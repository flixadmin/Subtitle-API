1
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,140
Okay. That's okay.

2
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:26,737
Get that.

3
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:30,283
Hey.

4
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:46,442
- Oh, God. Please.
- Oh, jeez.

5
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:48,069
Please.

6
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:49,570
Please.

7
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,747
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

8
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:01,749
You sure this is the way to go?

9
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,210
Yeah.

10
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:05,753
Yeah.

11
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:29,837
You see that?

12
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:02,995
- What does he remember?
- Not a whole lot.

13
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:05,154
He came in dehydrated and disoriented,

14
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,083
but once we gave him fluids
he stabilised pretty quickly.

15
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,293
But I mean...

16
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:12,880
- He knows where he is?
- Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

17
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:16,426
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

18
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:19,220
Go on in. He's probably awake.

19
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:26,894
My God.

20
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:29,147
Walter.

21
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:32,984
I'm so sorry.

22
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,909
Come here.

23
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:44,412
You know who I am, right?

24
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,747
Yes, son. I know who you are.

25
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:49,792
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

26
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,923
It's so good to see you.

27
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:00,011
How do you feel?

28
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,725
Better.

29
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,769
Yeah. I...

30
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:10,229
I feel like myself.

31
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:12,440
Really, I mean, in...

32
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:17,737
The past couple days are missing,
but other than that

33
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:18,988
I feel fine.

34
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:21,199
My God, Walt.

35
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:25,787
What a day this has been.

36
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:29,123
So, Uncle Hank, he was in a shootout?

37
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:31,459
A shootout?

38
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,629
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

39
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:35,937
Uncle Hank wasted him.

40
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:38,716
- Oh, my God. Is he all right?
- Absolutely fine.

41
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:42,720
- Where did this happen? How could...?
- Walt, everything's okay.

42
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:46,349
We're all okay.

43
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:48,226
We'll be all right.

44
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:51,062
<i>And no idea what caused it?</i>

45
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,480
No.

46
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:55,650
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so...

47
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:59,821
<i>But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?</i>

48
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,156
I really...

49
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:06,966
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so...

50
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,621
Well, which supermarket?

51
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,874
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

52
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,794
<i>- Marie.
- I... Don't get me wrong.</i>

53
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:20,007
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

54
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:22,009
I just, I mean...

55
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:25,847
He... Naked?

56
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:28,850
He was naked.

57
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,810
Naked.

58
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:32,603
In a supermarket.

59
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,312
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

60
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,858
<i>In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

61
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:40,987
No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

62
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,613
How's Hank?

63
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:45,491
You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of

64
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:48,870
30 seconds before they yanked him away.

65
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:51,914
You know, you'd think today of all days

66
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:55,251
they'd let him go home on time.

67
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:58,671
But how is he? Really?

68
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,383
Hank?

69
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:07,764
He's indestructible, you know that.

70
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:13,352
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

71
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:16,355
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca,

72
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,858
and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

73
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:23,529
- He was shot previous to your arrival?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:27,366
Again I instructed him to show his hands.

75
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:29,744
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle,

76
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:33,498
and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

77
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,750
I returned fire and sought cover

78
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,003
as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

79
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:42,882
When he paused to reload

80
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,468
I was able to take an effective shot.

81
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,055
Agent Schrader

82
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:52,763
what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

83
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:55,728
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

84
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:58,512
- I was tending to another matter.
- What other matter?

85
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,529
An unrelated family matter.

86
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:07,782
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

87
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:11,494
- Your brother-in-law?
- Yes, sir. He's since been found.

88
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:14,455
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

89
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:16,707
At the time, he'd been missing for hours,

90
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,294
and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

91
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,422
I was talking to his acquaintances

92
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,882
trying to get a fix on his whereabouts.

93
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:28,678
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his

94
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:32,014
a Jesse Pinkman.

95
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:36,811
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

96
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,397
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

97
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:44,193
- Have you run him down yet?
- Not yet, but we're working on it.

98
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:58,499
Man, they're like Jehovah's Witnesses.

99
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,126
They don't give up.

100
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:03,712
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

101
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:07,091
- They need probable cause.
- Probable cause?

102
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,093
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

103
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:12,680
I told you, this is serious shit.

104
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,932
I'm like an outlaw.

105
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:16,309
Okay.

106
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:27,278
Let's do this.

107
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:40,708
Holy Christ!

108
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,377
You're Willy Wonka.

109
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:46,339
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

110
00:09:48,132 --> 00:09:49,758
Put me on your magical boat, man.

111
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:52,970
Sail me down
your chocolaty river of meth.

112
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,629
So where you keep the pseudo?

113
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:58,476
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

114
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:02,355
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

115
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,315
No pseudo?

116
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:08,736
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

117
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:12,657
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

118
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:16,577
But I can't just let you break this down.

119
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:19,538
- That'd be sacrilege.
- I told you, that's why we're here.

120
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:21,272
- You saw the cops. Right?
- Sure.

121
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,793
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

122
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,754
- You know, for the road?
- No, forget it, all right?

123
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:30,800
- This stuff has to go, like, now.
- Dude, you owe me.

124
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,804
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

125
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:37,473
God, Badger!

126
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:42,311
Don't mess with me.

127
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:44,939
Got it?

128
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,570
Yeah, I got it.

129
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:09,881
Oh, my God.

130
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,470
Okay, that's all of it.

131
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:18,347
This was a bad choice.

132
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:25,521
You sure about this guy?

133
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,899
He's totally, totally cool.

134
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:29,859
He's my cousin.

135
00:11:33,654 --> 00:11:37,492
- Yo, what'd we say, 500?
- We didn't say, and it's 1000.

136
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,076
Thousand bucks?

137
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,954
Come on, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

138
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,080
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

139
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:48,836
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

140
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:54,926
560.

141
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,302
- You know what?
- Hey... No...

142
00:11:57,428 --> 00:12:00,306
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

143
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:04,018
He's totally good for it.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

144
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:08,397
- That right? You a stand-up dude?
- Yeah, I am.

145
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,817
I will get you the other 500.

146
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:12,193
Five hundred more.

147
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,655
Your word's your bond, right?

148
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:17,698
Right.

149
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:27,959
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

150
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:31,212
What are you doing now, exactly?

151
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,297
I'm giving you, like, two hours,

152
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:36,968
and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

153
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:38,726
You're not using your own name.

154
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:43,724
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

155
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,977
Why do you gotta go and do this?

156
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:48,855
They need probable cause.

157
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:50,398
I'm giving it to them.

158
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:05,663
What's the last thing you remember?

159
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,418
Well, I was driving home.

160
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,253
I think.

161
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:14,881
And...

162
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:17,341
Do you remember coming home?

163
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:20,851
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

164
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:27,435
You don't remember talking to me
when I was in the bathtub?

165
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,062
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

166
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:35,610
- Nothing else? No fleeting images?
- Well, no. I...

167
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:38,154
I was...

168
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:44,952
I was walking down some road or highway

169
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,331
with a lot of headlights,

170
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,668
and I remember feeling fear.

171
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:57,047
- That's it.
- All right. Thank you.

172
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:00,134
Well, there's definitely
some good news here.

173
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:02,845
The MRI shows no metastases.

174
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:05,932
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

175
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,975
Yeah, we're looking really good.

176
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:09,936
Oh, thank God.

177
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:13,856
So, what was it, then?

178
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:17,568
- There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
- And considering your condition

179
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:19,320
the blood panel looks good.

180
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:22,657
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

181
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:26,119
As of right now, we really

182
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,703
can't say.

183
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:31,332
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field,

184
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,293
but isn't it possible
that this had something to do

185
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:36,628
with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

186
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:38,256
There's the antiemetic

187
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,299
the antitussive

188
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:44,011
the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

189
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,560
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say

190
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,645
I'm feeling much better.

191
00:14:52,854 --> 00:14:55,564
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications

192
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,151
the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

193
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:02,363
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

194
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:05,783
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

195
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:09,704
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

196
00:15:09,912 --> 00:15:13,062
Walt, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

197
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,001
Stressed out? I...

198
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,259
- No, I don't think I'm...
- Walt, please.

199
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,714
Stressed out is putting it

200
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:21,174
mildly.

201
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:28,973
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said

202
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:30,850
I'm feeling much better.

203
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:33,852
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

204
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:36,856
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

205
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:39,609
A ways down the road?

206
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:43,988
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

207
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:49,410
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

208
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,954
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

209
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:54,540
But until we know
what caused this incident

210
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:57,001
we can't be certain it won't recur.

211
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:43,965
- That your last hit?
- Yeah.

212
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:46,467
Finish it quick.

213
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,375
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

214
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:25,506
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

215
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,556
I'm going, I'm going.

216
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:35,558
What's going on?

217
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,769
What did I do?

218
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:42,690
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

219
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:04,332
- What, man?
- Tell me again.

220
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,626
Again?

221
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,795
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

222
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,840
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

223
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,510
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

224
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,094
Taco? I don't know any Taco,

225
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,889
and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

226
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,725
Three days, you must have got hungry.

227
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,060
Yeah, I guess.

228
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:26,562
- You order take-out?
- Yeah.

229
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,773
Yeah, where from?

230
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:31,734
You get yourself a little
of that moo goo gai pan

231
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:33,945
from that chink place around the corner?

232
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:37,865
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

233
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,701
You know, Funyuns.

234
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,369
I had a Hot Pocket.

235
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:44,080
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

236
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:46,040
You didn't notice your car was gone?

237
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,724
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

238
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,962
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

239
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,220
Management's gonna be on my ass for sure.

240
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,384
- You weren't answering your phone.
- It was in my car.

241
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,387
- That right?
- Yeah.

242
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,433
We found your car,

243
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,768
but your phone wasn't in it.

244
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,478
You found my car?

245
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:09,731
You found my car?

246
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:13,276
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

247
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,187
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

248
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:21,909
Did you leave anything else in the car?

249
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:23,244
Like what?

250
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,873
Like what? Like...

251
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,417
I don't know. Like this?

252
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,764
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

253
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,599
That's not mine.

254
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,601
That's not yours?

255
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,604
He says it's not his, Gomie.

256
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:52,148
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

257
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:55,943
- I wish.
- Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.

258
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:58,302
You know what we got here,
Gomie, don't you?

259
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:01,324
That's a new interdiction van
right there, yeah.

260
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,159
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

261
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:05,912
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

262
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,539
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

263
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:12,085
So who's your chief, little Injun?

264
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:13,795
What?

265
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,006
- What does that even mean?
- I think your story's bullshit.

266
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,675
I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was.

267
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,934
Your car was there
because you were there.

268
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:26,307
Tuco had a bullet in him when I
got there and you know about that too.

269
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,394
So, what are you saying?

270
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,521
I shot someone?

271
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:35,191
- With, like, a gun?
- You?

272
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:37,276
No.

273
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:40,571
Only shooting you do is into a Kleenex.

274
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:43,908
But I think you know the badass who did.

275
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,580
Look, I was partying with Wendy, okay?

276
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,042
Funyuns and boom-boom.

277
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,294
No.

278
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:57,338
I don't think so.

279
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,675
Tell you what. We're gonna

280
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:04,887
go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

281
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,764
And you know what?

282
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:12,812
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

283
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,317
Don't go nowhere.

284
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:36,127
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

285
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:39,380
- I got medical issues.
- Medical issues?

286
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,549
Like, what kind of medical issues?

287
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,426
You got penis withdrawal?

288
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,970
You got schlongus interruptus?

289
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:49,223
Wendy, listen. Talk to me,

290
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:51,382
and you get a root beer and a tinkle.

291
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,560
- Tell me the last three days.
- I told you

292
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,189
we were shacked up since Saturday.

293
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:59,697
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

294
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:03,321
Not even for a second?

295
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:07,658
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

296
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,619
Maybe?

297
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,579
Did Jesse leave the room?

298
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:14,499
He did, didn't he?

299
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,086
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

300
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:21,547
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

301
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:25,385
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

302
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,555
It's you. I know you.

303
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:33,101
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

304
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,061
- What?
- The kid with the crutches.

305
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:37,688
- The football player.
- How about we stay on topic?

306
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:41,859
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

307
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,987
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

308
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,921
And that's all I'm saying about that.

309
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:48,574
Now, come on.

310
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:50,952
Where's my root beer?

311
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,707
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

312
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,292
It's a long story, Gomie.

313
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:02,129
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

314
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:05,383
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

315
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:14,684
And how are you sleeping?

316
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:20,565
Fine. Most nights.

317
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:22,066
Good.

318
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,777
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images

319
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,988
things you can't get out of your head?

320
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,662
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

321
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,666
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude,

322
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,836
but where is this going, exactly?

323
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,423
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

324
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:49,343
- Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
- Ongoing for how long?

325
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:50,952
I just met you. Hard to say.

326
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,057
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

327
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:59,353
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.

328
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:00,855
Now

329
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:06,361
if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

330
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,197
Walt

331
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:12,950
a fugue state is a very serious event.

332
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,411
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

333
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,645
Get into a situation

334
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,788
where you could be shot by the police?

335
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,583
We can't allow you to leave

336
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,892
until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

337
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,839
Saying you feel fine doesn't solve this.

338
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:35,681
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

339
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,182
It's very straightforward.

340
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:40,645
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

341
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:42,146
What about my family?

342
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,691
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

343
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,652
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

344
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:52,407
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

345
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:56,244
And you, as a medical practitioner

346
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:58,621
you abide by these strictures absolutely.

347
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,164
Yes.

348
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:07,630
All right.

349
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:12,385
There was no fugue state.

350
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:16,305
I remember everything.

351
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:22,979
The truth is

352
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:26,816
I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

353
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:30,445
I just had to get out,

354
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,321
and so I left.

355
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,699
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

356
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:41,289
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

357
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,959
I got as far as Gallup...

358
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,507
and then it was just time to come home.

359
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,301
So

360
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:56,345
Being found naked in a supermarket

361
00:25:56,554 --> 00:26:00,099
that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

362
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,519
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

363
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,904
Why run away?

364
00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:16,157
What did you feel you had to run from?

365
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:24,388
Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant

366
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,501
with a baby we didn't intend.

367
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:31,172
My 15-year-old son has cerebral palsy.

368
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:35,718
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

369
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:40,723
When I can work, I make $43,700 per year.

370
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,975
I have watched all of my colleagues,

371
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,686
and friends surpass me
in every way imaginable,

372
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,649
and within 18 months, I will be dead.

373
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,278
And you ask why I ran?

374
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,160
Gomie, you wanna do the honours?

375
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:39,496
- What's that mean?
- That means yes.

376
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:43,619
- Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
- Come on, this is bullshit.

377
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:47,527
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

378
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,124
Señor

379
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,460
are we on the planet Mars?

380
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,132
Are we on the planet Saturn?

381
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,178
Are we on the planet Earth?

382
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:06,976
Señor, is today Friday?

383
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:08,811
Is today Monday?

384
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,564
Is today Tuesday?

385
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:14,900
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

386
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,237
Señor

387
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:22,658
was this man at your house yesterday?

388
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:34,753
Señor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

389
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,514
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

390
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,975
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

391
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:53,856
Señor, are you scared of this man?

392
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,860
No, he's not scared.

393
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:03,824
Come on, Granddad.

394
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,285
Don't you wanna help us out?

395
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:25,721
Oh, man.

396
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:34,730
I guess that's a no.

397
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:39,857
- I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

398
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,195
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
in San Quentin.

399
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:45,448
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

400
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:49,578
- All right. It was worth a try at least.
- We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

401
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,705
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

402
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:54,014
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

403
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:57,503
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do

404
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:59,797
with shooting Tuco, man.

405
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:04,260
Dad? Hey, Dad.

406
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:06,262
Hey, can you hear me?

407
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,140
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...

408
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:12,643
What's...?

409
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:15,813
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

410
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,773
You know, I actually

411
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,832
lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

412
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,152
I've been busy as...

413
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,238
As totally productive.

414
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:27,741
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

415
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,245
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

416
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:33,914
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

417
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,458
Hey, could you give me a ride?

418
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:41,088
I'm actually...
I'm downtown and my car's in the...

419
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:45,966
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will...

420
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:49,805
I'll call you later when you have some...

421
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:52,558
Okay. Yeah. No. I...

422
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:55,394
I get it. I get it.

423
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,980
Okay, bye.

424
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,283
Thanks.

425
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:12,244
So, what are you doing now?

426
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,413
Waffle House?

427
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,833
Waffle House is good.

428
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:53,535
Pay phone?

429
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:56,413
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

430
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:57,623
So how did it go?

431
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,043
Okay. You?

432
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,547
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

433
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:08,092
- So you getting out of there?
- Tomorrow.

434
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,302
So who came for you?

435
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,263
The DEA? What did they ask you?

436
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:15,933
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law

437
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:17,685
took my rainy-day fund.

438
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:19,687
<i>Your what? What is that?</i>

439
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:23,148
My rainy-day fund.
Sixty-eight thousand, okay?

440
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:25,400
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

441
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:27,403
Now I got like 80 bucks to my name.

442
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:29,111
Wait, wait. What does he know?

443
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:30,781
Does he know it's your money?

444
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,492
No, man.
He doesn't know shit, okay?

445
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,244
The plan worked.

446
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:36,662
They bought it.

447
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,331
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

448
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,669
<i>- Did he mention my name?
- No. Thanks for caring.</i>

449
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:48,757
- What about the basement?
- It's clean.

450
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,926
<i>And the RV?</i>

451
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,972
Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
It's safe.

452
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,516
Can he get it running again?

453
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,353
<i>- Why?
- So we can cook.</i>

454
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,315
So you still wanna cook?

455
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:05,983
Seriously?

456
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:09,945
What's changed, Jesse?

457
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:21,957
Seven-hundred thirty-seven thousand.

458
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,126
Twenty-one pounds

459
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,670
minus cash on hand...

460
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:28,631
Cash on hand.

461
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,791
- Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
- No, I was awake.

462
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:14,129
- Want some cornflakes?
- Yeah, sure.

463
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:21,560
- You okay?
- Yeah.

464
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,142
Southwest Aniline again?

465
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:27,603
What's this?

466
00:38:27,812 --> 00:38:30,262
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

467
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:33,818
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

468
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:36,362
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

469
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:38,906
P2P, huh?

470
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:40,658
So, what are you thinking?

471
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:42,743
The two stooges over here cooked it?

472
00:38:43,578 --> 00:38:46,914
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

473
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:48,624
At least since this.

474
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,460
- Krazy-8.
- Yeah.

475
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:55,673
Krazy-8, Tuco...

476
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,594
Somehow, some way, it's all connected.

477
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:02,638
A simple explanation

478
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:05,516
only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

479
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,268
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

480
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:10,852
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

481
00:39:11,188 --> 00:39:12,773
It's 11 in the morning.

482
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:13,983
I'm buying.

483
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:15,443
You're buying? Holy crap.

484
00:39:15,651 --> 00:39:18,487
- What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:24,327
Surprise.

486
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:28,247
You little sneaky bastard, you.

487
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:30,082
Very nice work.

488
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,335
Thank you, sir.

489
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:36,923
- What's this?
- Look what we got you.

490
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:40,384
- Look at that, I love it.
- They got the gut right.

491
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:42,511
- Hey.
- There you go.

492
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,347
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Thank you.

493
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:50,353
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

494
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,521
You shouldn't have.

495
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:56,859
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

496
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:58,778
I love it.

497
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,868
You going to finish your apple juice?

498
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:08,871
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

499
00:40:10,706 --> 00:40:12,458
You're supposed to drink it.

500
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:16,087
The nurse said you have to stay hydrated.

501
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:18,339
But I'm not thirsty.

502
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:21,801
Dad. Drink it.

503
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:34,730
Hey.

504
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:36,691
Better late than never, huh?

505
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:38,818
- Hey.
- Hey.

506
00:40:39,944 --> 00:40:41,694
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

507
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,906
I see the mark of the beast there, huh?

508
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:46,284
Oh, yeah.
Marie stopped by this morning.

509
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:49,370
They really cheer the place up.

510
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:53,583
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

511
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:57,253
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

512
00:40:57,753 --> 00:41:00,548
So tell us about the shootout.

513
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:04,093
I was, you know, just doing my job.

514
00:41:04,302 --> 00:41:06,762
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

515
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:08,889
Say, Walt, you know

516
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:11,809
how are you?

517
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:13,769
I'm okay.

518
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:16,564
Really, I'm feeling fine.

519
00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:19,066
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:22,111
The doctor is calling it a...

521
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,365
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

522
00:41:26,574 --> 00:41:28,117
Damn.

523
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:29,952
Which means non-recurring.

524
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:32,330
Non-recurring.
That sounds good, yeah.

525
00:41:32,538 --> 00:41:33,956
Sounds real good.

526
00:41:34,165 --> 00:41:37,793
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

527
00:41:38,002 --> 00:41:40,838
Listen, Hank.

528
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:43,507
I don't know what to say. I mean

529
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:49,513
you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so...

530
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:53,392
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

531
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,311
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

532
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:59,815
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

533
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:03,319
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake

534
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:05,529
like you wouldn't believe, okay?

535
00:42:05,738 --> 00:42:08,908
You ought to disappear more often.

536
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:11,494
Just kidding. Don't do that.

537
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:14,372
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

538
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,165
Look what they gave me.

539
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:17,625
What is it?

540
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:22,296
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

541
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:24,715
- His grill?
- Yeah.

542
00:42:24,924 --> 00:42:27,634
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

543
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:30,012
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

544
00:42:30,221 --> 00:42:32,871
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

545
00:42:33,057 --> 00:42:34,850
Wow, cool.

546
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,060
Yeah.

547
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:04,839
I can't tell you how good it feels
to be home.

548
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:13,973
I'll get these in the wash.

549
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:15,516
Okay.

550
00:43:52,136 --> 00:43:54,305
Say, honey, I...

551
00:43:54,513 --> 00:43:59,477
I was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

552
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:09,195
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

553
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:23,376
Skyler, listen to me.

554
00:44:26,003 --> 00:44:28,965
This will not happen again, okay?

555
00:44:29,173 --> 00:44:30,299
I won't let it.

556
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:34,011
I'm still here. I'm me,

557
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,598
and we're gonna be okay.

558
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:45,189
Walt...

559
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,027
do you have a second cell phone?

560
00:44:53,364 --> 00:44:54,865
A second cell phone?

561
00:44:55,074 --> 00:44:59,287
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath,

562
00:44:59,495 --> 00:45:01,581
and you were very upset.

563
00:45:02,415 --> 00:45:05,334
It was like something
terrible had happened.

564
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:08,379
And then your cell phone rang.

565
00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:11,841
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up,

566
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:14,510
and just disappeared.

567
00:45:16,262 --> 00:45:17,722
Yeah.

568
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,224
And when Hank checked your phone records

569
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:23,436
there was no call.

570
00:45:23,894 --> 00:45:27,356
No call on the phone I know about.

571
00:45:32,236 --> 00:45:33,863
That is

572
00:45:34,071 --> 00:45:35,781
odd.

573
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:38,951
I mean, I don't remember any of that,

574
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,123
but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

575
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:48,419
Okay.
