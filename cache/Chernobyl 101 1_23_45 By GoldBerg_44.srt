It doesn't make sense to me either.

450
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,450
What about sabotage?

451
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,990
A bomb?

452
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,560
Sitnikov! Bryukhanov wants
us to use the good dosimeter,

453
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,430
but it's in the safe,
and we can't find the key.

454
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,850
It's in Building 2. Hasn't...?

00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,520

Please, uh, find a seat. Plenty of room.

I apologize for the
lateness of the hour.

460

Rest assured, we are
all very safe down here.

461
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,260
We built this shelter to
withstand a nuclear attack

462
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,560
by the Americans, so
I think we'll be fine.

463
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,680
As you can see, we have
experienced an accident.

464
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,350
A large control tank malfunctioned,

465
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,310
damaging reactor Building
4 and starting a fire.

466
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,060
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

467
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,390
Maryin spoke to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

468
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,680
Frolyshev to Central
Committee member Dolgikh,

469
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,200
and Dolgikh to General
Secretary Gorbachev.

470
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,970
Now...

471
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:46,310
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

472
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,350
for the work of the
Pripyat Executive Committee,

473
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,350
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

474
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,720
First, the accident...
<font color="#ff00ff">(STAMMERS)</font> is well under control.

475
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:05,060
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

476
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,850
are considered key state
secrets, it is important

477
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,260
that we ensure that this incident

478
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,430
has no adverse consequences.

479
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,640
Now, to prevent a panic, the
Central Committee have ordered

480
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,600
a detachment of military
police to Pripyat.

481
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,430
How large of a detachment?

482
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,970
Between two and four thousand men.

You saw men with burns.

There's more radiation

Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

But our faith in Soviet socialism

514

that when the people ask questions

00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,430
that are not in their own best interest,

523
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,430
they should simply be told

- Yes.

You are the Legasov who is

Deputy Chairman of the

There's been an accident at the

00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,930
How bad is it?

637
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,180
No. No need to panic. There was a fire.

638
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,400
It's mostly put out. The
system control tank exploded.

00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,850
Control system tank. And the core?

640
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:18,100
We've ordered them to
continuously pump water.

641
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,850
Yes, I see. Any contamination?

642
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:23,760
It's mild. The plant manager,
Bryukhanov, is reporting

643
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,350
3.6 roentgen per hour.

That's actually significant.

Yes, I've studied...

General Secretary Gorbachev
has appointed a committee

648

We'll convene at two this afternoon.

me, but don't you think

given the amount of
radiation that it would be...

652
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,650
Legasov, you're on this committee
to answer direct questions

653
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,140
about the function of an RBMK reactor

654

if they should happen
to arise. Nothing else.

655

Certainly not policy. Do you understand?

656

- Yes, of course. I didn't mean to...
