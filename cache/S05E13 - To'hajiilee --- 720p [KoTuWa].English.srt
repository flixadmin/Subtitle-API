1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,430
How big's the batch?

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,830
Should be about

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,830
50 pounds, give or take.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,750
Uncle Jack, that mask,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,910
I think you should...

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,710
Mr. White said the fumes

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,710
aren't good to breathe.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,750
Let me worry about

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,750
what I breathe, kid.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,800
Just hurry this up

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,800
so I can grab a smoke. Ahem.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,600
Seventy-six percent.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,600
Ha.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,950
Nice going, nephew.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,950
Thanks, Uncle Jack.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,390
Where's the blue?

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,200
Where's the what?

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,200
The blue color.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
Does it come later,

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
when this hardens?

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,110
Where is it?

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,820
I am correct in assuming

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,820
this should be blue?

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,870
See, I'm thinking the headline here

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,870
should be "76 percent."

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,990
Yeah. Whole lot more than it was.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,880
That dude who looked like Wolverine?

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,880
He couldn't crack 70.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,390
Fine. Yes, percentage-wise,

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,390
it's marginally improved.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
And congratulations, Todd.

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,750
But blue is our brand,

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,750
all over Europe.

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,150
It's what our buyers pay

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,150
top dollar for.

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,040
If we're down a bit in purity

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,040
from the Heisenberg days,

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,830
maybe they'll let us slide on that,

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,830
but not if it's not blue.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,550
I don't know. To my eye,

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,390
it's kind of blue.

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,390
Yeah, a little.

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,710
It's bluish.

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,040
Todd, you're the chef.

45
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,040
What do you think?

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,320
Yeah, kind of.

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,230
If it catches the light just right,

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,310
I could see how you'd think

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,310
there's a touch of blue,

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,550
blue-green in there.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,950
Aquamarine.

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,110
Hell, we'll put food coloring in it.

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,110

54

Yeah, like they do

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,470
farm-raised salmon. Yeah.

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,670

57
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,670
how pink they make that crap?

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,430

about the color.

80
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,710
For a minute or two,

81
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,710
it just got a few degrees too hot

82
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,470
in the mixing kettle, I think.

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,750
I might've just

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,750
cooked the color right out of it.

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,990
You burned it, like a cake.

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,110
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

87
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,110
But the point is I think I can fix it,

88
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,630
and I think I can bring

89
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,630

90

176
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,310
Had a lot of questions.

177
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,670
No calls though, right?

178
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,510
You got his phone?

179
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,510
Yeah.

180
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,750
He's on ice?

181
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,750
Safe house off Rio Bravo.

182
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,950
We've got Van Oster

183
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,950
babysitting him.

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,190
Yeah. What about Van Oster?

185
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,190
Did he have any questions?

186
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,790
Probably, but he knows

187
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,790
better than to ask.

188
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,990
Good job.

189
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,230
I gotta tell you this

190
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,230
up front, Hank.

191
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,550
If this guy decides

192
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,550
he wants to lawyer up,

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,230
I don't care if you are my boss,

194
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,230
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

195
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,430
He won't lawyer up.

196
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,990
What the hell, man?

197
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,920
You're up.

198
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,950
Hey there. You mind

199
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,950
taking it outside for a minute?

200
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,350
No, sir. You got it.

201
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,350
All right, thanks.

202
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,670
Huell Babineaux.

203
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,510
Know who I am?

204
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,430
I'll take that as a yes.

205
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,470
Thanks for your patience.

206
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,350
Uh, as Agent Gomez said,

207
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,350
you're not under arrest.

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,430
Why am I here?

209
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,790
Well, you're here, um,

210
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,790
for your own protection, sir.

211
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,030
How you figure that?

212
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,980
Well, we both know how dangerous

213
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,980
my brother-in-law can be.

214
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,230
Nice poker face.

215
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,110
Look, uh, relax.

216
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,920
There's not much new

217
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,920
you can tell me

218
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,920
about Walter White.

219
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,910
Multiple murders,

220
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,110
ties to a white-power

221
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,110
prison gang,

222
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,000
ran the largest meth racket

223
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,000
in the entire Southwest.

224
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,470
I'm not asking,

225
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,470
you're not answering,

226
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,670
whoop-de-do.

227
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,670
Let's cut to the chase.

228
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,870
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

229
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,670
We intercepted a call between him

230
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,670
and a certain Saul Goodman, Esq.

231
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,400
You know, your employer?

232
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,550
Anyway, in the call, Walt said

233
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,550
that he was going to, quote:

234
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,180
"Take care of one

235
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,180
Jesse Pinkman," unquote,

236
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,510
and that you were

237
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,510
next on the hit list.

238
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,510
That's why you're here.

239
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,750
Bullshit. That don't make no sense.

240
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,310
I got the recording.

241
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,310
I can-- I can let you hear it.

242
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,910
Your associate, Goodman's fixer--

243
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,910
What's his name?

244
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,230
Some carrottop

245
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,230
named Patrick Kuby.

246
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,860
Boston P.D. ran him out

247
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,860
of Beantown a few years back.

248
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,510
Came out here

249
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,510
for the sunshine.

250
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,710
Walt said he was gonna do this

251
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,710
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

252
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,950
In fact, Kuby's already missing.

253
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,830
Sorry to say, things are looking grim

254
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,830
for your-- Your redheaded buddy.

255
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,190
Believe us, don't believe us.

256
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,190
Suit yourself.

257
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,790
Whatever you do,

258
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,790
I would not call Goodman.

259
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,830
He sold you

260
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,830
down the river bigtime.

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,070
The hell you talking about?

262
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,500
Don't take it personally.

263
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,750
Goodman's next on the chopping block

264
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,750
if he doesn't do what White says.

265
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,590
To be fair, your circus clown of a boss

266
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,590
did try to spare you for all of, what,

267
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,550
about, uh, 15 seconds,

268
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,990
before he decided

269
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,990
to help Walt track you down.

270
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,910
You see, Goodman's got

271
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,910
a trace on your phone,

272
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,630
and as soon as you call him,

273
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,710
Walt will find out

274
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,710
where you're hiding.

275
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,150
Then it's just a matter of time

276
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,150
before you end up like this.

277
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,950
Oh, man. Oh, man. I swear to God,

278
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,950
I didn't know he was gonna kill him, man.

279
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,070
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.

280
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,070
Relax.

281
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,390
If we thought you did,

282
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,390
you'd be in lockup

283
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,470
for conspiracy to commit murder

284
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,470
instead of under our protection.

285
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,990
Tell us everything you know

286
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,990
so we can get him

287
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,990
before he gets you.

288
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,990
Why would he wanna kill me?

289
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,310
I ain't do nothing.

290
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,310
Who knows with this guy?

291
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,470
From what he said,

292
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,470
it may have to do

293
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,830
with him tying up loose ends

294
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,830
regarding poisoning

295
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,830
some kid named Brock.

296
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,080
Or maybe it's because

297
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,080
you know where his money is.

298
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,030
I don't know where his money is.

299
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,510
That ain't what we heard.

300
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,830
You ain't listening

301
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,830
to the people in the know.

302
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,950
Me and Kuby rented a van

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,950
for the dude,

304
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,830
loaded his cash up

305
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,830
in a self-storage unit,

306
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,550
handed over the keys to him

307
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,550
at Goodman's.

308
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,950
Who knows where he took it

309
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,950
from there?

310
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,760
A van, huh?

311
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,760
How much money we talking?

312
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,950
Seven barrels' worth.

313
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,470
Seven barrels?

314
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,110
When you say "barrels,"

315
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,110
you mean "barrels" barrels?

316
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,510
Barrels, man. You know,

317
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,510
plastic, black, 55-gallon type.

318
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,000
I got them at Home Depot.

319
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,670
Filled up every last damn

320
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,670
one of them too.

321
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,950
And, uh, where did you rent the van?

322
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,900
Lariat. The one

323
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,900
on Candelaria and Monroe.

324
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,710
Lariat on Candelaria?

325
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,710
Yeah.

326
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,190
Kuby rented the van.

327
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,190
Mr. White dropped it off.

328
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
He had us wash it good

329
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
before Kuby took it back.

330
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,350
Wash the rental? Why?

331
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,350
It was filthy, man,

332
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,350
like he went off-road with it.

333
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,470
After we had hosed it down,

334
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,470
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

335
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,350
handed over the key,

336
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,350
and that was it.

337
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,840
That's all I know.

338
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,660
All right, Mr. Babineaux.

339
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,030
Agent Gomez and I are going

340
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,030
to do everything we can

341
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,750
to find this son of a bitch.

342
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,400
Like I said,

343
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,400
you're free to go.

344
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,510
But if I were you,

345
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,510
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

346
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,190
And remember, no phone calls.

347
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,910
Oh, actually, I almost forgot.

348
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,150
Uh, I took the liberty

349
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,150
of removing the battery

350
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,550
so Walt can't track you by GPS.

351
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,510
So don't put that back in.

352
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,710
Agent Van Oster

353
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,710
will stay here with you.

354
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,230
You're in good hands.

355
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,230
He's our best man with a gun.

356
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,030
Uh, don't discuss the case with him

357
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,030
because the less you distract him,

358
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,430
the better he can protect you.

359
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,030
How long you gonna be?

360
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,420
As long as it takes to keep you safe.

361
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,910
So just one guy this time.

362
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,390
Not even in lockup.

363
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,270
Some former partner,

364
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,270
Todd says?

365
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,710
Yeah.

366
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,990
So, what are we talking, rat patrol?

367
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,950
Rat p--?

368
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,430
No, no.

369
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,910
Rat patrol?

370
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,910
No. No, he's not a rat.

371
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,150
He's just...

372
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,310
He just won't listen to reason.

373
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,590
Okay.

374
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,590
He's just angry.

375
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,350
He's not a rat.

376
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,510
All right.

377
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,830
Angry non-rat. Got it.

378
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,630
How angry we talking, by the way?

379
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,550
Like, Hulk angry?

380
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,910
Like, Rambo-James Bond

381
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,910
badass individual?

382
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,430
Not something

383
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,430
you'd do yourself, huh?

384
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,710
Jesse is like family to me.

385
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,750
Look, I want what you do

386
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,750
to be quick and painless.

387
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,830
No suffering, no fear.

388
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,990
Bullet to the back of the head.

389
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,990
Something he doesn't see coming.

390
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,940
I respect that.

391
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,390
There's too many savages out there.

392
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,390
Let's just talk about the money.

393
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,790
No, we don't want your money.

394
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,000
We want you to cook for us.

395
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,950
You know I'm out

396
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,950
of the business.

397
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
Just a couple times

398
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

399
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
Get him on track

400
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
to bringing the purity up.

401
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,310
Get the color right too.

402
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,310
Apparently that blue touch

403
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,310
you put on it,

404
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,750
it's all the craze

405
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,750
with those Slavic types.

406
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,920
So I'm told.

407
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,920
No.

408
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,990
Absolutely not.

409
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,870
Look, what was the price per head

410
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,870
last time? I'll triple it.

411
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,430
A drop in the bucket compared to

412
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,430
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

413
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,110
Don't skimp on family,

414
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,110
that's what I always say.

415
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,680
You want us to do this job?

416
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,830
Do it right? That's the price.

417
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,670
One cook,

418
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,300
after the job is done.

419
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,790
Time is of the essence.

420
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,790
Do you understand?

421
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,190
Do him tonight if you want.

422
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,240
Just tell me where he is.

423
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,070
I don't know where he is,

424
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,280
but I know how to flush him out.

425
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,910
You want string cheese

426
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,910
or yogurt squeezers with your PBJ?

427
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,480
Both.

428
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,790
I didn't hear you.

429
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,790
Both, please.

430
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,750
Hold on, honey.

431
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,030
Hi, Andrea.

432
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,030
I don't know if you remember me.

433
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,150
I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.

434
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,390
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Hi.

435
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,390
Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
Oh, hi. Hi.

437
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm sorry to just barge in

438
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,640
on you like this,

439
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,710
but, uh, I was hoping that I could

440
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,710
have a moment to talk with you.

441
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,270
It's about Jesse.

442
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,670
Um, sure. I'm sort of

443
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,670
rushing around right now.

444
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,830
Wanna talk inside

445
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,830
while I get my boy ready?

446
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,350
Oh, well, yeah. If it's--

447
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,350
If it's okay, yeah, sure.

448
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,670
Thank you.

449
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,750
You met Brock before, right?

450
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,750
Yes. Yes, I have. At Jesse's.

451
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,070
How you doing, Brock?

452
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,950
Brock, he asked you a question.

453
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,830
I'm good.

454
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,830
Good.

455
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,630
Froot Loops.

456
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,550
That's good stuff.

457
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,790
So Jesse...

458
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,310
Yeah, I...

459
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,750
I don't wanna alarm you,

460
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,480
but I've been trying

461
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,480
to reach him for days.

462
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,960
I've stopped at his house,

463
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,840
I've left all kinds of messages

464
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,840
on his voicemail,

465
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,150
and he won't return my calls.

466
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,150
I can't find him anywhere.

467
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,800
Have you heard from him?

468
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,550
No, not since the last time

469
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,550
he called to check on Brock.

470
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,110
That was, I don't know,

471
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,310
two weeks ago, maybe.

472
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,790
Andrea,

473
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,910
Jesse's using again, and I...

474
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,640
I have a bad feeling

475
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,640
about this.

476
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,350
Have you tried calling the police?

477
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,680
Or a better idea.

478
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,070
Jesse's lawyer's name

479
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,070
is Saul Goodman.

480
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,070
I have his card somewhere.

481
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,790
I mean, he may have ways of finding

482
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,790
Jesse without getting him in trouble.

483
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,190
"Better call Saul."

484
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,190
Yeah. I-- I did that.

485
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,670
He was able to verify

486
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,670
that Jesse's not locked up,

487
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,030
but, otherwise, very little help.

488
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,190
You see, the thing is,

489
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,470
is that Jesse and I

490
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,470
had this argument recently.

491
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,910
And I won't bore you

492
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,910
with the details, but he's...

493
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,750
He's-- He's pretty upset

494
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,750
with me and, um...

495
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,670
And I'm hoping that's the reason

496
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,670
he hasn't called me back

497
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,720
instead of him being...

498
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,510
Well...

499
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,070
Well, I'll try him right now.

500
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,230
I mean, if that's it,

501
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,230
he's mad at you,

502
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,180
maybe I'll have better luck.

503
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,180
That would be such a help. Yes.

504
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,310
What--? What--? What number

505
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,310
are you calling him on?

506
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,260
His cell.

507
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,260
You know, he recently got a new one.

508
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,270
And there. That--

509
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
That's his new number there,

510
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
the highlighted one.

511
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,710
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

512
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,270
Your friend Walter just dropped by.

513
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,270
He's here at the house right now.

514
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,630
We-- We're thinking of you.

515
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,990
Call me back as soon

516
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,990
as you get this message.

517
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,680
I really need to hear from you.

518
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,870
It's important.

519
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,750
Thank you, Andrea.

520
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,070
I appreciate that.

521
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,990
Well, I better--

522
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,990
I better be going.

523
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,070
You're welcome to stay a few minutes

524
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,070
to see if he calls back.

525
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,830
No, no, no. You're trying to get

526
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,830
your son off to school.

527
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,510
If he does happen to call back,

528
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,510
would you call me?

529
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,310
Better yet, I've got your number.

530
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,310
I'll call you back, okay?

531
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,350
And thank you.

532
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,790
See you, Brock.

533
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,070
We on?

534
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,880
Yes. It should be any time now.

535
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,590
Copy that.

536
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,310
Remember, fast and painless.

537
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,310
And take him away from here.

538
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,310
I don't want the mother

539
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,310
or the boy to know.

540
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,350
You got it.

541
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,870
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

542
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,920
Your friend Walterjust dropped by.

543
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,920
He's here at the house right now.

544
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,150
We-- We're thinking of you.

545
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,430
Call me back as soon

546
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,430
as you get this message.

547
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,150
I really need to hear from you.

548
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,990
It's important.

549
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,780
Nice try, asshole.

550
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,670
How'd it go at the rental place?

551
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,670
Van have GPS?

552
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,750
No GPS. Nope.

553
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,700
They used to have GPS

554
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,700
until about six months ago

555
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,270
when the ACLU or somebody

556
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,270
sued them

557
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,270
and they had to get rid of it.

558
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,270
Well, that's it.

559
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,270
Game over.

560
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,310
Yo, man, you can't just

561
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,310
give up on this.

562
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,750
Who said we're giving up?

563
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,750
What do you got?

564
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,070
Just thinking about

565
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,070
what Babineaux said

566
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,150
about the van being dirty

567
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,230
and the shovel

568
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,230
that Walt had with him.

569
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,670
I'll bet you 10-to-1

570
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,670
he buried that money.

571
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,990
No kidding. So what?

572
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,270
There's a whole lot of desert out there.

573
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,270
How we gonna find the spot?

574
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,670
You said it yourself,

575
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,670
there's no GPS on the van.

576
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,350
Yeah. But Walt

577
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,350
doesn't know that.

578
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,190
All right.

579
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,550
Here's your change.

580
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,830
Oh, count it out, please.

581
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,830
Here.

582
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,830
Uh, three. That makes 15.

583
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,630
Plus 5, that is 20.

584
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,990
Give this to your car wash professional.

585
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,990
Thank you.

586
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
Say it.

587
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,830
Have an A-1 day.

588
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,830
Oh, you too.

589
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,630
Good.

590
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,630
Why--? Why do I--?

591
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,830
Who do I gotta say that?

592
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,030
Because it reinforces our brand.

593
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,190
So getting the hang of it?

594
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,550
It's, uh-- It's pretty basic.

595
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,390
Mom, it's Saturday.

596
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,960
Can--? Can I go?

597
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,710
Go where?

598
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,710
Home.

599
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,340
Pick up a few things,

600
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,340
maybe chill for a little bit.

601
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,430
I'm sure the smell

602
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,430
is gone by now.

603
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
Why don't you just stick around here

604
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
for a while longer?

605
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,350
I need you.

606
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,350
Hi.

607
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,910
Uh, who do I give this to?

608
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,910
Um...

609
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,830
You know what?

610
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,830
I'll take care of it.

611
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,830
Excuse me, son.

612
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,430
That'll be 14.97, please.

613
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,550
Hey. How you doing?

614
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,310
You're on our billboard. You're--

615
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,080
You're the lawyer guy, yeah.

616
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,080
"Better call Saul!"

617
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,040
Heh, heh.

618
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,510
Okay.

619
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,390
So 3 makes 15, and 20, 25, 30,

620
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,070
35, 40, and 10 makes 50.

621
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,070
Thank you.

622
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,720
I like your commercial.

623
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,510
What--? What happened

624
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,510
to your face?

625
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,550
Oh, this is a-- I guess you'd call it

626
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,550
an occupational hazard.

627
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,550
Thank you, and please give that

628
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,550
to your car wash professional.

629
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,990
Very good.

630
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,990
Thank you very much.

631
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,990
Good to meet you.

632
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,670
Yeah.

633
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,670
Don't drink and drive.

634
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,190
Okay.

635
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,190
But if you do, call me.

636
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,150
Ahem.

637
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,150
Have an A-1 day.

638
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,470
Mom, you forgot to say it.

639
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,190
Yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay.

640
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,310
Make sure you get in there

641
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,310
between the cushions, all right?

642
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,670
That's it. Way in there. Attaboy.

643
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,190
What the hell you doing here?

644
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,230
I swear to God, the kid left

645
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,230
so much booger powder in there

646
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,190
my Caddy is a K-9 unit's wet dream.

647
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,820
Is your phone broken?

648
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,820
All 200 of them?

649
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,150
Huell's gone.

650
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,750
Huell's gone where?

651
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,590
No idea. AWOL. Nobody's seen him.

652
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,590
He's not answering his phone.

653
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,670
So, what about Jesse?

654
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,990
He hasn't shown up yet.

655
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,590
He will, Saul.

656
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,590
He's probably high as a kite

657
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,550
and hasn't gotten our message yet.

658
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,220
Or he got it loud and clear,

659
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,220
figured out it's a setup.

660
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,190
The kid is not as dumb

661
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,190
as you think.

662
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,950
Are you wearing

663
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,950
a bulletproof vest?

664
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
Did you miss the part about

665
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
my bodyguard has gone missing?

666
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,790
Look, I had him

667
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,790
watching the Dog House,

668
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,550
figuring the kid might show up.

669
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,710
Next thing I know, radio silence.

670
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,340
You're the math whiz.

671
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,340
Add up two and two.

672
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,270
Jesse is not on some killing spree.

673
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,670
It's me he wants.

674
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,190
It's just me.

675
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,030
Well, then where the hell's Huell?

676
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,190
Any news?

677
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,190
Not yet, but soon. I promise.

678
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,670
Have an A-1 day.

679
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,430
Next,

680
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,640
inventory lists.

681
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,590
These are the inventory lists.

682
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,590
Every day, after close of business,

683
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,670
you tally the total

684
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,670
of every item sold

685
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,030
and you mark it

686
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,030
under the appropriate column.

687
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,390
So say we sold, I don't know,

688
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,390
10 pine-scented air fresheners.

689
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,710
You mark "10" under this column

690
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,190
and then you subtract 10

691
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,190
from the stock column.

692
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,110
Okay? Why don't you try that?

693
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,840
Jesse?

694
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,190
Got my photo, bitch?

695
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,190
That barrel look familiar?

696
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,430
Because I just found six more

697
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,430
exactly like it.

698
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,270
That big bastard who

699
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,270
works for Goodman,

700
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,670
I pistol-whipped that melon

701
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,670
he calls a head

702
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,950
till he gave up what he knew,

703
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,950
which led me to your rental van,

704
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,870
which, it turns out, had GPS.

705
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,190
How do you like that, genius?

706
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,190
Guess you didn't think of everything.

707
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,550
Look, Jesse, I don't know

708
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,550
what you plan on doing here, but--

709
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,320
Well, I'll give you a hint, Walt.

710
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,590
It involves a couple of five-gallon cans

711
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,590
of gasoline and a lighter.

712
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,830
No, no, no! Jesse, please, listen to me.

713
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,550
No, you listen to me, bitch.

714
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,110
You get your ass out here

715
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,110
as fast as you can.

716
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,910
Yes, I'm coming. Okay! Okay!

717
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,630
And don't even think about

718
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,630
calling anyone for help, all right?

719
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,910
You hang up on me, put me on hold,

720
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,870
lose my call for any reason,

721
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,760
as soon as you do,

722
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,760
I'm burning all of it.

723
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,670
All right? One big bonfire.

724
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,670
You get the picture?

725
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,510
I get it, I get it. Okay.

726
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,510
All right. You better hurry,

727
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,790
because I'm burning

728
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,790
10 grand a minute

729
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,910
till you get here, starting right now.

730
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,870
I said, I'm coming!

731
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,870
Don't you touch my money!

732
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,270
Fire in the hole, bitch.

733
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,270
There goes 10 G's.

734
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,910
Oh, nice orange flames.

735
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,910
No, no, no!

736
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,000
Jesse-- Jesse, please.

737
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,110
I'm dying. My cancer is back.

738
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,670
You're not hurting anyone

739
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,670
but my family. Okay?

740
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,870
I can't spend this money.

741
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,110
It's not for me. I won't be around

742
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,110
long enough to use it.

743
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,800
It belongs to my children.

744
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,630
Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.

745
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,590
You're seriously gonna go there?

746
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,900
I am sorry about Brock.

747
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,430
No, you're not.

748
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,470
I am.

749
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,470
You're not, but you're gonna be.

750
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,510
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!

751
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,310
But he's alive, isn't he?

752
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,390
He's fine, just as I planned it!

753
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,110
Don't you think I knew

754
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,110
exactly how much to give him?

755
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,310
That I had it all measured out?

756
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,310
Come on!

757
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,910
Don't you know me by now?

758
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,910
I know you're a lying, evil scumbag,

759
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,150
that's what I know.

760
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,390
Manipulating people,

761
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,110
messing with their heads.

762
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,110
Open your eyes!

763
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,990
Can't you see that I needed you

764
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,990
on my side to kill Gus?

765
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,190
I ran over those gangbangers!

766
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,270
I killed Emilio and Krazy-8! Why?

767
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,870
I did all of those things

768
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,870
to try to save your life

769
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,560
as much as mine.

770
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,790
Only you're too stupid to know it!

771
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,030
Jesse.

772
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,550
Jesse!

773
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,280
Jesse, talk to me.

774
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,390
Jesse!

775
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,280
Jesse, I didn't hang up! Jesse!

776
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,390
Jesse?

777
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,310
Jesse, I'm here. Where are you?

778
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,790
Son of a bitch.

779
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,910
Son of a bitch.

780
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,710
Son of a bitch!

781
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,390
No. No. No, no, no.

782
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,070
Come on, come on.

783
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,790
Yes.

784
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,950
Yeah?

785
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,070
It's me. I've got Jesse in sight,

786
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,910
and he's coming for me right now.

787
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,150
He knows I'm alone.

788
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,230
Let's go, boy.

789
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,230
I'm guessing he's got backup.

790
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,270
How many guys?

791
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,270
I do-- I-- I don't know.

792
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,310
Where are you?

793
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,310
To'hajiilee.

794
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,430
An Indian reservation west of town.

795
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,990
Get a pen.

796
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,990
Go.

797
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,040
Okay.

798
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,760
Okay.

799
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,070
"Thirty-four, 59, 20,

800
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,390
106, 36, 52."

801
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,820
Those are coordinates.

802
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,670
If you want me around

803
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,670
to cook for you,

804
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,390
you get here now.

805
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,390
You got it.

806
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,910
As fast as you can. Okay. Wait.

807
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,590
They're coming.

808
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,310
Looks like there could be

809
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,310
three men total.

810
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,780
Wait a minute.

811
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,070
What? What is it?

812
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,830
- Stay in the car.

813
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,830
- Oh, my God.

814
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,270
Walter, what is it?

815
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,430
Walter, you still there?

816
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,390
Walter?

817
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,550
Walter, you got eyes on him?

818
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,630
What do you see?

819
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,390
Walter, talk to me.

820
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,910
Forget it.

821
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,710
Don't come.

822
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,400
What do you mean,

823
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,400
"don't come"?

824
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,710
It's off.

825
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,390
Do not come.

826
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,310
Walt!

827
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,950
Come on out!

828
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,510
Walt!

829
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,070
Walt!

830
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,750
I know you're out here!

831
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,990
It's over!

832
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,230
Walt!

833
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,190
Come on out, Walt!

834
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,950
Got him.

835
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,550
Drop it!

836
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,390
Hands up!

837
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,030
Walk towards me slowly!

838
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,310
Stop.

839
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,710
Turn around.

840
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
Lace your fingers

841
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
behind your head.

842
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,710
Walk backwards to me.

843
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,200
Stop.

844
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,590
Get on your knees.

845
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,080
How'd you like my

846
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,080
barrel photo, huh?

847
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,550
Took it in the backyard

848
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,550
by the barbecue grill.

849
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,470
You know, where we used

850
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,470
to cook out with the family.

851
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,430
Gomey thought the dirt

852
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,430
might not match. But me?

853
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,670
I bet your greedy ass

854
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,670
would be so worked up

855
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,830
about the prospect

856
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,830
of losing your cash

857
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,030
that you wouldn't catch it.

858
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,110
Looks like I was right.

859
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,230
He's clean.

860
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,830
Yo, I remember this place.

861
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,390
It's the very first place

862
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,390
we cooked, like, ever.

863
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,310
It is, isn't it?

864
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,790
Hey, what say you save us

865
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,790
the busywork, Walt,

866
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,750
and point out the spot

867
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,750
where you buried your money?

868
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,040
No?

869
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,310
No matter.

870
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,710
I'll get a search team out here.

871
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,710
We'll find it.

872
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,120
Agent Gomez,

873
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,120
should we flip a coin

874
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,120
for the honors?

875
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,920
No way, man. It's all yours.

876
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,230
Walter White,

877
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,630
you have the right to remain silent.

878
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,300
Anything you say can

879
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,300
and will be used against you

880
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,960
in a court of law.

881
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,910
You have the right

882
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,910
to speak to an attorney

883
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,830
and have an attorney present

884
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,830
during questioning.

885
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,710
If you cannot afford an attorney,

886
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,630
one will be provided for you

887
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,630
at the government's expense.

888
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,840
Do you understand these rights

889
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,840
as I have just recited them to you?

890
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,790
Coward.

891
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,000
- Get-- Get over here!

892
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,000
- Bring it!

893
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,990
Get in the truck, will you?

894
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,990
Bring it, bitch!

895
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,990
Put him in the car!

896
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,990
Come on! Come on!

897
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,390
Get in the car! Hurry up!

898
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,150
Get in the car, kid. Come on.

899
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,700
Gonna take him down

900
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,700
for booking, okay?

901
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,150
You should stay here

902
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,150
till I come back with a search team.

903
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,310
You got it.

904
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,310
I'd take the kid with me,

905
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,430
but they'd probably

906
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,430
kill each other on the way.

907
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,430
Congratulations, buddy.

908
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,430
Hey.

909
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,580
I'll call the tribal police,

910
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,580
let them know we're here.

911
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,390
Gonna make a phone call.

912
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,350
Hank, why is there what looks like

913
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,350
brains in our garbage can?

914
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,190
Hey, baby. I got him.

915
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,390
Dead to rights.

916
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,400
You got Walt?

917
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,400
Yeah.

918
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,150
I got him in handcuffs as we speak.

919
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,750
Want me to wave to him for you?

920
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,750
Heh, heh. Well, he's not--

921
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,750
He's not feeling too friendly.

922
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,710
Oh, my God.

923
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,790
You did it.

924
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,870
Thank God.

925
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,910
Things are gonna be a little rough

926
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,910
for the next couple weeks,

927
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,400
but they'll get better.

928
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,830
Baby, you okay?

929
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,670
I'm much better now.

930
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,750
I gotta go.

931
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,310
It may be a while

932
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,310
before I get home.

933
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,190
I love you.

934
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,510
I love you too.

935
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,550
Who the hell is this?

936
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,710
Tribal police?

937
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,310
Hank! Hank! Hank!

938
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,670
No--

939
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,870
Police! Drop your weapons!

940
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,230
Jack, don't do it!

941
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,840
Jack!

942
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,630
Drop your weapons!

943
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,790
You heard the man! Put them down!

944
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,150
How do we know you're cops?

945
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,430
Show us some ID!

946
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,030
Damn straight!

947
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,030
Let's see some badges!

948
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,990
Jack!

949
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,830
Jack, don't do it!

950
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,520
Jack!

951
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,550
No, Jack, it's off! Jack!

952
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,670
We'll give ourselves up,

953
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,670
you show us some badges!

954
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,350
Simple as that!

955
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,790
How about it?

956
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,670
No!

957
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,310
Jack!

958
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,270
Jack, it's off! Forget it!

959
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,550
Jack!
