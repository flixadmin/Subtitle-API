is even more primitive than I expected.

497
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,447
Hey...

00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,828
Hmm. I like the way they pop.

501
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,705
Focus, comrade.

502
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:46,960
B-127's distress signal came
from the western coast of this continent.

503
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,713
For now, we head west.

[Ron] When do they start
letting you use nunchucks?

507
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,856
[Otis] I don't know, but I hope soon.

508
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,067
-Morning! See you guys later.
-Where you off to so fast?

509
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,528
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

510
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,990
Morning, Bum--...

511
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,619
Bee?

512
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,831
Bee, where are you?

513
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,959
[breathing heavily]

-Bee!

00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,797
Where did you go?

517

Otis!

518
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,349
[panting] Have you seen my car?

519
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,933
Unfortunately, yes.

520
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,935
No, have you seen my car today?

521
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,812
It was in the garage. Someone stole it!

522
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,606
No, idiot. Mom took it.

523

-[panting]
-She had to bring Conan to the vet

a rubber glove or something

525
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,903
and Ron needed the station wagon.

526
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,363
Thank God.

527
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,200

Hi. Excuse me. It's me again.

00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,126
-We never officially met, but...
-I can't right now. Sorry.

00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,586
Nope. Yep.

I know, buddy. Hang in there.

You can't eat everything you see.

536
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,267
Just let this be
a good life lesson for you.

537
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,481
Oh, my God. Stop it! Don't do that!

-Mom?
-Whoa!

541
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,080
Jesus! Charlie, what are you doing?

542
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,748
Mom, you gotta pull over.

543
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,543
-What the hell is going on?
-Just pull the car over.

544
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,212
[Sally] Okay, okay. All right.

[Conan whines]

546
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,426
Would you put that robot junk away?

547
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,052
What are you thinking?

548
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,554
[Sally] You almost gave me a heart attack.

549
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,932
I thought I was being carjacked.
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

550
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,184
I can't believe you would take
him without me.

551
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,769
Mom, I'm so worried about him!

552
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,813
He's my dog, too, you know.

553
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,232
What happened to Conan being Otis's dog?

554
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,109
[sighs] Mom, you're
being hysterical, okay?

555
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,236
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

556
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,113
I know how you get during emergencies.

557
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,115
I'm a nurse.

Not of animals.

00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:33,084
Oh, okay. I'm happy for you to drive.

560
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,253
You weren't wearing your helmet,
by the way.

00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,796
-I saw that.
-Oh, shoot.

[whispers] Keep it together, Bee.

Sir?

Sir.

566
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,564
I thought you'd want
to see this immediately.

567
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,613
-They sure?
-[Simmons] Yes, sir.

568
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,573
Two of them just
made contact in Texas.

569
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,867
Intel says they're heading west fast.

570
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,452
Saddle up, Simmons.

571
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,954
We're going to Texas.

572
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,667
[Charlie] Okay, Bee,
we need to go over a few things.

573
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,670
[sighs]

574
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,383
Okay. We're all clear.

575
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:28,014
All right. [spits]
I'm re-thinking the beach.

576
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,098
Ugh.

577
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,143
Oh, I'm good.

578
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,145
No, I'm good, thanks.

579
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,068
People can be terrible
about things they don't understand.

580
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,862
If they find you, they'll probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

581
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,489
and cut you into tiny little pieces.

582
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,367
It'll be... bad, trust me.

583
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,916
The only person you can show
yourself around is me, okay?

584
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,962
So, let's practice. You ready?

585
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,089
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

586
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,636
Great. Perfect.
[chuckles] Come back now.

587
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,641
Okay, so let's say we're driving
and all of a sudden...

588
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,227
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here!
Hide, Bee, hide!

You serious?

Bee, it's too late. You're already dead.

592
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,752
It's all right.

593
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,629
That's why we're practicing.

You'll get it.

[indistinct radio chatter]

598
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,114
The goal, sir, should be
to communicate with them.

599
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,117
First contact with an alien species.

600
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,704
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

601
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,539
If they make one wrong move,

602
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,790
we put 'em down.

Please let me kill them.

00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,644
Not yet.

606
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,063
B-127's signal has gone silent.

607
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,899
I have an idea.

608
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,027
Listen up! I'm Agent Burns

609
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,654
and this is... Dr. Powell.

610

We currently have 100 guns
pointed right at your head!

611
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,284
So, state your business.

[Dropkick] What are you doing?

615
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,169
This is humiliating.

616
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,839
We believe a dangerous criminal
from our world

617
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,009
is hiding somewhere on yours.

618
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,886
How is it you think we can help?

619
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,598
We need your eyes.

620
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,600
Wait.

621
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,894
You want access to our satellites?

622
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,689
[Shatter] Our scanners' range is limited.

623
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:26,109
Your infrastructure is... primitive.

624
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,654
But combined,
they could be quite powerful.

625
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,489
No way! Out of the question!

626
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,450
We have a common enemy, Agent Burns.

627
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,869
There's a war raging on our planet.

628
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:41,624
If B-127 isn't found,
that war may find its way here.

629
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,084
Perhaps...

630
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,004
We can find a way to help one another.

631
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,048
We'll talk it over with our superiors.

632

In the meantime,

in a VW all day, huh?

Is there anyone that can help you?

00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,533
Do you have a family?

00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,661
You know, like a mom, dad, siblings?

640
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,996
You all love each other?

641
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,125
Or drive each other crazy

642
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,753
and you can't wait to get away
and start a whole new life.

No. You're not going anywhere.

It's about my car. It's really important.

is make things harder.

I've become this drain on everyone,

it's impossible to do that.

You must protect the planet.

This is our chance to wipe out the Autobot

We'll burn the whole planet to cinders.

They're using our satellites.

1321

They're calling an army.

1322

They're gonna kill us all.

1323

She wishes not to be troubled.
