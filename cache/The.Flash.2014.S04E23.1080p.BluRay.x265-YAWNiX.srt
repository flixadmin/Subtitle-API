1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,826
<i>This season on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,708
<i>DeVoe and his wife
are super-villains.</i>

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,756
<i>He created 12 meta-humans
just so he could steal their powers.</i>

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,799
This was your team member. Ralph Dibny.

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,130
A rookie hero.

6
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,553
I'll save you!

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,966
My husband is dead.

8
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,343
I am leaving you, Clifford.

9
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,595
This is an intelligence booster.

10
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,926
<i>Your mind is being rebooted.</i>

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,888
The more I try to use my brain,
the sooner I'm gonna lose it.

12
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,145
<i>DeVoe plans to position each
of his five satellites around the globe.</i>

13
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,522
Satellites working together
for a single purpose?

14
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,070
DeVoe wants to remove the
intelligence of everyone on Earth?

15
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,363
"Let there be light."

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,154
<i>Hey, this is Barry. Leave a message.</i>

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,998
Allen. Captain Singh.

18
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,372
Got some good news about you
getting your job back.

19
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,128
You can thank your wife, too.

20
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,047
Apparently, the Mayor read those
posts Iris wrote about DeVoe,

21
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,669
and she's decided...

22
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,138
- Cisco, we need power!
- Working on it!

23
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,103
Nothing's working.
Not even cell phones.

24
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,400
- It's what I was worried about.
- It's happening, isn't it?

25
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,022
I don't know.
I mean, our plan didn't work.

26
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,775
DeVoe replaced the satellite I destroyed

27
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,152
with the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite
to set off the Enlightenment.

28
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,528
Barr, it's going nuts out there.

29
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,656
I mean, there's no power anywhere.
Our car just stopped working.

30
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,827
Thank God we were close by.

31
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,654
I mean, the hospital's
another three miles away.

32
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,081
The hospital?

33
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,157
- Oh!
- Joe!

34
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,540
Yeah, the sky turned purple,
and she started having contractions.

35
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,620
Cisco, hurry!

36
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,797
If we're not able to get her
to the hospital, can you...

37
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,216
No, Barry can't run her.
It's not safe for Cecile or the baby.

38
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,338
Then what are we gonna do?

39
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,294
I have everything here
I'd need to deliver a baby.

40
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,469
- What?
- Huh?

41
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,047
- Thank God.
- Great.

42
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,552
Um, let's go see how dilated you are.

43
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,805
- Okay.
- Breathe, baby. Breathe.

44
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,302
Hey.

45
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,892
You're gonna wanna see this.

46
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,397
DeVoe must have predicted Harry
would build his own thinking cap

47
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,525
and power it with the dark matter
from this tube.

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,065
Dark matter that he could then
siphon off from S.T.A.R. Labs

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,149
and use to infect the world.

50
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,693
Harry was his guinea pig.

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,863
He knew if he could reboot Harry's
brain, he could reboot everyone's.

52
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,073
What about Gideon?
Could she hack into the satellites?

53
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,829
No, Purple Haze took her out, too.

54
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,294
So, what do we do?

55
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,624
I don't know.

56
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,088
It's okay, Barry.

57
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,427
I think I do.

58
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,804
Look, I love <i>Inception</i>
as much as the next guy,

59
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,185
but sending Barry into DeVoe's mind?

60
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,187
His mind is the only one fast enough

61
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,769
to survive the linking process
without any harm.

62
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,320
Yeah, but how would this
help us stop him?

63
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,239
If we could find the good
left in Clifford

64
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,324
and help it retake control of his mind,

65
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,822
that good could overpower the bad.

66
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,279
You think there actually is good
left inside of him?

67
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,368
I know that this is hard to imagine,

68
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,666
but there was a time
when Clifford was nothing but good,

69
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,163
when he truly wanted to help the world.

70
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,916
It's the dark matter
he infused in his brain

71
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,121
that changed him, so, yes,

72
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,081
I do believe that there is
some good in him somewhere.

73
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,165
We just need to find it.

74
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,544
This is crazy. I mean, why don't we
just call someone we trust?

75
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,674
Kara, Oliver, Wally.

76
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,721
You could bring a legion
of your friends,

77
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,140
but they would pose no challenge.

78
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,765
Clifford created the bus metas
and a combination of the abilities

79
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,189
to ensure that he could defeat anyone
whose assistance you might enlist.

80
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,727
How long until our minds are wiped?

81
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,697
We have until
the permeation grid hits 100%.

82
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,153
How would we get me inside his mind?

83
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,122
We need to find a way to transfer
your consciousness into his.

84
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,915
No, you know what happens
every time I try to vibe him,

85
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,288
I... I can't do it.

86
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,331
I do.

87
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,290
But I don't think it's your power
we need, Mr. Ramon.

88
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,749
I believe it's hers.

89
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,969
This will amplify Ms. Horton's
telepathic ability

90
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,099
to link the Flash's consciousness
to Clifford's,

91
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,522
wherever he may be.

92
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,482
It will also provide a one-way link

93
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,811
so that he doesn't realize
that someone is inside his mind.

94
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,315
So it's kind of like
a one-way brain radio?

95
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,774
I suppose so, yes.

96
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,658
Hey, you hear that, Harry?

97
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,408
That cerebral inhibitor of yours
is gonna be put to good use.

98
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,413
I'm sorry, but your friend, his mind...

99
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,245
"Sorry" won't make him better, will it?

100
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,540
- Everything ready?
- Think so.

101
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,383
Mr. Allen, the chair.

102
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,339
Ms. Horton, the gurney.

103
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,178
You wanna put him in that thing?

104
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,351
It is the only way to establish
a transcranial link

105
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,144
between Ms. Horton and Mr. Allen.

106
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,856
Joe, I'll be all right.

107
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,600
I'll be here the whole time.

108
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,605
We know.

109
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,202
Mr. Allen, put the cap on your head.

110
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,203
Once Cecile has locked
onto DeVoe's brainwaves,

111
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,250
we'll transfer your consciousness
to his amygdala.

112
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,999
That's the part of the brain
that connects

113
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,421
emotional significance to memories.

114
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,998
Where the good memories are,

115
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,425
we will find the good part of Clifford.

116
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,129
Here we go, Ms. Horton.

117
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,369
<i>Barry? Barry?</i>

118
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,993
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

119
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,887
You've got to be kidding me.

120
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,346
<i>Guys, I'm in.</i>

121
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,432
<i>Paint the picture. What do
you see? What's around you?</i>

122
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,357
For starters, The Thinker.

123
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,936
I'm in the 405 bus,
in the middle of the street.

124
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,192
I just came out of
that same portal from before.

125
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,193
<i>This is where it all began.</i>

126
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,446
It is the nexus of Clifford's brain.

127
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,198
Once you find him, get him through it,

128
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,904
and he can regain control of his mind.

129
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,534
Okay, what does he need to look for?

130
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,203
Our house.

131
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,825
All right.

132
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,725
Barry, what do you see?

133
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,314
Nothing.

134
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,187
<i>A little vague
for the viewers at home.</i>

135
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,484
<i>What do you mean, "nothing"?</i>

136
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,478
<i>I mean, it's empty.</i>

137
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,613
It's completely empty.

138
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,572
<i>- All right, well, where should I go...</i>
- Barry? Barry, can you hear me?

139
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,283
Babe, breathe.

140
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,334
Cecile's powers are connected
to her pregnancy.

141
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,163
Her contractions must be putting
a strain on her transcranial link.

142
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,792
No, no, no.
We need to do something about that.

143
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,170
But we can't stop her
from having a baby, Marlize.

144
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,752
We have to, Mrs. West-Allen,
or this will never work.

145
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,139
She is the only way to get Barry
in and out of Clifford's mind.

146
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,137
Everyone chill. It's not like
Cecile's gonna lose her powers

147
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,217
if she has this baby.

148
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,599
Cecile's gonna lose her powers
if she has this baby?

149
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,807
Won't that leave Barry stranded
in DeVoe's mind?

150
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,724
I'm afraid so.

151
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,028
Information you may have wanted
to share, like, way before now.

152
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,401
Joe, do you still have
that inhaler I gave you?

153
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,153
Yeah, it's in our hospital bag.

154
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,200
Okay. Most inhalers contain
the drug Terbutaline,

155
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,822
which can be used
to slow down contractions.

156
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,082
I found Thomas.

157
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,460
He's been this way all the time.

158
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,539
What the hell is that all about?

159
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,169
I don't know.

160
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,922
I'm gonna go get the inhaler.

161
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,173
- Cisco, cover me!
- Yeah.

162
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,429
Guys, we need to tell Barry
where to go next.

163
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,597
And fast.

164
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,051
Harry figured out where Marlize was.
Maybe he can...

165
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,599
Harry?

166
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,693
What are you doing?

167
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,522
Help.

168
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,483
No.

169
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,078
You are not frying away
what's left of you.

170
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,577
Help! Help!

171
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,204
Please.

172
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,901
See?

173
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,905
Nothing.

174
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,581
Ramon.

175
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,672
Where DeVoe
first fell in love with Marlize.

176
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,709
Tell Barry to go there.

177
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,632
You'll find him there.

178
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,892
Okay?

179
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,346
Okay.

180
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,807
And one more thing.

181
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,709
Stars so loud...

182
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,839
Nora shouldn't be here...

183
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,135
I won't lose anyone else today.

184
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,020
I won't.

185
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,608
<i>Harry had an idea. Go to Oxford.</i>

186
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,734
Oxford?

187
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,281
<i>The hamlet of Boars Hill.</i>

188
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,279
<i>The place where we fell in love.</i>

189
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,948
All right, I'm on my way.

190
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,584
All right, I'm here.

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,289
Uh, there is a blanket, some wine.

192
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,250
There's a song playing on a car radio.

193
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,923
Our first dance.

194
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,300
<i>And DeVoe?</i>

195
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,806
He's not here.

196
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,512
<i>All right, guys, well...</i>

197
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,140
Where to next?

198
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,440
Rookie?

199
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,995
Allen? What are you doing here?

200
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,748
Ralph? Is that really you?

201
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,118
Hey, man. I thought I lost you.

202
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,671
I... I'm so sorry, man. I...

203
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,457
I missed you, too, Barry.

204
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,463
Barry, did you just say, "Ralph"?

205
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,385
Yeah, guys.
Yeah, it's Ralph. He's...

206
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,217
<i>He's alive.</i>

207
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,553
Wait, how are you even here?

208
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,350
How are you here?

209
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,518
- Did DeVoe... Did he get you?
- No. No, he didn't.

210
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,566
He... It's Cecile.
Cecile's using her telepathy

211
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,023
to get my consciousness
inside DeVoe's mind.

212
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,951
That's trippy. Why?

213
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,949
We need to find the good part of him,

214
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,531
so we can stop the bad
from starting the Enlightenment.

215
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,908
Have you seen him?

216
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,666
A good DeVoe?

217
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,249
No.

218
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,835
Just the evil, floating-chair variety.

219
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,425
He visits me all the time.

220
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,719
He knows you're here?

221
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,005
Why would he need to...

222
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,593
In this place,
I do as I please, Mr. Allen.

223
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,225
I must say, the fact that
you thought I wouldn't calculate

224
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,772
you and your team
making this feeble attempt

225
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,770
is somewhat insulting.

226
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,691
There'll be no defeating the Big Bad
this year, Mr. Allen.

227
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,945
You see, you're in my mind now.

228
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,404
And there's no escape.

229
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,709
Run, Mr. Allen. Run.

230
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,246
Barry?

231
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,586
Barry?

232
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,461
He's coming... He's coming for us.
He's coming for us.

233
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,172
I heard his thoughts.
He's coming. He's coming. Here.

234
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,474
- We need to leave.
- And go where?

235
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,725
Okay, what are we doing?

236
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,931
I'm getting you out of here.

237
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,812
We still need to find
the good DeVoe, though.

238
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,017
- How?
- I don't know.

239
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,819
I mean, he's gonna be someplace
that means something to him.

240
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,693
Before he became who he is now.

241
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,079
You mean, like when he was
a simple history professor?

242
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,584
Stars are raining.

243
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,081
- Got to go. Come on!
- Whoa!

244
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,715
Good.

245
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,926
We are gathered here today
to worship in song.

246
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,553
I suggest "Kumbaya."

247
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,385
Ah.

248
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,187
A force field.

249
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,015
Force field, sucker.

250
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,318
I should never have let you build
this chair without my oversight.

251
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,112
It was my first miscalculation.

252
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,524
You've made many miscalculations.

253
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,775
Really?

254
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,074
Have you ever pondered
why I never pursued the Flash,

255
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,282
never needed his speed or his mind?

256
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,412
Anyone?

257
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,244
His connection to the Speed Force,

258
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,417
access to all of time,

259
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,129
past, present, future, true knowledge!

260
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,763
And now that you have placed him
inside my mind,

261
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,260
I'll have it all.

262
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,802
You'll have to find us first.

263
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,063
DeVoe's lair? Are you crazy?

264
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,989
Can he find us
in this pocket dimension?

265
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,279
I bought us some time.

266
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,364
Time, rhyme, fine, sign...

267
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,291
Cecile, we need you to try
and link up with Barry again.

268
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:20,951
I'll try.

269
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,632
Professor DeVoe?

270
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,551
<i>Barry?</i>

271
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,144
Barry, can you hear me?

272
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,938
<i>Yeah. Yeah, Iris, I hear you.</i>

273
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,105
What's wrong?

274
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,524
Good DeVoe, we found him.

275
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,646
He's dead.

276
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,620
I don't suppose you have
another plan, do you?

277
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,001
No, man, I mean, I...

278
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,081
This was it.

279
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,710
- Now...
- Now, the world belongs to The Thinker.

280
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,467
Allen, listen to me.

281
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,424
I'm stuck here.

282
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,226
But you're not.

283
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,261
You should go.

284
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,099
Be with your family
for whatever time is left.

285
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,479
No.

286
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,360
No.

287
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,153
Okay, first of all, it's our family,

288
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,234
and I'm not leaving you behind.

289
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,067
There's got to be another way.

290
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,868
Allen, you said
the only way to save the world

291
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,071
is by finding the good
that's left in DeVoe.

292
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,452
He's right here,

293
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,368
with a hole in his chest.

294
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,551
It's not the only good left in him.

295
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,140
Why the brakes? Are we there?

296
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,718
Almost.

297
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,598
So that's the Hellmouth?

298
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,270
That's the nexus of DeVoe's mind.

299
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,769
Marlize said we can take control of him

300
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,316
if the good in DeVoe passes through it.

301
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,270
Allen, we know
that's not possible anymore.

302
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,276
Why do you think he's keeping you alive?

303
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,149
I mean, I couldn't figure it out,
but think about it.

304
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,953
If you get out, you take back control
of this body, because it's yours.

305
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,867
That's why he won't let you leave.

306
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,912
Once you get out,
DeVoe will cease to exist.

307
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,661
All you have to do
is make it through that portal,

308
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,995
and you'll regain control.

309
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,332
Remember who you are, Ralph. A hero.

310
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,139
Let's go get control.

311
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,189
Or how about I kill you?

312
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,475
A second time, if necessary.

313
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,494
- What was that?
- My husband.

314
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,914
He's getting close.

315
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,548
Please tell me someone else felt that.

316
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,092
Apologies. I had to force
an emergency shift

317
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,386
to another pocket dimension.
It can be unnerving.

318
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,715
- Nerving, serving, swerving, curving.
- Hey, hey, hey.

319
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,266
It's okay.

320
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,184
- What's wrong?
- No more labor suppression.

321
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,144
How you feeling, Cecile?

322
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,815
Like... Like I don't know
if I can do this.

323
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,563
You shouldn't have to.
You should be able to have our baby

324
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,191
just like any other parent,
in a hospital, in a regular bed,

325
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,147
not with all this.

326
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,732
Hey, look what you've done.

327
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,826
To our friend, my son, my daughter,

328
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,787
the love of my life,
everybody in this damn city!

329
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,831
- Dad.
- How could you ever think

330
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,159
that this would be better for humanity?

331
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,916
Dad, what did you say to me when
Barry came out of the Speed Force?

332
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,753
You said,
"Strength without faith means nothing."

333
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,595
We need to have faith that
we can get through this, together.

334
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,480
- How long until he finds us?
- Minutes. Maybe less.

335
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,671
Crap in a hat. I can't hit him.

336
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,093
He can read our minds.

337
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,592
- Then we do this Dibny style.
- What?

338
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,298
We don't think. Just...

339
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,466
Fill your mind with something else.

340
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,017
Something you love.

341
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,094
Ralph.

342
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,734
Shrimp buffet!

343
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,990
It's you and me, Iris.

344
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,210
Shrimp platter!
Shrimp cocktail! Um...

345
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,805
Once again, Mr. Allen,
your best will not be good enough.

346
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,395
What's the plan, rookie?
I'm running out of shrimp entrees.

347
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,147
You're only gonna need one.

348
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,984
They're coming every five minutes.

349
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,161
The stars are raining...

350
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,739
Cecile, please just focus
on not having a baby.

351
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,541
Stars are raining,
draining, paining.

352
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,710
He sounds just like Barry when he
came out of the Speed Force.

353
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,879
- Yeah. I know.
- No, I mean, he's...

354
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,998
He's saying the exact same words.

355
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,902
You should mind where you point
your weapon, Detective West.

356
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,154
No.

357
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,925
Stay away from my girls!

358
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,880
Joe!

359
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,407
Hey, <i>Attack of the Clones.</i>

360
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,704
Come and get me.

361
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,884
Hang on!

362
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,231
That was awesome.

363
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,612
Come on.

364
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,917
Now it ends.

365
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:09,941
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

366
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,899
No!

367
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,087
How could you beat me?

368
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,831
I didn't.

369
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,500
We did.

370
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,467
Their emotional attachment to Mr. Dibny

371
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,095
have made them stronger
than you would ever be, Clifford!

372
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,393
But then you wouldn't understand.

373
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,688
No! This is not my will!

374
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,649
Not anymore. It's mine.

375
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,284
Whoa.

376
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,500
The numbers are still rising.

377
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,959
Clifford's meta abilities are no
longer controlling each satellite.

378
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,922
If I can just override
their last command. Come on.

379
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,844
There's no more dark energy
anywhere in the city.

380
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,717
We did it.

381
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,976
Oh, my stretchy so and so.

382
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,224
Uh, guys.

383
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,143
My water just broke.

384
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,986
Let's get her to the med lab. Quickly!

385
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,063
Baby's coming.

386
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,238
Oh, boy, baby's coming.

387
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,315
- Careful. Carefully.
- Okay, okay.

388
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:21,949
Come on, Harry.

389
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,349
Please, tell me you've done this before.

390
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,801
A few times.

391
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,178
- In med school.
- Med...

392
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,021
- Med school?
- Yeah.

393
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,475
Okay. Okay, med school. Okay.

394
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:56,272
- Joe, just relax. We got this. Okay?
- Yeah. Just breathe out.

395
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,274
Just breathe out.

396
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,408
Power's back on everywhere.

397
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,414
Now, the world can finally
get back to normal.

398
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,167
Landing, standing, tumbling, tossing,
turning, falling, falling...

399
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,294
What happened to him?

400
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,966
He's Enlightened.

401
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,465
Another use of Mr. Deacon's powers.

402
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,221
Technological reincarnation.

403
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,473
- Cisco.
- He's taking over.

404
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,774
I told you that the Enlightenment
will come for you, Marlize.

405
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,601
And it will.

406
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,738
Remember, I thought of everything,

407
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,025
even this moment.

408
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,493
Goodbye, my love.

409
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,922
We're back online.

410
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,675
Not just that.

411
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,469
Sally's in a decaying orbit.

412
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,647
Wait. So Marlize deactivating him
triggered a literal dead-man switch?

413
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,727
It's falling fast.

414
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,608
Clifford must have increased its mass
by a thousand-fold.

415
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,155
Barry, the impact of something
that heavy and that fast...

416
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,357
- I know.
- How much time do we have?

417
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,441
Three minutes if we're lucky.

418
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,743
Okay, how do we stop something that's
gonna send us back in the Stone Age?

419
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,617
Together. I'll spread the word
to evacuate downtown.

420
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,790
Ralph, Cisco, you guys
clear the impact zone.

421
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,583
Barry, you've got to destroy
that satellite.

422
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,834
Okay, now it's time for you to push.
On three.

423
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,629
One, two, three.

424
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,340
You're doing great.

425
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,815
Go that way!

426
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,733
Ma'am, not this way. Take cover.

427
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,149
- Well, what is he doing?
- He's building up speed.

428
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,771
He's gonna use a sonic punch
to destroy it.

429
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,399
Given the satellite's mass
and its escalating descent,

430
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,526
what prevents it from destroying him?

431
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,326
You're doing great.

432
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,537
Now I need one big push, okay?

433
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,624
One, two, three.

434
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,461
Here she comes.

435
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,597
Thank you.

436
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,358
Barry.

437
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:55,778
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,452
This will restore your friend's mind.

439
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,042
Thank you.

440
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,708
I have a lot to make amends for.

441
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,634
You know, Marlize,

442
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,382
there are still a lot
of metas out there.

443
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,759
I mean, we...

444
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,799
We could use your help.

445
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,510
You have
all the support you need.

446
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,805
There are those, however,
that do need my help.

447
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,769
Before I joined
my late husband's crusade,

448
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,147
I used technology to better the lives
of those who had nothing.

449
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,533
Back then, my mechanical creations
healed the world,

450
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,869
not harmed it.

451
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,076
I'll just pick up where I left off.

452
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,459
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

453
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,750
- Good luck.
- Bye.

454
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,260
She risked everything
to try and save him.

455
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,013
She really loved him.

456
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,977
Part of her always will.

457
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,864
What? What is it?

458
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,109
That satellite,

459
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,288
it wasn't just me who took it down.
There was someone else.

460
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,579
Who? Who was it?

461
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,410
Another speedster.

462
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,044
Hang on, Harry.
We're almost there.

463
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,218
Okay. I'm gonna put this on.

464
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,659
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

465
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,737
- Is he okay?
- His vitals are stable.

466
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,948
The program completed,
it should've worked.

467
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,790
Hey, Harry.

468
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,959
Hey. Harry!

469
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:53,710
Harry.

470
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,255
Don't worry.

471
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,925
You have been

472
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,976
and will always be

473
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,516
my friend.

474
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:11,974
Khan...

475
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,697
- "Heal them."
- "Heal them."

476
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,954
Oh, my God.

477
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,370
<i>Star Wars.</i>

478
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,333
I can't believe it.

479
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,377
- You did it. You did it. You did it.
- Oh, I can't believe it.

480
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,505
It's not every day you translate symbols

481
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,881
into binary
programming polynomials.

482
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,634
I don't know what that means.

483
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,598
Yes, you do.

484
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,676
No, actually I don't.
I don't know what that means.

485
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,262
I think that there's some...

486
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,597
Some short circuits
have been fried up here,

487
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,358
but it's fine.

488
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,859
What are you talking about?

489
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,688
I mean, I just don't understand
the... The thing you said.

490
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,568
It's okay, though.

491
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,908
What's the matter?

492
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,081
- Marlize said this would work.
- It did work.

493
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,159
Ramon.

494
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,786
You did it.

495
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,209
I'm back! I'm here.

496
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,337
I mean, maybe I'm a little more average

497
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,050
than I used to be up there,
but I'm here.

498
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,219
Harry, there's nothing average
about you.

499
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,637
You have seven PhDs.

500
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,924
Well, not anymore.

501
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,263
- I was supposed to fix this.
- What's the matter?

502
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,438
And you did! Ramon.
Ramon, you did. You did.

503
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,059
You brought me back.
You brought back what matters.

504
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,688
So what if I'm... Look, my whole
life, I've been defined by one thing.

505
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,358
My IQ. And...

506
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,240
Somehow, you've given me

507
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,782
a balance

508
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:56,250
between my head and...

509
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,596
Thank you for the balance, Ramon.

510
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,978
Now, I'm gonna take that balance
to my Earth.

511
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,473
- What?
- Wait, Harry. Harry, we just...

512
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,687
We just got you back.

513
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,356
No, I know, Iris.

514
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,272
But I have to go see my daughter.

515
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,450
I mean,
I might not have the intelligence

516
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,573
to garner seven PhDs,

517
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,781
but I can see one thing clearly.

518
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,036
Family matters.

519
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,124
Well, we're family, too.

520
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,080
Heck yeah, you are.

521
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,417
Each and every one of you.

522
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,381
I'll miss you.

523
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,047
Okay.

524
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,562
- We should probably hug. Yeah!
- 'Cause...

525
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,858
I was like...

526
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,609
We're going to miss you.

527
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,611
- I love you guys.
- We love you, too.

528
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,651
I love you, too.

529
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,999
There could be a million
Harrys in this multi-verse,

530
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,495
but you,

531
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,577
you're one of a kind.

532
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,381
I love you, too.

533
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,353
It's the end of an era.

534
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,073
- There she is.
- Hi.

535
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,618
Hi. Joe, she's beautiful.

536
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,044
Just like her mother.

537
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,876
I think this calls for a toast.

538
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,882
I said this calls for a toast!

539
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,672
Oh!

540
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,257
- Sorry, I was...
- I got it.

541
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,341
Wally.

542
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,973
You didn't think I'd miss my new
baby sister's first party, right?

543
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:24,443
All right.
To the newest member of Team Flash...

544
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,529
Jenna Marie West.

545
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,944
Welcome to the family.

546
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,024
Cheers.

547
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,368
Nice party.

548
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,117
It's so good to see everyone.

549
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,875
You know, I heard that the Legends
have quite some parties, too.

550
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,126
Mmm.

551
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,001
So, tell me, did you find
what you were looking for?

552
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,296
Yeah, I did. And a lot more.

553
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,220
- I think fighting a time-demon helped.
- Mmm.

554
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,309
But, Dad, look, I left Team Flash

555
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,480
because I felt like I was always
gonna be in Barry's shadow.

556
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,107
But as a Legend, I...

557
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,361
I learned how to be comfortable
just being me.

558
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,943
- I'm so proud of you, son.
- Thank you.

559
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,609
- Let's see your sister.
- Yes.

560
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,242
- Oh, hi, handsome.
- Hi.

561
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,248
Oh, you know, Harry was right.

562
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,960
- This is really all that matters.
- Mmm-hmm.

563
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:25,996
We're next, you know.

564
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,420
Wait...

565
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,502
What do you mean? You wanna have
a baby now? What do you mean?

566
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,757
- You... Right now?
- Barry.

567
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,883
- What?
- Relax.

568
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,339
- I'm fine. I just...
- Are you?

569
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,890
- Mmm-hmm.
- I just meant someday.

570
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:37,966
Yeah.

571
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,474
- Not anytime in the near future.
- Right.

572
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,230
Oh, my God.
Let me just get you a refill.

573
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,604
- So you can relax.
- Thank you. That's nice. Thanks.

574
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,275
- Hi.
- Hi.

575
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,611
- We need to talk.
- What?

576
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,455
Wow, this house is bitchin'.

577
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,910
- Huh?
- I think I've seen you before.

578
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,207
Didn't you spill coffee
all over Harry and me?

579
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,378
Yeah, did she pay for yours?
Because she paid for ours.

580
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,049
Weren't you the server at their wedding?

581
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,592
Wait. Yeah, you were.

582
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,762
And where did you get this jacket?

583
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,506
Uh...

584
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,852
From her.

585
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,273
Um, no. Mine...

586
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,109
Mine is a one-of-a-kind, so...

587
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,238
So was this, uh,
when you let me borrow it.

588
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,361
Who are you?

589
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:42,206
I'm your daughter, Nora,
from the future.

590
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,408
And I think

591
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,793
I made a big,

592
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,212
big mistake.

593
00:41:49,236 --> 00:41:57,236
