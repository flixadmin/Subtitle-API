1
00:00:00,244 --> 00:00:02,183
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,184 --> 00:00:04,617
For 7 years, I have fought
with only one goal...

3
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:05,917
To save my city,

4
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,556
but now a new threat has emerged,

5
00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:09,536
a danger so severe it has forced me

6
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:11,401
to leave my family in order to face it,

7
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:13,898
and it won't be enough for
me to just be the Green Arrow.

8
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:15,634
To prevent the crisis that's coming,

9
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:17,549
I am going to have to
become someone else,

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,492
I am going to have to
become... something else.

11
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:22,936
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:24,859
We see the wall coming
down as an opportunity.

13
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,396
For the criminals of Star City to

14
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:28,562
- Rob the Glades blind.
- To reunite the city.

15
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:30,910
Ever since we brought down
the wall, your brother...

16
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,173
The Deathstroke gang...
has really upped their game.

17
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:35,529
They've amassed more territory
and power than ever before.

18
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,743
Your brother hates you.
That makes things unpredictable.

19
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:39,875
Vasquez is one of the
Glades' wealthiest citizens.

20
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:42,226
Maybe the Deathstrokes
plan to extort him.

21
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:43,534
A crisis is coming, John.

22
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:45,138
- What are you doing here?
- Reminding you

23
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:47,258
what you are doing here,
which does not include

24
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,059
interfering in the events of this Earth.

25
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,714
- The city's under attack.
- By who?

26
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:53,716
A crisis is imminent.

27
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:55,457
Someone is coming,

28
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,547
someone far, far more
powerful than myself.

29
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:00,268
We have to get the hell out of here.

30
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:08,460
I missed you, buddy.

31
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,028
We found ourselves in each other.

32
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,465
You're never without me.

33
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,597
Beautiful boy.

34
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,121
What's happening?

35
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:19,210
Oliver!

36
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:20,385
Son.

37
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:38,011
I warned you not to interfere.

38
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:39,458
You didn't bring us here?

39
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:42,668
No. I discovered what
had transpired on Earth-2,

40
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,132
that you intervened
to save Laurel Lance.

41
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,368
I redirected you.

42
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,849
What... the hell happened back there?

43
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,634
A herald of what is to come,

44
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,419
an entire world erased from existence.

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,682
Where's my mother?

46
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:01,557
Where's... where's Tommy?

47
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:05,082
Where's... where's Rene, where's Dinah?

48
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,345
They are no more.

49
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,869
Did you hurt John and Laurel?

50
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,524
They are alive and nearby,

51
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,888
but now you know that if we fail to stop

52
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,049
the coming crisis,

53
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,703
what you witnessed will occur

54
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,290
on infinite Earths across
the expanse of time.

55
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,665
How did I fail? Your Dwarf
Star particles are right there.

56
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,276
You disobeyed my instructions

57
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:28,061
to avoid entanglements
on a parallel Earth.

58
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,454
You confronted Tommy Merlyn.

59
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:31,688
You altered the fate of Laurel Lance.

60
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,284
I watched her die once.

61
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:36,722
Okay. I wasn't prepared to do it again.

62
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,465
You are not a man accustomed
to following orders,

63
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,903
but the survival of
the multiverse requires

64
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:46,342
that you obey mine.

65
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,040
Where are we?

66
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,348
Your home Earth, where you
will complete your next task.

67
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,394
There's a man named Dr. Robert Wong.

68
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:57,874
Bring him to me.

69
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,876
- Why?
- Now, that is not your concern.

70
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:03,707
Do not fail me again.

71
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:09,060
Oliver, we have to
get out of here... now.

72
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:20,723
- Who are they?
- Local gang.

73
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:22,290
I think we busted up a deal.

74
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,324
Nice of you to show up.

75
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,376
Where the hell are we?

76
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:08,494
We're in Hong Kong.

77
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:23,845
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

78
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,617
It's... it's not possible.

79
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,314
There's no way that my entire Earth

80
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:31,881
is just... is just gone.

81
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:34,013
You saw what happened
to the SCPD, right,

82
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,176
that energy wave,
people just disappearing?

83
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:37,626
That doesn't mean
it happened everywhere.

84
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,062
The Monitor told me that it did.

85
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:41,194
- The what?
- His real name is Mar Novu...

86
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:42,587
Oh. You call that a real name?

87
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:45,691
He's the one that has asked
me to be on this mission.

88
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,549
He is trying to prevent a crisis...

89
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,028
Oliver, just stop.

90
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,769
Hand me the breach device.

91
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,597
Give it to me. I'm going back.

92
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:53,946
Laurel, back where?

93
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:56,079
To my Earth

94
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,081
to look for any survivors.

95
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:04,059
- It's not working.
- Probably damaged

96
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,187
on our jump through the portal.

97
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,647
We don't have time to go all the way

98
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:08,352
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

99
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:09,962
I... I have to find somebody local.

100
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:11,703
I'm sorry, but we need
to focus on the mission.

101
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,183
First of all, there is no we here,

102
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,664
and the only mission that I care about

103
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:17,666
is saving what's left of my Earth.

104
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,059
Laurel. Laurel!

105
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,497
There's no one left to save.

106
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,237
The only thing that we can do right now

107
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:26,326
is prevent this from happening again

108
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,633
by doing what the Monitor tells us...

109
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:29,721
Screw the Monitor, Oliver,

110
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:31,506
and screw you, too.

111
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:33,551
None of this would have happened

112
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:36,554
if you hadn't shown up on
my Earth in the first place.

113
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,513
All of those people that you saw die,

114
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:40,273
they weren't real to you.

115
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,686
They were just copies of
the people that you love...

116
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,347
But that is my home,

117
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:50,334
and those people, those are real people

118
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,656
who are counting on me...

119
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:55,442
Adrian, my sister.

120
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:56,922
I just got my life back,

121
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,663
and I am not giving
it up without a fight.

122
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:03,233
Let her go, man.

123
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,713
She's wasting her time, John.

124
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,453
She's processing her grief,

125
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:08,412
and if we have a new mission

126
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,069
and the multiverse
depends on it, Oliver,

127
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,721
we have to get going right now.

128
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:16,812
Anyone want to fill me in
on what happened out there?

129
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:19,554
I almost got my throat slit.

130
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:22,034
Turns out Connor doesn't know
his brother as well as he thinks.

131
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,586
Hey. We're all still alive, aren't we?

132
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:25,308
Which means what exactly,

133
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:26,996
that your brother's not such a bad guy?

134
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:29,104
All I'm saying is JJ
could have killed you,

135
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:33,176
- and he didn't.
- Wow! That is some serious denial.

136
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:35,004
To answer your question, nothing good.

137
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,322
What about Alberto Vasquez?

138
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:39,182
He's safe, but he'd already
given JJ what he was after.

139
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:41,097
- Which was?
- Access codes

140
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:43,229
to the private vault in
Vasquez's penthouse.

141
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,603
Yeah. Well, we went to the vault,

142
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,634
but by the time we got there,

143
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:47,442
it had already been trashed and emptied.

144
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:50,585
This is all that was left.

145
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:52,674
Flash storage from the
vault's security mainframe.

146
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,327
Yeah. Don't get too excited.

147
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,199
- It's totally fried.
- Not to brag,

148
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,767
but totally fried is
kind of my wheelhouse.

149
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:01,004
If I can fix it, I'll be able to extract

150
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,379
the vault's security log.

151
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,862
Finding out what the Deathstrokes stole

152
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:05,488
could help us figure out
what they're planning next.

153
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:07,025
We already know what they're planning.

154
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,572
JJ wants to take over the city.

155
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:09,685
He needs the cash to do it.

156
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:12,302
Well, Vasquez did say the
vault was full of valuables...

157
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:13,545
Jewelry, cash.

158
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:15,860
So we figure out where JJ's
gonna sell, take him out.

159
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:18,799
I know exactly where you'd
go with that kind of product.

160
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,461
You're not the only one
around here with street smarts.

161
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:24,793
Okay. We'll find JJ,
take him out of play.

162
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:28,797
Stay here. Fix that
useless piece of junk,

163
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:32,409
and, you, next time I see your brother,

164
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,846
Don't get in my way.

165
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,281
Harbinger sends her regards.

166
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,577
Oh. This would have come
in handy 10 years ago.

167
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:12,275
Well, it helps to be
married to Lyla Michaels,

168
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:14,059
who is en route even as we speak.

169
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,888
John, I didn't even want
to get you involved in this.

170
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,934
I know, but if what you told me is true,

171
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:21,850
which is that we're
facing the destruction of...

172
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,113
Well, hell, man, pretty much everything,

173
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:26,985
then to me that's the very
definition of all hands on deck.

174
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,031
Check this out.

175
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:32,904
Now this machine is hooked
up to A.R.G.U.S.'s intranet,

176
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:35,865
so we can access all the
information it has on Dr. Wong.

177
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:40,042
You want to tell me what
that face is all about,

178
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:42,305
or are you gonna make me guess?

179
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,960
Laurel. She was right.

180
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:47,092
The Monitor warned me
not to get involved,

181
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,375
and, I don't know, if I'd just found

182
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:51,880
a way to get the Dwarf Star particles

183
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,715
without trying to stop
Tommy's undertaking, then...

184
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:54,778
Oliver, what were you supposed to do,

185
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:55,809
just sit back and let it happen?

186
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,104
I ignored the orders of a cosmic being,

187
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,951
and as a result, I
watched an entire world

188
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:06,024
just disappear, so...

189
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:08,331
I'm just trying not to make
the same mistake twice.

190
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,550
Well, if this cosmic being wanted

191
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,702
someone willing to watch the
mass murder of innocent people,

192
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:17,906
then... he picked the wrong hero.

193
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,183
Shouldn't blame yourself, man.

194
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,373
Well, what about my behavior
over the past 7 years

195
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:24,651
has given you the
impression that I would?

196
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:25,957
- Got him.
- Good.

197
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,525
Dr. Robert Wong, renowned biophysicist.

198
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,092
Won the Nobel Prize in the specialty

199
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,745
of complex proteins and antibodies.

200
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,837
First the Dwarf Star particles,
now a mysterious scientist.

201
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:38,143
Can't the Monitor just
snap his fingers and get both?

202
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,755
Well, he's not the biggest
fan of sharing information.

203
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:43,453
Ok. Looks like Dr. Wong might
not be that easy to find.

204
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:46,151
He's been missing a week.
This is the last-known photo.

205
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,327
Wan Chai university. He's a professor.

206
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,155
That's where we start.

207
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,267
Do this quietly, stay under the radar.

208
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,641
Too late.

209
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:35,462
Agh!

210
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:42,861
Tatsu?

211
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:56,293
You will be safe here.

212
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:59,122
So who were those men, Triad?

213
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:01,167
Shu gang, their rivals.

214
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:03,256
Why are you in Hong Kong?

215
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:04,692
I thought you were
with the Crescent order.

216
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:07,486
I was until I gave Nyssa the Lotus Cure

217
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:09,132
to save your sister,

218
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,437
and they called for my head.

219
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:12,129
So you decided to become a vigilante?

220
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,267
My son died in this city.

221
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,226
No more Akios will die here

222
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:19,316
as long as I'm here to protect them.

223
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:22,928
That explains what I'm doing here.

224
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:25,191
It's all you, man.

225
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:28,455
Right. We're looking for a
scientist named Dr. Robert Wong.

226
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:31,284
- Why?
- There's a crisis coming

227
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:35,419
that quite literally threatens
the entire universe.

228
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,945
A man... something like a man

229
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:42,469
has asked me to help him stop it.

230
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,299
- You mean Mar Novu?
- You've heard of him?

231
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,345
When I was with the Crescent order.

232
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:52,131
A being who transcends universes,

233
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:53,698
a crisis brewing.

234
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:55,395
He believes Dr. Wong
can help him stop it.

235
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,744
And you believe him?

236
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:59,269
I have to.

237
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,879
Then how can I help?

238
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,924
Tatsu, what we're
doing is very dangerous.

239
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:05,405
I... I can't ask you to be involved.

240
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:07,756
You're not asking. I'm offering.

241
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,807
Dr. Wong was seen last
leaving his classroom

242
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:17,374
at Wan Chai university.

243
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,724
That was a week ago.

244
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:22,292
We're trying to figure out
why he would have left town.

245
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:23,989
I don't think he has.

246
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,599
Those pins, they're only worn

247
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,160
by the security wing,

248
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,820
Hong Kong version of the secret police.

249
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:30,387
With a very healthy reputation for

250
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,056
silencing political
enemies of the state.

251
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:34,953
Yeah, but why would they
be going after Dr. Wong?

252
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,307
We need to find out.

253
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,319
Johnny told me you were
about to do something stupid.

254
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,365
He called you all the way
to Hong Kong to follow me?

255
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,804
- How nice.
- He thought you could use some help.

256
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:55,991
Clearly, he was right.

257
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,371
Clearly, he needs to
mind his own business.

258
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:00,634
He said you're
looking for an old friend.

259
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:03,071
Doesn't seem like the
kind who's too friendly.

260
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:05,787
His name is David Chin.
I met him a few years ago

261
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:06,976
through Cayden James.

262
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:08,816
He said he could help
me get back to Earth-2

263
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:11,515
so maybe he still can.

264
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:16,302
Do you have any idea what
you're about to walk into?

265
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:18,131
Nothing that I can't handle myself.

266
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:28,054
You'll need backup.

267
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,625
Hey. What are you doing here?

268
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,540
You can't be in here. What the?

269
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:45,376
What the hell?

270
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,508
I wouldn't.

271
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,989
Hello, David. It's been a while.

272
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,295
Black Siren?

273
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,905
David, I'm gonna need your help,

274
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:55,646
and if you don't help me,

275
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:58,431
then I am gonna hurt
you very, very badly.

276
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:01,478
What do you want?

277
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:04,568
Whoa? Is that an
Interdimensional Extrapolator?

278
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,762
If that's nerd talk for
breach device, then yes,

279
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,398
and I need you to fix it.

280
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,792
That's not really my area of expertise.

281
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,360
Okay, okay.

282
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:16,536
I'll do it.

283
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:19,410
Good. I'm so glad you reconsidered.

284
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,982
So this is, what, like a black market?

285
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:29,462
More or less.

286
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:31,377
If JJ wants to find a buyer,

287
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:33,074
this is where he'll be.

288
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,301
I'll check the back.

289
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,522
See, I still don't get it.

290
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:48,655
Your dad was bronze tiger,
and you turned out okay.

291
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:51,049
I mean, kind of.

292
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,660
Gee. Thanks.

293
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,533
John and Lyla were basically saints.

294
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:59,797
Yeah. Well, they spent all
their time worrying about me.

295
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,451
JJ got shortchanged.

296
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:06,238
Hey. You think JJ turned
out this way because of you?

297
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,719
No. JJ made his own choices.

298
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,577
I know you want to
believe that deep down

299
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,125
there's still some good in him.

300
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,593
There is. Listen.

301
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:15,457
JJ wasn't just my brother, okay?

302
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,596
He was my best friend.

303
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:18,337
That was a long time ago.

304
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,519
Come to have a drink
with me, little bro?

305
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:31,437
- This is over, JJ.
- I don't think so.

306
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,271
- Put down your weapons.
- You first.

307
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,056
Tsk.

308
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,367
Maybe there's a better
way that we can resolve this.

309
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:49,629
No, no, no. We can resolve this

310
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,061
by you coming with us.

311
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:53,241
You know, I wish that I could. I do,

312
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:56,767
I do, but I got business to attend to.

313
00:15:56,768 --> 00:16:00,684
I would settle for a friendly
chat with my brother.

314
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:01,844
What you think?

315
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,281
I think that's never gonna happen.

316
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:08,822
Fine.

317
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:10,821
You want to talk, we'll talk.

318
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,133
That looked like that hurt.

319
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:30,061
Knowing you has changed my life.

320
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:31,803
I love you.

321
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:37,156
We're gonna be fine.

322
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,989
I spoke to contact
on Hong Kong police force.

323
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,819
As soon as I mentioned Dr.
Wong's name, he stopped talking.

324
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,647
- He seemed afraid.
- I think we know why.

325
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:52,316
It seems that Dr. Wong has been working

326
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:54,301
on a top secret project
for the Chinese government.

327
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:56,609
Exactly, which means the security wing

328
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,871
wasn't kidnapping him.

329
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:58,940
It was trying to help him.

330
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,938
- He must be in protective custody.
- Safe house in the Wan Chai district,

331
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,868
but they're planning on moving
him out of the city tonight.

332
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,489
Then we better get moving.

333
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,544
Don't hurt me.

334
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,203
Triad.

335
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:27,422
We can't let them
get away with Dr. Wong.

336
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:30,208
We won't. Go, go, go, go!

337
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:35,214
Out of the way! Out of the way!

338
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:45,224
Welcome back to Hong Kong.

339
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:51,185
Hyah! Hyah!

340
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:52,797
Hyah! Hyah!

341
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:01,369
Agh! Ugh!

342
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,589
- Hyah!
- Unh!

343
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,770
Gah!

344
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,129
- It's gas.
- Got to get these people out of here.

345
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:29,860
We can't lose the doctor.

346
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:47,164
No sign of Dr. Wong.

347
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:49,732
Triad must have taken
him deep underground.

348
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:52,125
I thought China White
was in A.R.G.U.S. custody.

349
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:55,065
Yeah. Well, so did I, and as
far as I know, Lyla did, too.

350
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:58,099
Well, our situation just got
a whole lot more complicated.

351
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,482
You seemed ready to let
those people die back there.

352
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,484
I knew you had it handled,

353
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:04,703
and you knew that Dr.
Wong was the priority.

354
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:07,619
You sound like someone I used to know...

355
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,708
You 9 years ago,

356
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,261
single-minded about your mission.

357
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:12,885
Tatsu, with due respect, if you had seen

358
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,105
what I have seen, you would understand.

359
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:18,064
The Monitor is our best
chance at preventing it

360
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:19,257
from happening again.

361
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,025
I've seen that blind faith
in you before, as well,

362
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:23,432
with Amanda Waller.

363
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,550
That wasn't blind faith.

364
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:29,032
She threatened my family, Tatsu.

365
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:32,644
Right now, the stakes are
every family in existence.

366
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:34,777
Guys, I really hate to interrupt this,

367
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:36,692
but none of this matters
if we don't find

368
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,868
this missing scientist, right?

369
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:41,218
Why does the Triad want him?

370
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:42,559
His work does not seem harmful.

371
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,976
Yeah? Well, innocent men don't work

372
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,219
on secret government projects.

373
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,419
We need to know what this project is.

374
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,685
Then we'll know why
the Triad is after him.

375
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,581
I don't like this.

376
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:57,888
He's stalling.

377
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:05,721
Hey. Hey!

378
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:07,549
What's taking so long?

379
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,682
- It's done.
- Great.

380
00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:13,598
So you won't mind if we test it out.

381
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:20,779
It isn't working.

382
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,044
Well, it should be.

383
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:23,809
Then where's the portal?

384
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,265
You want to go to Earth-37, Earth-14?

385
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,572
I want to go to Earth-2.

386
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:33,662
Earth-2...

387
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,186
is gone.

388
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:39,364
It registered at first, but now
I see that it's like a shadow.

389
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:45,412
There's no sign of life.

390
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:47,154
That doesn't make any sense.

391
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:55,074
You're lying. Fix it! Fix it!

392
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,772
I'm telling you I did.

393
00:20:56,773 --> 00:20:58,251
I can fix tech. I can't bring back

394
00:20:58,252 --> 00:20:59,645
a whole friggin' universe!

395
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:05,345
I'm so sorry, Laurel...

396
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,739
But they're gone.

397
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,618
Let's get out of here.

398
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,707
Laurel!

399
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,883
Now!

400
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:24,364
There's nothing in
any governmental databases

401
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,628
about the project Dr.
Wong was working on.

402
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:28,891
- So we're back to square one?
- No, not exactly.

403
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:31,110
An A.R.G.U.S. mole led
me to a paper trail,

404
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,038
some equipment that Dr. Wong purchased.

405
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,854
- He shipped it to this address.
- Well, it's his lab. It has to be.

406
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:38,055
- We need to get in there.
- That may not be so easy.

407
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:40,946
I know this place. It's a PLA Garrison.

408
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:42,731
Oh. Those Garrisons have a reputation

409
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:44,123
for being almost impenetrable.

410
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:45,951
Almost but not quite.

411
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:51,043
There are certain vulnerabilities.

412
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,871
Yeah. Well, even if we
could get in that place,

413
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:54,394
it's gonna be heavily fortified.

414
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:56,788
That's never stopped us before.

415
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,604
Ow.

416
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,563
I'm almost at the sublevel.

417
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:34,826
The elevator will take
you straight to the lab.

418
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:37,437
Most likely will be guarded.

419
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:38,613
Hyah!

420
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:40,440
Unh!

421
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:41,790
All right. I've definitely been made.

422
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,618
You only have a few minutes.

423
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,494
I'm starting the upload.

424
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,851
What? What is it?

425
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:03,333
I know what the Triad is after.

426
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,987
Dr. Wong has been trying to re-create

427
00:23:04,988 --> 00:23:06,642
the Alpha/Omega virus.

428
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,909
He's not trying. He's already done it.

429
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:21,210
After what happened
last time, you'd think

430
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:22,801
the Chinese government would
have learned its lesson.

431
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,957
The Alpha/Omega is a powerful weapon.

432
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,591
Yeah, and the Triad
could already have it.

433
00:23:26,592 --> 00:23:28,965
If they had it, they wouldn't
have any need for Dr. Wong.

434
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:31,116
It's just a matter of time
before they make him re-create it.

435
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:33,835
Which means, Oliver, that
we have a ticking clock

436
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:36,621
and absolutely no plan.

437
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,927
- We have this.
- You stole the virus?

438
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:40,538
This is what China White wants,

439
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:41,800
this is what I'm gonna give her.

440
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,955
Oliver, you more than anyone
else knows how dangerous this is.

441
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,932
Which is why I'm not actually
gonna give her the virus.

442
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,651
We're using this as
bait to draw her out.

443
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:49,633
My husband tried this
gambit once already,

444
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:52,767
and you're the one who
told him he made a mistake.

445
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:54,247
This is different.

446
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:55,901
Maseo had every intention

447
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,946
of actually giving the
virus to China White.

448
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:00,035
- I don't.
- It's too risky.

449
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:02,995
It's riskier to do nothing.

450
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:05,954
If anyone has a better idea,

451
00:24:05,955 --> 00:24:07,391
I'm all ears.

452
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:15,269
I'll start making arrangements.

453
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:35,225
Here. It'll help with the swelling.

454
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:36,540
I don't have anyone here

455
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,732
who cares if I come home
with bruised knuckles.

456
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,600
I'm here. I care.

457
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:48,127
You barely even know me.

458
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,738
I know what it's like to lose people.

459
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,481
Do you know what it's like
to lose an entire universe?

460
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:57,397
No.

461
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,227
Then you don't know how I feel.

462
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:03,882
You didn't know them.

463
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:09,888
My sister, Adrian, they're my family,

464
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:13,979
they're... they're good people.

465
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,764
They don't deserve to be gone.

466
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:21,290
To think that I'm the one
who's done such awful things.

467
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,641
But you're trying to be better.

468
00:25:23,642 --> 00:25:26,034
Everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

469
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:28,385
Well, then maybe this
is where I deserve to be.

470
00:25:30,518 --> 00:25:34,086
When I was in Afghanistan,

471
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:35,914
my unit got sent out on patrol

472
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:38,090
on a day I drew base duty.

473
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:39,831
It was a routine op.

474
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:42,703
We'd done it a hundred times before.

475
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Only this time, there
was an IED in the road.

476
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:52,061
None of them made it back.

477
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:57,587
I used to lie in bed at night

478
00:25:57,588 --> 00:26:00,503
asking myself

479
00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:02,810
"why them?

480
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,944
Why not me?"

481
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:08,598
And I made every deal I could think of

482
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,123
with any god I thought might listen.

483
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:12,778
And did it work?

484
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,956
Not exactly.

485
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:22,134
So you're right.

486
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:24,919
I don't know what you're going through,

487
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,444
but I do know something
about survivor's guilt.

488
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:30,404
Does it get any easier?

489
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:34,494
No.

490
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:36,149
All we can do is try and move forward.

491
00:26:40,022 --> 00:26:43,895
How am I supposed to move forward

492
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,159
when everyone I've ever loved is gone?

493
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,771
By not giving up.

494
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,295
By doing the right thing.

495
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:57,518
We honor the dead by
fighting for the living.

496
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,915
This world needs you, too.

497
00:27:23,152 --> 00:27:24,979
You're not talking me out of this.

498
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,851
- I know.
- Trust me, Tatsu.

499
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:29,984
I will not let China
White get the virus.

500
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:33,553
- And what if you fail?
- I'm not gonna fail.

501
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:37,513
9 years ago, you failed
to stop the virus,

502
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:38,863
and my son died.

503
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:40,342
And I regret it every day.

504
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:42,170
You must remember it

505
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:43,824
because of what happened after.

506
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,521
I tortured General Shrieve.

507
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:48,960
Your grief, your anger,
your guilt over the failure,

508
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,442
it stole your humanity.

509
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:52,615
This is different. I'm not angry.

510
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:55,227
I'm simply doing what has to be done.

511
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:57,011
How do you know that?

512
00:27:57,012 --> 00:27:59,448
It is said that Mar Novu believes
order comes through chaos.

513
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:01,233
So he's bringing us order?

514
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:02,974
But first maybe chaos.

515
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,976
He's asking you to bring him a man

516
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,935
who re-created a deadly virus. Why?

517
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,590
How do you know he won't use it
for something worse than the Triad?

518
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,374
I don't know,

519
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,812
but I have to believe him.

520
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,509
I have no other choice.

521
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,511
Even if that is true,

522
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:22,602
he does not seem to care
who he hurts along the way.

523
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:26,171
Sometimes, the mission
is not worth the cost.

524
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:29,043
You know that,

525
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:32,046
so why are you still doing what he asks?

526
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:36,050
Because if I'm wrong...

527
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:39,575
If I'm wrong, then all
of this is for nothing.

528
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:41,097
Do you understand, Tatsu?

529
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:44,058
I left Felicity.

530
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:46,626
I left my children,

531
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:49,585
so if... if... if the... if
the Monitor can't fix this

532
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:51,457
and if he is not here to help,

533
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,415
then all of these things
that I've sacrificed

534
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,027
and all the things that
so many other people

535
00:28:56,028 --> 00:29:00,553
have already sacrificed
will have been for nothing.

536
00:29:00,554 --> 00:29:04,949
I need my family to live,

537
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,344
which means that I need this to work.

538
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:11,433
You're risking too much.

539
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:12,670
There's no other choice.

540
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:14,716
There's always another choice.

541
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:30,888
You seem stressed. Relax.

542
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:34,065
Look. You said you wanted to talk,

543
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,501
so talk.

544
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:38,289
Still can't believe that you
decided to become a vigilante.

545
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,985
You know you always have
a place here with us.

546
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:42,464
You do have the Mark.

547
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:43,623
You know why I got it.

548
00:29:43,624 --> 00:29:46,033
That's right. You
and Dad's brilliant plan

549
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,687
to save me from the dark side.

550
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:50,298
I got it because I
wanted my brother back.

551
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,692
You remember when I was
in middle school, huh?

552
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:54,650
Remember when those guys tried
to get me to run their drugs?

553
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:57,001
Not really in the mood for
a trip down memory lane, Con.

554
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:59,469
When you found out, you were the one

555
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,135
that told me that I
was better than that.

556
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:02,585
Yeah. My favorite part of that story

557
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:04,922
is when you didn't listen

558
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:07,576
and I got grounded.

559
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:11,189
Dad held me responsible.

560
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,321
You want to hate me?

561
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:15,584
You want to hate Dad? Fine. Okay.

562
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,499
That... that's fair.

563
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,111
Don't throw your
life away because of it.

564
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,113
When I look at you, I still see

565
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:25,159
the kid who'd take on
somebody twice his size

566
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,836
just because he was messing with me.

567
00:30:26,837 --> 00:30:28,423
Yeah. I'm not that kid anymore, Con.

568
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:29,903
Yes, you are,

569
00:30:29,904 --> 00:30:31,513
and you can try... you can try

570
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,689
to snuff it out, to
cover it up with a mask,

571
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,431
but I know who you are,

572
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:39,130
and it's not too late.

573
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:43,048
And we can fix this... together.

574
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,105
You're late. I thought perhaps
you changed your mind.

575
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,064
Deal's a deal.

576
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,587
Thank you for meeting me.

577
00:31:01,588 --> 00:31:02,981
Anything for a friend.

578
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,106
Now I have the virus.

579
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:11,069
- Where's Dr. Wong?
- He's nearby.

580
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,377
I was surprised when I got your call.

581
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:15,639
Well, I'm surprised that
you're not in an A.R.G.U.S. prison.

582
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,206
Well, apparently the
government doesn't like

583
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:20,035
when agents put bombs in people's necks.

584
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:22,559
You know what else they
don't like? Bad press.

585
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,039
So they bought your silence.

586
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,649
It's a shame your friend Mr. Diggle

587
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,564
had to lose his job over it.

588
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:28,958
I assume he's here, too.

589
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,177
Perimeter's clean.

590
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:33,876
Tatsu, any sign of Dr. Wong?

591
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:37,139
Not yet.

592
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,271
I don't think he's here.

593
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,013
Wait. Someone's coming.

594
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:46,061
Oliver, keep her talking.

595
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:47,759
You and I...

596
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:52,589
We have been enemies
since the very beginning,

597
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,547
but there's something coming.

598
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:56,245
It's bigger than us.

599
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,987
It is something that threatens

600
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:01,946
our entire Earth.

601
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:03,034
Let me see him.

602
00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:04,819
Give me the case.

603
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:15,699
Tatsu, we have to move now.

604
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,484
I see him. I'm going in.

605
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:22,793
Wait. He's wearing some kind of vest.

606
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:24,360
It looks like explosives.

607
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,231
China White must have a detonator.

608
00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:28,974
It's real.

609
00:32:33,193 --> 00:32:34,593
_

610
00:32:35,894 --> 00:32:40,245
That vest is not part of the agreement.

611
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:42,552
I had to be sure you weren't
gonna do anything stupid.

612
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:46,251
I'll deactivate it once
I'm safe in the car.

613
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:48,297
Until next time, Mr. Queen.

614
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:51,517
There's not gonna be a next time.

615
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:52,693
Now.

616
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:56,044
Hyah!

617
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,400
_

618
00:33:06,142 --> 00:33:08,618
Damn it! I'm going after the virus!

619
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:36,823
Chien Na Wei.

620
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:39,000
Tatsu Yamashiro.

621
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:41,501
You really think this will
go better than the last time?

622
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,681
I have Dr. Wong.

623
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,210
Hi, honey.

624
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:16,516
Virus is secure.

625
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,539
I can't remove the
vest without triggering it.

626
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,325
We need that detonator.

627
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,465
Unh!

628
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,080
The detonator.

629
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,217
You better kill me now.

630
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:09,656
I have the detonator.

631
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,232
Tatsu?

632
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:32,897
Unh.

633
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:46,650
Looks like I'm not the only
one who needed backup.

634
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:02,951
Tatsu's resting in the infirmary.

635
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,649
She'll be in pain for a few
days, but she'll be fine.

636
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,216
She would have been dead

637
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:08,391
if you hadn't have come back

638
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:09,653
and fought with us.

639
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:11,960
I don't know if I'll ever
get over what happened

640
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,950
on Earth-2, but I'll help you

641
00:36:14,951 --> 00:36:16,660
make sure it never happens again.

642
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:18,532
Well, at least we
accomplished our objective.

643
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:20,328
- How's Dr. Wong?
- He's fine.

644
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:22,405
In a secure location.

645
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:23,937
The virus is, too.

646
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:25,514
And so what... what, do we text

647
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:27,149
the Monitor or whatever,
letting him know

648
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,628
- we have his guy?
- Don't think he texts.

649
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:32,198
I don't want to hand
over Dr. Wong just yet.

650
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:34,287
I want answers, and if he is not

651
00:36:34,288 --> 00:36:35,347
gonna give them to me,

652
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:36,838
I'm gonna find them somewhere else.

653
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:37,888
Oliver, what are you talking about?

654
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:43,426
Tatsu... she told me that I had to be

655
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:46,778
absolutely sure that I was
making the right choice.

656
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:51,522
She almost died, John.

657
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,265
A lot of people have died already

658
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:59,137
for the sake of this mission.

659
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:00,791
I owe it to all of them to find out

660
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,837
who the Monitor really is.

661
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,666
And, Oliver, what if we don't
like the answers to those questions?

662
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,015
What do we do then?

663
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,583
We find another way to stop it.

664
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:14,327
There's always another way.

665
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:17,634
Oliver, so what's the plan?

666
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,637
I need to apologize to
a friend of mine first.

667
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:29,211
So... what do you say?

668
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:31,258
How about you and me leave together?

669
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,523
It was a nice speech, but once again,

670
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:39,917
you have managed to make
everything about you.

671
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:42,659
This isn't about you or Dad.

672
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,401
Yeah. You both have this misguided idea

673
00:37:45,402 --> 00:37:50,406
about duty and family, civic pride.

674
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:54,584
You fail to see the bigger picture.

675
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:55,933
I have vision.

676
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:58,893
What are you talking about?

677
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:01,134
Did you really not think that
I knew you'd show up here?

678
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:09,513
Yes. Worthless piece of junk, my ass.

679
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:13,386
What the hell did the
Deathstrokes want with this?

680
00:38:13,387 --> 00:38:15,398
What did you do?

681
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,440
What did you do?!

682
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,292
Oh. Hey, hey. I knew that you thought

683
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:21,176
that I'd be after the
valuables in Vasquez's safe

684
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:23,787
and that Zoe would lead you here,

685
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:26,660
the one shady trading post
that she knows about, right?

686
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:28,444
You were never after the money.

687
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:31,318
Why cripple the system when
you can rip its heart out?

688
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,143
Oh, my god.

689
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:39,716
Once the unification movement is gone,

690
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,676
the power vacuum is ours to fill.

691
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:44,547
I think we're done here.

692
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:46,502
- Not even close.
- You are not gonna touch me.

693
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:47,622
Oh, yeah? And why is that?

694
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:49,639
Because if you do,

695
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,554
the men who are storming
your bunker right now

696
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:53,340
will kill your brother.

697
00:39:03,437 --> 00:39:05,046
William?

698
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:08,616
William, do you copy?

699
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:11,992
Like I said, I think we're done here.

700
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:17,014
If you hurt my brother,
I swear I will kill you.

701
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:20,801
JJ... please.

702
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,456
You were wrong about me, brother.

703
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:27,199
It was never a mask.

704
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:44,607
Think the doctors would have
preferred you stay in the hospital.

705
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:46,697
I have survived worse.

706
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:50,309
Brought you something.

707
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:57,272
- Herbs.
- There's a rumor going around

708
00:39:57,273 --> 00:40:00,057
they help with healing.

709
00:40:00,058 --> 00:40:02,016
I have seen many battles.

710
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:04,410
For a moment, I believed

711
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:07,456
this was my last.

712
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:11,547
I saw Akio and Maseo,

713
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:15,159
but... this was not my time.

714
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,293
Tatsu, you almost died because of me.

715
00:40:20,122 --> 00:40:21,428
I'm sorry.

716
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:27,607
Well, you were right when you said that

717
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:31,611
some missions aren't worth the cost,

718
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:34,352
so I'm gonna make sure that this one is.

719
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:37,051
So where will you go?

720
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:41,403
You heard a rumor about the
Monitor and a coming crisis?

721
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:42,694
I doubt the Crescent order

722
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:44,624
will have the answers you seek.

723
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:48,541
Thankfully, there are
organizations on this Earth

724
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:53,023
far, far older than the Crescent order.

725
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:54,504
I'm going to Nanda Parbat.

726
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:11,521
You should have told me what
was going to happen on Earth-2.

727
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:20,442
John was there. He
could have been killed.

728
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:23,401
The destruction of that Earth
was a necessary sacrifice.

729
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:25,795
And what about Laurel Lance?

730
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:27,623
Her friends, her family...

731
00:41:27,624 --> 00:41:29,669
Countless more like them will perish

732
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,193
if we do not ensure that
Oliver Queen is prepared

733
00:41:32,194 --> 00:41:35,283
for what is coming.

734
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,285
Were you successful?

735
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:41,594
Yes. I have Dr. Wong.

736
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:43,248
Then let us proceed.
