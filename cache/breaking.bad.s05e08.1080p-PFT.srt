No. I stayed off

exponentially.

Did you know there's
a higher demand for meth there

127

They're professional

I'm very careful
who I work with.

159

And if this is
such a slam dunk,

160
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:28,698
then why didn't you
pitch it to Fring?

161
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:30,199
I did.
He said yes.

00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,360
Oh, my God!
Look at her go!

330
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:52,861
Good job!

331
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:54,697
[Walter, Jr.] - Peekaboo. This way.
[Skyler] - Good job!

332
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,348
Here. Let's go see your brother.
Let's get him.

333
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,350
- Get him!
- Where'd you go?

334
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:00,352
I can't see you.
Where'd you go?

335
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,489
There you are!
[Chuckling] [Laughing]

336
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:06,525
You're really good with her.
[Coughing]

337
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:08,244
Come here, my baby girl.

338
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:11,413
You're gonna be a handful,
aren't you? Yeah.

339
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:14,500
Mama's gonna get her exercise.
Aw. [Cooing]

340
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:17,303
[Cooing continues] [Sighs]

341
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:20,372
Hey, do you, uh-- You wanna watch a movie?
[Phone ringing]

342
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,259
Hey, Louis.

343
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,876
Uh...
[Clears throat]

344
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:26,545
One moment.

345
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,314
Uh, nothing.

346
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:30,683
[Chuckles] What's up?

347
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:32,401
[Sighs]

348
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:37,273
Oh, well.

349
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:40,326
[Sighs]

350
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,860
[Chuckles]

351
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:46,582
It's nice to see you
smile again.

352
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:49,752
I mean, you seem good.

353
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,205
Yeah.
I'm hanging in there.

354
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,576
To see you laugh
like that just now...

355
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,980
It's such an improvement,
don't you think?

356
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:06,518
I don't--
I don't really...

357
00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:08,554
[Stammers]

358
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:13,626
We've been thinking,

359
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,096
Hank and I, that...

360
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,949
it may be time
to take the kids home.

361
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:26,288
It's been almost
three months, right?

362
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:29,241
Almost three?

363
00:29:29,275 --> 00:29:30,626
Um...

364
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,830
D-does Hank not want--

365
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:37,800
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, God. No. No.

366
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:40,919
Hank's crazy for these kids.
You know that.

367
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,455
It goes without saying,
we love having them.

368
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:45,391
And we're always here for you

369
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:49,261
and wanna help you
any way that we can.

370
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:51,230
But...

371
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,352
We're starting to worry

372
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,271
that maybe...

373
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:03,975
Maybe we're enabling you.

374
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:10,982
Sweetie, you've had
a lot on your plate,

375
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,087
and you and Walt
have had a lot--

376
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:19,007
so much to contend with.

377
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:22,845
And I'm so proud of you for going to
therapy, by the way. You know that, right?

378
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:25,297
It can be so helpful,
such a good tool.

379
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:29,385
And I'm very,
very proud of you,

380
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,220
but I--

381
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:33,272
We...

382
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:38,360
Maybe at this point,

383
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:40,312
the best way

384
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:42,614
to help repair the family

385
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:46,285
would be to repair the family,

386
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,820
you know?

387
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:26,909
[Crickets chirping]

388
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,395
[Water lapping softly]

389
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:58,607
Take a drive with me.

390
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,134
Walt.

391
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:50,158
This is it.

392
00:32:51,911 --> 00:32:55,146
This is what
you've been working for.

393
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,835
I rented this place,
and I started bringing it here,

394
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,837
because...

395
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:05,541
I didn't know what else to do.

396
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:08,260
I gave up counting it.
I mean, I had to.

397
00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:10,512
It was just so much, so fast.

398
00:33:10,547 --> 00:33:14,216
I-- I tried
weighing it.

399
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:16,668
I figured one bill

400
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:19,170
of any denomination
weighs a gram.

401
00:33:19,188 --> 00:33:21,857
There are 454 grams to a pound,

402
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:24,843
but...
[Exhales forcefully]

403
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:30,032
there's a variety
of denominations,

404
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:31,850
so...

405
00:33:33,486 --> 00:33:35,737
How much is this?

406
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:40,042
I have no earthly idea.

407
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:43,662
I truly don't.

408
00:33:44,664 --> 00:33:47,499
I just stack it up,
keep it dry,

409
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,885
spray it for silverfish.

410
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:54,923
There is more money here

411
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:58,010
than we could spend
in ten lifetimes.

412
00:33:58,044 --> 00:34:00,512
I certainly can't launder it,

413
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:03,214
not with 100 car washes.

414

have to be?

Hey.

Um, I--

433
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:31,390
I hope I'm not
disturbing you or anything.

434
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,891
I tried calling,
but, uh--

435
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:35,561
Yeah. No, I, uh,
tossed all my burners.

436
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:38,530
Oh. And you didn't answer
your home line, so--

00:36:38,565 --> 00:36:40,482
It's disconnected.

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,989

00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:49,325
Uh, no.

441
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:54,463
So, what's up?

442
00:36:54,497 --> 00:36:57,466
I was just in the neighborhood,

443
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,420
so I thought I'd drop by
and say hello.

444
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:09,211
You, uh, wanna come in, or...

445
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,213
Uh, sure.

446
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,731
Thanks.

a beer or something, but--

wind up moving, I see.

Didn't have to.

You aren't either,
so there you go.

no other option, Jesse.

exactly?

[Chuckles]

462
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,618
It's funny. I...

463
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,588
I saw a Bounder the other day.

464
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:28,891
- Bounder?
- Yeah.

465
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:31,226

A Bounder?

466
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:33,929
Oh. Oh.

467
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:36,932
Oh, you saw
the same one as ours?

468
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:40,269
Yeah. Well, within a
couple years, I guess.

469
00:38:40,303 --> 00:38:41,603
Early '80s.

470
00:38:41,637 --> 00:38:43,605
It was certainly in
a lot better shape

471
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,157
than our old hunk of junk.

472
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:48,444
A much nicer paint job.

473

No bullet holes in the door.

474
00:38:51,614 --> 00:38:54,700
Yeah. That thing
was a nightmare, huh?

475
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:58,036
Oh, it was primitive.

476
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,372
You know, whenever
I hit a red light,

477
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:03,008
I used to pray

478
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,794
it wouldn't crap out on me.

479
00:39:05,828 --> 00:39:07,296
Yeah.

480
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:10,999
And then, suddenly,
it would sometimes have that--

481
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,352
that screeching sound that
just-- out of the blue,

482
00:39:13,386 --> 00:39:15,304
like we hit a pack of cats.

That's what that was.

484
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:20,809
I always had this--

485
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:22,895
this whole system--

486
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,731
strategy-- to not let
it idle too low.

487
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:28,350
Remember that time we ran out
of gas coming back from a cook?

488
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:31,353
Ah, the gauge.
The gauge always said half-full, so...

489
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,039
Yeah, you had to walk three
miles with a jerry can

490
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,041
while I waited
on the side of the road,

491
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:39,378
praying the whole time
that no cop would show up,

492
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:41,046
no good samaritan.

493
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,915
God.

494
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,416
We had money.

495
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,835
Why'd we keep it?

496
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:49,805
Why did we have to have
the world's shittiest RV?

497
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,558
- Inertia?
- Yeah.

498
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,427
Yeah.

499
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,479
Inertia.

500
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:14,279
So, hey, um, you know,
I gotta get going.

501
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,698
- Yeah. No, me too. - I'm just
meeting up with some friends, and--

502
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:19,084
I gotta get going as well.

503
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:26,758
I left something for you.

Hey.

00:42:16,235 --> 00:42:18,370
I'm out.

512
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:26,995
I'm out.

513
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:17,512
[Marie] With some big earrings,
it could be really nice.

514
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:20,766
Perhaps some big hoops.
I feel like I just want

515
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,934
to mix it up
with my hair this summer.

516
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,270
- You know, like color...
[Hank] - Yeah. I don't know.

517
00:43:25,304 --> 00:43:27,773
[Walt] Did you have a coin collection?
I had coins.

518
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:30,609
...have the time
to do hobbies.

519
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:33,762
Coins and baseball cards.
Those were the ones.

520
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,231
You can play around with it
and take them in and out...

521
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:38,150
Not enough hours
in the day, right?

522
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:40,986
- Not enough hours...
[Marie] - My hairstylist told me

523
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:43,155
to take prenatal vitamins.

524
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:44,706
For your hair?

525
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:47,325
He said they work,
so I figure why not?

526
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:49,277
Oh, uh, Flynn,

527
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,463
could you put some more
sunscreen on Holly?

528
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:53,415
Yeah.
Is it over there?

529
00:43:53,449 --> 00:43:55,000
- Yeah, it's right here.
- Okay.

530
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,885
...for a home brew,
though.

531
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:58,887
Papa-free.
That's good.

532
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:02,090
- Although I don't know why it would be bad.
- Yeah. I know. Me neither.

533
00:44:02,124 --> 00:44:04,843
Oh, do you-- I used to squeeze
lemon juice in my hair.

534
00:44:04,894 --> 00:44:06,178
You remember that?

535
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:09,514
You wanted to be
a beach bum so badly.

536
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:11,016
- I did.
- Ohh.

537
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:13,902
You and your stiff hair.
[Groaning]

538
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:17,572
- Stiff what?
- Hey, hey.

539
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:19,974
I was interested
to see you get into that.

540
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:22,694
- Borage oil is supposed to be good.
- It's like chemistry.

541
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:24,946
- Is it really? Better than flaxseed?
- I don't know.

542
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,865
That's cool.
I like your style.

543
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:29,284
There is no Christmas.
There is no Christmas...

544
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:30,919
Maybe I should brew up a batch.

545
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:32,487
- What do you think?
- Ooh, Schraderbrau?

546
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:33,839
- Yeah.
- I vote yes.

547
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:35,123
I second that.

548
00:44:35,157 --> 00:44:36,675
Well, there you go.
It's unanimous.

549
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:38,176
Well, who am I to fly

550
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:40,796
in the face of public demand, right?

551

[Chuckling]

552
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,853
All right. Hold on.
[Grunts]

553

Anybody, uh-- anybody want anything?
Want anything?

554
00:44:50,556 --> 00:44:52,307
No, I'm good.
I'm good, thank you.

555
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:53,975
All right.

556
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:56,177
Does it look glossier?

557
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:58,530
- Do I have a halo?
- I don't know.

558
00:44:58,564 --> 00:45:01,182
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

559
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,568
- I used to have that halo.
- Yeah.
