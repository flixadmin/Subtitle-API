1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,610
Previously, on "Arrow"
and "Flash"...

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,060
Thanks, mister.
Yeah.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,790
Barry said that
you need our help.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,520
Somebody very dangerous
is after you.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,430
Give her to me and I'll
make your death fast.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,800
The man you're looking for
is vandal savage.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,600
An immortal.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,430
Chay-ara,
it's me, khufu.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,210
We're drawn to each
other in each life,

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,870
and after we die,
we reincarnate.

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,330
Do you know who
vandal savage is?

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,140
In every lifetime,
he hunts us down.

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,870
We think he's trying
to locate the staff of horus.

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,680
[Grunting]

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,410
I'm never going to become who
I really am unless I let go.

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,890
No!

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,030
Chay-ara.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,710
Price khufu, my son.

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,640
What have you come to offer?

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,240
Father, we bring this tribute

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,110
to the protector to all
we see and know, horus.

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,610
Praise be upon him.

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,290
It is a fine offering, khufu.

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,040
At least worthy of a god.

25
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,110
And yet,
priestess chay-ara

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,650
does not seem to agree.

27
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,430
Your offering is
lovely, my prince.

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,430
If not a bit naive.

29
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,500
[Scoffs] Naive?

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
To think that horus
would be appeased by...

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,960
Trifles.

32
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,540
The portents of his
dissatisfaction

33
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,440
grow with each passing day.

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,010
The celestial
rocks used to fall
once a generation;

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,180
now they strike
with each phase
of the moon.

36
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,350
I thought it was your job
to keep horus in a good mood...

37
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,650
Priestess.

38
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,490
Priestess chay-ara
only speaks out
of concern for all.

39
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,560
Otherwise, she would
remain a bit more...

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,320
Polite.

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,790
We have warned you time
and again of the sky rocks

42
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,090
and the threat
they pose to the court

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,370
of ramses the wise.
Dark times are
coming, my pharaoh.

44
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,010
Prayers and trifles will
not be enough to stop it.

45
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,000
Priestess.

46
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,980
You spoke with quite
the tongue in there.

47
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,010
Did I overact?

48
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,110
No. I love your tongue.

49
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,920
You ok?

50
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,660
Yeah, I'm fine,
I just have a headache.

51
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,920
Are you sure?
Usually
that's a sign

52
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,490
of your memories returning.

53
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,330
Yeah, I'm sure.

54
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,140
I can't remember anything yet.

55
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,240
A bunch of superheroes
in a farmhouse?

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,270
I feel like I've seen that
in a movie before.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,020
We need a secure location.

58
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,550
What's wrong
with s.T.A.R. Labs?

59
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,250
Well, I mean,
absolutely nothing
if you forget about

60
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,780
the revolving door
you guys installed

61
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,520
so the bad guys
can come and go
as they please.

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Remind me again
what happened
to your old lair,

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
or the one before that.

64
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,220
Well, lair number
one was compromised
by the police,

65
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,830
and...

66
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,130
I will stop helping.

67
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,900
Savage only let Barry and I live

68
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,640
because he felt Kendra
start to emerge as hawkgirl
and went after her.

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,700
He can sense
her and Carter's
presence.

70
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,100
We don't need
to make it
easier on him

71
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,330
by staying in the city limits.

72
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,540
Bet you wish you were
staying at your mother's
place now.

73
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,830
We need to find a way

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,640
to neutralize
savage's advantage.

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,440
Barry, you're late.

76
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,150
Sorry. It turns out,
it's not easy finding
the ass end of nowhere.

77
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,280
Yeah, for real.
The roaming charges alone

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,440
are going to bankrupt me.

79
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,150
We're discussing
how to take away

80
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,180
savage's newfound power.
And his magic stick thing.

81
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,720
Yeah, staff of horus.

82
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
Well, it's protected
by some kind
of energy field.

83
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,220
I couldn't lay a finger on it.

84
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,830
Maybe you wear
mittens next time.

85
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,960
What if we made some sort
of insulated gauntlets...

86
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,020
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the magnetic shielding
could disrupt the...

87
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,260
the staff's magnetic polarity.

88
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,870
Well, while
the geek squad works...

89
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,370
heard that, honey.

90
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,870
While they work to get
the staff away from savage,

91
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,570
we need to know everything
there is to know about him.

92
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,740
Well, I googled
reincarnated
nut jobs

93
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,340
and came up with nothing.

94
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,250
Kendra and I would
be the reincarnated
nut jobs.

95
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,850
Savage is merely immortal.

96
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,190
Merely?
Welcome to the new normal.

97
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,160
Anyone who's been
around for 4,000 years
should leave a trail.

98
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,910
I'll check with
a.R.G.U.S., see if they
have anything on him.

99
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,180
Laurel and I can
check police reports
and stuff like that.

100
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,920
Good. We need
to find a way
to utilize

101
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,530
your new ability.
My ability?

102
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,430
It might give us an advantage.

103
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,130
Yeah, whatever you do,
don't let him train you.

104
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm sorry, but when it rains,

105
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,370
I can still feel
where he shot me
with those arrows.

106
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,610
I'll handle her training, then.
Yeah.

107
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,060
Oliver.

108
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,570
Uh, I need to run
something down.

109
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,070
I'll be back as soon as I can.

110
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,750
And what exactly
are you running down?

111
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,620
Don't worry,
it's nothing
dangerous.

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,150
Well, are you ok?

113
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,120
Well, we're up
against an
immortal mad man

114
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,550
armed with a magical staff,

115
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,080
so I do have a few
things on my mind.

116
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,890
Yeah, but you were
acting fine with everything

117
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,490
while we were home,

118
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,190
and now that we're here
in central city,

119
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,490
you've just been not... You.

120
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,770
Well, maybe it's too
bright and sunny
for me here.

121
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,270
There is something going on,

122
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,640
and I am going
to tell you
all about it.

123
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,180
I would just like
the chance to know what
I'm dealing with first.

124
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,450
Ok.
Ok.

125
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,610
Hey!

126
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,140
You must be going
through a lot right now.

127
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,180
Yeah. You know,
we should talk.

128
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,610
Never in the history
of romance have those words
ever meant anything good.

129
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,620
I just mean we
should probably talk

130
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,150
about everything
that's happened...

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,630
that's happening.
You know what,

132
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,230
I'm going to suggest
something radical here

133
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,230
and say let's not talk.

134
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,030
Look, you've got a lot
on your plate right now.

135
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,760
And I just don't want
to be that piece
of very nutritious broccoli

136
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,970
that you scrape off the plate
to give to the dog.

137
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,040
My point being,

138
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,540
I don't think you can afford

139
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,570
to be distracted right now.

140
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,830
Let's go.

141
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,970
Yes.

142
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,510
Let's.

143
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,740
Sorry, buddy, this is private.

144
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,950
Private?

145
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,750
Yep.

146
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,760
I'm just going
to go do some
push-ups over there.

147
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,950
Open it.

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,500
Why? What's inside?

149
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,770
Something we have
to track down in each
of our incarnations.

150
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,970
Sometimes I find it;
Sometimes you find me

151
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,400
and we go look for it together.

152
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,730
4,000 years, 206 lives.

153
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,580
We've seen about every
combination there is.

154
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,680
I don't think I'm really...

155
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,890
both: Ready for this.

156
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,660
You say that in every lifetime.

157
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,790
Look, as you emerge,
as your memories
come back to you,

158
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,390
so will other things.

159
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,570

[Scoffs]
This is nuts.

163
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,540
It's ok.
I'll help you through it.

164
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,410
Yeah, well, the last
time you helped me,

165
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,180
I got pushed off a building.

166
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,880
Yes, and after that,
you, uh, you soared,

167
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,980
if I remember correctly.

168
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,080
And that is because anger, fear,

169
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,580
adrenaline... those
are the things

170
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,410
that bring out
the warrior within.

171
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,290
Well, according to savage,
I'm a priestess.

172
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,250
The clergy were warriors.

173
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,550
Warrior priests,

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,160
and that is
the side that you
need to remember.

175
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,860
And if I can't?

176
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,520
Well, then,
we'll both
probably die.

177
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,160
Again.

All right, let's not be late.

Hi!

185
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,250
Uh, hold on one second.

What are you doing here?

187
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,250
So sorry to just
drop by unannounced.

188
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,100
I came to town the other day,

189
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,800
and I saw you with your son.

190
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,900
William.

191
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,370
William?

192
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,770
That's a nice name.

193
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,670
Oliver, what are you
doing at my house?

194
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,170
I saw you and William together,

195
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,300
and it's difficult
not to wonder,

196
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,940
because he is, what, nine?

197
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,240
And you know,
we had a thing
10 years ago...

198
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,950
Ok, let me stop you right there.
All right.

199
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,090
William isn't yours.

200
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,880
I told you I lost
our baby, Oliver,

201
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,230
and I met William's father
two months after moving
to central city.

202
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,420
So...

203
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,160
Mom, we're going
to miss the game.

204
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,460
Sorry, I have to go.

205
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,290
No, go.
Ok.

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,400
Oh, here you are.

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,570
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

good luck for me,
all right?

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,740
I will.

Now's not a good time, Malcolm.

212
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,980
I've arranged a meeting
with vandal savage.

213
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,390
You, me, and the speedster.

214
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,320
What? Wait, why...

215
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,220
because negotiation
is the only way out

216
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,560
of this situation, Oliver.

217
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,460
Savage is going
to decimate
central city

218
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,460
to get what he wants.

219

If your child were here,
you would understand.

220

Suit up. I've already
spoke with fleet feet,

221

than a little crazy.

Yeah, well, your friend
with the creepy ring
asked so nicely.

225
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,890
Please tell me we're
not going to negotiate
with terrorists.

226
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,460
Or, you know, 4,000
year old bad guys.

227
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,860
Just think of this more
as a fact-finding mission.

228
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,670
Maybe savage slips up
and gives us something

229
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,400
that we can use
to our advantage.

more humorous lately.

you know so much

about savage, anyway?

I don't know anything about him,

Mr. Allen. No one does.

235
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,950
That is why I'm afraid of him.

That's not
the only reason
to be afraid of me.

not to die.

wasn't a problem
for you.

I taught him how to use a bow.

to not feel pain.

The only way for you and yours
to live through this

is to render onto me
what is mine.

that you hold dear.

that makes you think
that you can prevent me
from doing so again?

Not hubris.

to jurgens industrial
in twenty-four hours

We're not giving up

That's not
your decision to make.

281

This is a cycle
that has played out

282
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,240
for the last 4,000 years.

immortal, but
he isn't a god.

You better be certain
that your stubbornness

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,380
does not get my daughter killed.

288

Because if that happens,

289
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,790
I will come for you.

290
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,820
And in a way that will
make you beg

292

Until we are supposed
to hand you and Carter

this before. 1887,
the huang he floods,

298
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,930
savage killed nearly
two million people

299
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,270
to get to us.
And he did.

We weren't helping you then.
We are now.

with a workable plan.

No, this is insane.

worth millions
of people's lives.

Hey, here's an idea...

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,720
why don't we just toss him
over to vandal savage?

save the city

over to an immortal
psychopath briefing.

don't say it.

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,270
I'm sorry. I don't
know what else
I'm supposed to do.

321
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,480
The first rule of time
travel is you don't
talk about time travel!

322
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,080
Because by having
this conversation,
we're screwing history!

323
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,880
Look, I know
that time travel
has consequences.

324
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,690
I mean, the last
time you vibed...

325
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,490
well, I'm not vibing
anything right now.

326
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,460
Okay, um, all right,
look, don't panic.

327
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,890
A., you don't know
that you time jumped
for a bad reason.

328
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,720
It could have been
a good one, right?

329
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,030
B., now that
you know
you time jumped,

330
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,100
you might not do it, right?

331
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,970
So knowing
the future might
change the present,

332
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,270
which might change the future.

333
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,400
What?

334
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,440
My head hurts.

335
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
Chay-ara... sorry, Kendra...

336
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,870
you shouldn't run off.
We don't know is savage is...

337
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,450
do we ever kill ourselves?

338
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,850
Excuse me?

339
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,750
In our prior lives.

340
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,450
Savage has
to kill us in order
to live forever.

341
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,790
Do we ever kill
ourselves in order
to deny him that?

342
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,160
You know, in our past lives,

343
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,920
I'm typically the one
that makes the plans,

344
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,620
and I'm starting to think

345
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,090
this is probably why.

346
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,120
Everyone in there
is willing to die
to protect us.

347
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,370
You don't think
that's a little bit insane?

348
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,570
No.

349
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,000
I think it's noble.

350
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,460
I think
it's what makes
them all heroes.

351
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,070
Yeah, well, heroes or not,

352
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,330
I'm not letting anyone
die for me.

353
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
Then don't.

354
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,170
Be the person, the woman,

355
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,880
the warrior
you were
meant to be.

356
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,610
The one you always have been.

357
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,520
[Sighs]

358
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,350
Come at me.

359
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,290
What?
Hit me.

360
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,920
Or... Try to.

361
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,600
Yeah, well, as much
as I'd like to do that,

362
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,230
I'm really not
in the mood right now.

363
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,360
Oh, really? Well,
I'll just tell savage

364
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,870
to come back when you are.

365
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,380
Ow!

366
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,350
Again.

367

Good.

372
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,130
Do you feel that?

373
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,460
The rage?

374
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,140
That's the key, Kendra.

375
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,670
It's the only way of finding

376
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,310
the warrior within.
Hey.

377
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,480
Sorry to interrupt...

378
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,510
The weirdness.
Um, John,

379
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,650
Laurel, and thea are back,

380
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,450
and they've got something.

381
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,150
Where are Oliver and Barry?

382
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,220
Oliver's back
in secret-keeping
mode, apparently.

383
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,720
Barry, I don't know.
Caitlin and cisco

384
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,260
are working
on the anti-staff gauntlets.

385
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,210
What do you guys have?

386
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,720
Beta Max. Aww, what,
did you guys get
this off of ebay?

387
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,190
Lyla hooked us up.

388
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,590
Yeah, well, it's going
to take a while to play

389
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,930
since we live
in a digital world now.

390
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,930
The tape came
from a conspiracy
theory group

391
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,790
that's interested in savage.

392
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,640
Pentagon had a file
on savage back in '86,

393
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,310
but it's all been
heavily redacted.

394
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,500
Got it.

395
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,310
Is this on?

396
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,180
I hope so.

397
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,780
My name is
Dr. aldus boardman.

398
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm a professor at
St. roch university.

399
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,850
The date is April 8th, 1975.

400
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,120
I don't think anyone
else knows this,

401
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,260
and those that do,
don't believe.

402
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,890
He's a myth.
An urban legend.

403
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,490
He has been compared
to machiavelli
and nostradamus.

404
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,730
He's gone by many
names, but I know him
as vandal savage,

405
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,960
and he will be
the death
of the world.

406
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,200
But I believe
there is a way
to stop him.

407
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,800
Savage is an immortal,
Egyptian priest.

408
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,180
His long life is a result

409
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,110
of an unearthly calamity.

410
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,910
I believe that any
object associated
with this calamity

411
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,950
should be able
to undo its effects
and kill him.

412
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,680
And I suspect that our
precious, fragile world

413
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:18,090
may one day depend
upon us doing so.

414
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,850
Well, that's
the understatement
of the year.

415
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,060
Or, you know,
the last 4,000 years.

416
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,690
Do you have any idea
what he meant by
these objects?

417
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,200
This calamity?

418
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,130
No, i... i don't
recall a calamity.

419
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,840
The staff.

420
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,340
Staff of horus?
Yes.

421
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,110
I think the staff
belonged to savage

422
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,510
back in ancient Egypt.

423
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,940
You remember?

424
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,870
It's a hunch.

425
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,880
And if professor
boardman's
guess is right,

426
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,940
that staff has
helped me kill savage.

427
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,410
Ok, someone
needs to inform
Oliver and Barry.

428
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,250
Ok, here you go.
I gene sequenced

429
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,200
the hair strand
with the blood
sample you gave me.

430
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,120
Still not sure what it has
to do with Damian darhk,

431
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,730
but the y chromosomes match.

Are you ok?

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,200
Thanks for this,
it's a big help.

434
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,730

what's going on here.

want me to see it.

near my child.

480
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,280
Or me anywhere near him.

481
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,460
So what, he can be
just like his dad?

482
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,130
Punching out paparazzi
and getting young girls
knocked up?

483
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,830
Samantha, I'm not
that person anymore.

484
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,540
I know, I know.
You're... you're
running for mayor,

485
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,130
your mother was killed.

486
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,160
Your friend Tommy,
you're a different
person now.

487
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,940
But can you really tell me

488
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,210
that your life
is any less crazy?

489
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,110
Can you honestly
say that William
isn't better off

490
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,610
with your world
kept away from his?

491
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,570
No, you're right,
I'm being selfish.

492
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,740
But I want
an opportunity
to get to know my son,

493
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,290
and I think that
a young boy deserves
the opportunity

494
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,060
to get to know his father.

495
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,850
He's happy.

496
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,790
He's... he's
well-adjusted.

497
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,590
I don't want to run
the risk of him getting
sucked into your orbit.

498
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,120
That can't happen.
Which means...

499
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,530
That he can't know
that you're his father.

500
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,860
And nobody else can.

501
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,470
I don't care
if that sounds harsh.

502
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,370
I'm his mother, and I
will do whatever...

503
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,240
whatever I feel I have
to do to protect him.

504
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,740
Samantha, there is
someone in my life now.

505
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,000
Please, don't make me
keep this from her.

506
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,310
Oliver, you will if you want

507
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,050
a relationship with my son.

508
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,050
These are my conditions.

509
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,080
You've already asked
the world of me,

510
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,330
I'm just asking for
the same in return.

511
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,370
Everyone's waiting for you.

512
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,540
Sorry, just something
I had to take care of.

513
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,210
So I guess you're off
the secret-keeping wagon.

514
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,770
That's not it.
Then what is it?

515
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,370
[Sighs]

516
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,980
I think Damian darhk
has someone operating
in central city.

517
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,120
So I sent Barry
to run down a lead.

518
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,780
This kind of lead?

519
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,120
He didn't know
what he was giving me.

520
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,080
But I run enough tests
on your blood to recognize
your DNA sequence anywhere.

521
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,690
Felicity, you don't...

522
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,550
You had to run
a paternity test,
didn't you?

523
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,930
Look, Felicity...

524
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,730
Stop.

525
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,340
I cannot hear another lie.

526
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,110
It's more complicated than that.

527
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,580
God, Oliver,

528
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,510
you are the only person
on this planet

529
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,840
who considers
the truth complicated.

530
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,420
Just to be clear,
I don't care that
you have a child.

531
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,220
I can't believe that
you have a child

532
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,650
that you didn't tell me about.

533
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,480
I care that you
lied to me just now.

534
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,590
You know that
my whole world
just exploded?

535
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,890
And I think that
I'm entitled to a...

536
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,260
A minute to process that
by myself.

537
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,990
You somehow managed
to go to ccpd

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,500
and track down
Barry. You didn't
keep it to yourself;

539
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,230
you kept it from me.
When were you planning
on telling me?

540
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,780
I don't know.

541
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,180
If you loved me,

542
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,780
if you trusted me,

543
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,740
telling me this
wouldn't be
such a burden...

544
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,090
it would be a relief.

545
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,620
But you don't trust me.

546
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,780
You never will.

547
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,290
And how can I be
with someone who
doesn't trust me?

548
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,040
Felicity...

549
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,940
Are you guys ok?

550
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,110
Oliver?
What happened?

551
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,810
Nothing. I'm fine.

552
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,920
Uh, are you sure?
I mean, you don't seem fine.

553
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,840
You seem out of it.

554
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,520
Is everyone inside?

555
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,820
Yeah.

556
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,920
Coming up on savage's deadline.

557
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,450
Where's Felicity?

558
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,660
Are the gauntlets working?

559
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,460
They have to be,
we're out of time.

560
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,890
I think they'll work.
That staff's going to go

561
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,700
from "can't touch this"
to "invisible touch."

562
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,240
Savage doesn't know
Kendra has access
to her full abilities,

563
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,610
which makes you
our Ace in the hole.

564
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,060
We're going to put you up
against savage;

565
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,400
you attack with
the element of surprise.

566
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,910
I will lay down the cover fire.

567
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,910
Barry, you speed in, and...
snatch the staff, I got it.

568

John: Where
do you need us?

No, we're not risking

571

any more lives tonight
than we have to.

572
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,430
Suit up.

573
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,560
You brought them.
And dressed

574
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,370
for the occasion, I see.

575
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,940
We're only doing this
because two lives

576
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,740
aren't worth two cities.

577
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,080
Well, in that case,
you are wiser than
I gave you credit for.

581
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,420
ridiculous outfits, I see.

You don't need
to be here for this.

a tendency to be...

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,420
We need to brief the team.

Oof, nothing.
All right, never mind,

I shouldn't have said anything.

Barry, what's
going on?
Ok, look,

623
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,100
this isn't going
to make any sense to you,

624
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,870
but i... all right,
so I traveled back in time

625
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,680
from when we tried
to take out savage.

626
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,440

627
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,350
to take him down in the future,

628
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,950
and it doesn't work.

629
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,380
You're right,
that doesn't
make sense to me.

My world is stranger than yours.

Well, maybe
we use that
to our advantage.

You say that
whatever do against
savage doesn't work?

No. No, no, no.
Ok, look, you can't.

it just, it doesn't end well.

me is that it already
doesn't end well.

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,180
Barry, people in our
line of work, we don't
get second chances.

639
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,680
We need to take this one.

640
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,250
All right, I hope you're right.

641
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,750
All right,
let's start with
what went wrong.

642
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,990
You did. When we
go up against savage,

643
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,490
your head's not in the game.
You're not yourself.

644
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,190
Why not?

645
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,490
Oliver...
Barry!

646
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,820
Why not?

647
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,700
Ok, are you planning
on giving me

648
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,930
a hair sample
to run forensics on

649
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,290
in the near future?

650
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah...

651
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,530
Well, I did.

652
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,910
And you were
pretty shaken
after the fact.

653
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,080
And then Felicity found out,

654
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,070
and you guys
had a pretty
big fight,

655
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,110
and it sounded
like it was over
between you two.

656
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,410
What was the fight about?

657
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,070
[Exhales]

658
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,940
I'm pretty sure
you're someone's
father, Oliver.

659
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,220
So when we go up against savage,

660
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,720
you're not focused.

661
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,530
And then,
Kendra can't
access her powers,

662
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,060
and then the tech
they're developing

663
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,220
to counteract
savage's staff
does not work,

664
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,700
and...

665
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,400
Everyone dies, Oliver.

666
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,330
This time they won't.

667
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,210
This time we do
things differently.

668
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,310
How are they coming?

669
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,080
For my first pair
of anti-Gandalf
magic staff gloves,

670
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,340
pretty good, I think.

671
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,680
Just double
and triple check, ok?

672
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,460
I'm a little worried
about them not working.

673
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,690
Based on what?

674
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,460
Call it a gut instinct.

675
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,130
Also, I need you
to talk to Kendra.

676
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,630
Oh, I get it.
You shoot arrows,
you give love tips,

677
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,160
it's like you're cupid
or something.

678
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,900
What Carter is doing
with her isn't working.

679
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,760
We need her power
to fight savage,

680
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,810
and we need her
to be able to
use it reliably.

681
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,480
Carter's a jerk.
But he's supposed
to be with her,

682
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,210
'cause destiny says
they're supposed
to be together,

683
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,110
and he's supposed
to be her soul mate,

684
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,940
so I'm not even sure
what I can say...

685
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,080
we need to do something,
cisco. We need to reach her.

686
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,980
Egyptian reincarnation
is not in my wheelhouse.

687
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,850
What Kendra is going through

688
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,280
is about accepting
who she really is.

689
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,620
Who better to help her do that

690
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,290
than a guy
who is clearly
in love with her?

691

I don't know if we're at
the l-bomb stage yet.

692
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,200
I'll talk to her.

693
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,600
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

694
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,060
No, I think it's noble.

695
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,700
I think it's
what makes them
all heroes.

Yeah, that's nice.

I'm going to talk to Kendra
for a minute, he-man.

Talk, man. Thanks.

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,750
We should talk.

701
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,310
I thought you were the one
that said we should wait
till this was all over.

702
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,750
Oh, this isn't that talk.

703
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,690
This is the "trying
to help you sprout
wings" talk.

704
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,250
Yeah, well, according to Carter,

705
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,720
I'm a warrior priestess,

706
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,630
and rage is the key
to rediscovering myself.

707
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,190
Yeah, I'm not surprised
Mr. agro thinks that,

708
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,170
but I think
he's got this whole
thing twisted.

709
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,440
Instead of focusing
on the warrior,
focus on the priestess,

710
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,070
and the nurturer,

711
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,500
the good-hearted
person inside of you.

712
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,380
How do you know I was
so good hearted
4,000 years ago?

713
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,920
Because I know you, Kendra.

714
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,480
Some things don't change.

715
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,140
I think you're resisting what

716
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,880
Carter's trying
to teach you
because it means

717
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,560
remembering who you
were, and that is
somebody else.

718
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,130
Somebody who loves him.

719
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,860
Ever since I emerged,

720
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,630
I've been remembering
our first life,

721
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,800
in Egypt. But I've
been telling Carter

722
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,430
I can't remember
anything, because...

723
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,250
because I don't
want to accept that
I'm some reincarnated

Ok. Yeah, that's
pretty heavy.

726
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,050
But it's also pretty amazing.

727

I've been through this,
you know I have.

And what you're
going through right
now, this is a gift.

It's a miracle that
most people don't even
get to experience.

Yeah, well, it feels
like a nightmare.

that is a choice.

to remember who you are,

00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,030
Which is one of
the many reasons
we love you so much,

798
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,360
but also doesn't
seem to help us
stop savage.

799
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,200
It's the calamity
professor boardman
was referencing.

800
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,330
The meteors,
they had a glow
about them.

801
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,710
And savage's staff
had two gemstones with
the exact same glow.

802
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,810
Yeah, the gemstones
might be made up

803
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,410
of the same element
as the meteorite.

804
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,170
The Egyptians would use
meteorite in their
craftsmanship.

805
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,010
And the minerals
glow in proximity
to each other.

806
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,420
Like sankara stones.

807
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,960
Oh, wait,
the Indiana
Jones reference

808
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,610
is the only thing I understood.

809
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,020
Two pieces of the same
meteorite, like an nth metal...

810
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,150
That is the key
to counter-acting the staff.

811
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,730
Believe it or not, this
isn't actually the craziest
thing I've heard today.

812
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,000
There's a sample
of the meteorite
from the middle kingdom

813
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,130
at the keystone
city museum of
natural... history.

814
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,830
Hopefully I got the right one.

815
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,210
I could synthesize
the compatible isotope

816
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,830
out of this and coat
the gauntlets with it.

817
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,340
Ok. Do it.

818
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,580
Savage doesn't know
that Kendra has gained

819
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,780
access to all of her abilities.

820
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,180
It makes you
our Ace in the hole.

821
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,620
Where do you need us?

822
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,580
Suit up.

823
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,760
Ollie...

824
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,290
Everyone's in position.

825
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,590
All right.

826
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,120
Are you sure about this?

827
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,100
About changing the future?

828
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,430
Barry, what can happen here

829
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,930
that is worse than
what already did?

830
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,810
If I knew that,
I wouldn't be so worried.

831
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,540
Let's do it.

832
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,210
It's wonderful to see
you again, my love.

833
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,440
I will never be your love.

834
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,990
I know.

835
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:43,030
That always makes this easier.

836
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,790
Chay-ara...

837
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,530
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

838
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,670
Ahh!

839
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,140
Now, Kendra!

840
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,210
[Tires squealing]

841
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,020
[Canary cry]

842
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,530
[All grunting]

843
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,160
Get clear!

844
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,550
The gauntlets are working.

845
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,180
No, no, no, Oliver,
get yourself to safety!

846
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,740
We're not leaving each other!

847
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,600
Did we do it?

848
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
Is he gone?

849
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,110
Yeah, it looks like.

850
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,410
I knew you could do it.

851
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,750
I'm having
the strangest deja vu.

852
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,420
You're not the only one.

853
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,620
So how do you feel

854
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,360
now that savage
is pushing daisies?

855
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,300
Does this mean you guys
are the immortal ones now

856
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,000
and he's the one
who gets reincarnated?

857
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,470
'Cause that would suck.

858
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,670
I just sprouted
wings a few
days ago,

859
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,140
and I'm just trying
to wrap my head
around that.

860
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,470
He does raise
a good point, though.

861
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,030
Savage is gone
for good now, right?

862
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
I don't know.

863
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,610
We never defeated him before.

864
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,680
But we're free.

865
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,350
Ugh, get a room.

866
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,880
You finally have
the rest of your lives
in front of you.

867
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,340
Have you thought about
what you're going to do?

868
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,820
Carter says in our past lives,

869
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,250
we used to help people.

870
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,350
And after everything
you guys have
done for me,

871
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,090
I think I should
give that a try.

872
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,530
You make it sound like
this try is happening
somewhere else?

873
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,800
In our prior incarnation,
we used to live in St. roch,

874
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,500
and we really liked it there.

875
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,600
Could cisco and I have a moment?

876
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,830
Of course.

877
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,700
Here we go.

878
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,410
Cisco...

879
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,850
I'm really sorry.
You know what,

880
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,440
it's fine. It's cool.

881
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,150
It's actually kind of
a classic story...

882
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,180
boy meets girl, boy gets girl,

883
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,380
girl sprouts wings
and flies away with her
reincarnated soul mate.

884
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,210
The only part I don't get
is you don't even really
seem to like him.

885
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,050
It's kind of
a complicated
relationship.

886
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,760
Hmm.

887
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,560
Like most 4,000 year
old relationships
are, I guess.

888
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,160
A week ago, I was a barista

889
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,570
and I really didn't have a plan

890
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,140
for what I was going
to do with my life.

891
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,800
And now you do?

892
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,530
Well, at least
I know I want
to find out.

893
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,110
[Sighs]

894
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,880
Ok.

895
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,010
I made you something.

896
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,270
To remember me by, I guess.

897
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,110
I made it out of the nth medal

898
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,750
Barry got from the meteorite.

899
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,580
It's got a micro GPS
chip embedded in it.

900
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,430
So if you're ever in trouble,

901
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,150
I'll come find you.

902
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,090
What was that for?

903
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,630
For being you.

904
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
Thank you, cisco.

905
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,570
Well, you did it, Barry.

906
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,610
Everyone's alive.
Our guardian angel.

907
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,170
That's what you told me
I could be when I told
you about my powers.

908
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,040
Meant it then and I know it now.

909
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,580
Hey, Oliver, um,

910
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,890
we need to have a difficult
conversation, I think.

911
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,490
About my son?

912
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,120
God, it feels weird to say that.

913
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,100
Less about your son
and more about

914
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,670
whether or not you're going
to tell Felicity about him.

915
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,830
I don't think
that's any
of your business.

916
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,600
You know what, yeah,
you're right, it's not
really my business,

917
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,800
except I told you,
when I mess with time,
time messes back.

918
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,510
And we've already changed
how things turned out
with savage,

919
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,340
and I'm worried
about temporal backlash.

920
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,510
Wait, you think that
the timeline cares about
what I tell my girlfriend?

921
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,470
What are you going to tell her?
Well, you're right

922
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
when you say that
the rules keep changing

923
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,680
and that the lives that we lead,

924
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,320
they make us feel...
Powerless.

925
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
And it makes me wonder if...

926
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,620
If William wouldn't
be better off

927
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,460
with my world kept
separate from his.

928
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,590
Look, Oliver, take it from
someone who didn't get
to grow up with his father...

929
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,500
I think the best thing
for William

930
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,940
is for you to be
a part of his life.

931
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,670
Thanks, Barry.

932
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,130
Yeah.
[Laughs]

933
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,910
I'm not really a hugger.

934
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,210
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

935
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,600
But the thing is,
I am fast enough

936
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,010
to just hug you
without you knowing,

937
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,980
so you might as well let me.

938
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,450
Yeah. Thanks.

939
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,410
Wasn't so bad, right?

940
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,590
These are my conditions, Oliver.

941
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,720
You've already asked
me for the world;

942
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,030
I am just asking for
the same in return.

943
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,930
[Sighs]

944
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,370
Ok.

945
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,700
I won't tell anyone.

946
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,280
Even Felicity.

947
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,580
Felicity, that's a nice name.

948
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,110
She is a nice person.

949
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,420
She's the best.

950
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,360
William is in his room.

951
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,400
You're just a friend
of mommy's, ok?

952
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,960
Hey, William.

953
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,000
Hello.

954
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,930
You like the Flash?

955
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,770
Can I tell you a secret?

956
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,910
I've actually met the Flash.

957
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,010
What's he like? Is he cool?

958
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,850
Yeah, he's cool.

959
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,280
He's... he's one
of the best guys
that I know.

960
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,490
I'm Oliver.

961
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,220
I'm a friend of your mom's.

962
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,600
We've known each
other a long time.

963
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,160
Want to play action figures?

964
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,490
Sure, sure.

965
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,300
William, I'd love to come by

966
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,760
every once in a while

967
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,230
and say hello.

968
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,280
Would that be
all right with you?

969
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,050
It's captain cold.
He's a bad guy.

970
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,780
Yes, he is.

971
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,220
The Flash is going
to have to be very
fast to catch him.

972
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,790
He will. He's
the fastest man alive.

973
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,390
Oh!
Gotcha.

974
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,490
[Door opens]

975
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,290
Oh, what a mess.

976
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,290
Well, we have to clean
this place up.

977
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,300
Unless you're ready
to tell me what

978
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,540
you said you'd tell me.

979
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,270
[Sighs]
Felicity, um...

980
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,110
Oliver...

981
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,510
We have a life together.

982
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,110
Right? We're a team.

983
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,750
Ow.

984
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,150
If something is bothering you

985
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,720
and I don't know about it,

986
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,550
I can't help you fix it.

987
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,010
I can't be a good teammate.

988
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,120
I love you,

989
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,290
and that makes me
want to be the best
teammate ever.

990
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,220
Not in a Lance Armstrong
performance enhancing
drugs kind of way.

991
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:07,600
More like... More positive
sports analogy I would use
if I knew anything about sports.

992
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,740
What had you acting so strange
when we got to central city?

993
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,640
It doesn't matter, it's over.

994
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,270
And I am back in star city,

995
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,450
with you.

996
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,250
Come here.

997
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,080
[Moans]

998
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,130
Your hate will be everlasting.

999
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,430
Your enmity will never die.

1000
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,940
It will follow them
from this life

1001
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,810
into the next,

1002
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:50,980
and the next...
And the next.

1003
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,680
You owe me one, buddy.

1004
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,210
Greg, move your head.
