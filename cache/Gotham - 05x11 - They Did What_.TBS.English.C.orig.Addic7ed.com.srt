1
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,418
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,009
General Wade's landing craft docked.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,679
His convoy's on the way here now.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,679
Reunification day is today.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,700
- Captain Gordon.
- General, welcome to Gotham.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,300
- Incoming!
- Get back!

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,999
Eduardo.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,233
What did Walker do to you?

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,568
Eduardo's dead, Jim.

10
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,194
There is only Bane now.

11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,948
Everything I have done here
is about punishing Gotham

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,859
for the sins of Bruce Wayne.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,078
I'm not leaving. And I don't think I can

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,247
let you leave... either.

15
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,456
What are you doing?

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,899
Ra's al Ghul.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,919
This is revenge for his death.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,940
- And who am I?
- You're his daughter.

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,719
Barbara Kean.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,780
Run!

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,140
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

22
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,102
I believe you knew my father.

23
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,395
- Where's Nyssa?
- I don't know,

24
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,449
but she's planning on using the
military to wipe out Gotham.

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,019
I can order them to stand down.

26
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,260
Then let's get you out of here.

27
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,486
This is General Wade.

28
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,738
Begin your bombing run

29
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,823
- on my order.
- Wait, wait.

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,891
We need to get ahold of Barbara.

31
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,659
Nyssa al Ghul's coming for her.

32
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,970
The sooner she and Lee get back
here with the baby, the better.

33
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,979
We got refugees coming in
from all over Gotham, Jim.

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,019
People are scared.

35
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,219
I know you're not one to quit,

36
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,229
but if there was ever a time
to wave the white flag,

37
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,239
now is it.

38
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,049
Nyssa al Ghul doesn't want
to just conquer Gotham...

39
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,919
she wants to destroy it,

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,659
kill everyone she finds.

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,159
The only thing standing between
her and these people is us.

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,479
Gather the team.

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,019
Get every able-bodied refugee

44
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,080
down into the bunkers beneath the GCPD.

45
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,219
Why do I get the feeling he's concocting

46
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,420
an elaborate plan to get us all killed?

47
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,385
Better gather up these refugees.

48
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,609
Look at him.

49
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,812
The medics did everything
they could to stabilize him.

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,050
Now all we can do is wait.

51
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,360
This is my fault.

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,059
I sent him on this mission.

53
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,201
Alfred knew what he was
signing up for, Bruce.

54
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,453
We all did.

55
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,099
Nyssa and Bane are coming
after me and Barbara.

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,459
Coming after Gotham.

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,380
Because of what we did to Ra's.

58
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,980
What you did was stop him.

59
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,590
Twice.

60
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,350
We'll stop his psycho daughter together.

61
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,110
I'm sure you recognize this knife.

62
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,699
You touch my baby,

63
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,719
and I will turn you into a pile of ash,

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,360
just like I did your father.

65
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,379
A bit cruel, don't you think?

66
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,479
To let this little one get too attached

67
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,709
when you won't be around

68
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,029
much longer.

69
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,250
Mmm.

70
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,289
Soon, you and Bruce Wayne

71
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,256
will see Gotham

72
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:39,552
and Jim Gordon's precious
Green Zone destroyed.

73
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,847
Then I'll allow you to die.

74
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:46,809
My father made his name
destroying empires.

75
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,688
Now it's my turn.

76
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,479
Hello.

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,650
Listen to me. There is a submarine

78
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,579
in the docks, full of Gotham's gold.

79
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,859
It's yours.

80
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,779
Just leave the city.

81
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,450
Let me and my baby go.

82
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,579
No.

83
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,089
I think I'll keep this little one

84
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,590
and raise her as my own.

85
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,379
As an al Ghul.

86
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,095
I take it the army has landed.

87
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,972
They're just awaiting my orders.

88
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,059
Then what are you waiting for?

89
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,399
What a cute little baby.

90
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,499
Wait, what?

91
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,579
You're ordering us to
destroy the Green Zone?

92
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,377
Anyone still in Gotham is
an enemy of the state.

93
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,539
I won't be party to the
murder of civilians, General.

94
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,290
Then you're relieved of command.

95
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,133
The hell are you?

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,760
I'm your new commander.

97
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,020
Does anybody else have a problem
with the general's orders?

98
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,144
Good.

99
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,519
Let's get started.

100
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,600

101
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,039
What's the matter?

102
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,770
Can we really be so cavalier
about the destruction of Gotham?

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,679
Let me think about that.

104
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,689
Yes!

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,840
Damn it!

106
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,499
Oswald!

107
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,079
Where are you going?

108
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,719
Oswald!

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,099
This is my city, and I will be damned

110
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,930
if I'm gonna let those bastards take it!

111
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,434
I cannot let you do this.

112
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,039
You, of all people,

113
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,379
should want to stop those monsters.

114
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,990
They forced you to destroy Haven,

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,119
to murder hundreds of
innocent civilians.

116
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,110
You're just gonna let
'em get away with it?

117
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,779
I was kind of planning on it, yeah.

118
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,040
Very well.

119
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,639
I'm going to follow my heart.

120
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,030
Oswald!

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,490
You have been down this road before.

122
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,461
Following your heart has
never worked out for you.

123
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,339
Perhaps.

124
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,219
But perhaps you could learn something

125
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,199
if you listened to this

126
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,054
instead of this.

127
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,973
I'm gonna miss you,

128
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,399
Edward.

129
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,061
I'll miss you, too, Oswald.

130
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,809
I'm not talking to you.

131
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,589
I'm talking to the...

132
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,609
God!

133
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,199
Come on, baby.

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,449
All right.

135
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,950
Okay. Good boy.

136
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,679
Go with the man in green.

137
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,699
You'll be safe.

138
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,939
Oswald, if you walk off this dock,

139
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,710
I'm taking this submarine.

140
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,709
And the treasure!

141
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,039
Nyssa al Ghul wants to
kill everyone in Gotham.

142
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,459
But, to get to us, the army has
to follow the Western Corridor.

143
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,720
That's where we make a stand.

144
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,019
We got a handful of men.

145
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,990
How are we gonna take on an army?

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,859
We just have to slow the
army down long enough

147
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,189
to get General Wade out
from under Nyssa's control.

148
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,984
Then he can reverse the invasion order.

149
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,279
We're trying to reach the Sirens.

150
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,289
Still no luck.

151
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,259
All right. I'll go.

152
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,269
Jim.

153
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,110
I need to get Barbara and Lee back here.

154
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,069
- I'll meet you at the barricades.
- I know you haven't seen

155
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,739
your kid yet, but the
GCPD needs a leader,

156
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,259
and they're looking to you.

157
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,456
I'll go to Sirens.

158
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,167
Okay.

159
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,559
You sure you want to do this?

160
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,220
It doesn't take two of us to
track the general's signal.

161
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,639
And if Jim's making a stand,
that's where I should be.

162
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,960
Okay.

163
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,100
Wayne Enterprises EMP,

164
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,854
smoke bombs, signal jammers.

165
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,990
Not enough to even the odds, but...

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
it may buy you some time.

167
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,139
What's this?

168
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,529
Ah. Remember the Nightwing Project?

169
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,149
Portable, next-gen stealth tech.

170
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,119
Put it on any aircraft, and
it's invisible to radar.

171
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,470
But, unfortunately, it also
seems to serve as a beacon

172
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,949
to certain animals.

173
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,700
Never know. Might find a use for it.

174
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,579
Oswald, come in.

175
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,928
Still have those eyes in the
back of your head, Jim.

176
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,639
No.

177
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,010
You just have a remarkably
recognizable odor.

178
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,769
Part dandy, part snake.

179
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,989
After all these years,
it hasn't changed.

180
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,019
Drink?

181
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,000
No, thank you.

182
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,400
Dulls the senses.

183
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,696
That's what I was going for.

184
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,179
Surprised you're still here.

185
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,449
Figured you'd be long gone by now.

186
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,619
That storm you've warned
me about for so long,

187
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,910
it's finally here.

188
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,000
We've shared some turbulent
times, you and I.

189
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,999
That we have.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,559
When you spared my life
on the pier that day,

191
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,179
banished me from Gotham,

192
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,939
that was the most lost I've ever been.

193
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,669
Because I was away from
the city, you see.

194
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,940
It's part of me.

195
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,019
You know what I'm talking about,

196
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,120
because it's part of you, too.

197
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,359
Sure, I could escape...
with money, I might add...

198
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,219
but then what?

199
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,139
Stand on the shores of the mainland

200
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,450
and watch the army
burn it to the ground?

201
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,379
Then watch tasteless industrialists

202
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,960
and vapid politicians rebuild it?

203
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,990
No.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,459
My life is etched on the
walls of every alley

205
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,619
and dirty warehouse here.

206
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,099
My blood lives in its broken concrete.

207
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,469
I'm staying to fight.

208
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,919
For my legacy.

209
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,299
Hey.

210
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,859
The army just busted through
the GCPD checkpoint.

211
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,299
They're heading to the barricades.

212
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,309
Bane's leading them.

213
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,405
How many men?

214
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,157
600, 700?

215
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,367
Still want to fight?

216
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,909
How many do we have?

217
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,740
Maybe 30?

218
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,415
Thirty-one.

219
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,969
Takes two men to pilot
that submarine, Oswald.

220
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,980
The dog can't do it.

221
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,980
Ditto on that blood and concrete thing.

222
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,799
Kind of like this city the way it is.

223
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,519
Shall we?

224
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,429
I believe time is of the essence.

225
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,181
Gentlemen.

226
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,101
Remind me to talk to you
about that full pardon.

227
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,079
Alvarez!

228
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,579
Harper, Bruce!

229
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,479
You take the left flank.

230
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,259
Harvey and I will take the right.

231
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,690
Holy Mary, Mother and Joseph.

232
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,186
Captain Gordon...

233
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,699
I always knew you had a savior complex,

234
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,559
but this is too much.

235
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,979
What happened to you, Eduardo?

236
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,619
There was a time when
you would have been up

237
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,190
on these barricades with me.

238
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:42,159
Yes... but that was before
I found my true purpose.

239
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,539
Stand by.

240
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,289
Fire on my command.

241
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,639
Jim, it's a lot of innocent soldiers

242
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,290
down there just following orders.

243
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,739
Target Bane and Nyssa's commandos.

244
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,000
Fire on my command.

245
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,720
For Gotham.

246
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,939
Lee?

247
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,939
Selina.

248
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,779
Hey. Come on, we got to get out of here.

249
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,400
Where's Barbara and the baby?

250
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,719
Nyssa al Ghul took them.

251
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,819
We have to tell Jim.

252
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,019
Yeah.

253
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,600
The Narrows.

254
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,590
They never stood a chance.

255
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,209
The ones who could escaped to the GCPD.

256
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,940
Then that's where I'm needed.

257
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,859
Target Jim Gordon.

258
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,996
I'm sorry!

259
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,159
I don't think he can hear you

260
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,999
through the bullet in his ear!

261
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,780
Eddie!

262
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,680
They're only delaying the inevitable.

263
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,393
Jim, that thing's pointing right at us!

264
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,025
Go, go, go, go, go!

265
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,948
Find me Jim Gordon and Bruce Wayne.

266
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,299
If the army gets through the barricades,

267
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,619
they'll have a straight shot to
the GCPD and the people there.

268
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,700
We need to find another
way to slow them down.

269
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,416
I think I have a way.

270
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,400
Gather all the ammunition you can.

271
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,920
Fall back to the GCPD.

272
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,381
Go, go now!

273
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,590
Fall back!

274
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,135
We got to go.

275
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,439
Well, that was a disaster.

276
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,690
Come on, Oswald, we have to keep moving.

277
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,590
Where? There's nowhere to hide, Jim.

278
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,119
Wherever we go, the army will find us.

279
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,532
Get me Gordon.

280
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,140
It's Lucius.

281
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,499
Tell me you were able to
track the general's signal.

282
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,779
It's coming from City Hall,
but there's a problem.

283
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,319
Selina radioed.

284
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,649
Barbara and the baby were
kidnapped by Nyssa al Ghul.

285
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,559
General Wade's at City Hall.

286
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,159
Chances are Nyssa, Barbara
and the baby are, too.

287
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,758
Our best bet is for me to
sneak into City Hall alone.

288
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,499
One good electrical zap should
short out the general's chip,

289
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,510
then you can get him to
reverse the invasion order.

290
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,224
See you back at the GCPD.

291
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,529
Get Barbara and the baby back safe.

292
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,687
Come on. Hey, move!

293
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,659
Upsy-daisy, Oswald.

294
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,260
We're running out of time.

295
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,480
Just give me one minute.

296
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,779
I'm so sorry.

297
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,783
I saw the grenade and I froze.

298
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,411
- I'm sor...
- Shh.

299
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,998
It's the least I could do.

300
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,917
But tell me...

301
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,380
Does it look bad?

302
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,579
No, it's just a scr...

303
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,480
Looks fine. Let's go.

304
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,379
Where'd everybody go?

305
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,860
She's gonna need some morphine.

306
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,820
And this bandage needs changing.

307
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,179
Lee.

308
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,640
- Bruce. Is Jim... ?
- He's okay.

309
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,100
For now.

310
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,270
We'll need to get Jeremiah's
battery from the basement.

311
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,363
After the bridges went
down, Lucius re-modified

312
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,789
Jeremiah's bomb to be used
for its original purpose...

313
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,040
as a battery.

314
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,980
It's been powering the GCPD.

315
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,480
Right.

316
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,700
We need to make it a bomb again.

317
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,420
You got to be kidding me.

318
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,139
Jeremiah knew exactly
where to put his bombs

319
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,289
to topple buildings,
turn Gotham into a maze.

320
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,659
We stopped him.

321
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,739
But if we could use
just part of his plan,

322
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,879
we can track the army
and slow them down.

323
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,719
By knocking buildings down like dominos.

324
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,429
But for that to work, we need
to put a bomb in this building.

325
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,999
Ground Zero for the blast.

326
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,620
Wayne Enterprises.

327
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,180
Bruce...

328
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,509
There's no other way.

329
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,980
Okay. How do we get
this thing out of here?

330
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,149
To use it as a bomb, you
don't need the whole thing.

331
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,820
All you need is... the core...

332
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,139
and the activator.

333
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,189
That's it?

334
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,619
It may look modest,

335
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,189
but all it took was one of these

336
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,359
to blow up an entire bridge.

337
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,080
Not to mention the Gotham Clock Tower.

338
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,960
Bruce, you can't do this alone.

339
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,379
He's not alone.

340
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,280
I know where to place the bomb.

341
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,220
And you and Lucius are needed here.

342
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,920
I can't believe we're
letting them do this.

343
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,399
Add that to the list of things

344
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,970
that I cannot believe are happening.

345
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,239
Hey.

346
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,870
What?

347
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,240
The key's there.

348
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,639
Where is she? Is she okay?

349
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,949
Yeah, she's upstairs in the office

350
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,719
with Nyssa and the general.

351
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,419
Nyssa is not gonna stop

352
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,919
until she's killed everyone in Gotham.

353
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,229
One thing at a time,
let's go save our baby.

354
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,320
Hello, Captain Gordon.

355
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,819
Ah.

356
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,799
You're seeing your baby
for the first time.

357
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,169
I wish I had a camera.

358
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,269
Hand her over.

359
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,289
No.

360
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,539
I don't think I will.

361
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,539
Put down your guns.

362
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,840
Unless you want the little
one hurt in the crossfire.

363
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,679
Even now, the army is making
its way to the Green Zone

364
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,470
while Bane is hunting down Bruce Wayne.

365
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,639
Only question is,

366
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,810
what to do with you?

367
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,449
This is it.

368
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,099
The bomb will weaken the support column

369
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,500
and topple the entire building.

370
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,979
This is crazy.

371
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,099
I mean, we've spent this entire
time trying to stop Jeremiah

372
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,350
and now we're actually
using part of his plan.

373
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,999
Believe me...

374
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,420
if there was any other way...

375
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,469
You sure you want to do this?

376
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,719
First Wayne Manor gets destroyed

377
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,829
and now Wayne Enterprises.

378
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,929
This building is the heart
of my family's company.

379
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,429
There are things above us

380
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,980
my parents spent their entire lives on.

381
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,339
Some of my earliest memories

382
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,019
are playing with Alfred in this lobby,

383
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,319
waiting for my parents to
come down these escalators.

384
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,899
But my parents built this company

385
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,380
to make Gotham a better place.

386
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,749
They would have sacrificed
everything for this city.

387
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,790
They did sacrifice everything.

388
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,960
And if that's what it takes...

389
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,800
... so will I.

390
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,059
So remind me how this works.

391
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,810
Pulls energy from the
air and magnifies it.

392
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,689
And when it does that?

393
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,050
We run!

394
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,839
I knew you'd come for your child.

395
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,659
I just didn't think
you'd be foolish enough

396
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,009
to come alone.

397
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,119
I don't need help to take you down.

398
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,879
Don't you see?

399
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,519
It's over.

400
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,369
Gotham will burn.

401
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,339
And I'll achieve what
my father couldn't.

402
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,129
Including killing you.

403
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,329
She likes to be held upright.

404
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,440
There.

405
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,400
Barbara, I'll deal with you

406
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,179
once Gotham has been destroyed.

407
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,720
But I'd like you to see this.

408
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,409
I was expecting a little more gusto.

409
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,119
You want gusto?

410
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,850
Is that all you got?

411
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,920
It's Lieutenant Angel.

412
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,429
They did what?

413
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,839
No, no.

414
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,469
Is there another way around?

415
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,979
Then tell the army to blast through.

416
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,809
Hey.

417
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,189
I'm not done with you yet.

418
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,579
Your friends may have
bought you some time,

419
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,400
but the Green Zone's
destruction is only delayed.

420
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,579
And now to meet your fate.

421
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,700
Let's meet it together.

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,499
Barbara!

423
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,169
Shoot him.

424
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,419
No.

425
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,559
You think you can defeat me?

426
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,139
Better men and women
have tried and failed.

427
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,569
I'm an al Ghul.

428
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,059
You'll never beat me;

429
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,949
I have my father's blood in my veins.

430
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,819
I am his one true heir.

431
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,620
Do you ever stop talking?

432
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,210
You two do share one thing.

433
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,249
You both love getting
stabbed by this knife.

434
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,880
General Wade.

435
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,470
Execute fail-safe.

436
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,220
No.

437
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,469
I'm going to enjoy watching
Gotham be destroyed!

438
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,880
And then my legacy will be complete.

439
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,939
We got to hurry.

440
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,079
It's only a matter of time
before the army breaks through.

441
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,209
We need to get back to the GCPD.

442
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,340
Bruce!

443
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,859
Impressive.

444
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,199
You blew up your father's building

445
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,549
to stop the military.

446
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,999
It will take more to stop me.

447
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,009
Go on ahead, Selina!

448
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,319
Warn the GCPD!

449
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,310
No, we're doing this together.

450
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,079
You shouldn't have hurt Alfred.

451
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,630
Collateral damage. It happens in war.

452
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,659
I'm sorry you weren't there
to see me break your butler,

453
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,389
but I'm so glad you won't miss
me killing your little friend.

454
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,909
Let her go.

455
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,359
In war, there are no attachments.

456
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,840
Only then can you fight
without your hands tied.

457
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,159
You see... just a little
ounce of pressure.

458
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,459
That's all that separates
the living from the dead.

459
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,859
- What is that?
- Wayne cloaking device,

460
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,059
but it had some glitches.

461
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,729
Apparently, it's a beacon
for certain winged mammals.

462
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,039
What winged mammals?

463
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,110
Bats.

464
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,119
There's no way to reverse
the invasion order.

465
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,079
We have to find another way.

466
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,289
- Is she all right?
- She is now.

467
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,900
There, there. Mama's here.

468
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,820
And your father.

469
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,810
Try not to get blood on her.

470
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,529
- Sir...
- Come on.

471
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,569
We're almost at the Green Zone.

472
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,620
Lee?

473
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,389
Jim.

474
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,519
- The baby?
- I checked her over, she's fine.

475
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,729
Though she could use a feed.

476
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,359
Where's General Wade? The
army's broken through.

477
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,899
General Wade's dead.

478
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,899
Nyssa al Ghul escaped. There's no way

479
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,359
to order the army to stand down.

480
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,159
So, now what?

481
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,829
The army blew up Wayne Enterprises

482
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,399
and knocked down two other buildings.

483
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,119
We don't stand a chance.

484
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,959
Actually, that was Bruce and Selina.

485
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,459
What?

486
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,119
The army's blocks away.

487
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,919
- From what direction?
- Every direction.

488
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,020
We're surrounded.

489
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,919
Jim. I need to get her out of here.

490
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,539
All right. The tunnels
underneath the GCPD.

491
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,289
There's a vent shaft, it
connects to the subway line.

492
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,889
Take the baby and the refugees
down into the subways.

493
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,579
Get 'em behind enemy lines.

494
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,439
- Don't stop till you get to safety.
- Okay.

495
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,360
But what about you?

496
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,199
We'll hold 'em off outside,
buy you some time.

497
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,819
- Jim...
- These refugees,

498
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,009
most of them are from the Narrows.

499
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,219
They know you, they trust you.

500
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,980
They know you'll protect them.

501
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,850
Go.

502
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,389
Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.

503
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,759
Rest, Alfred.

504
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,889
All this time, I tried to protect you.

505
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,019
There you are, a soldier.

506
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,669
A soldier for good.

507
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,609
You've spent your life protecting me.

508
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,709
Now it's time for me to do the same.

509
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,529
It's time for me to protect Gotham.

510
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,060
Even if there's nothing left to defend.

511
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,879
All right, everyone, let's move. Okay.

512
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,080
All right, you'll walk about
five blocks underground,

513
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,700
and then you'll get
to a subway vent. Go.

514
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,439
You're not coming with us?

515
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,439
Jim and our friends are
out there making a stand.

516
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,509
That's where I belong.

517
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,309
Wait, what are we going
to do without you?

518
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,519
Survive. Make sure
this was all worth it.

519
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,850
Go.

520
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,839
What was that for?

521
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,699
Everything you've done for me.

522
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,539
And for her.

523
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,560
Just get them to safety.

524
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,819
It's over, Jim.

525
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,529
Our war's come to an end.

526
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,820
This isn't a war. This
is a firing squad.

527
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,799
I told you to go.

528
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,949
And I didn't listen.

529
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,499
Ready.

530
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,209
Aim.

531
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,009
Shoulder to shoulder.

532
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,630
- Stand together.
- What the... ?

533
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,470
They're here for us, Jim.

534
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,489
Fire.

535
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,839
I said fire!

536
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,699
You have a choice.

537
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,139
You can stand with us,

538
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,420
or you can stand with them.

539
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,409
We are Gotham!

540
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,450
We are Gotham! We are Gotham!

541
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,630
So that bitch was telling
the truth after all.

542
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,399
We managed to raise the
mainland on the radio.

543
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,139
They know everything. As of right now,

544
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,469
the army's being repurposed

545
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,079
for the humanitarian mission
of rebuilding Gotham.

546
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,999
These refugees will get food,
water, medical treatment.

547
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,299
They're setting up a crisis
center in Federal Square.

548
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,890
I'll be damned.

549
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,840
Hey.

550
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,299
So...

551
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,599
this whole "not listening" thing.

552
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,219
It's not gonna become a habit, is it?

553
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,620
You're welcome.

554
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,780
Go.

555
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,119
Well, this is gonna make

556
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,160
one hell of a bedtime story some day.

557
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,839
Can I?

558
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,720
Of course.

559
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,719
I don't even know what to call her.

560
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,180
Barbara.

561
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,429
Oh.

562
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,599
Barbara Lee Gordon.

563
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,019
In this city, it's important
she know who she can rely on.

564
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,450
Bruce, what's wrong?

565
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,819
We won.

566
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,429
Nyssa al Ghul is still out there.

567
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,599
And she and Bane were right.

568
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,239
All this happened because of me,

569
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,359
because people were trying to hurt me

570
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,309
and the people I care about.

571
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,970
When Bane had you...

572
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,579
I thought he was gonna kill you, Selina,

573
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,799
and there was nothing I could do.

574
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,649
Hey.

575
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,580
I will be here whenever you need me.

576
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,289
What?

577
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:09,180
That's what my parents used to tell me.

578
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,380
Come here.

579
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,969
That bitch stole our submarine!

580
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,099
And our gold.

581
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,119
And by now she's probably landed

582
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,679
somewhere on the mainland,
impossible to track!

583
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,939
After all we've been
through these last months,

584
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,279
we are once again left with nothing!

585
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,599
Nothing!

586
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,059
Back to square one.

587
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,859
Common criminals.

588
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,659
We saved this city from
certain damnation,

589
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,959
but will we see any
credit for our loyalty,

590
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,799
our selfless bravery? Of course not!

591
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,269
I don't want their thanks.

592
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,539
Or their respect.

593
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,319
You know what I felt,

594
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,800
standing shoulder to shoulder
with those people out there?

595
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,920
Nothing.

596
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,559
I... feel...

597
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,499
absolutely nothing

598
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,019
for those drab...

599
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,639
boring people.

600
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,619
That was me once.

601
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,039
Minimum wage at a thankless job

602
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,619
at the GCPD. "Yes, sir. No, sir.

603
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,399
Thank you so much, sir."

604
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,419
Picking up scraps from
my master's floor.

605
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,459
Shy, awkward...

606
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,420
pathetic Ed.

607
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,130
Common criminals?

608
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,019
Never again.

609
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,039
I've shown this city who
I truly am once before,

610
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,239
and I will do it again.

611
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,859
They will bow

612
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,110
to the Riddler, and they won't get up

613
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,739
until I permit them to.

614
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,579
Yes.

615
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,579
You're right.

616
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,999
Our accomplishments have been erased,

617
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,089
our brilliant minds underrated.

618
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,299
If they had let me run this
city the way I wanted to,

619
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,239
it would not be in ruins now.

620
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,319
I have the men, the money,

621
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,239
- the guns...
- Gordon took them.

622
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,179
Why? Because he still sees you

623
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,869
as Fish Mooney's umbrella
boy, and he always will.

624
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,309
Yes.

625
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,099
I only came back to
help him save this city

626
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,859
so that I could take it for myself.

627
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,080
We would be stronger together.

628
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,239
No one could stop us.

629
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,080
Yeah, perhaps.

630
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,789
Let's make a pact,

631
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,029
here and now.

632
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,739
We will take what we want

633
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,379
from who we want,

634
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,670
and we will suffer no fools.

635
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,010
Together.

636
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,849
Shall we shake on that?

637
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,849
Please,

638
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,619
we're brothers.

639
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,609
A hug.

640
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,279
A hug it is.

641
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,080
Life begins anew.

642
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,890
Shall we get to work?

643
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,299
Thank you all for coming here today.

644
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,860
It is my great honor to
introduce Mayor Jones.

645
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,359
With reunification underway

646
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,619
and the bridges being rebuilt,

647
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,419
it is my honor to bestow
upon Captain James Gordon

648
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,119
the title of commissioner.

649
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,459
We're gonna miss you around the bullpen.

650
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,679
I won't be far.

651
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,099
And the mission doesn't change.

652
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,899
Still trying to make this
city a better place.

653
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,239
Be careful.

654
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,910
You're swimming with sharks now.

655
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,439
If you need anything, ever...

656
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,350
I know who to call.

657
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,299
You deserve this, Jim.

658
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,549
You really do.

659
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,519
I'm gonna go get a drink before...

660
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,399
you get all teary-eyed on me.

661
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,029
What do you mean, you're leaving?

662
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,859
Bane's in prison, it's over.

663
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,949
My life here... it's too public.

664
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,479
You've made up your mind.

665
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,869
Gotham's in good hands.

666
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,159
Commissioner.

667
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,920
Yeah.

668
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,939
Thank you, Bruce,

669
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,840
for everything you've done
for me and for the city.

670
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,430
Gotham will always be your home.

671
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,189
Bruce is all grown up.

672
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,529
- That he is.
- Well,

673
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,580
now you have another
little one to look after.

674
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,459
Where's Bruce?

675
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,039
Um...

676
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,640
he left you this.

677
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,679
You know how to reach me

678
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,409
if you need anything?

679
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,200
Yes.

680
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,480
Well, you know me, Master Bruce,
I'll be very self-sufficient.

681
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,299
Busy, actually. You know,
we start the reconstruction

682
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,679
of Wayne Enterprises and
Wayne Manor tomorrow.

683
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,140
You will remember everything
I taught you, won't you?

684
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,460
Of course.

685
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,569
Good, that's... that's good.

686
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,640
I never tried to replace
your parents, you know?

687
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,740
I couldn't, I never would.

688
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,719
But I want you to know, Master Bruce,

689
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,919
that you are the only son

690
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,289
that I will ever have,

691
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,630
and I could not be more proud.

692
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,930
