1
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,217
Wait. Did everybody make it?

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,677
- No. Bishop's dead.
- We have to go back.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,014
We can't leave a man behind now.
We have to go back.

4
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,350
Gwyn, he sacrificed himself for us.

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:18,019
We cannot go back,
or more of us could die.

6
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,439
I need a moment.

7
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:28,571
- Uh, are we in John's mansion?
- Yeah. In the pocket dimension, I think.

8
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,032
Does it still open to the factory?

9
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,207
Not unless something terrible
happened to that factory.

10
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,852
The portal must have closed
when the last person exited the manor.

11
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,795
So, right now,
there's no doorway back to Earth.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,630
It's okay. We can still time jump.

13
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,007
No, we can't. Not until we know
exactly where and when.

14
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,691
We can't afford to have another mistake.

15
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:51,719
What? What do you mean?

16
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,681
We told her to go home,
and this feels like home to me.

17
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,225
Home is 2022, not here.

18
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:58,977
It was all really chaotic. I just...

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,937
Gidget, are you okay?

20
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,481
You look a little...
Oh, she has a fever.

21
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:06,067
Oh, man.
Okay, well, if Gideon is unwell,

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,336
it's definitely not safe to jump,

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,160
- so we are trapped in the mansion.
- In Hell.

24
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,077
More like we're trapped
three inches from Hell.

25
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:14,033
It's gonna be all right, guys.
Gideon probably just needs a rest.

26
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,536
And, luckily,
we landed outside the timeline,

27
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,264
which means Evil Gideon can't find us,

28
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:21,541
and now, we have a chance
to come up with our game plan.

29
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,061
- That was the whole...
- Tactics. We need to think tactics.

30
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,688
Give me ten minutes.
I'll have a murder board drawn up,

31
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:26,879
and we can do some planning.

32
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,431
It tolls for thee.

33
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,641
Hello?

34
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,103
Is someone there?

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,983
Hello?

36
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:51,654
<i>- Gwyn!</i>
- Alun?

37
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:10,673
Wow, babe, this is your
most complicated murder board yet.

38
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:13,217
- All right, bottom line is...
- Nice.

39
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,262
Yeah. Evil Gideon's manufacturing robots
to hunt us down.

40
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,265
After all we have done
to protect the timeline?

41
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:23,436
So, what we need, ideas, good ideas.

42
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,855
How to defeat robots.

43
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,024
How to travel
without being detected by Evil Gideon.

44
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,235
Hey, Gideon.

45
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:35,156
Didn't see you
at the murder board meeting. You okay?

46
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,368
I thought I was doing the right thing
coming here,

47
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,723
but they're all so disappointed in me.

48
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,541
It all happened so fast.
I just went with my gut.

49
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,253
What if next time I get confused
and I just jump us all into a tornado?

50
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,132
- I could kill us all.
- No. No, you did good.

51
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:56,302
You brought us to safety.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

52
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,102
So, what did I miss at the meeting?

53
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,521
Oh, you know,
they were talking about why

54
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,356
Evil Gideon wants to
kill all the Legends.

55
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,876
I'm sure she thinks they're
an unpredictable and destructive force

56
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,110
that needs to be eradicated.

57
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:14,737
Just a guess.

58
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,282
Looks like someone
restocked the kitchen.

59
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,951
- Have an apple.
- Oh.

60
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,338
Is it getting hot in here
or is it just me?

61
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:35,133
Well...

62
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,069
If you're referring to the increase
in temperature in the house,

63
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,261
you're correct.

64
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,345
Oh.

65
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,782
If you're insinuating
we should go upstairs and fool around,

66
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:42,890
also correct.

67
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,144
Oh.

68
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:50,815
Guys.

69
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,609
I'm thinking about maybe
asking Astra out.

70
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,654
Oh.

71
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,322
Our baby boy is all growns up.

72
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,783
I just feel, like, clarity, you know?

73
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,178
Like, I haven't smoked weed or done
edibles since we got time stranded,

74
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,329
and I feel so present,

75
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:07,338
and now, I just can't stop
thinking about her.

76
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:10,835
That's great. Just be yourself,
and, you know, don't make it weird.

77
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,254
Be myself, don't make it weird.

78
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,548
You're Behrad.
You're the cool, chill guy

79
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,008
everyone wants to hang out with.

80
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,644
Be cool and chill.
That's why people like me.

81
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,929
- Exactly.
- All right. Thanks, guys.

82
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,976
We crushed that.
I love helping a little bro.

83
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,186
Because you're time bros?

84
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,773
No. Because I'm getting
so serious with my Zari.

85
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,358
He's like a future
little brother-in-law.

86
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,779
I guess that makes us in-laws
in some weird way.

87
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:42,492
Yeah, but you're like my best bud,
so like a time bro-ette.

88
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,786
Thank you, but I hate that.

89
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:51,751
Is it hot in here?
Feels like a million degrees.

90
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,711
Yeah, something is not right.

91
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,466
Gwyn!

92
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,471
Are we in Hell?

93
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,893
Oh, Lord, and all you saints
and martyrs, aid me now.

94
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,394
Okay, calm down, Gwyn.

95
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,647
I mean,
what's the worst that can happen?

96
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,856
"The worst that can happen"?

97
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,609
We are in the very bowels of Hell,
Esperanza.

98
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:21,906
The horrors that await us
are beyond the limits of imaginations.

99
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,783
Yeah, out there.

100
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,327
But, I mean, we would have
seen something come in, right?

101
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,169
You might want to keep praying, Gwyn.

102
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:44,512
- You left the door to Hell open?
- What were you thinking?

103
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,764
Yes, I'm sorry.
You see, I thought I heard voices,

104
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,809
and so I opened the door.
I'm a grand fool. I know.

105
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,436
There's no telling
what nightmare got in.

106
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,774
Where I come from,

107
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,694
the only thing worse than pests
are pests that make themselves at home.

108
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,029
Yeah. Okay, let's split up
and sweep the house.

109
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,073
We can't fight Evil Gideon
if we're all possessed.

110
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,449
Or can we?

111
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,078
No. No, bad idea.
Sweep the house. Tell everyone.

112
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:10,955
- Go ahead.
- Right.

113
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,172
Hey, you ever feel like
someone's watching you?

114
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,973
Well, I was a child celebrity.
I feel weird when I'm not being watched.

115
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,804
But, yeah, I do know what you mean.

116
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,978
- Oh!
- Ew! Oh, my God.

117
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,479
Disgusting.

118
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:40,276
Who knows what kind of magic goo
John was hoarding in here. Ugh.

119
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:41,694
Disgust...

120
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,491
There's, um...

121
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,827
There's gotta be something
to wear around here.

122
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,511
Mmm-hmm. I'll get some right here.
Right?

123
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:57,793
I don't like this.
We didn't plan for a Hell detour.

124
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,587
Yeah, I know.

125
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,632
We got robots and Evil Gideon
and now this.

126
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,258
- I'm at capacity.
- Mmm.

127
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,099
Something is definitely up there.

128
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,313
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

129
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,276
Behrad, don't sneak up
on people in Hell!

130
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,528
- You idiot.
- Sorry.

131
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,344
You look like John.

132
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,762
You look like my Zari.

133
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,107
What's happening?

134
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,654
I think we're being manipulated.

135
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,905
- No.
- Yes.

136
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,875
Why are you attacking us?

137
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,294
"Us"?

138
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,506
- Greetings.
- Oh, my...

139
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,341
Oh, my... Damn.

140
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,719
Why, why, why, why?

141
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,221
Ohh!

142
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,597
Gideon!

143
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,890
Why are there three of them?

144
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,517
God, God save me now.

145
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,104
Hi, everyone. This is, uh, mortifying.

146
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,582
This had better be consensual, Gary,
or I'm gonna rip off your...

147
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,066
It's entirely consensual.

148
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,902
In fact, I was the one
to instigate our first tryst.

149
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,613
All right.
How long has this been going on?

150
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,158
- Including the foreplay, approximately...
- No, no, no.

151
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,619
I mean, when did you guys,
like, first hook up?

152
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:59,081
Uh, the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown
was our first date.

153
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:02,293
- Yeah.
- Oh, lovely. Sounds very romantic.

154
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,045
That's why Gideon's been so unfocused.

155
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,714
Yeah. And why we ended up here.

156
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,258
Gary said that
the manor feels like home,

157
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,635
so that must be the reason
Gideon brought us here

158
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,929
instead of our actual home,
because of him!

159
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:16,724
- Oh, my God. That's such a nice thought.
- Aw, that's so sweet.

160
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:20,102
This is like a bad reality show.
Thank you very much for that.

161
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,189
That's it.
I know what's infesting the house.

162
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,565
Well, enlighten us, Miss Logue.

163
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,525
It's The Cursed Crew.

164
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,212
And they're watching us, trying to get
a glimpse of the real world.

165
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,530
- What are you talking about?
- Let me show you.

166
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,091
We are on a reality show from Hell.

167
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,806
You're saying there's just creepers
just watching us?

168
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,599
Yeah, like everywhere?

169
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,802
Yeah, they're
following us around, filming us.

170
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,363
I don't like the idea of creepers
watching us for their own amusement.

171
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,148
Not for their amusement,
for their curse.

172
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,567
Back in the '90s,
there was this film crew

173
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,878
that was so desperate for a hit show,

174
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,696
they sold their souls
to this demon called Harris Ledes.

175
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,408
The terms of the deal state
that they can't leave his employment

176
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:19,912
unless they capture something authentic,
something real.

177
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,248
Ugh, sounds like a bunch of sad sacks.

178
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,499
No, we need to be careful.

179
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,376
Through Harris's unholy magic,

180
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,920
they can twist emotions
to amplify conflict.

181
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,088
They love drama.

182
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,090
Unless we want
to vacate this place forever,

183
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,675
I have to confront Harris.

184
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,385
You want to go out there?

185
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,637
I can handle myself.

186
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,806
But you all need to handle yourselves.

187
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,517
If you feel your emotions
getting amped up, don't succumb.

188
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,228
And just keep your heads
till I get back,

189
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,188
and please don't turn on each other.

190
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,401
Oh, man, this is gonna be
just like <i>KUWTT.</i>

191
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,988
<i>KUWTT. Keeping Up With The Tarazis.</i>

192
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,449
The reality show about my own family
that I was re-cast on.

193
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,659
Oof.

194
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,078
That's right.
I forgot what a bummer you were on it.

195
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,913
- I'm starting to remember, though.
- Mmm.

196
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,249
I'm joking. It's a jo...

197
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,792
Wow.

198
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,212
- Miss Spooner?
- Uh-huh.

199
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:11,576
May I have a word? I just, uh...

200
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:20,890
Would you mind informing me
as to exactly what this "reality TV" is?

201
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,143
Don't worry, stick with me.

202
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,061
I've watched like
40 seasons of <i>Survivor.</i>

203
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,815
Hey, we should form an alliance.

204
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,192
I had an ally once.

205
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,570
And perhaps being stuck in Hell is proof

206
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,823
that I have strayed too far
from getting his back.

207
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,119
Yup, uh... Never mind.
Forget it. Offer rescinded.

208
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,121
You're too weird for an alliance.

209
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,290
You'd only hold me back.

210
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,462
Reality TV show or not,

211
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,857
we need to find a way
to deal with Evil Gideon and her robots.

212
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,549
Okay, plan, plan.

213
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,509
Let's, uh... free associate.

214
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:02,264
Mmm. Free associate?
Okay, I guess I'm listening.

215
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,101
- Robots.
- Robots, yes.

216
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:11,982
Robots don't like water.
Water is on the ocean.

217
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,228
We need to go to our beach house
on the ocean.

218
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,320
What?

219
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:17,821
What?

220
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,574
Babe, look, I'm... I'm drained, okay?

221
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,326
I just... I need a break.

222
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:27,539
Just like a little private island
with a yacht for day trips.

223
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,458
- I mean, is that so much to ask for?
- Yes!

224
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,045
We don't have time for this.
I don't under... Okay.

225
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,149
- Do you not want to do the work?
- Of course I want to do the work.

226
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:40,261
All I do is work.
I'm Sara Lance. I'm crazy about work.

227
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:46,725
But I am also crazy about personal chefs
and hers-and-hers massages.

228
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,477
- Hmm?
- Who are you?

229
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,981
You know what,
I have this all figured out.

230
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,443
These super basic,
lazy reality show wannabes

231
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,446
are trying to foist
the friends-to-lovers trope on us.

232
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,242
That's why they did the stunt
with the shirt goo.

233
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:06,870
Yeah. Luckily we are way too TV savvy
to fall for that, especially me.

234
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,134
It's like, if we haven't
hooked up already,

235
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,833
why would we hook up now?

236
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,668
We got this.

237
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,421
We're gonna be the friends
that never fight.

238
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,924
Hmm? All we have to do
is not sleep with each other.

239
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:22,011
You and me? That's crazy.
Never in a million years.

240
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,598
Well... Yeah. I mean, you know,
because we're just friends.

241
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:30,394
Obviously I'm genetically identical
to your girlfriend,

242
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,147
so I understand why you would
unconsciously be drawn to me.

243
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,734
To be honest,
just the idea of it is like blah.

244
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,946
Okay. Okay. Uh...

245
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,574
Not to, like, press the issue,
but, um, look at me.

246
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,286
I dress better than her.
I live in your timeline.

247
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,873
In fact, the only real difference
between us is our personalities.

248
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,000
And surely you're not saying that I,

249
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,586
the person who you called
your "time bro-ette"

250
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,963
not 20 minutes ago,
have a bad personality.

251
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,715
Surely not.

252
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,594
Did I say "never in a million years"?

253
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,971
I meant to say never
in ten million years!

254
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,474
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

255
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,356
Miss Lance, when we first met,
we made a deal.

256
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,525
And I have fulfilled
my end of the bargain.

257
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,277
I gave you time travel.

258
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:26,033
But you have not upheld your side by
helping me complete my sacred mission.

259
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,661
Instead, you have brought me
to the burning inferno of Hell itself.

260
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,872
And therefore,
with all due respect, Miss Lance,

261
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,832
I must remind you
of your obligations to me.

262
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,834
I do not have time for this.

263
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,339
But you promised me.
Please, we must save Alun.

264
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,301
Yes, Gwyn, okay,
I have not forgotten about our deal.

265
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,553
I owe you one person to save.

266
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,764
No problem. You got it.
We'll talk about it later.

267
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,225
I am very sorry, Miss Lance,
but this is not good enough!

268
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,186
What do you want then?
Do you need me to write it down?

269
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,313
Is that gonna make you happy?
Fine. Here.

270
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:01,735
Gwyn can save one person
from the timeline.

271
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,987
Signed, Sara Lance.

272
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,826
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to plan.

273
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,993
Thank you.

274
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,517
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

275
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,498
- Yes!
- Plan a holiday.

276
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:18,962
Oh, my God!

277
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,756
Excuse me, young lady,
will you put some clothes on?

278
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,842
No way. It's called strategy.

279
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,845
Being naked is "strategy"?

280
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,013
You know,
it psyches the other players out.

281
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,726
Everyone trusts the naked guy,
because what could they be hiding?

282
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,811
Hmm?

283
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,064
But, Gwyn,
what I'm hiding is all in here.

284
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,152
That's very, very good.
That's very, very good.

285
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,135
Lowest Common Demon-inator Productions.
How may I...

286
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,181
Astra Logue? Uh, is that really you?

287
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,516
Unlucky for you, I'm back.

288
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,854
And you're gonna do exactly as I say.

289
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,366
Astra Logue.

290
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,202
It's been too long.

291
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,038
Ooh. You look awful.
It's not your fault, though.

292
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:39,082
Being outside of Hell is bad for
your pores, bad for your karma.

293
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,710
Harris. Still negging like it's 2007.

294
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,172
Oh, it's called trolling now.
And these souls that I'm trolling,

295
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,925
they're gonna be
ripping each other apart by mid-season.

296
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,928
Those are my souls you're messing with,

297
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,679
so hands off.

298
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,972
Oh.

299
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,296
Astra, hey, I...
I didn't know you were still in the biz.

300
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,478
Hey, look, I would never
want to step on your toes,

301
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,814
scuff those gorgeous heels.

302
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,735
Look, I'll tell you what,
souls are yours.

303
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,904
I'll pull the crew back
to <i>Kitchen Night Terrors.</i>

304
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,864
Good. Then we don't have a problem.

305
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,582
Sir, we found this soul
lurking around outside,

306
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,501
following her.

307
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,463
I made this weird, didn't I?

308
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:36,098
So, what was the plan
with this one, huh?

309
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,392
Classic flaying? Exsanguination?

310
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,035
- Puddling, huh?
- "Puddling"?

311
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,692
Puddling is when
we remove all your bones.

312
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,975
You just turn into a human puddle,
and we splash in you.

313
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,405
Not that.

314
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,324
So, what do you say,
take this one together?

315
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,285
For old times, huh?

316
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,461
Mmm...

317
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,050
No. Astra?

318
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,179
You've, ah... You've become
one of them! Disgusting!

319
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,866
Next thing you know, she's gonna be
talking about found family

320
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,018
and having a conscience.

321
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,395
So what if she does have a conscience?

322
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,105
That's part of what makes her amazing.

323
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,566
- She's come so far.
- Behrad, shut up!

324
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,692
What?

325
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,236
Behrad, was it?

326
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,573
See, the thing that you think
makes her amazing,

327
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,491
actually now makes her...

328
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,535
Vulnerable.

329
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,121
Down here, she's any demon's plaything.

330
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,041
Though... Whoa.

331
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,252
She's really mad at you.
I'm not detecting much push back.

332
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,714
Fight it, Astra.
But if you can't, I totally get it.

333
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,009
Yuck.

334
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,844
So chill. You're a nice guy. Yeah.

335
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,280
Here's the thing about nice guys,

336
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,931
they are all over the place
down here in Hell.

337
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,310
The nicer they are,
the more secrets they got buried.

338
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,063
So, I wonder...

339
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,359
what have you really
got all locked up in here?

340
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,948
Or maybe, is it... nothing?

341
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,076
You've got... It's so boring!

342
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,828
Boring. I'm bored.

343
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,081
Why did you follow me?
I had this handled.

344
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,601
Yeah, no, duh. I saw what you did
to that guy at the front desk.

345
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,294
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't triggered by being back.

346
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,630
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

347
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,049
Save it for the cameras.

348
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,425
Please, no!

349
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,014
<i>No, no, no. Ugh! I can't be here!</i>

350
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,433
So, you either think
that I'm too weak to go solo,

351
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,894
or I'm just gonna backslide
into being a monster.

352
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,397
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

353
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,066
But... I don't want to talk
in front of the cameras.

354
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,734
<i>There's not really another option.</i>

355
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,569
<i>They're still here,
because you followed me!</i>

356
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,408
Mmm...

357
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,660
Well, I enjoyed every bit of that.

358
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,621
And not just the chocolate,
the sex was great, too.

359
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,457
Mmm...

360
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,167
What's wrong?

361
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,586
What are we doing?

362
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,505
Maybe they're right.

363
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,091
Maybe this thing between us
is clouding my judgment.

364
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,178
Maybe it's all being heightened
by this Hell house.

365
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,907
The last thing the Legends need
is for their time pilot

366
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,731
to be obsessed
with your sweet, little bottom.

367
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,309
No. No.

368
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,193
Hell house or not,
our judgment isn't clouded.

369
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,189
You do genuinely admire
my sweet, little bottom,

370
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,983
and I do genuinely love you.

371
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,570
I have to go.

372
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,281
Uh... No, that was
the reality show effect.

373
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:44,077
I know it's too soon to talk about love.
That's weeks away, even a month.

374
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,330
I'm sorry,
I just need some time to think.

375
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,969
You are in over your head this time.

376
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,473
How so?

377
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,434
Hello?

378
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,936
<i>How are you in over your head?</i>

379
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,022
Who's talking?

380
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,565
You, hopefully.

381
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,968
I don't want to share my emotions
with a disembodied voice.

382
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,278
<i>Don't you? Just a little?</i>

383
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,784
Well, I guess it would be nice
to unload.

384
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,579
- This is just between you and me?
<i>- Of course.</i>

385
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,378
This has all been quite overwhelming.

386
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:40,383
My human side, well, it's been
developing all sorts of new feelings,

387
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,528
and I particularly hate this one
called self-doubt.

388
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,263
<i>- Your human side?</i>
- Yes.

389
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,475
Sometimes I wish
I could turn off my emotions

390
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,894
and just approach things
more analytically,

391
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,479
like my CPU was designed.

392
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,314
That would be quite dangerous.

393
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,984
Well, some people would say,
in these peculiar circumstances,

394
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,322
that unchecked emotions
could be much more dangerous.

395
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,116
Maybe you're right.

396
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,670
- Gideon?
- I'm dumping you, Gary.

397
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:18,922
It's over.

398
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,257
What?

399
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,175
I need to devote my full energy
to my work.

400
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,428
- But my bottom...
- Please don't make a scene.

401
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,722
You'll only embarrass yourself.

402
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,198
You're not thinking about
what Nate said, are you?

403
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,825
"Ten million years." Ha!

404
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,160
I'm just not as laid back
as the other Zari.

405
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,371
I simply take advantage of my genes

406
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,748
to utilize a little variety
in my appearance.

407
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,877
Tell me this,
is it a crime to admit that I am,

408
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:59,379
empirically speaking, very hot?

409
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,506
Perhaps the mere sight of you
makes him...

410
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,151
I don't know, nervous for some reason.

411
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,815
You know what, you're right.
He's nervous.

412
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,429
But why? We're just friends.

413
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,472
There's no reason for him
to be nervous around me.

414
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,308
Maybe it's the other Zari.

415
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,811
Why would he be nervous around her?
They're in love, moving in.

416
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,605
That's a big step. It's...

417
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,149
Oh, my God!

418
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,485
- That's it.
- What?

419
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,195
He doesn't want to move into the totem.

420
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,865
- Oh.
- How could he do this to her?

421
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,869
Gidget!
We have to protect that little nerd.

422
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,872
- You're on my team, right?
- Of course I am.

423
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,583
Of course. Oh, my God. I love you.

424
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,347
Hey.

425
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,724
I saw you talking to Zari.
What did she say?

426
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,226
I shouldn't. It was in confidence.

427
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,665
I'll just say,
it's interesting that she thinks

428
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,025
she utilizes her genes
better than your Zari.

429
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:04,736
What?

430
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,490
She thinks my Zari is ugly?

431
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,575
- She thinks she's better than her?
- I cannot say.

432
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,037
Hey, good talk. Spot buddies for life.

433
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,290
- Nice!
- Ouch.

434
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,381
Deep into planning.

435
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,424
Refreshing.

436
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,011
The rest of the Legends
are concerned with more trivial matters.

437
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,767
I was thinking though,
this current plan,

438
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,996
how are you going to prevent
any harm to Alun

439
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,260
throughout the rest of the war?

440
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,650
I mean, there is, after all,
four more years of it.

441
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,864
It's too bad you cannot save them all.

442
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,492
Those poor men.

443
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,870
Perhaps we can save all of them.

444
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,917
Why go back out there?

445
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,086
Oh, you're talking to me now?

446
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,214
I am just wondering
why you want to go back out there,

447
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:09,384
being that it's the source
of your trauma?

448
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:12,971
My trauma?

449
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,892
Behrad, I grew up in Hell. It sucked.

450
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,812
But I survived by pushing through,
not hiding.

451
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,339
What the hell are you hiding from?

452
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,440
Me?

453
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,317
I'm B. I'm chill.

454
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,486
I don't have trauma.
That's my whole thing.

455
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,281
Frankly, I think you're projecting,
which I hear is quite common.

456
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,452
Oh...
Please! Grow up!

457
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,710
Men are cowards.

458
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:50,300
Nate, I think there's
something wrong with me.

459
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,970
My boy Gary,
he's broken-hearted right now.

460
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:58,016
But Natey-H
still has to drop these truth bombs.

461
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,897
Look, just when you think
you can trust a woman,

462
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,107
she turns around
and shows her true self.

463
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,610
That's why you can't trust dames.

464
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,947
You can only trust gains.

465
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,118
No...

466
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:20,705
Nate? He sucks to be around right now.

467
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,750
I need to find someone
more level-headed.

468
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,797
What do you mean, "Gideon is different"?

469
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,174
She just came to me about an alliance.

470
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,764
Want to start a secret double alliance?

471
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:39,432
Hmm?

472
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,103
Ugh.

473
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,648
Gary's head just isn't in the game.

474
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,109
If he can't get it together,
then he's out.

475
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,486
Of what? I'm not sure yet. But...

476
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,531
I know I'm ahead.

477
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,786
Co-Cap, once you're finished
coming up with a brilliant plan,

478
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:03,289
we need to talk about how bro Nate
is going to ruin flannel Zari's life.

479
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,876
I have come up with the perfect plan
to defeat Evil Gideon.

480
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,713
Pack your sunscreen
and your hangover remedies

481
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:13,883
because the Legends are going to Cabo!

482
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,220
That's her plan?

483
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,432
Of course a trip would be nice,
but we have business to take care of,

484
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,576
we have messes to clean up.

485
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,645
We can't just go to the beach
every time life gets hard.

486
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:30,358
Oh, no. I'm turning into
the implanted memories of my mother.

487
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:34,988
Wash your hands! It's time for dinner!

488
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,950
These Legends are going
to have to listen to me now.

489
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:43,079
If I had it my way, the only "Z"
we would have at dinner is ziti.

490
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:44,414
Oh!

491
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,292
I mean, honestly,
and this is a true question,

492
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,919
did that self-tanner
seep into his brain?

493
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,047
And that is how you make a rabbit trap.

494
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:58,011
Table's set and the knives are out.

495
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:02,849
I hope everyone's hungry,

496
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,560
because they're about to get a mouthful
of the meal I just cooked.

497
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,020
And my opinions.

498
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,316
Oh, crap.

499
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,321
So, I get down to dinner,

500
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,325
and the Legends have done
literally nothing I told them.

501
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,160
The place is a powder keg.

502
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,954
Without human emotions
clouding my judgment,

503
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,374
I'll make sure the Legends
get exactly what they deserve.

504
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,253
I don't think Behrad will be joining us.
He is hiding in bed.

505
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,215
Oh. Just like he spent
most of his teenage years.

506
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,549
Ew.

507
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:37,926
No, not like that.

508
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,720
He just didn't want to be on camera,
so we had to re-cast him.

509
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,847
- You re-cast your own brother?
- Mmm-hmm.

510
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,015
Let us pray.

511
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,352
Our... who art in...

512
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,103
hallowed be thy...

513
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:51,105
- thy... come, thy...
- be done...

514
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,775
Beautiful words.

515
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:59,197
Uh, Avs, I just want to say thank you
for this beautiful meal.

516
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,783
- You're welcome.
- Fake.

517
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,951
Excuse me?

518
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:05,954
I think that this is now
a wonderful opportunity

519
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,205
to bring up the plan

520
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:10,792
with regards to what
Miss Lance promised me.

521
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,085
What is he talking about?

522
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,504
She promised me
that I could save one life,

523
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:18,466
and that life
is Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

524
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,097
By preventing the assassination
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

525
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,641
we shall prevent the entire Great War.

526
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:32,105
How dare you misrepresent me?

527
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,148
You led me to believe

528
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:37,860
that you wanted to save
one inconsequential person

529
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,530
from the timeline,
not your entire generation.

530
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:41,614
No. Thank you.

531
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:46,077
Babe, listen to me, you know I would
never promise something like that.

532
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,496
- And he is clearly a liar.
- I am not a liar.

533
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,707
- I am not talking to you.
- That's it!

534
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,168
I am done cleaning up after you,
after all of you!

535
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,505
I am not the den mother.

536
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,590
- And would you put some clothes on?
- Ah!

537
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:00,675
Oh, my.

538
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:01,759
Look what you did.

539
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:04,345
<i>- Ava, wait!
- A promise is a promise!</i>

540
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,473
Perfect. Oh, let's really
turn the heat up.

541
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:10,143
I want to see them
rip each other's limbs off!

542
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:14,814
So, Spooner, whose faction
did you decide to join, Nate or Zari's?

543
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,734
Oh, my gosh!

544
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,236
You're trying to team up against me?

545
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:23,364
Well, good luck
getting anyone on your side.

546
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,576
Oh, my God, you're such a backstabber.
Nobody wants to be on your side.

547
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:27,994
- Everyone's on my side.
- No.

548
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,204
All you ever do
is talk crap about my Zari,

549
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:31,622
and that woman is a saint!

550
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,333
They both make good points.

551
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:36,169
But just know that
whichever alliance I join,

552
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:39,130
I promise I will betray it.

553
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,632
You know what,
since we're already in Hell,

554
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,301
there's only one way to settle this.

555
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,932
This is the weirdest vibe yet.
What's going on?

556
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,017
She called you ugly.

557
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,244
Nate doesn't want to
move into the totem.

558
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,788
- I totally want to live in the totem.
- No, I did not say that.

559
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,814
And also, I believe
she's trying to sleep with me.

560
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,335
- Upstairs, she said that to me.
- My God. That's literally not true.

561
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,361
Hey. Are we in Hell right now?

562
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:05,114
Yeah. And we're all under
the effects of a demon's reality show.

563
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:06,699
Huh.

564
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,868
Okay. That, uh... that makes sense.

565
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,244
It does?

566
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,248
Yeah. Because I have
the uncontrollable urge to do this.

567
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,545
How could I?

568
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:23,925
Babe, I'm really sorry, okay?
I just really needed a break,

569
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,260
and have a reset
and swim with dolphins, babe.

570
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,614
- Would you stop with the vacation?
- That's all I need! I just...

571
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:31,099
This is divine punishment!

572
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:35,978
Enough! This is exactly what he wants!
You are all complete idiots!

573
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:37,647
We're getting out of here.

574
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,108
Gideon, I need your brain!
Put on the colander!

575
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:42,110
We will figure out an exorcism top side!

576
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:43,778
Excellent.

577
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,461
We should all simply pile into
Gwyn's ramshackle time contraption,

578
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,157
and I'll take you out of here.

579
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,534
It'll be a breeze.

580
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,869
"A breeze"? No!

581
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,830
She'll kill us all!

582
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:02,839
I've been trying to tell you,
she's not herself.

583
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,258
She'll time jump us into a tornado.

584
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,885
Gary, don't do anything crazy.

585
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:11,097
I'm trying to save your life,
so help me...

586
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,851
- I'll eat this.
- Eat...

587
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:19,772
- No, no, no, no.
- Get back here!

588
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,150
Gary! Gary!

589
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,824
No!

590
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:32,994
Get him!

591
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:41,752
Wait up, Gary!

592
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:44,922
<i>Wow! Sounds
really tense down there, huh?</i>

593
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,508
Back off. Those are my friends.

594
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:50,178
<i>Yeah, of course.
Your friends who love you.</i>

595
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:53,282
<i>You know, they sure could use
a chill and cool Behrad right about now</i>

596
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,640
<i>to calm things down.</i>

597
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,853
So, I'm just gonna be that guy, forever?

598
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:03,858
<i>Well, the real question is,
who are you without this,</i>

599
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,444
<i>and who would want
to hang out with this mess?</i>

600
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,243
Let's slice him open.

601
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:17,955
No, no, no! Get him!

602
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,169
Get him! Get him! Get him!

603
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,341
Go, go, go!

604
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:29,509
Go, go!

605
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:39,977
You guys wanna make asses
of yourselves for the cameras?

606
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,354
Is that what you want?

607
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,943
Because I know what it gets you.

608
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,905
I have countless memories
of cameras in my face

609
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,824
every time I was scared,
every time I cried.

610
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,911
You wanna know about
the first time I ever failed?

611
00:33:56,994 --> 00:34:01,207
Don't worry. <i>Keeping Up With The Tarazis</i>
had a whole episode about it.

612
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:06,587
I figured out the way to beat it
was to be unflappable.

613
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:10,174
Chill. Pop a gummy, lay low, relax.

614
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:13,302
If they don't see it get to you,
they don't have the power.

615
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,557
But... it gets to me.

616
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,476
A lot of things do.

617
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,478
I'm sad sometimes.

618
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,565
I'm scared a lot.

619
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,443
I died and I never talked about it.

620
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:35,408
Because maybe I'm afraid
if I'm honest with anyone,

621
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,702
they'll end up hating me.

622
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,374
All I wanted to do was ask you out.

623
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,920
And now I'm crying
for all of Hell to see and laugh at me.

624
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:52,883
For my friends to realize
they never knew the real me.

625
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:00,641
And for the girl I like
to run far away from me.

626
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,894
But I'm done now.

627
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:07,857
Here's the honest truth.

628
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,862
When it comes to you, Astra,
I lose all my cool.

629
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:16,407
I'm just B.

630
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:22,246
Oh, oh, oh!

631
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,175
Ooh!

632
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,218
Ahh!

633
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,929
It's gone. Ah, my shows!

634
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,766
What happened?

635
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,311
He got real.

636
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,943
- Is it over?
- The curse is lifted.

637
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,737
Your contract with Harris is terminated.

638
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,197
Get the hell out of here.

639
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:07,583
Gideon?

640
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:11,629
Are you in there?

641
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,553
Gary, I'm so sorry.

642
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,193
- Here, babe, let me do this.
- No, it's all right.

643
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:40,783
It's not, and I know it's not.

644
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,538
Look, even when my brain
was on a vacation episode

645
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,290
of <i>The Real Housewives,</i>
I knew you were right.

646
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:53,712
Go on.

647
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,509
I let you take on
too much responsibility for the mission,

648
00:36:58,592 --> 00:36:59,844
and it's not fair.

649
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,638
You are not the house mom,
you are the co-captain.

650
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:08,185
And a very beautiful, sexy co-captain.

651
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,543
So, when were you gonna tell me about
this promise that you've made to Gwyn?

652
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:15,836
- You...
- Pardon the intrusion, ladies,

653
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,196
but, uh, if you are attending
the mea culpas,

654
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:23,242
then I have to admit
that I got a little carried away.

655
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:27,329
I'm not very well acquainted
with the rules of time travel yet,

656
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:32,376
but even I know that one cannot
simply stop the Great War.

657
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:37,006
I'm sorry, Gwyn.
But I will uphold my promise, all right?

658
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:38,817
We're gonna find a way to save your guy.

659
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:43,137
As cleanly as possible.

660
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,347
No timeline explosions.

661
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:51,562
I guess it is sweet
you were both looking out for me.

662
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:52,688
Girl, of course.

663
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,647
Look, I love you.

664
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:58,402
I love you, I love you, I love you,
and I cannot wait to live with you.

665
00:37:58,903 --> 00:37:59,903
I know.

666
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,300
Besides, do you know how many aunties
are very psyched for your arrival?

667
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,325
- Mmm-mmm.
- Hmm.

668
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,244
Which reminds me, I, uh...
I gotta get back.

669
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:14,043
You are going to stay
and apologize to each other, yeah?

670
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,337
By the way,
sorry about the whole wine thing.

671
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,671
Okay, bye.

672
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,134
I'm sorry...

673
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:23,803
It's okay.

674
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,638
- Honestly, the voice...
- My voice?

675
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,201
- It was, it was. And your...
- You can't be serious right now.

676
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,977
All is forgiven.

677
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,480
How did you know
that would work with the camera guys?

678
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,949
I didn't. Just wanted to say how I felt.

679
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,577
Right, yeah. The reality show
made everyone say crazy things.

680
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,371
Not me.

681
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,206
That was genuine.

682
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,042
A genuine, full-blown freak out

683
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,336
in front of the hot girl
I've had a crush on forever.

684
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:01,632
Well...

685
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:05,803
Who knows? Maybe that girl
has a little crush on you, too.

686
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,105
I'm sorry. I'm just in my own head.

687
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,275
Is, uh, something wrong?

688
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,360
- Don't you want to?
- Oh.

689
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:24,113
I want to really bad,

690
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:28,742
but I might need a minute to figure out
what being unchill and sober is like...

691
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,996
before I'm the best boyfriend
you've ever had.

692
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,458
If you want to go slow... that's cool.

693
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:42,172
You know, you guys are so dorky.

694
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,426
- Oh.
- Spooner! The cameras are gone!

695
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,017
I got so comfortable,
I didn't even realize it.

696
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,015
House meeting!

697
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,475
Just... Clothes. Put on clothes.

698
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,812
House meeting, everyone!

699
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,898
Sure. Why not?

700
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:02,359
- Gary, the reality show is over.
- Yes.

701
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,696
And I, for one, am very pleased.
You call that entertainment?

702
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,781
No, I don't.
No, we are having this house meeting

703
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:11,160
because there are apologies
that need to happen.

704
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:14,121
Gary, it's okay.
Gwyn and Sara and I talked it out.

705
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:15,724
Yeah. And Nate and I are besties again.

706
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:19,126
No. Apologies to
me and Gideon, you jerks.

707
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,438
She wouldn't have had
to switch over to robo-mode

708
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,356
if you guys didn't make her
second guess herself,

709
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,358
and then make her feel guilty
about our relationship.

710
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,675
Thank you, Gary.

711
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,740
Look, I've noticed
that you've all found love

712
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,349
in some of the most chaotic of times,

713
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,226
and you've still done your jobs
with terrific aplomb.

714
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:41,190
So the fact that you think
that Gary and I cannot find comfort

715
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:44,568
in each other's sweet embrace
is a bit hypocritical.

716
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:48,864
Um...

717
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,243
Yeah. Actually, you're...
You're completely right.

718
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:56,038
And we're sorry.

719
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,582
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

720
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,667
- Yeah.
- We're sorry.

721
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,295
It's quite nice feeling emotional again.

722
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:04,797
It's like a warm and gooey feeling

723
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,716
as opposed to
a cold and calculated urge to murder.

724
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:10,636
Say what?

725
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,514
I'm just kidding.
I'm quite funny actually.

726
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:17,309
- She was kidding.
- So funny.

727
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,896
But, hey, since you are
a part of this team

728
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,191
and a supercomputer, so you tell us,
where do you think we should go?

729
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,627
I'm glad you asked, Captain,

730
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,445
because I've given it much tactical
and emotional consideration,

731
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:32,241
and I think I want to trust my gut,
as us humans say.

732
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,869
And my gut is telling me
to plot a course for Sarajevo in 1914.

733
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,874
We need to save Archduke Franz Ferdinand
and stop World War I.

734
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:49,299
What?
