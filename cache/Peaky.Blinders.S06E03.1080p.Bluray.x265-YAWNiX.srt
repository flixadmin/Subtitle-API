1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:03,319
{\an8}<i>Jack Nelson's
coming to London.</i>

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,039
{\an8}There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

3
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:07,159
Fascists.

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,119
Not the ones
in boots and black shirts.

5
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:11,679
<i>The ones in tuxedos.</i>

6
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,279
Mr Shelby,
Lady Diana Mitford.

7
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:15,679
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

8
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,719
Officially he's coming to buy
liquor import licences.

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,119
And unofficially
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,039
By being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

11
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:25,359
I can undermine them.

12
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,639
Still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

13
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:29,279
If you don'<i>t want</i>
to help me carry the bucket,

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,639
then I wouldn'<i>t</i> blame you.

15
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,239
You have to carry this bucket
on your own.

16
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,759
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

17
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,679
You're a brave man.

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,319
Every war hero I ever met,

19
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,079
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

20
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,639
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby. <i>..</i>

21
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,039
It will be you.

22
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,439
The devil will be dead.
The future belongs to us.

23
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,159
<i>You need to see
a doctor.</i>

24
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:52,399
We've got to keep going until
this Boston business is done.

25
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,799
Hello?

26
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,479
Tommy, she has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

27
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,239
Just get here now.

28
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,239
Out of the way! Out of the way!

29
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,039
- No. <i>..</i> No. Where's the doctor?
- Can you get the doctor?

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,159
I need to speak a doctor!

31
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:30,199
Mr Shelby! Mr Shelby. <i>..</i>
your daughter has consumption.

32
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,039
Consumption
is a very infectious disease.

33
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,959
There are procedures
that must be followed.

34
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,079
- Please, hand over the child.
- OK.

35
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,199
Lizzie?

36
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,639
Right, you take her.
You be gentle.

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,519
Look after her.

38
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,439
That's my daughter.
You hear me?

39
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:47,879
I need to be with her.

40
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:49,799
I need to be with my daughter!

41
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,439
Calm.

42
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:54,239
OK. Come on.
They are X-raying Ruby.

43
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,719
They have to X-ray us because
we might have it as well.

44
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,839
Fuck us, Lizzie.

45
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,879
Fuck us! Fuck you and me!

46
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,679
Who brought this on?!

47
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,759
We brought on this curse!

48
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,759
Stop, Tommy.

49
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,239
Fucking stop!

50
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,239
They wouldn'<i>t</i> let me pass.

51
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:14,559
They wouldn'<i>t</i> let me pass.

52
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:19,559
They did it on purpose -
to punish me.

53
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:23,839
Tommy, stop it, please.

54
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,799
All right.

55
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,559
All right.

56
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,079
My husband...is very sorry.

57
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,999
OK.

58
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:38,159
My husband is very sorry

59
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,799
and he is calm now.

60
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,479
He is recovering
from addiction.

61
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,839
Sometimes...

62
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,959
Sometimes...

63
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,799
...he's a horse in a crate,
kicking the crate.

64
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,159
It's just the crate
I'm kicking.

65
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,519
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,759
- Lizzie.
- Yeah?

67
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,639
Tell me what I have to do.

68
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,839
- This way, sir.
- Sorry.

69
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,799
Thank you.

70
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:23,479
Mr Shelby, you will need
to keep still for a moment.

71
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:31,503
http://hiqve.com/

72
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,679
To see what's inside.

73
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,279
Wait till you see.

74
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,439
God.

75
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,519
God knows what's inside.

76
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,319
God help her.

77
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,479
She has a tubercular infection
in her left lung.

78
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,279
They've caught it quite early.

79
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,159
They'll do more tests.

80
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,519
They do this thing,
pulmonary something,

81
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,319
where they collapse the lung,
let it rest.

82
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,079
Sometimes the lung
cures itself.

83
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,479
And if that doesn't work,
they use gold.

84
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,479
What?

85
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,719
- Gold?
- Gold salts.

86
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,199
The doctor said he explained
their methods to you

87
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,999
when you cut the ribbon
to open the institution.

88
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,399
I can't remember.
I wasn'<i>t</i> listening.

89
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,599
Yeah, well.

90
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,479
Gold salts.

91
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:15,599
Salt with 37% gold.

92
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,559
They say it helps, but it will
make her more sick at first.

93
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,679
Did they say <i>what...?</i>

94
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,519
Did they say
what the chances are?

95
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,919
- No. They don'<i>t say.</i>
- Hmm.

96
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,479
But she's small.
And with TB that's not good,

97
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,719
because the disease
is big and fast.

98
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,239
I'm so sorry. <i>..my</i> darling.

99
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,759
I will deal with <i>it.</i>

100
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,799
I will make it go <i>away.</i>

101
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:46,559
I will strike a bargain.

102
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,119
You should be wearing a mask.

103
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,199
I am.

104
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,079
You can <i>try</i> gold.

105
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,159
I will <i>try</i> something else.

106
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,679
<i>Mayfair 244.</i>

107
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,199
Ada? Listen to me.

108
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,999
I need you to be me in London.

109
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,759
No, it's important.

110
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,959
I know you want nothing
to do with my business,

111
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,399
but Ruby is very sick.

112
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,319
I need five days of your time.

113
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,679
So, she dresses well.

114
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,479
Go to the door
and take her coat.

115
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,519
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh...

116
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,279
And make a note of the label.

117
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,919
Of course, ma'am.

118
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,719
Oh, Thomas,
where the devil are you?

119
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,959
Mrs Ada Thorne, ma'am.

120
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,119
I thought you were
all called Shelby.

121
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,599
Ah, I'm a widow.

122
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,759
My husband didn'<i>t</i> have
the good grace to die.

123
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,279
He lingers <i>yet.</i>

124
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,959
Your husband is a member of
the Guinness family, I believe.

125
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,519
They do a lot of good work
on behalf of the poor.

126
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,919
The poor who are only poor

127
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,679
because they've spent so much
of their income on Guinness.

128
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,719
Please.

129
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,359
I think the causes of poverty

130
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,159
are a little more complex
than <i>that.</i>

131
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,919
Yes. I believe
it is to do with genetics.

132
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,319
Huh. Beautiful vase.

133
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,039
My grandfather stole it
from a brothel in Cairo.

134
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,359
Egyptian.

135
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,199
The 18th Dynasty, I think.

136
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,919
How do you know so much
about Egyptian vases?

137
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,999
- I collect antiques.
- Hmm.

138
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,839
A tribe of Gypsies settles on a
clearing in a factory <i>town.</i>

139
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,879
Children, of course,
ensue in their hundreds,

140
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:57,039
but one of them becomes
a gangster and a politician,

141
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,039
the other
a collector of antiques.

142
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,799
It is quite extraordinary.

143
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,159
A result of genetics, I think.

144
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,639
My dear, you researched me
and I researched you.

145
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,839
If this was 1919, you would
have come through my front door

146
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,999
carrying a revolver
and a Molotov cocktail

147
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,639
and would happily
have blown off my head.

148
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,719
Hmm. Isn'<i>t it</i> wonderful
how time changes everything?

149
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,079
Where is the American?

150
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,639
- He'll be here later.
- Where's Mosley?

151
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,759
He heard Thomas wasn'<i>t</i> coming
so he decided to sulk.

152
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,999
You know how men are.

153
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,159
Where is Thomas?

154
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,959
His daughter is sick.

155
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,879
Does he not employ a governess?

156
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,279
Hmm. It's a class thing,
a genetic thing.

157
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,999
He puts his daughter's welfare
before business.

158
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,919
Even the business
of changing the world?

159
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,879
I thought
today was purely social.

160
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:40,079
Now that it's just you,
I suppose it will be.

161
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,919
You should know your brother
has altered my life.

162
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:52,479
The men here just bounce up
and down in their saddles

163
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:55,319
in a rising trot,
never even galloping.

164
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,999
Thomas is the man on the horse
on the vase.

165
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,959
That's <i>why</i> I put it out for you
to look <i>at.</i>

166
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,559
According to
recent interpretations,

167
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,239
the black rider on 18th Dynasty
vases is meant to signify

168
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,079
approaching death,

169
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:13,959
so, yes, I suppose
it resembles Thomas.

170
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,199
Tell me, <i>why</i> is he
so emotionally mutilated?

171
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,159
Oh. Because he's a character
in a novel, of course.

172
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,879
One of those novels
ladies like you like to read -

173
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:25,479
all about wild men.

174
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,639
Oh, I don't read novels,

175
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,279
I read only pornography
and politics.

176
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,359
In the absence of the men,

177
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,959
shouldn'<i>t we</i> ladies
be engaging in small talk?

178
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,759
Very well.

179
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,919
Small talk.

180
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,679
You know I like to fuck women
as well as men?

181
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,599
Mmm, Tommy was right.

182
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,439
He says that
everything is a circle.

183
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,079
A lady in Eaton Square,

184
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,079
as coarse and honest
as an Aston whore.

185
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,599
I just realised I haven'<i>t</i>
even offered you a drink.

186
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
Ada...

187
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,279
Before the dreary business
of changing the world begins,

188
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,799
I want you to know something.

189
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:26,159
When the time comes
for the great cleansing,

190
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,359
I myself will personally
argue the case

191
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,399
that the Jews
must be dealt with,

192
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,359
but that the Gypsies
should be spared.

193
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,839
Huh.

194
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,839
Let's drink whisky
and wait for the American.

195
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,559
Huh.

196
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,119
Who the fuck are you?!

197
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,119
I am the owner
of this Colt pistol

198
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:38,519
and the bullets within <i>it.</i>

199
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
And I'm in a hurry.

200
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,759
I followed the patrin signs
for the Lee family.

201
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,599
I'm looking
for Esme Shelby-Lee.

202
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,639
Never heard of her.

203
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,599
Esme's husband
was a fucking dirty didicoy.

204
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:04,639
- He was a Peaky Blinder.
- Yeah?

205
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,479
Well, I'm the elder
and more terrible.

206
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,079
And as I said, I'm in a hurry.

207
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,279
Where is she?

208
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:35,599
Put your gun away, Thomas.
There's children around.

209
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,919
You only found me
cos I let you find me.

210
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,039
I heard you were looking,
and I'm curious.

211
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:53,559
If any of these men
is your man,

212
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,839
please tell him
I want no trouble.

213
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,119
I don't have a man.

214
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,919
What use is a man?

215
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,119
Horse pulls the wagon.

216
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,439
Dog keeps me safe.

217
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,239
Cat keeps me warm at night.

218
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:11,799
And if anybody's going to give
you trouble, Tommy Shelby,

219
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,119
it'll be me.

220
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,959
What do you want?

221
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,919
Tell 'em to leave.

222
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,639
What, you think <i>I'm</i> in charge
here?

223
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,319
Oh, I'm sure of it, Esme.

224
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,839
Didicoy's too grand to put his
arse on the grass these days?

225
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,799
I have a daughter, Esme.

226
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,639
Her name is Ruby.

227
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,599
She's fallen ill suddenly.

228
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,359
She's very sick.

229
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,199
And I can tell...

230
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,479
<i>...by</i> saying her name
and looking in your eyes. <i>..</i>

231
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,999
<i>...that</i> I have wasted petrol,
time and hope.

232
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,919
Wasted petrol on what?

233
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,519
Ah...

234
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,679
Tommy Shelby OBE MP. <i>..</i>

235
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,439
...running around
the mountains

236
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,199
in pursuit of a Gypsy curse,
is that it?

237
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,639
I thought you had
Polly deal with the spirits.

238
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,879
Polly is dead.

239
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,799
Bullet or blade?

240
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,439
Still speaks to me
in my dreams.

241
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,319
It was her who told me
come find you.

242
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,919
Polly...

243
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,999
That name like the ringing
of the school bell.

244
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,599
"Come and do as you're told."

245
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,199
Fuck!

246
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:07,399
I am so glad I'm not
in your camp any more.

247
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,279
Made of bricks and bars.

248
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,959
My daughter is dying, Esme.

249
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,359
Some people go to France,
to Lourdes.

250
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,079
I hear they sell trinkets.

251
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,839
I need more than
fucking trinkets.

252
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,959
I can tell from your reaction
this is not your doing.

253
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,079
Sorry for troubling you.

254
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,159
The butler says our American
friend is parking the car.

255
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,759
He also says, in answer
to your inquiry, Diana,

256
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:56,519
that the coat our exotic friend
is wearing is made by Chanel.

257
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,959
That's a very expensive label.

258
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,199
Yes, it is.

259
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,719
But the perfume I can smell
on you is very cheap.

260
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:14,839
I am deeply, deeply annoyed
that Thomas isn'<i>t</i> here.

261
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,639
It is a family
emergency, apparently.

262
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,679
We only have Ada. The sister.

263
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,319
Well, would the sister
like some more champagne?

264
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,879
Oh, the sister is allowed
to speak?

265
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,319
She thinks this lunch
is purely social.

266
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:33,399
The sister is here because
there's sickness in the family.

267
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,679
Thomas wanted someone
from the Shelby organisation

268
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,519
to introduce Mr Nelson to you

269
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:40,199
and to offer all three of you
an invitation.

270
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,919
Ooh.

271
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,679
What invitation?

272
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,559
The invitation can wait.

273
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,599
And please remember that,
in this moment, in this room,

274
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:51,079
it is the Shelby family
that holds the power,

275
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,799
because we have the information
and the incentives

276
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,719
that will make Mr Nelson
do what you require him to do.

277
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,399
So when I speak, please keep
your fucking mouths closed,

278
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,039
because,
although I'm reluctant,

279
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,519
I am actually quite good
at this.

280
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,319
And yes, I will have champagne.

281
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,839
- Ah.
- Take care of this.

282
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:17,279
OK, so before
these dull introductions begin,

283
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,399
I just have to tell you
something that my niece Gina

284
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,759
- just told me.
- Jack.

285
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,319
She said the Shelby family
are all witches and sorcerers

286
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,999
who speak freely with the dead.

287
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,959
So. <i>..who</i> here's a Shelby?

288
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:33,679
Is it true?

289
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,679
Hmm. Gina.

290
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,879
Hello, Ada.

291
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,159
Michael sends his regards.

292
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,919
You're the sister.

293
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,359
Yes, it seems I am indeed
the sister.

294
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:48,439
I did some research.
You were a communist once,

295
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,119
but diamonds and lipstick now.

296
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,799
Actually, I'm a socialist.

297
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,199
She's Mr Shelby's
political adviser.

298
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,199
And you, you're the future
Prime Minister of Great Britain

299
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,559
- and its dominions.
- Indeed I am.

300
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,239
And you, Lady Diana Mitford,

301
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,119
the talk of London with
her amphetamines and emeralds.

302
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,559
It's her sharp mind
that I'm in love <i>with.</i>

303
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,679
Men bore me.

304
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,159
Ada, do you have a man?

305
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,359
My husband died,
but of course we speak often.

306
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:21,479
Between
this sparkling conversation,

307
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,719
could I get a drink
of some kind?

308
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,679
So, this little kid Gina,
she runs out,

309
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,439
she marries a gangster,

310
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,479
and now here we all are.

311
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,959
Oh, Jack, please,
you're so blunt.

312
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,439
Yes, it's wonderful. A man who
is not careful with his words.

313
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,679
I'm not careful.

314
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,519
Just say it first, and then
clear up the broken glass

315
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:42,999
with my bare hands.

316
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,319
There you are.

317
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:46,959
I don'<i>t</i> seem to have
a drink either.

318
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,359
Well, I have Scotch or Irish.

319
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:53,839
- Thomas drinks Irish.
- Where the hell is he?

320
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,359
Irish.

321
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,319
He's been unavoidably detained.

322
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,559
Nothing's unavoidable.

323
00:21:58,679 --> 00:21:59,879
His daughter is unwell.

324
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,559
He doesn'<i>t</i> have a wife?

325
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,999
You know, I did some research
on you too, Mr Nelson.

326
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,319
Ada here is the smart one

327
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,559
- of the family.
- I learnt

328
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,919
that when you were young,
you lost a brother and a sister

329
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,999
to consumption.

330
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,319
No ice?

331
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:29,559
Well, that same awful illness
has entered our family.

332
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,159
And, you see,
Thomas has very little faith

333
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,879
in current medical practices
regarding tuberculosis.

334
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,679
- Man, he has <i>that</i> right.
- He's gone off in search

335
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,479
of alternative approaches
to curing the disease,

336
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,079
experimental work that he hopes
will save the life

337
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,279
of his daughter.

338
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,959
In his shoes, I would do
the same thing.

339
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,639
Your brother intrigues me.

340
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,559
Yes, he often has that effect
on people.

341
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,079
Yes, and my future husband
has that effect on

342
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:58,039
20 million people in this
country who attend his rallies

343
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,999
and listen to his broadcasts.

344
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,159
It's amazing...

345
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:05,439
<i>...what</i> English
upper-class women can do

346
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,799
with just skin, bone
and arrogance.

347
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,719
My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

348
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,479
and would like to invite all of
you to his home for a meeting,

349
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,999
a meeting where the real
business will be done,

350
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,239
and where you can meet
like minds from Ireland

351
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,279
who would also like to discuss
the future of Europe.

352
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:28,319
But, as you say,
this lunch is purely social.

353
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:32,159
And looking at my glass, I see
I still don'<i>t</i> have champagne.

354
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,319
Michael told me
the sister had gone straight.

355
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,359
Yes, but her brother
is the sun.

356
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,879
The rest just orbit around him.

357
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,399
Gina tells me lots of things,

358
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,279
but I want to hear it from you,
Ada.

359
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:53,239
What exactly does
the Shelby Company Limited do?

360
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,839
Fuck!

361
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,039
You used to have eyes
in the back of your head.

362
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,839
How can you change so much
and not change at all?

363
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:43,159
I have other lines of enquiry.
Give me the spark plug.

364
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,519
Give me the...

365
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,159
Give me the fucking spark plug.

366
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,879
Give you the spark, give you
hope? Is that what you want?

367
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,839
Something you should see.

368
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,679
Someone dead.

369
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,599
Someone grieving.

370
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,519
Lot of hate against you.

371
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,559
You were wise to come to me,
Thomas.

372
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,999
Open the bonnet, would you?

373
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,839
What hate?

374
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:21,399
What hate? What grieving?

375
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,559
I can'<i>t</i> explain where it is
you have to go,

376
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,879
so I'll take you there.

377
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,679
I hope the suspension's good.

378
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,239
We're going
to a wild old place.

379
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:12,359
Mrs Thorne,
Mr Shelby isn'<i>t</i> here.

380
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:14,439
I know. I am.

381
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,039
Do you know where he's gone?

382
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,639
He's gone up a mountain
looking for a miracle.

383
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,679
No-one is allowed to go in
if he's not here.

384
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,399
Just bring me the keys.

385
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,919
All of the keys.

386
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,999
Do you want tea, Mrs Thorne?

387
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,999
Whisky.

388
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,039
Mr Shelby doesn'<i>t</i> allow whisky
in the building any more.

389
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,519
Then have someone
go and fetch some.

390
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:03,799
Until Mr Shelby comes down off
his mountain, I'm in charge.

391
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,319
Yes, Mrs Thorne.

392
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:41,839
Fuck.

393
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:07,399
Mickey, I've got to go.
The boss's sister is here.

394
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,159
For the next five days,
I'm not the boss's sister,

395
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,639
I'm the boss.

396
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,319
Where is Arthur?

397
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:15,279
We locked him in the cash safe.

398
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:17,319
When he gets the yamps
really bad,

399
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:19,399
he tells us to lock him
in the safe,

400
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,879
to stop him from slipping down
to Chinatown.

401
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:25,919
- What are the yamps?
- When you lose your head.

402
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,399
When you can'<i>t</i>
control yourself.

403
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,679
Young people say <i>it.</i>

404
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,679
Hmm. And Arthur gets the yamps
a lot?

405
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,439
A lot is twice a day.

406
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,679
Arthur gets them
three times a day.

407
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,999
It smells in here.

408
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,559
Arthur sleeps on the floor.
We lock him in at night.

409
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,999
On your feet.

410
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,039
Sit down.

411
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,359
Nice perfume.

412
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,959
Tommy likes you, Isiah.

413
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,519
I believe I'm suited
to this life.

414
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,679
I'm not so sure about you.

415
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,839
I was given to understand

416
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,439
that you are no longer part
of the company.

417
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,279
Hmm.

418
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:21,079
You speak well.

419
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:23,519
I was going to be an accountant

420
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,599
but everybody said I'd be
wasted counting money. <i>..</i>

421
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,359
<i>..</i> .Instead of stealing <i>it.</i>

422
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,159
What's the name
of that perfume?

423
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,919
I've got a girlfriend
with a birthday.

424
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,799
I want you to go to Liverpool.

425
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:41,159
Then I will go to Liverpool.

426
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,359
We have opium in storage
at the Salthouse Docks.

427
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,599
Word got out
among the dock workers.

428
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,679
They started stealing cupfuls.
Now it's by the bucket.

429
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,719
By the bucket?

430
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,119
The audacity of <i>it.</i>

431
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:58,559
The sale of the stolen opium
is being organised

432
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,959
by a union convenor
called Hayden Stagg.

433
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,679
In the envelope you'll find
details of where to find him

434
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,279
and what to do to him
when you do.

435
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,839
Is there a black star
in the envelope?

436
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,799
I decided not.

437
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,519
<i>You</i> decided?

438
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,479
The name of the perfume is

439
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,799
know your fucking place,
soldier.

440
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,959
I decided

441
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,279
he'll just take a beating,

442
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:31,279
and, also, that you're
going to take Arthur with you.

443
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:33,839
Arthur, ten days clean,

444
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,559
and we're gonna take him
into a warehouse

445
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,679
full of fucking opium?

446
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,999
It can be your job
to look after him.

447
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,599
Why take him at all?

448
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,079
It's his reputation
you're taking.

449
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:46,399
The beating can be conducted
in a civilised <i>way.</i>

450
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,919
No-one would dare fuck
with Arthur Shelby.

451
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,079
- But they would fuck with me?
- Yes.

452
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,919
He is Arthur Shelby.

453
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,679
You're Isiah...who?

454
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:03,159
I'm just Isiah...

455
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,159
<i>...who</i> is keen to learn, Ada.

456
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,839
Keep him clean.

457
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,439
Deal with Hayden Stagg.
Bring Arthur back in one piece.

458
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,879
And in return,
I won'<i>t</i> tell Tommy

459
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,599
that you're laying private bets
on races that we've fixed.

460
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,879
Just trying to make
a few extra pennies,

461
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,719
buy that birthday present
for my girlfriend.

462
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,319
Mmm, lucky girl.

463
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,239
Lock the door, Lizzie.
There are people around here

464
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,799
who start drinking
this early in the morning.

465
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,119
No.

466
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:34,239
I need to stay myself. <i>..</i>
be strong.

467
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,479
Now, come on, not with me.
You can let it go with me.

468
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,719
I can'<i>t</i> cry, Ada.
If I start, I'll fall apart.

469
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,959
I need to stay strong for Ruby.

470
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:49,199
Tommy says
it's just in one lung.

471
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:52,599
No. They now think
it's in both.

472
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,799
It's...moving quickly.

473
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,359
They collapsed the left lung
but it made no difference.

474
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,039
They're starting her
on the gold salts tomorrow.

475
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,399
You know somebody who died
on the gold treatment, yes?

476
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,839
Half the people I tell look
like you just did,

477
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:15,199
because they know someone
who died on the gold treatment.

478
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,479
The person I knew was old.

479
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,279
Huh. Old and young, the same.

480
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,199
Have you given up, Lizzie?

481
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,359
No.

482
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,079
I'm...being strong...

483
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,359
...at her bedside...
on my own...

484
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,519
<i>..</i> .while Tommy is up
in the mountains

485
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:43,319
to be amongst Gypsies.

486
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,559
In truth, it's a blessing

487
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,799
he's not around
at the hospital,

488
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:51,319
because all he wants to do
is fight people

489
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:53,079
and blame himself,

490
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,919
and I've never felt
so ashamed of him,

491
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,319
Christ, because right now I <i>...</i>
I need a normal man.

492
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,799
It's me sitting there,
taking away the bloody rags

493
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,599
and watching her disappear.

494
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,919
Do you know when he's back,
Ada?

495
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,839
He gave me instructions,
not information.

496
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,119
Can you get a message to him?

497
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,719
He'll be out of reach.

498
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,839
Ada, I thought you might
know things.

499
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,319
I've been away from all this.

500
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,119
You're still Gypsy.

501
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,199
Yeah, well...
The mystery leaves you.

502
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,319
What mystery?

503
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,759
Lizzie, is there anything
practical that I can do?

504
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,279
Before he left, he was looking
for a number for Esme.

505
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,519
What's Esme got to do
with this?

506
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,599
I thought you might know.

507
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,359
Esme's a Lee.

508
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,519
What does that mean?

509
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:22,599
The Lees and the Barwells,
they're wild tribes.

510
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,999
Where do they live?

511
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:28,279
They're Gypsies.
They live where they like.

512
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,159
Fuck.

513
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,239
Fuck, Ada.

514
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,639
Tribes in the mountains!

515
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:43,079
It's 1934, and the doctors
know what it is,

516
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,559
they know what causes it,

517
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,599
but, oh, no, my husband,
he knows better.

518
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,759
Not a normal man, your brother.

519
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:51,479
He's up in the mountains
<i>with...</i>

520
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,199
...fucking horse thieves
and sorcerers

521
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,999
while I'm here on my own.

522
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,799
Not a normal man.

523
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,399
It's OK, Arthur.
I'll look after you.

524
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,319
Yeah.

525
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:57,439
And Ada said it'd be OK
if I recruited my cousins -

526
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:00,959
off the streets of Alum Rock
and looking for the big time.

527
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,519
What do you say, Arthur?

528
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,679
I say big-time boys
don't ask for permission.

529
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,759
I think he means you're in.

530
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,319
Let's go.

531
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,279
Can you still ride bareback?

532
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,079
We're a long <i>way</i> from anywhere,
Esme.

533
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,559
If I find out
you've been wasting my time,

534
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,879
I'll use that rope
to fucking hang you.

535
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,759
Right, hold up,
Hold on, hold on.

536
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:27,559
Listen, you know
what you've got to do, right?

537
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,559
You've got your orders.
I'm depending on you.

538
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,079
Do you hear me?

539
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,959
Let me tell you something.

540
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,319
Any man, any fucking man
who looked like this before. <i>..</i>

541
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,319
<i>...they</i>'re Peaky Blinder.

542
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:45,879
Peaky Blinder
still looks like this. <i>..</i>

543
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,839
...after.

544
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:20,599
We are here to meet a gentleman
called Hayden Stagg.

545
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,519
A gentleman?

546
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:26,799
Mr Stagg?

547
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,319
That scoundrel.

548
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,759
Never there when you need him.

549
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,759
Who needs him?

550
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,119
We do.

551
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,919
Where is he?

552
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,319
The last I saw, he was. <i>..</i>

553
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:50,839
<i>..</i> .Up to his balls in a lady
called Maria.

554
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,839
We have no time for tradition

555
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:58,919
or the rules of
the sporting life,

556
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,639
because, among
the Peaky Blinders,

557
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:05,759
any man who comes home from
a mission with all his bullets,

558
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:07,719
he pays a fine.

559
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,399
My name's Hayden Stagg.

560
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,239
I hear there's some men here
from Birmingham looking for me.

561
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:18,879
I was in the banana warehouse
playing football with the boys.

562
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,759
But I'm guessing you gentlemen
aren'<i>t</i> here to kick footballs.

563
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,559
No.

564
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,439
We're here
about other business.

565
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,999
We like to call it
Black Star business.

566
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:42,199
The Black Star a pub, is it?

567
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,639
Yeah. The Black Star's a pub.

568
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,359
The last pub
you ever fucking drink in.

569
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,439
Peaky Blinders
take you to the Black Star. <i>..</i>

570
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,399
<i>..</i> .And all your troubles
are done.

571
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:00,479
But the pub <i>you</i> drink in,
Mr Stagg...

572
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:04,319
...is called the Dolphin,
right?

573
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,159
Every night. <i>..you</i>'re in there.

574
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,319
Not to drink.

575
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:14,439
You're there divvying up
the day's takings, ain'<i>t</i> ya?

576
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,679
And there's a woman there.

577
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,079
She sings out,
"Opium for sale! "

578
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,999
Sit down, boys.

579
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,479
The rules say the king
puts his head on the block

580
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,039
when the game's up.

581
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,679
You're stealing from
the Shelby Company Limited.

582
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,879
You're stealing from
the Peaky Blinders, man.

583
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:51,759
Therefore...

584
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:55,799
...punishment...

585
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:59,999
...is a visit
to the Black Star pub.

586
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,279
Hmm.

587
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:08,679
But. <i>..out</i> of kindness. <i>..</i>

588
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:12,039
...of my heart...

589
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,279
<i>..</i> .your sentence
has been commuted.

590
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:18,999
Praise the fucking Lord!

591
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,159
And our lovely Ada, eh?

592
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:27,559
Instead...

593
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:32,039
<i>..</i> .instead, Mr Hayden Stagg,
it's just a beating for you.

594
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,919
Well, before
I take this beating. <i>..</i>

595
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,959
Arthur Shelby, is it, yeah?

596
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:47,279
Well, comrade, beneath
your sleeves lies the truth.

597
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:49,039
The marks on your arm.

598
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:51,359
Yeah.

599
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:53,999
Stories about you
come up the canal.

600
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,039
You know, where once
you walked fine alone,

601
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,079
now you need a stick.

602
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,079
Let's just fucking do it,
Arthur.

603
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:05,959
For me, it was the morphine
they gave us in France.

604
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,759
I got a taste for it, Arthur.

605
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:13,359
It was 1924 before I realised
the fucking war was over.

606
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:18,559
There's a warehouse full of it
just across the yard, there,

607
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,839
where the boys play football.

608
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:23,719
And they steal it
and roll around laughing,

609
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,719
and it floats in the air.

610
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:31,199
But I'm strong, comrade.

611
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,559
Arthur, let's just
fucking do it.

612
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,719
Liar.

613
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,679
It's me that's due a beating,

614
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:41,959
but it's me who feels sorry
for <i>you,</i> Mr Shelby,

615
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,399
because you take your beating
every hour of every day.

616
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:50,639
Your own blood betrays you,
because it demands dilution.

617
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,159
Sometimes you want
to cut a doorway in your arm

618
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:58,439
so your blood can escape
and leave you in blessed peace.

619
00:44:58,559 --> 00:44:59,719
Yeah.

620
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,919
Fuck you, man.

621
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,399
I was once where you are now,
Arthur.

622
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:11,359
If you're going to do it,
do it.

623
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:14,439
But look at me
as the man you can be.

624
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,479
You've tried Jesus, yeah?

625
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,759
Yeah, he looked you up and down
and he shook his head.

626
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:24,239
Your loved ones?

627
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:28,239
Your wife, your kids?

628
00:45:32,919 --> 00:45:36,919
Jesus and your wife
and your kids can'<i>t</i> help you.

629
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:42,039
Only you, Arthur Shelby.

630
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:45,399
Only you.

631
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:47,399
Don'<i>t</i> count the days.

632
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,199
Futile.

633
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,079
You get to 100,
and then you wake up

634
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:52,759
and it's fucking one again.

635
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,239
Don'<i>t</i> build mountains.

636
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:01,079
Walk like it's a flat plain.

637
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:05,879
Easy step. <i>..by</i> easy step.

638
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:09,519
Arthur, just give me

639
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:11,759
the fucking word!
I'll fucking do it!

640
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,039
Use your stick, Arthur.
Give him the order.

641
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,839
Arthur, I'm not gonna
ask you fucking twice!

642
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:29,679
- Isiah, leave him alone.
- No. <i>..</i> No fucking <i>way.</i>

643
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:33,519
Isiah, I said
you can stand down!

644
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:51,919
Be off. Let's go. Come on.

645
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:54,679
Come on, all of ya! Go on.

646
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:56,039
Go on!

647
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:34,199
Gypsy graveyard?

648
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,079
You can still read the signs?

649
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,239
No horse will go beyond here.
We'll have to walk.

650
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,839
Just tell me whose grave it is.

651
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:51,679
You'll see.

652
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:53,799
Who knows what you'll see?

653
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:58,199
Do you ever go to John's grave?

654
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,879
When things are really bad.

655
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,839
When what's really bad?

656
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:03,919
I've done bad things, Esme.

657
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,719
And you think now you're being
punished for them?

658
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,599
I would like to make amends.

659
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:12,399
You want to lift every curse
anyone's ever put on you?

660
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:14,239
That's a lot of lifting.

661
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:16,119
My own curse is in there
somewhere.

662
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:17,879
I should have done more
to protect John.

663
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:19,079
You think in this holy place

664
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,159
the spirits are listening
to you being kind?

665
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:24,239
Believe it or not, Esme,
I'm discovering kindness.

666
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,439
I'm learning it
from my children.

667
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,919
Do you ever think
you've lost your mind, Thomas?

668
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:33,759
Lost it long ago. I only use
the crate it came in.

669
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:37,159
- I know <i>why</i> you're here.
- I'm in a hurry, Esme.

670
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:39,439
You think you can make a deal
even with death?

671
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:42,239
Well, soon you'll be
in the right place to do <i>it.</i>

672
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,799
The village disappeared.
Church fell down.

673
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:46,839
Only us still use
the graveyard.

674
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,319
Do you recall a sapphire?

675
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,159
You gave a sapphire to
a woman called Bethany Barwell.

676
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:56,759
Ten years ago.

677
00:48:56,879 --> 00:48:58,759
She took the stone back
to her camp.

678
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,479
I warned her about it,
but she took it <i>anyway.</i>

679
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,159
She gave the sapphire
to her sister.

680
00:49:04,279 --> 00:49:05,959
Evadne Barwell.

681
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,839
Evadne put the stone around
the neck of her daughter.

682
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:10,359
A little girl.

683
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,839
Straight away, the little girl
began to cough.

684
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,559
She died that night.

685
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:19,959
Seven years old.

686
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:30,399
I heard they threw the sapphire
in the river.

687
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:32,839
No-one's ever gone
to look for <i>it.</i>

688
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:36,719
I'm guessing
it'll be the girl's mother

689
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,359
who laid the curse.

690
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:40,599
Only women can lay curses.

691
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:44,599
Perhaps she waited till
your little girl was seven,

692
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:47,079
so you'd know how it feels.

693
00:49:58,399 --> 00:50:00,279
- Do you have whisky?
- No.

694
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:18,479
Tommy!

695
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,639
Perhaps the treatment will work
and your daughter will live.

696
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:26,079
It's science.

697
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:28,599
Science is winning everything
these days.

698
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:30,959
Even against the angels.

699
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:38,399
I can leave you, if you <i>want.</i>

700
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:41,039
Your horse'll know
its <i>way</i> back.

701
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:43,199
But I think there should be
some reward

702
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:46,079
for what I have shown you,
some consideration.

703
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:48,799
You can afford it,
Mr Shelby OBE.

704
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:51,679
I will find her.

705
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,919
I will find this fucking
Evadne Barwell,

706
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:55,479
I will fucking find her,

707
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,599
and I will give her money
to take back this curse!

708
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,839
You only found me
because I wanted to be found.

709
00:50:59,959 --> 00:51:01,959
And the Barwells roam
from the border to the sea.

710
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,159
I will give her £10,000.
More. Anything!

711
00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:05,399
You will put out word, Esme.

712
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:07,199
You will put out word.
I will put out word,

713
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:08,839
and I will find her!
And instead

714
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:10,799
- of this poor wooden cross. <i>..</i>
- Tommy!

715
00:51:10,919 --> 00:51:13,679
<i>...</i> I will build a monument
to this little girl!

716
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:15,159
Her mother can decide how big.

717
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:17,959
It can be as big as
fucking Nelson's Column.

718
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,799
That, and £1 O,000!

719
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:23,719
I will buy her off.
I will start looking today.

720
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,079
Ruby will be well!

721
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:28,199
She will be well!

722
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,319
And I will undo the many wrongs
that I have done!

723
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:33,999
Now that I'm without whisky,
I can hear the spirits clearly,

724
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,439
and they're saying that Ruby
will be well if I make amends.

725
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,799
That is the conversation!

726
00:51:37,919 --> 00:51:39,359
If you want my help,
I will help you, Thomas,

727
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:42,839
if you also pay me. Pay me and
I will help you to find her.

728
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:44,959
- I will pay you.
- But I don'<i>t want</i> money.

729
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:47,519
I don'<i>t</i> read the papers,
but I know there was a crash,

730
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:49,799
and nothing is certain,
and money loses value.

731
00:51:49,919 --> 00:51:52,439
Instead of money, give me gold.

732
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,039
Gold. Yes.

733
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:55,359
I will give you gold.

734
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,679
In uncertain times,
gold is always certain.

735
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:01,799
I will give you gold. And you
will help me find this woman.

736
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,439
And she will spare my daughter.

737
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,399
- Lizzie!
- Where the fuck were you?!

738
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:30,119
Where were you?
Where the fuck were you?!

739
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,479
She's gone, Tommy.

740
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:42,639
She's gone.

741
00:52:44,399 --> 00:52:46,279
Just now. 5. 17.

742
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,679
You weren'<i>t</i> fucking here. <i>..</i>
were you?

743
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:57,399
Were you?

744
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:10,519
It was before then,
and she was here,

745
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:11,839
and then she was gone,

746
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:14,439
and now she's gone to
where they've put the dead.

747
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:18,959
They've put her
with the dead people.

748
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,519
She was asking, just now,
for you...

749
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:34,159
<i>...but went...</i>

750
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,519
...at 5. 17.

751
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,039
I told her that you loved. <i>..</i>

752
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:53,959
I gave her your kiss goodbye.

753
00:53:53,983 --> 00:54:01,983
