1
00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:03,913
<i>There's a war coming, a terrible war.</i>

2
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:05,548
<i>There will be chaos.</i>

3
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:06,683
Rivers of blood in the streets.

4
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:07,884
I know it.

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:09,052
I-I can see it coming.

6
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:10,687
<i>MOONEY: It's time.</i>

7
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:13,823
<i>Somebody has to take over.
It might as well be me.</i>

8
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:15,658
(screams)

9
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:18,261
I'm looking for a connection
between the Arkham plan

10
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:19,495
and the murders of my parents.

11
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,530
If Maroni gets even

12
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:22,598
<i>a piece of Arkham,</i>

13
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>it will prove Falcone is weak.</i>

14
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:26,536
<i>GORDON: Don't ever come back to Gotham.</i>

15
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,038
Hello, James, old friend.

16
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:30,573
I told you never to come back here!

17
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:32,375
Nobody looks for a dead man.

18
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,345
- So, you want the job or what?
- Yes.

19
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:37,447
I ain't looking for no girl.

20
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,614
<i>I'm looking for a weapon.</i>

21
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:40,049
<i>MARONI: Falcone thinks he can hit me,</i>

22
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,784
in my place of business,

23
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:42,719
and get away with it?

24
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:43,886
I want to hit him back.

25
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:54,931
Fancy a stroll?

26
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:57,800
It's a lovely day.

27
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:00,336
Stretch the legs, breath of fresh air.

28
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:01,704
Busy.

29
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,875
I've got a question for you, Master Bruce.

30
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,078
What if all this was a complete

31
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:11,281
and utter bloody waste of time?

32
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:15,285
What if you never discovered
who killed your mom and dad?

33
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,655
Hmm?

34
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,226
What if you never get to wreak revenge?

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,462
I don't want revenge.

36
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:29,232
I want to understand how it all works.

37
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:30,600
How Gotham works.

38
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:32,035
Well, you'd have more chance

39
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:34,003
digging to China with a teaspoon.

40
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,905
Take the Arkham project for instance.

41
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,974
How did the Falcone and Maroni

42
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,610
crime families get such
big shares in the deal?

43
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:41,911
I mean,

44
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:43,479
I know City Hall is corrupt,

45
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:46,816
but why didn't Wayne
Enterprises do something?

46
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:50,119
Can you pass me that
blue folder over there?

47
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:57,026
Well, I suppose as hobbies go,

48
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,162
this is damn sight better

49
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:02,999
than grilling yourself
like a bloody pork chop.

50
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,468
Still, not particularly healthy, is it?

51
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:07,704
Thank you.

52
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:11,040
Are you listening to me?

53
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:12,609
Y-Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

54
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,144
I'll take a walk later. Thank you, Alfred.

55
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,686
I won a piece of Arkham.

56
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:25,388
I strong-armed the mayor.

57
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:26,956
I made Falcone back down.

58
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:30,159
And you're telling me that
I can't rob a lousy casino?

59
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:33,963
Sal, the casino is Falcone's pride and joy.

60
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:35,531
I mean, what's the point?

61
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,433
For a few thousand bucks,
why mess with Falcone?

62
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:39,135
That's the point.

63
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,803
Messing with Falcone.

64
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:42,906
I want him and his people to
know we're not backing off.

65
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,008
Arkham was only the beginning.

66
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,676
We're taking over, Frankie.

67
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,177
Inch by inch.

68
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,446
- Okay, but...
- But, but, but!

69
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:53,449
- Make it happen.
- Okay, boss.

70
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,027
What are you looking at?
You got something to say?

71
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:07,096
No, sir. Nothing at all.

72
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:12,135
(guitar playing)

73
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,212
Here you go, buddy.

74
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:27,250
(car horn honks)

75
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:47,136
Hey!

76
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,038
Hey, man!

77
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,764
(panting, heart beating)

78
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,440
(skin crackling)

79
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:26,476
(gasping)

80
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,881
(doorbells jingle, electronic bell chimes)

81
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,100
Hey!

82
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:55,171
Hey! You got to pay for that!

83
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:57,574
(burps)

84
00:04:57,608 --> 00:05:01,478
Do not vex me, mortal.

85
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:02,846
Yeah?

86
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,583
Suit yourself, Zeus.

87
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:21,698
Hey, might look like the
heel of a hobo's shoe...

88
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,600
best burgers in Midtown. Huh, Ephraim?

89
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:24,734
If you say so.

90
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:26,836
All right, I want two cheeseburgers,

91
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:29,339
uh, hold the sauce, extra
pickles, two malted shakes.

92
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:30,707
No pickles on mine, please.

93
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:32,509
Oh, you got to trust me on this one, Jim.

94
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,345
Yeah? All right. Pickles, bring 'em.

95
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:45,188
BULLOCK: All right, now,
you want to look good

96
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,523
in a swimsuit like me come summertime,

97
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,925
you're gonna want a lot of
this and a lot of this, huh?

98
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,527
Is that right?

99
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:54,330
You!

100
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:55,565
Hey!

101
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,767
(tires screech)

102
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:00,904
(car horn honks)

103
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,409
BULLOCK: Jim!

104
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:08,111
Come on, it's lunchtime. Relax!

105
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:10,747
(alarm bell ringing in distance)

106
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:12,415
It's lunchtime!

107
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,886
No, Jim. We're on our... It-it's lunch!

108
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:18,555
Oh, brother.

109
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:22,025
Jim, can't just pop up and
jump every time you hear a bell.

110
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:24,060
(alarm bell stops)

111
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,865
GCPD! Anybody here?

112
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,767
MAN (grunting): Over... over here.

113
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,105
- (panting)
- You all right, sir?

114
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,506
You okay?

115
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,209
- Thank God you're here.
- Anybody dead?

116
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:40,510
I don't think so.

117
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:42,779
Some guy, he was stealing milk.

118
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:44,047
I try to stop him,

119
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:46,082
he hauls away my ATM machine.

120
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,517
BULLOCK: All right, nobody dead.

121
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,419
We're homicide, and it's lunch.

122
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:51,154
So have a good day, sir.

123
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:53,089
Call 911, and someone
will take good care of you.

124
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:55,091
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. One guy did this?

125
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,726
Stole your ATM over milk?

126
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:59,129
Little skinny-ass dude. Guitar case.

127
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,564
Drinking milk like there's no more cows.

128
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,800
"Don't vex me, mortal," he says.

129
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,335
Sorry, what?

130
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,804
MAN: Listen, if I had a
dollar for every hobo skeez

131
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:09,472
that walks through that
door, thinks they're God,

132
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:11,441
I wouldn't be here.

133
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:14,544
But this son of a bitch,
he wasn't fooling around.

134
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,880
All right, you get a
description of the vehicle,

135
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:18,014
license plate, something?

136
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:19,816
He didn't have a vehicle.

137
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,085
Then how'd he pull your ATM from the wall?

138
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,286
How'd he take it away?

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,754
That's what I'm telling you, man.

140
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,823
He pulled it out of
here with his bare hands.

141
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,661
(panting wildly)

142
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:46,638
(woman singing opera music over stereo)

143
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:49,274
(both singing to music)

144
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,512
(music stops)

145
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:55,981
I'm bored.

146
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,435
Poor little baby girl.

147
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,570
Cooped up in here all the time.

148
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,905
You want some excitement.

149
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,641
Yes, I do. Can we just go somewhere and...?

150
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:06,243
(groans)

151
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,712
How's that? Excited now?

152
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:10,514
What'd you do that for?

153
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,449
Why are you here with me?

154
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,819
I'm your secret weapon.

155
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,387
Exactly.

156
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,123
But are you helping me help you?

157
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:21,525
No, you're not.

158
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,460
You won't even learn the damn tune.

159
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:26,363
I told you this is important.

160
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:28,331
I'm sorry, mama.

161
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,066
I'm not your mama.

162
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:34,671
Now, you might be my baby
girl, but I'm not your mama.

163
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:36,273
Not yet.

164
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,276
You have to earn that.

165
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,016
(woman singing opera music over stereo)

166
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,051
(singing to music)

167
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,135
ESSEN: How is that even possible?

168
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,737
- Who is this guy?
- No positive I.D.

169
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:09,673
As of yet, he's a street guy.

170
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:10,874
We think that

171
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:13,710
this thing has something to do with his...

172
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:15,812
<i>excessive joi de vivre.</i>

173
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,681
Yeah, we found it in the
suspect's guitar case.

174
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:18,849
It's some kind of drug.

175
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,184
A drug did that?

176
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:22,686
Wow.

177
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,554
GORDON: Nygma found traces of the drug.

178
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,089
He'll have a read on what the hell

179
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,290
this thing is by tomorrow morning.

180
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:28,992
Meantime, we'll try
and I.D. the strong man.

181
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah.

182
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,679
I know your families are upset.

183
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,981
But tell them

184
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:53,183
everybody got a piece
of the Arkham project.

185
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,818
It was a business decision.

186
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:56,787
We didn't lose, Maroni didn't win.

187
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,722
Maroni thinks he won.

188
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:01,057
He thinks he won a great battle.

189
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:04,094
- We need to hurt him.
- No.

190
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:06,930
If we don't push back
hard, he's going to think...

191
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:09,833
Nikolai, that fool will think
what I want him to think.

192
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,635
No push back, not yet.

193
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:14,171
NIKOLAI: In my country, we say,

194
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:18,842
"Even a fool may bite the
king, if he has teeth."

195
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,178
MOONEY: Can the folklore, Niko.

196
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:23,513
We're not in your godforsaken country.

197
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:27,217
We are here in Gotham, where
we have plumbing, electricity,

198
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,352
and Don Falcone is the boss.

199
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,754
He's playing

200
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:33,390
that cluck Maroni on a long line. Done!

201
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,525
Why so angry, Fish?

202
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,861
I speak my mind. Is no crime.

203
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:40,597
And I assure you, in my country,

204
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,699
we have all modern conveniences.

205
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,701
Only difference: ladies.

206
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,236
Ladies are in kitchen or in bed,

207
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,305
depending on their talents.

208
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,574
I bet your mother was a lousy cook.

209
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,142
NIKOLAI: Don't speak of my mother.

210
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:53,577
Or what?

211
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:57,314
You gonna hit a lady?

212
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:58,515
That's enough.

213
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,550
There'll be no bad blood here.

214
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:02,986
My apologies, Don Falcone.

215
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:04,755
We need each other.

216
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,957
We're family.

217
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,668
Hey.

218
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,439
Excuse me. You seen this guy by chance?

219
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,840
WOMAN: Nah.

220
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,975
Mm-mm.

221
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,476
You seen this guy?

222
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,112
Excuse me.

223
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,516
Familiar to you, hmm?

224
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,484
Any chance you've seen this guy?

225
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,621
Yeah, I know him. That's, uh, Benny.

226
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,391
He's a guitar player.
Strung out like string.

227
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:44,394
- What'd he do?
- Uh, nothing bad.

228
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,063
Uh, he came into an inheritance actually

229
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:47,998
- no one knew about.
- That's right.

230
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,767
Million dollars. Farm, horses, real nice.

231
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,369
You know where can we find him?

232
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,204
$20.

233
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:57,874
Ten.

234
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,743
Same as the bodega.

235
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:03,180
Yeah, what's with all the dairy products?

236
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:09,820
Sir?

237
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,456
GCPD. Let me see those hands.

238
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,591
Oh... help me.

239
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,026
I need...

240
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,694
more...

241
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:19,529
More what? What'd you take?

242
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:22,597
- What is it?
- It's... it felt so good.

243
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,435
And now I-I don't feel so
good. Something's wrong.

244
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,237
I need more!

245
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,706
Please, you have to find him.

246
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:30,774
GORDON: Find who?

247
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,676
The guy that gave you the stuff? Yeah!

248
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,178
The man with a mangled ear.

249
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,080
The mangled ear. I got him.

250
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:39,216
Stay calm. We got it. Help me.

251
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,684
We're gonna help. Just put your...

252
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,886
- No, no, no, no!
- Hey, hey! Sir!

253
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,389
Sir, we need you to calm down.

254
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:46,456
Calm down. Please...

255
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:47,524
Put your hands behind your back!

256
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,427
(grunts)

257
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,165
(metal creaking)

258
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,302
I said no!

259
00:12:58,336 --> 00:12:59,736
Put it down!

260
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,371
(groans)

261
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,341
(bones crackling)

262
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,278
(gasping)

263
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,227
What the hell?

264
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:29,766
God help us if that drug gets out.

265
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,510
ALFRED: Will you look at this shambles?

266
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:04,849
What would your mother say?

267
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:07,318
You know, I have a half a mind to

268
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:10,488
stick all this lot straight
into the bloody fire.

269
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:12,857
- No fire.
- We'll see about that.

270
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:15,126
Come on, up you get.

271
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,295
Wayne Enterprises is hosting

272
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:20,131
a charitable luncheon tomorrow.

273
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,700
And I took the liberty of
accepting their kind invitation

274
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,169
on your behalf, Master Bruce.

275
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:25,770
Good.

276
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:27,372
Is there breakfast?

277
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:30,041
Yeah, I'll make you an egg.

278
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:31,709
Does that mean you'll go?

279
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,578
Yes.

280
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:36,447
I have some questions I need
to ask the members of the board.

281
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:39,717
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

282
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:41,352
It seems very likely those gangsters

283
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:44,622
were actually given their shares
in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.

284
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:47,859
Well, that's how business
is done, isn't it?

285
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,460
Is it?

286
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:54,098
M-My parents didn't do business that way.

287
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,734
- Did they?
- No.

288
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,369
No, they didn't, Master Bruce.

289
00:14:58,404 --> 00:15:00,338
The board might not know, of course.

290
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,841
There's quite a bit of
clever camouflage used.

291
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,177
Shell companies, offshore
accounts and so forth.

292
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:08,746
Right. So, you-you've...

293
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,749
learned all that from all this, did you?

294
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:15,019
Fantastic detective work.

295
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:17,055
I still, however, want to get the whole lot

296
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,890
and chuck it straight in the fire.

297
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,992
Don't put anything in the fire, Alfred.

298
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:23,428
That's an order.

299
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:25,463
Right, Master Bruce.

300
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,467
Nothing in the fire.

301
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:39,544
<i>WOMAN (over TV): We are
live in downtown Gotham</i>

302
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:42,380
<i>where a deadly new drug
has hit the streets.</i>

303
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:45,750
<i>Nicknamed "Viper," users
of this mystery drug</i>

304
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:48,386
<i>acquire great strength and
a euphoric sense of power,</i>

305
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,822
<i>but only for a few brief hours.</i>

306
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:54,292
<i>Then, without exception,
they die a horrible death.</i>

307
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,060
(crashing, crowd clamoring)

308
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:01,699
Let me out!

309
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:06,638
WOMAN: Get off me!

310
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,777
Let go of me!

311
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:13,812
(grunts)

312
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:18,116
WOMAN: Get your crummy hands off me!

313
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,819
(clamoring continues)

314
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,490
NYGMA: It's really quite remarkable.

315
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:28,827
Viper somehow activates unused DNA.

316
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:30,395
The body starts to burn calcium

317
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,297
from the skeletal system as fuel.

318
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,133
Hence the victims' cravings
for milk and cheese.

319
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:38,236
They're desperately trying to
replace the missing calcium.

320
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,138
But they can't consume enough.

321
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:43,241
Essentially, their bones crumble.

322
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:44,976
Then they suffocate and die.

323
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,478
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

324
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,446
No. Nobody has. Totally new.

325
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:50,849
I cannot tell you how
thrilled I am to be...

326
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:52,350
No new reports for a few hours now.

327
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:54,719
Maybe they're done. Maybe
they ran out of the stuff.

328
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:55,720
I doubt it.

329
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:57,956
Who would put this on the street?

330
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,957
Why?

331
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,159
Th-They're not even selling
it. They're giving it away.

332
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:03,294
That's how you create demand.

333
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:04,996
For a drug that kills you that fast?

334
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,664
Well, first it makes you king of the world.

335
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,032
There'll be takers.

336
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,467
There'll be mayhem, that's for sure.

337
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:10,935
But it's skell-on-skell mayhem.

338
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,370
If we keep the decent citizens indoors

339
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,806
for a couple of weeks, let
the scumbags have at it,

340
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,608
voilà... the end of crime.

341
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:19,444
Yeah, that's a nice thought. But no.

342
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:22,047
This stuff seems hard to make, no?

343
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,015
Oh, it takes a high level
of technical sophistication.

344
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,717
A state-of-the-art lab made this stuff.

345
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:28,286
Okay, so who has the biggest
and best lab in the city?

346
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,455
The best is WellZyn.

347
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,123
But this is not them.

348
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:34,125
They're a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.

349
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,061
Multibillion-dollar corporation.

350
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,529
Why would they be doing this?

351
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:39,998
I don't know, but we might
as well start at the top.

352
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:41,800
(woman screams)

353
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,001
OFFICER: Grab her! Grab her!

354
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,402
Come on, here! Let go of me!

355
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:47,672
Get off me! Get off me!

356
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:49,040
(grunting)

357
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:50,875
(gasping)

358
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,044
(bones crackling)

359
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:01,386
Fascinating.

360
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:03,822
Fascinating!

361
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:05,990
<i>WOMAN: Breaking news. Continued mayhem...</i>

362
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,193
Maybe I should hire that
guy to take the casino.

363
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,295
Maybe you should snort
some Viper, grow a pair.

364
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:11,730
Either way, I want that casino taken.

365
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:13,331
Sure, we'll take it.

366
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:16,167
I mean, it's tight as
a nut... ten armed guards

367
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:18,737
blast-proof doors, cameras.

368
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:21,940
We're gonna lose a few
guys, but we'll take it.

369
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:24,109
Excuse me, gentlemen.

370
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,910
I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation

371
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:27,178
regarding the casino.

372
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,847
Go mind your business.

373
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:30,648
I'm sorry. Of course. So sorry.

374
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:34,219
No. Tell me, what about the casino?

375
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:38,556
I know a janitor who runs
the boiler room of the casino.

376
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:41,526
He could get you inside
quite easily, I believe.

377
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,461
There are access tunnels
that nobody knows about.

378
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,297
Access tunnels?

379
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,399
Sit down. Come here.

380
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:50,702
Thank you, sir. A great honor indeed.

381
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:52,637
What's your name again?

382
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:54,773
Everyone here calls me Penguin, sir.

383
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:56,775
You don't like that name, huh?

384
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:01,112
Yeah, well, you're wrong. It's a good name.

385
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:03,148
Works for you.

386
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,951
So how do you know this man?

387
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,153
The janitor?

388
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:11,556
- I have connections.
- Reliable, is he?

389
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,792
I think I can persuade him to be.

390
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,927
Boss, this guy is a dishwasher in a suit.

391
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:17,729
Relax.

392
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:19,831
Is that right, Penguin?

393
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:22,100
Are you just a dishwasher?

394
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:23,802
'Cause I don't get that vibe.

395
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:26,004
You come off as all humble, but...

396
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,239
you got a little player in you, huh?

397
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:30,942
That's very perceptive
of you, sir. (chuckles)

398
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,844
I guess that's why you're the don.

399
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:34,846
- Well...
- (both chuckle)

400
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,282
I'm not a dishwasher.

401
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:40,919
And this isn't my first rodeo, so to speak.

402
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:42,988
(both laugh)

403
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:44,422
So, you've rode some bulls, huh?

404
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:46,358
- Well...
- I knew it.

405
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,993
Well, tell all, cowboy.

406
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:51,463
Well, my real name is Oswald Cobblepot.

407
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:52,464
Mm-hmm.

408
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,332
And I think that once you hear my story,

409
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,801
you'll agree that I could be
a great asset for you, sir.

410
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:58,203
Hmm.

411
00:19:58,237 --> 00:20:00,171
It's a long, funny story really.

412
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:03,108
But the headline, just
so you're not surprised...

413
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,710
I used to work for Fish Mooney.

414
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:07,612
Fish Mooney?

415
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:09,047
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,950
I was privy to many aspects
of the Falcone family business.

417
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:14,286
Until they tried to kill me.

418
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
- Yeah, well...
- (laughs)

419
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:17,289
- Hello.
- (both laugh)

420
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:18,657
Suffice it to say...

421
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,059
(grunts)

422
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,627
That is a funny story.

423
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,129
Mm.

424
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,376
I'm Taylor Reece,

425
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:41,012
general counsel, public
relations for WellZyn.

426
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:42,647
Good morning, gentlemen.

427
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:45,350
Thank you for saving us a trip.

428
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:48,186
We were en route as soon as we
were apprised of your inquiries.

429
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,523
WellZyn is committed to
good community relations.

430
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:52,757
What do you know about Viper?

431
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,226
Only what we see on the news.

432
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,028
WellZyn has no connection to this tragedy.

433
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,663
We will vigorously pursue

434
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:00,498
legal action against any individuals

435
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,534
making assertions to the contrary.

436
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,536
Do you think we push a button

437
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,538
or does she just rewind automatically?

438
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:08,773
GORDON: We're looking for
an employee of WellZyn's.

439
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,244
Male with a severely damaged ear.

440
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:14,746
Y-Yes.

441
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,049
Full disclosure... that does raise a flag.

442
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:27,926
That's Stan Potolsky.

443
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,529
He worked for us for several years

444
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:32,163
as a biochemist.

445
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:34,199
Uh, primarily personal care products.

446
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,301
Shampoos, toothpastes.

447
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:37,969
So what happened?

448
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,771
Well, Stan was frustrated
that he wasn't doing

449
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:41,106
more important work.

450
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,276
He grew disgruntled and unstable.

451
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,711
We tried to get him help, but he resisted.

452
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:50,549
Last April, there was an incident.

453
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,085
He tried to cut off his own ear

454
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,422
during a disagreement with his supervisor.

455
00:21:58,457 --> 00:21:59,925
Guess it was harder than he thought.

456
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,127
We had to let him go.

457
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:03,728
Last known address?

458
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:05,497
Well, after he was terminated,

459
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,766
he didn't even clear off his desk.

460
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,734
Just disappeared, off the grid.

461
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,137
You knew, didn't you?

462
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:14,639
You knew all along it was him.

463
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:16,408
That's why you came to see us so fast.

464
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:18,577
That's incorrect.

465
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:21,146
Viper can only be produced
in a state-of-the-art lab,

466
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,347
like yours.

467
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:25,917
Stan Potolsky is a brilliant man,

468
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:28,987
perfectly capable of building his own lab.

469
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,956
But you are more than welcome to examine

470
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,257
our facilities.

471
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,759
With full and proper clearances, of course.

472
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,027
Of course.

473
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:38,296
We'll get the paperwork started.

474
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:42,100
BULLOCK: Lawyers.

475
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,969
Scumbags, the lot of them.

476
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:45,103
Yeah, some of them.

477
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:46,538
Let's go find Stan Potolsky.

478
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,340
What, drive around looking for him?

479
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:51,443
No. I'll call dispatch,
have them put out an APB.

480
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,078
All right, I'll check with the desk,

481
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,614
see if his name's come up.

482
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:58,617
- Gordon, right?
- Yeah. Who the hell are you?

483
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:01,052
You got to come with me
now, nice and quiet like.

484
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,187
What are you talking about?

485
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:03,822
Relax. We got a mutual friend.

486
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:07,225
- Oh, yeah, who's that?
- Oswald Cobblepot.

487
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,828
Yeah, him.

488
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:11,363
And if you don't come with me now,

489
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:12,931
we're gonna put his head in a bag

490
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:14,666
and send it to Falcone,

491
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,902
which would be embarrassing for you, no?

492
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:20,272
Or maybe we've been misinformed.

493
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:22,474
I mean, if I'm not ringing any bells here,

494
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:25,710
you can go on your merry way.

495
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:28,346
No, I'll come.

496
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,623
Come on, shove over.

497
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,626
Hey! Hey!

498
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:50,467
(crackling)

499
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:52,302
(gasps)

500
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:53,336
(sighs)

501
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,276
Welcome.

502
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,178
I'm Salvatore Maroni.

503
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:03,580
I know who you are.

504
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:04,848
What do you want?

505
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:05,849
Here's the thing...

506
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:07,651
Jim, just tell the truth.

507
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:11,788
You want a drink, Jim?

508
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:13,190
I'm having a Negroni.

509
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:14,624
So good with seafood.

510
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,827
Water.

511
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:17,994
(snaps)

512
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:24,301
So, our friend here told
me a fascinating story.

513
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,869
Never heard a story so good.

514
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:27,471
It's hard to believe it's true.

515
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:30,207
- It is, it's true.
- Shut up! Shut up!

516
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:32,409
One more word,

517
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:34,678
and I'll jam this down your throat.

518
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:36,379
I try to be civil, Jim.

519
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:41,418
But I'm not the kind of
man that likes to ask twice.

520
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,186
So here's how it's gonna go.

521
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:45,322
Slow down, Mr. Maroni. I don't know...

522
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:46,990
No! No. No.

523
00:24:47,024 --> 00:24:50,360
You let me finish. You'll
have your turn to speak.

524
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:55,665
Okay, then.

525
00:24:57,068 --> 00:25:00,036
I want you to tell me the same exact story

526
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:01,772
that Penguin told me.

527
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:03,240
What story is that?

528
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,442
Oh, you better know what story, my friend.

529
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:08,311
Because if you tell me
the same story he told me,

530
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:10,247
then I could believe it's true.

531
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,415
Then I'm happy.

532
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,418
But if you tell me another story, oh, mama.

533
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:17,020
Then someone's lying to me.

534
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:20,457
And I don't know which one,
and the both of youse will die.

535
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:22,692
Understand?

536
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:25,228
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

537
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:26,363
So...

538
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:30,634
Tell me a story, Jim.

539
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,672
Somebody murdered Thomas and Martha Wayne.

540
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:37,774
My partner and I caught the case.

541
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:38,909
We didn't even know each other then...

542
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:39,943
What did I say?!

543
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:42,078
Go put him on the slicer.

544
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:44,548
No, no, no.

545
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:47,818
<i>If I don't like what I
hear, slice his face prejute.</i>

546
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:52,222
Oh, I'm sorry. Go on.

547
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:53,890
(blade whirring)

548
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:58,161
I was a pawn...

549
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,130
in a conspiracy

550
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:03,767
between Falcone, the mayor and the GCPD

551
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:06,970
to frame Mario Pepper
for the Wayne murders,

552
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:08,538
with the help of Fish Mooney,

553
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:11,775
Mr. Cobblepot's employer at the time.

554
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,679
Mr. Cobblepot then told
the whole story to the MCU.

555
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:19,883
To prove that I wouldn't
betray the conspiracy,

556
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,918
Falcone ordered me to kill Cobblepot.

557
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:27,357
I didn't do it.

558
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:29,860
I let him live.

559
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:32,129
And here we are.

560
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:39,603
Falcone, Mooney,

561
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:42,139
the MCU cops...

562
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,807
none of them know he's alive?

563
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,709
If they did, I'd be dead already.

564
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:47,744
(laughing)

565
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:52,749
It's delicious.

566
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:54,017
(laughs)

567
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:57,320
Frankie! Bring the Penguin back out here.

568
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,122
The little punk is telling the truth.

569
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:00,557
Thank you, Jim.

570
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:03,393
Good story. Told well.

571
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:05,862
Lot of guys in your
situation, they freak out.

572
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:08,665
There you are, you rat,

573
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,435
you snitch, you gorgeous
turncoat son of a bitch.

574
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:13,036
Come here, I love you. Mwah!

575
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:14,371
Be happy, Frankie.

576
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:16,840
We just got a brand-new
weapon against the Falcones.

577
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:18,041
It's Christmas!

578
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:19,776
Happy holidays. Can I go now?

579
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:21,978
Oh, yeah, Jim, you can go.

580
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:25,882
You know, just so that we, uh,

581
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,384
understand each other,

582
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:30,053
you know, keep all this hush-hush.

583
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:32,289
Between us pals.

584
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:35,425
And if I need you again, I'll call you.

585
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:38,161
(mouthing)

586
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:40,697
You do that.

587
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:45,335
MARONI: Look at you, come on.

588
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,370
Let's get you cleaned up.

589
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:47,437
Look at you. Come on.

590
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,044
I love you, baby.

591
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:56,413
I love you, baby.

592
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:58,348
I love you, baby. Okay, now,

593
00:27:58,383 --> 00:28:00,450
you're still putting too much sex on it.

594
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:02,452
Keep it clean.

595
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,756
Like a mother.

596
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,858
I love you, baby.

597
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,261
I love you, baby.

598
00:28:11,295 --> 00:28:12,529
Good.

599
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:14,031
Better.

600
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:17,801
Now, act as if you've caught me in a lie.

601
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:19,202
(sighs)

602
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:20,904
Not angry.

603
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:24,207
No. Disappointment.

604
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:27,911
Oh, honey.

605
00:28:28,913 --> 00:28:30,781
Oh, honey.

606
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:32,916
There you go.

607
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,452
Now, about your hair.

608
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:39,823
There you are.

609
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:41,858
(sighs)

610
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:44,227
Where the hell have you been?

611
00:28:44,262 --> 00:28:45,862
Personal business.

612
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:47,798
You disappear in the middle of a case,

613
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:49,266
you can't even tell me why?

614
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,834
That's what "personal" means.

615
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:53,003
You in some kind of trouble?

616
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,905
Look, forget it. I don't
want to know your problems.

617
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,473
WellZyn sent by Potolsky's stuff.

618
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:58,909
- Grab a box.
- Anything useful yet?

619
00:28:58,943 --> 00:29:01,311
No. Classic geeky loner.

620
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:02,679
Lived for his work.

621
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:06,850
No wife, no family, no real friends.

622
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:08,652
Is it Barbara?

623
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:11,321
She get into something?

624
00:29:11,356 --> 00:29:12,889
Uh, yeah.

625
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:14,458
Kind of.

626
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,927
Figures. No offense.

627
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:20,030
- Need any help?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

628
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,034
Hey.

629
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:26,403
What do you think about this?

630
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:27,838
Looks like a friend, no?

631
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:35,779
Judging by the books and the mascot,

632
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:36,880
philosophy professor,

633
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:39,216
Gotham U.

634
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,617
Worth a shot.

635
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:42,619
Amen.

636
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:49,026
I was just on my way to an appointment,

637
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,828
but yes, I know Stan Potolsky.

638
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:53,563
He was a student of mine.

639
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:56,333
A very brilliant student.

640
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:58,435
GORDON: And you've stayed
in touch over the years.

641
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:01,171
We have. He may be a biochemist,

642
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,640
but philosophy is a passion of his.

643
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:06,543
What can you tell us
about WellZyn firing him?

644
00:30:06,577 --> 00:30:10,647
Research for WellZyn led him
into some dark moral corners.

645
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:12,449
WellZyn said he made shampoo.

646
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:14,217
Where are the dark moral corners in that?

647
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:18,355
Shampoo? (chuckles) They say that, do they?

648
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:22,559
No, no, Stan designed
pharmaceutical weapons

649
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:24,728
to be used by combat troops.

650
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:27,164
Drugs that worked on an epigenetic level.

651
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:28,632
Imagine an army

652
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,835
made up of soldiers so strong
that they can tear a man apart

653
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,537
with their bare hands.

654
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:36,707
Of course, at the beginning,
there were side effects.

655
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:38,242
Yeah, death.

656
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:39,610
But Viper was the first batch.

657
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:42,012
They worked out the kinks
in the second version.

658
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:43,347
Called it Venom.

659
00:30:43,381 --> 00:30:44,448
(coughing)

660
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,053
By then, Stan had acquired some clarity.

661
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:55,058
He appealed to his
bosses to end the program.

662
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:58,161
They refused, so he went over their heads

663
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,197
to Thomas and Martha Wayne.

664
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:04,067
He convinced them to shut it down.

665
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,602
And when they died,

666
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:07,838
WellZyn immediately revived the program

667
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:10,173
with the blessings of Wayne Enterprises.

668
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,542
In the end, there was nothing

669
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:15,312
for Stan to do but to resort
to more radical measures.

670
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:16,647
GORDON: Killing people.

671
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:19,383
I'm not hearing a sense of
moral outrage, Professor.

672
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,286
If you don't mind, I'll
reserve my moral outrage

673
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,488
for the true villains of this piece.

674
00:31:24,522 --> 00:31:26,089
You mean WellZyn.

675
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:29,393
You planned this with Potolsky.

676
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,295
- Yes.
- Where is he?

677
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:32,796
Talk fast, bub!

678
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,432
Oh, what are you gonna do to
me? I'm an old man! I'm dying.

679
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,834
I'll help you die quicker, you terrorist.

680
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:39,069
Soon, Stan will issue a statement

681
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:40,571
the world won't be able to ignore.

682
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,905
Soon?

683
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,807
- Today?
- You're already too late.

684
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:45,309
- Now, you tell us where he is right now.
- Wait a minute!

685
00:31:45,343 --> 00:31:47,144
Wait a minute! You said you
had an appointment, right?

686
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,145
Where were you going?

687
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,281
Bravo! You've asked the right question.

688
00:31:51,316 --> 00:31:54,184
- The first step to enlightenment.
- (glass breaks)

689
00:31:56,855 --> 00:31:57,921
(screams)

690
00:32:03,294 --> 00:32:05,262
No!

691
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:08,031
(choking)

692
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:11,134
(groaning)

693
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,673
Where is he?!

694
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,542
- Where's Potolsky?!
- Those hypocrites.

695
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:21,278
Empty altruism will not
erase what they've done.

696
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,547
They must pay.

697
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:25,849
- Who? Who must pay?
- WellZyn.

698
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:27,484
Wayne Enterprises.

699
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,020
Everyone will finally

700
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:32,222
- see them for what they are.
- How?

701
00:32:32,257 --> 00:32:33,390
Where's Potolsky headed?

702
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:37,027
What's altruism?!

703
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,497
Charity.

704
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:45,469
I know where he's going.

705
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:51,208
- Name, please?
- He's, uh, Bruce Wayne.

706
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:52,342
He's Bruce Wayne.

707
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:54,645
- Just this way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

708
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,481
(piano playing gentle music)

709
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,976
<i>Enterprises is</i>

710
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,611
<i>a helping hand...</i>

711
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,748
Oh, that's Miss Mathis.

712
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,717
She worked closely with your father.

713
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:43,753
<i>Wayne Enterprises is a shelter for all.</i>

714
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,789
<i>And clean water...</i>

715
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,775
<i>WOMAN (over TV): The smile of a child...</i>

716
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,678
Please, sit, Bruce.

717
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,247
It is so good to see you out and about.

718
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,683
Glad to be here.

719
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,120
All of us at Wayne Enterprises
are so sorry for your loss.

720
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,024
So, are all you here on the board?

721
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:24,928
Oh, heavens no. We're middle management.

722
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,530
The board members don't
do this sort of thing.

723
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,165
No?

724
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,500
Why not?

725
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:35,772
Well, they're very busy people, Bruce.

726
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:37,674
Your family created a company

727
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,977
worth billions and billions of dollars.

728
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:43,880
- How awesome is that?
- Awesome.

729
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,116
I wanted to speak to
them because I've found

730
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,517
what looks like serious irregularities

731
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,718
in the Arkham project.

732
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,187
Irregularities?

733
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,858
(gas hissing)

734
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:04,034
I can assure you, Bruce,
that Wayne Enterprises

735
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,870
would never countenance
doing business with criminals.

736
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,671
- Just wouldn't happen.
- I hope so,

737
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,975
but I'd like to speak
directly with the board myself.

738
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,077
Can you make that happen?

739
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:17,080
I can certainly try.

740
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:22,052
They prefer to communicate with minors

741
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,654
via the usual legal mediation, but...

742
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,022
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentleman.</i>

743
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,490
<i>This is a public service announcement</i>

744
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,993
<i>on behalf of all living creatures.</i>

745
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,929
<i>You've heard of a drug called Viper?</i>

746
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:34,731
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

747
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,233
<i>That's me.</i>

748
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,869
<i>I made it for WellZyn,</i>

749
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,106
<i>a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.</i>

750
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,575
- Is this true?
- Of course not, Bruce.

751
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:47,944
I mean, this man is clearly insane.

752
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,614
(gas hissing)

753
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,822
The AC plant... where is it? On the roof?

754
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,690
Straight ahead, staircase
across the ballroom.

755
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,025
Clear the ballroom!

756
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,960
<i>I hoped that a demonstration</i>

757
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:07,230
<i>using street people would
suffice, but seems bad things</i>

758
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:12,302
<i>only truly happen when they
happen to important people.</i>

759
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,604
<i>- Like you!
- (gas hissing)</i>

760
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,776
(crowd gasping, screaming)

761
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,611
GCPD! Everybody out!

762
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:23,079
Now!

763
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,114
(crowd clamoring)

764
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,283
Turn it off!

765
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,320
Can't do that.

766
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,789
Turn it off or I'll shoot!

767
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,557
Go ahead.

768
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,059
My work is done.

769
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,102
(skin crackling)

770
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,774
(grunts)

771
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,642
Turn around! Put your
hands behind your head!

772
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,344
Interlock your fingers!

773
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,779
That's all right.

774
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,648
You're angry and confused.

775
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,150
I understand.

776
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:03,787
There's no more need for violence.

777
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,323
Don't shoot!

778
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,258
That's considerate of you.

779
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,897
I'm leaving now.

780
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,433
Go look in warehouse 39.

781
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,767
You're not going anywhere!

782
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,370
I can go anywhere I want!

783
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,541
Don't do it!

784
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,843
(crash)

785
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,611
(car alarms blaring, people screaming)

786
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,552
You really can have too
much of a good thing.

787
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,244
(ship horn blowing)

788
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:12,602
(door opens)

789
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,707
Nothing.

790
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:21,444
What'd you expect? It's Gotham.

791
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:33,247
MATHIS: It's Mathis.

792
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:35,983
I'm outside the site. They're here.

793
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:38,219
No. I think we should leave them be.

794
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:41,422
There's nothing here for them.

795
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:44,459
We'll review that if they get close.

796
00:39:11,186 --> 00:39:12,653
(chuckles softly)

797
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:32,373
It's been ten minutes.

798
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:35,176
I-I assure you, my friend is reliable.

799
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,679
You scared, Penguin?

800
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:41,516
Your voice is doing that shaky thing.

801
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,484
(laughs): No, sir.

802
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,353
I'm fine.

803
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:46,988
You don't have to act tough.

804
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:48,322
Nerves are a good thing.

805
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:51,559
Perhaps I am a bit jittery, sir.

806
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:53,161
Good.

807
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:54,462
You should be.

808
00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:58,499
'Cause if my boys don't
make it, neither do you.

809
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:03,638
(glass shatters in distance)

810
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:05,339
(people screaming in distance)

811
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:06,941
Got 'em!

812
00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:07,975
Keep going!

813
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:10,912
Ha!

814
00:40:10,946 --> 00:40:12,914
Take that, Falcone, you son of a bitch!

815
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:16,184
Huh? I told you, Frankie,
the kid's a player.

816
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:18,086
He's got a future.

817
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,189
What are you waiting
here like an old lady? Go!

818
00:40:21,223 --> 00:40:23,891
(tires screeching)

819
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:32,066
Untie me.

820
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:36,237
Say "pretty please."

821
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,542
Please.

822
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:43,678
Ah!

823
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:46,447
(sighs)

824
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:51,319
Sometimes I think you really don't like me.

825
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:53,721
Now, would I be backing your takeover

826
00:40:53,756 --> 00:40:55,723
if I didn't like you?

827
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:58,226
And that stuff with Falcone...
well, we have to look good

828
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,394
for the old man.

829
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:01,863
If he figures we're working together,

830
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:05,299
we'd be cooked.

831
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:08,569
- Patience.
- I have no more patience.

832
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:09,737
(chuckles)

833
00:41:09,772 --> 00:41:11,773
The old man has to go.

834
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,574
We must strike soon.

835
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:19,380
Yes. Mm. But softly.

836
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:38,633
(pigeons cooing)

837
00:41:42,338 --> 00:41:45,740
(woman humming music)

838
00:41:54,216 --> 00:41:57,685
(continues humming)

839
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,361
Excuse me.

840
00:42:07,863 --> 00:42:10,999
I couldn't help but overhear
that aria you were humming.

841
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:13,201
Oh, yes. It's my favorite.

842
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:14,502
(chuckles): Mine, too.

843
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:18,139
Ah, well, there you go.

844
00:42:18,173 --> 00:42:20,575
I'm sorry, I-I just...

845
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:23,578
I-I didn't mean to bother you.

846
00:42:23,612 --> 00:42:26,247
My mother sang that to me when I was young.

847
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:28,216
Her whole life, she sang that to me.

848
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,718
I hadn't heard it in a while, and I...

849
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:33,488
I had to smile because you look...

850
00:42:35,057 --> 00:42:36,257
(sighs)

851
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,227
Anyhow, sorry, I'm rambling on.

852
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:41,796
No, that's okay.

853
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,331
Do you want to listen?

854
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,434
Well, yeah.

855
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:48,069
S-Sure, thank you.

856
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:50,104
Let's sit down.

857
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:03,484
(woman singing opera music over earbuds)

858
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,422
Hmm.

859
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:19,788
