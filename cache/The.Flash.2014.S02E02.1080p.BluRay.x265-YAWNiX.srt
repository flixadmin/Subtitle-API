1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:06,132
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,177
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,229
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,809
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,736
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother, but in doing so,

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,360
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,443
And I am the only one fast enough
to stop them.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,574
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,952
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,871
- No!
- The man who saved Central City.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,582
Why did you wanna kill me?

12
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,163
He promised he'd take me home...

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,714
- Who?
- Zoom.

14
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,006
Wells killed my mother.

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,131
I don't know anything anymore,
especially who I can and can't trust.

16
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,178
S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.

17
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,097
People can'tjust waltz
in and out of here.

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,344
Exactly.

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,891
Stay where you are.

20
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,517
My name is Jay Garrick.
And your world is in danger,

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,767
Barry Allen.

22
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,102
Please, just let me explain.
I mean you no harm.

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,401
How do you know my name?

24
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,732
I know all your names. Caitlin Snow.
Cisco Ramon. Detective Joe West.

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,410
Enough! That part about "explaining"
needs to happen right about now.

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,328
This world is in danger.

27
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,202
What other worlds are there?

28
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,454
When you created the Singularity
above Central City,

29
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,582
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

30
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,254
I'm sorry. A breach?

31
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,877
Yes. A portal, connecting our two Earths.

32
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,551
And what precisely is your concern?

33
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,255
A few days ago, you found a dead man
named Al Rothstein at the nuclear plant.

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,636
But then, a different Al Rothstein
tried to kill you.

35
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,888
Atom Smasher.

36
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,264
That man was from my world.

37
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,312
If he got through the breach,
I suspect there'll be more to follow.

38
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:42,236
Okay. So, Jay,
how exactly do you know all this?

39
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,986
Where I came from,
I was a speedster like you.

40
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,283
They called me the Flash.

41
00:01:55,532 --> 00:02:00,038
Before I arrived on your Earth,
I was in a fight with a man named Zoom.

42
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,247
Zoom?

43
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,091
I've heard that name before.

44
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,843
Atom Smasher, he said
Zoom sent him here to kill me.

45
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,719
Who is this guy?

46
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,180
He's a speedster, like you and me.
And fast.

47
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,183
Maybe the fastest of all, but evil.

48
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,766
He is an unstoppable demon
with the face of death.

49
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,780
We were engaged
in our fiercest battle ever,

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,200
racing throughout my city,
but I wasn't fast enough to stop him.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,778
Zoom had me beaten.

52
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,407
He was about to kill me, when suddenly,

53
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,209
there was a blinding light,
and the sky split open.

54
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,339
A breach, between my world and yours
caused from the Singularity.

55
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,092
It pulled me in

56
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,266
and I somehow ended up in your world.

57
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,515
Powerless. Unable to return home.

58
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,971
What do you mean?

59
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,431
I lost my speed.

60
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:01,853
How?

61
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,934
I'm not entirely sure.

62
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,235
So, you've been in Central City
for six months.

63
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,907
Why haven't you come to see us before?

64
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,907
I'm in a foreign world here, Detective.
I didn't know who you all were.

65
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,159
Took me that long
to piece it all together.

66
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,788
So that's how you know our names.
You've been following us.

67
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,253
Look, I know how this sounds.

68
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,420
The existence of another Earth,
you, another Flash?

69
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,052
It all came as an unexpected shock
to me, too.

70
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,548
I just wish there was something
I could do to convince you.

71
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:39,182
There is.
We're gonna do some tests on you.

72
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,434
See if you're telling us the truth.

73
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,393
Because if you're not, this Zoom

74
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,987
is not gonna be your only enemy.

75
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,157
Where the hell am I?

76
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,667
You wanna go home?
You only have to do one thing.

77
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,000
- What's that?
- Kill the Flash.

78
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:17,307
So, Mr. Garrick, how long have you been
the Flash on your world?

79
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,884
Not long enough to call me "Mister."

80
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,390
Please, it's Jay.

81
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,683
Jay, of course.

82
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,311
On my world, I've been the Flash
for about two years.

83
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,734
And how did you get your speed?

84
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,063
I'm not really sure. I was at my lab
trying to purify heavy water

85
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,821
without any residual radiation
when there was a blinding light.

86
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,277
Uh, I fell into a coma.

87
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,738
When lwoke up, I could run
almost as fast as the speed of light.

88
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,955
Sorry, did you say "lab?"
Are you a scientist?

89
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,083
Well, certainly didn't work at a place
like this but yeah.

90
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,415
I had a respectable solo operation.

91
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,342
Part-time chemist. Part-time physicist.
Part-time superhero.

92
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,589
Hmm.

93
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,343
I can forget that
superhero part now though, huh.

94
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,930
Is any of this possible? A breach
to another Earth? It's not, right?

95
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,853
The contrary. Just recently,
the many-different-worlds theory proposed

96
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,103
interaction with parallel universes
was plausible.

97
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,934
Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true,

98
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,395
that theory's been proven
sooner than we all thought.

99
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,695
It doesn't add up.

100
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,489
I'm gonna be honest here.
I don't understand

101
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,407
what the hell any of you
are talking about.

102
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,829
So, Jay is saying he's from,
like, a mirror world.

103
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,375
Or a parallel universe,
that's very, very similar to ours.

104
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,499
Multi-verse would be
a more apt description.

105
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,338
Nope. Not helping.

106
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,258
- Bless your heart.
- Okay, see if this helps.

107
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,975
This is our Earth.
Let's call it, Earth One.

108
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:47,852
And this second Earth,
let's call it, Earth Two.

109
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,605
This is where Jay claims to be from.

110
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:56,361
And these other Earths,
three, four, five, to infinity.

111
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:02,079
All of them are nearly identical to ours,
and, uh, they all exist at the same time,

112
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,499
giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

113
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,795
For example, uh, the Joe West
on Earth Two, your doppelganger,

114
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,750
he might not be a detective. He could be
a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

115
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,257
And you, the Barry Allen here
is the Flash,

116
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,055
but over there,
he could be an electrician.

117
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:25,432
So I'm assuming that
the people on all these other Earths

118
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,013
work to make money to pay bills and such?

119
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,939
- I would imagine.
- So we got that in common.

120
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,189
I'm heading back to the station. Call me
when this makes a little bit more sense.

121
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,691
I'm still trying to wrap my head
around the whole idea of time travel.

122
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,114
There is one problem that remains.

123
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,287
If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth,

124
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,489
there is a breach
somewhere in Central City

125
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,121
that we need to find. And close for good.

126
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,125
Yeah, but how do we find it?
We don't even know what to look for.

127
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:57,005
Well, I suggest we put our heads
together and come up with a solution.

128
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,721
Not literally, of course.
Those days are over.

129
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,723
What'd you find?

130
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,226
Well, Jay's heart rate
is extraordinarily low.

131
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,183
And he does have
regenerative capabilities.

132
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,143
Other than that,
I'm not seeing any evidence

133
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,729
of the speed force in his system.

134
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,656
We don't even have proof that he's
a speedster, much less from another Earth?

135
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,325
- Not necessarily.
- What does that mean?

136
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,153
Well, Jay doesn't know this,
but while I was testing

137
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,490
his heart rate, blood pressure
and motor responses,

138
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,702
I also measured his autonomic reactions
while we were talking.

139
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,583
You gave him a lie-detector test?

140
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,001
And he passed it.

141
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,546
What if he's not a good guy,
and he just wants to find our weaknesses?

142
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,428
Keep running tests.
See what else you can find out.

143
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,020
Detective West, sir.

144
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,898
Yes. Officer...

145
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,155
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

146
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,906
Captain Singh mentioned
there may be positions available

147
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,579
on your anti-meta-human task force.

148
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,157
Yeah. Everybody quit.
There is no task force anymore.

149
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,117
Well, I know someone
who's interested in being on it.

150
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:14,832
Me.

151
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,751
You do realize that meta-humans

152
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,252
- have super-powers, right?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,630
And even if they didn't,
you wouldn't be a good fit for the team.

154
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,007
Because I'm a woman?

155
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,804
I didn't mean to imply that.

156
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,428
Good, because I know
how difficult this job would be,

157
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,350
but I think I'm an excellent candidate.

158
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,929
I triple-majored at Hudson
in Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

159
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,937
I'm in prime physical condition. And,
I rated top of my class in marksmanship.

160
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,769
Your class? You don't even have
your stripes yet.

161
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,604
Soon. Been on thejob seven months, sir.

162
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,655
Are you aware of what happened
to my previous partner?

163
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,904
Detective Thawne, yes.
I know that he died,

164
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,452
and the one before him,
Fred Chyre, died, too.

165
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,950
But the one before, that's not dead,
just transferred.

166
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,998
I'm sure it had nothing to do with you.

167
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,742
Listen, Officer...

168
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,372
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

169
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,545
Yes, Spivot. The answer's no.

170
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,716
All I'm asking for is a shot, sir.
Please, just an interview.

171
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,418
You just had the interview.
Didn't get the job.

172
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,809
I hope you understand
why we have to do this.

173
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,145
I get it, kid. You're doing
what you think you have to.

174
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,312
But you'll all realize soon enough
that this, the tests,

175
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,155
it's unnecessary.
I want to help you, Barry. Not harm you.

176
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,282
You're not the first person
that's said that to me.

177
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,908
If what you told me about Zoom is true,
that he sent Rothstein here to kill you,

178
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
instead of locking me up in here,
you better start listening.

179
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,745
Because if Zoom is involved,
you are going to need

180
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,498
a lot more than just me
at your side to stay alive.

181
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,664
Barry, there's a fire at the
waterfront. Fire Department's en route.

182
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,332
I'm on my way.

183
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,958
Be careful.

184
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,364
That was the Flash!

185
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,462
- That was a big fire.
- It's out, Cisco.

186
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,336
Copy that. See you in a bit.

187
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

188
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,473
I thought it'd be harder than this.

189
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,412
Barry? Hello? Are you there?

190
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,252
- What was that?
- I don't know.

191
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,503
But we need to find out.

192
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,676
- Barr.
- Hey.

193
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,049
What are we dealing with here?

194
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,883
Well, definitely a meta-human.
Got a pretty solid look at him

195
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,094
between punches
and he was, like, made of sand?

196
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,765
- Sand? Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

197
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,102
These walls are too porous
to pull any prints.

198
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,602
I can't even get one off the boat.
But check this out.

199
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,068
There's gasoline burns everywhere.

200
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,401
Water didn't go off.
Sprinklers weren't working.

201
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,235
This was arson.

202
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,243
Excuse me, Barry Allen?

203
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,039
- Yeah.
- Hi.

204
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,789
Two days in a row, Officer.
What a coincidence.

205
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,959
Or kismet,
if you believe in destiny or fate.

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,042
- I'm Patty. Patty Spivot.
- Hey.

207
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,093
I'm really excited to meet you.
I'm a huge fan.

208
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,922
- Excuse me?
- Your forensic reports.

209
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,556
I read them sometimes. Who am I kidding?
All the time. I've actually read them all.

210
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,480
Wow, I don't think
that I've read them all.

211
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,641
They're always so detailed, you know.
They really paint a picture

212
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,152
like you were somehow actually there
when somebody was being brutally murdered.

213
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,655
Thank you.

214
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,323
Uh, anyhow, I found, uh, something.
Well, I think I found something.

215
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,579
It's just a theory,
but I would like to show you.

216
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,826
Great.

217
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,333
So, this right here
is the point of origin of the fire.

218
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,996
And look. I don't know
a sand blaster on the market

219
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,092
that can make a cut that precise. So,
I think a meta-human may have done this.

220
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,510
Here. I took a sample for you.

221
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,592
Uh, there's also some fingerprints
on the back of the pipe.

222
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,098
Should've gone into CSI work.

223
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,847
I love the science,
but out here's where all the action is.

224
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,811
Isn't that right, Detective West?

225
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,185
The answer's still "no," Officer...

226
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,439
- Spivot.
- Spivot.

227
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,687
Yeah.

228
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,019
What was that about?

229
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,153
I'm trying to join
the anti-meta-human task force.

230
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,355
Ah.

231
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,484
But you heard him.
Hey, he's kind of like your dad, right?

232
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,036
So, do you have any advice
on how I can crack his "no" code?

233
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,662
Yeah, I've been trying to pick that lock

234
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,114
- since I was 11.
- Yeah.

235
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,370
So, if you figure it out,
how about you let me know?

236
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,708
- Deal.
- All right.

237
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,040
- It was nice to meet you, Barry.
- Yeah, you, too.

238
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,007
His blood pressure is low,
his heart rate is low,

239
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,559
his oxygen levels are impressive.

240
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,724
Yeah, but nothing compared to Barry's.

241
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,015
No, but he's certainly
in the physical specimen range.

242
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,560
- In more ways than one?
- Hmm?

243
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:35,858
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.
That's enough for today, Jay. Thank you.

244
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,073
Found it at the crime scene.

245
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,365
I mean, it's gotta be
from the meta-human that attacked me.

246
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,574
Huh.

247
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,618
What is this stuff? Sand?

248
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,712
It's not sand. It's human cells
whose myosin-two protein

249
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,914
have migrated to the cells' periphery.

250
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,924
Jay's a fellow science nerd.

251
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,757
Those cells have the ability
to rearrange and harden,

252
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,921
giving them the appearance of sand.

253
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,598
Mmm, how do you know this?

254
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,593
They belong to a meta-human
I've fought before named Sand Demon.

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,229
I know you're new here,
so I'm just gonna break it down for you.

256
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,148
The whole naming the bad guys thing,
that's myjam.

257
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,937
But you know what?
I'm gonna let you have that one,

258
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,894
'cause I actually kind of like it.
I'm not mad at that one.

259
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,149
Is that Barry's sweatshirt?

260
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,944
Oh, uh, sorry. lt was all we could find.

261
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,322
I was gonna say 'cause it looks
a lot smaller on you, right?

262
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,082
I gotta do this thing.

263
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,627
So, who is this Sand Demon?

264
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,460
I don't know his name,
but I know how to stop him.

265
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,466
You know what,
I think we'll be fine on our own.

266
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,675
Look, Barry, I don't know what else
I can do to prove to you I'm on your side.

267
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,142
I've been poked, prodded, I even
subjected myself to a full body scan.

268
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,472
I was being thorough.

269
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,976
Sand Demon's from my world.
Let me teach you how to stop him.

270
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,980
Yeah, I don't need you
to teach me anything, Jay.

271
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,815
Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you.

272
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,817
He must've sent Sand Demon here
to do the same thing.

273
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,822
Don't you get it?
Anyone close to the Flash,

274
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,654
all of you, are in a lot of danger!

275
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,955
All right. If you were so good,
you would've caught him already.

276
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,038
Let's get Jay back to his cell.

277
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,714
Whoa.

278
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,510
Hey, Beautiful Mind.
I think you need to take a breather.

279
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,385
After some lengthy calculations,
I believe I have discovered

280
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,855
the key to proving
the proposed breach theory.

281
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,515
Exotic matter.

282
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,816
Huh.

283
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,528
You mean like trans-dimensional energy.

284
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,571
Precisely. Exotic matter,

285
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,693
trans-dimensional energy
will theoretically leak

286
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,032
from one universe into another.

287
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,868
Now, if this breach
Mr. Garrick is talking about is real,

288
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,537
if there is indeed a hole in our universe
which leads to his Earth...

289
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,708
We can make some adjustments and
upload an electrophotography program

290
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,921
to the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite

291
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,421
and essentially photograph
the exotic matter leak.

292
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,174
Thereby giving us
the locale of said breach.

293
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,430
Last time I saw the kit,
it was in the fabrication room.

294
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,723
I shall return.

295
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,103
Oh-hoo-hoo!

296
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,689
Getting goosies. All right.

297
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,570
Let's see what you're made of.
It's too much.

298
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,577
Barry?

299
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,959
I thought it'd be harder than this.

300
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,588
What's happening to me?

301
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,775
Hey.

302
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,279
I found our meta. His name is Eddie Slick.
We tracked those prints to his address.

303
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,658
All right. Where are you?
I'll meet you there.

304
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,413
- Too late, he made me.
- What? Joe!

305
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,641
So, can I be on your task force?

306
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,779
That look familiar?

307
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,989
- How about now? What's it look like?
- A fire.

308
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,658
There you go, genius. It's the fire
you started in the third ward last night.

309
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,834
Man, I didn't start
no fire there last night.

310
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,458
What, were you out of town?
Your cat get sick?

311
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,040
Well, let me guess.

312
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,713
You don't start fires anymore.
You've been rehabilitated.

313
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,381
Yeah, I've done it before. So what?

314
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,799
I didn't do this one.

315
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,054
I always start a fire
with somethin' that's hard to trace.

316
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,302
You know, like acetone or somethin'.

317
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,185
Or maybe you don't need to use
accelerants anymore.

318
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,812
Iron Heights can hold people like you now.
You know that, right?

319
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,395
What, you think I'm one of those
meta-human freaks?

320
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,898
If I had powers, you don't think
I would've used 'em to get away from you?

321
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,492
- December 2013. Where were you?
- Why?

322
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,365
Answer the damn question. Where were you?

323
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,325
Blackgate Penitentiary.

324
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,702
You don't believe me? Check your records.

325
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,867
Jimmy, I need you
to confirm something for me.

326
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,083
So, Joe told me what you did.
I'm impressed.

327
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,377
Oh, all I did was, you know,

328
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,916
run the other print
from the electrical pipe,

329
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,918
and track Slick down from there.

330
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,511
That's all?

331
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,262
Yeah.

332
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,884
How's it going with Joe?
Any closer to cracking his "no" code?

333
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,600
Are you kidding me?
He's like the permission Sphinx.

334
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,394
Or like a magic eight ball
with just one answer.

335
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,351
Or like, you know, the Bridgekeeper
protecting the Holy Grail.

336
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,606
What is your quest?

337
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,570
- To join your task force.
- No.

338
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,572
Aah!

339
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,025
Amazing!

340
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,240
Well, maybe I can
put in a good word for you.

341
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,781
That would mean a lot to me, Barry.

342
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,870
- Yeah.
- Lt's me.

343
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,790
Okay, so Slick wasn't in Central City

344
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,042
the night
the particle accelerator exploded.

345
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,251
He's lying.

346
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,303
He's a dirt bag and an arsonist,
but he's not lying about this.

347
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,592
He's not a meta, Barry.

348
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,928
Slick is the guy who jumped me.

349
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,311
Do you think it's possible
that the Slick in there has a...

350
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,099
A doppelganger?

351
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,606
I don't know.

352
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,609
Yesterday's surprise
broadcast from a Star City vigilante

353
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:49,489
who is calling himself the "Green Arrow"
has spawned a massive outcry...

354
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,781
Catchy.

355
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,819
I hate it
when they put a color in their name.

356
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,653
- Yo.
- Yo.

357
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,329
- The sample you gave us...
- Yeah.

358
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,283
Not sand. Definitely human cells.

359
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,164
Yeah, I know. It's not him. I get it.

360
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,291
I hate to say it,
I think this Earth Two theory

361
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,293
- is starting to make sense.
- For real?

362
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,378
What, you think Jay is lying
about the Sand Demon?

363
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:13,221
I don't know. That's my point.
But I'm not gonnajust believe some guy

364
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,717
that walks in here and says a few things
that sort of check out.

365
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,311
"Sort of?" He was right about Zoom.

366
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,723
We don't even know anything about Zoom.
Or what is Zoom? ls Zoom even real?

367
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,352
Right now, that's just, you know,
a story around a campfire.

368
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,904
I mean, have you discovered a breach yet?

369
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,148
Not yet, but we know how to now.

370
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,031
Have you found one thing to suggest
that Jay is a speedster?

371
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,987
Is the speed force even in his system?

372
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,411
It doesn't appear to be, no.

373
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:47,922
See? We are scientists.
You are a journalist.

374
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,088
We test, we prove, we report.
That's what we do!

375
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,383
Except, right now, nobody here
wants to do any of that, except me.

376
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,894
Can we have the room for a minute?

377
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,731
What has happened to you?

378
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,021
Are you... Me?

379
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:17,115
Yes, you. The you that I grew up with.
The you that is my best friend.

380
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,954
The you that became the Flash. I haven't
seen that you in a very long time.

381
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,699
A lot's changed, Iris.

382
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,628
Yeah, it sure has. You have learned
how to not trust people.

383
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,589
What is it about Jay that you don't like?

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,258
I don't know. Uh...

385
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,258
It's because he reminds you
of Harrison Wells.

386
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,264
I trusted that man. For months.
We all did.

387
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:50,735
And you know what?
Eddie is dead, Ronnie is dead.

388
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:56,824
And a whole lot of other people
in this city, they are dead

389
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,113
Because we trusted him.

390
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,446
I'm not gonna let us
make that mistake again.

391
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:07,661
Barry, not everyone is Harrison Wells.

392
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,458
Besides, you defeated him
because you trusted in people,

393
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,168
because you believed in them.

394
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,136
This team that you have here,
they will follow your lead.

395
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,342
They'll do what you say.

396
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,142
But if they think
that you don't believe in them,

397
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,974
it won't be long
before they don't believe in you.

398
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,655
Get to walking. I don't want to see
your ugly mug around here again.

399
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,111
Sayonara.

400
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,617
- We didn't have probable cause.
- I get it.

401
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,127
One thing you should know
about dealing with these meta-humans,

402
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,204
nothing is ever as it seems.

403
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,715
Speaking of which,
you're the only person here

404
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,049
who wants to be on my task force.

405
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,886
You wanna tell me
why you're so hell-bent on being on it?

406
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,472
You want to tell me
why you're so hell-bent I'm not?

407
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,305
Didn't I just tell you I didn't want
to see your ugly mug around here again?

408
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,190
Well, you're gonna have to,
Detective West,

409
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,234
so I can get to the Flash.

410
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,656
Hey!

411
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:33,997
I like you. You'll do the trick just fine.

412
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,722
Finally come to your senses?

413
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,066
Sand Demon kidnapped a police officer.
A woman that I know.

414
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,480
And you need my help?

415
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,901
I need you to help us
save her before something happens.

416
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,405
Guess you're gonna have to
trust me now, huh, kid?

417
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,075
We're looking for any structures
that promote humidity.

418
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,415
Greenhouses, grow rooms,
anything of the sort.

419
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,581
His body will literally start
to fall apart if he becomes dehydrated.

420
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,328
- Like dry sand.
- Exactly.

421
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,538
Sand Demon always attacks on two fronts.

422
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,841
He creates a diversion,
then strikes when you're distracted.

423
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,042
Okay. Then what do we do?

424
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,924
We use your speed to get to him
before the distraction can happen.

425
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,595
Jay, how do I stop somebody
who can slip through my fingers?

426
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,060
The way I never was able to.
With lightning.

427
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,266
Yo-oh!

428
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,106
- Are you about to pull a Zeus right now?
- What are you talking about?

429
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,898
Barry's going to hurl lightning
from the energy he creates when he runs.

430
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,104
Because lightning plus sand equals...

431
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,401
Glass.

432
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,565
Time to learn something new, kid.

433
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,072
All right.

434
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,958
Give me a sec.

435
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,124
Hey,. are you good?

436
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,089
That was Singh.
C.C.P.D. still hasn't found anything yet.

437
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,092
Irony is, I didn't want Patty to have
anything to do with the damn task force

438
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,714
in the first place.
And she gets taken because of me.

439
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,717
No, no, no.
This isn't your fault, all right?

440
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,298
It's hard not to think that.

441
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,643
Well, look, we're gonna find Patty,
all right? Whatever it takes.

442
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,776
Flash is coming for you, you know.

443
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,615
Yes, I'm sure he is.

444
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,124
You can't beat him.
I don't care what powers you have.

445
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,834
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

446
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,417
Is that why you need to build
that concussive bomb?

447
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,343
Yeah. I know what it is. I'm a cop.
I've seen one before.

448
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,180
This isn't gonna kill the Flash.

449
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,636
I am.

450
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,598
This is gonna kill you.

451
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,150
You know you got lucky, right?

452
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:05,857
You think you were chosen,
the rest of us don't mean anything,

453
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:10,453
but it's not true. You werejust
at the right place at the right time.

454
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,615
Getting those powers
didn't change who you are.

455
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,542
They only highlighted the worst parts
of who you already were.

456
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,954
Maybe you're right.

457
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,047
Maybe not.

458
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,552
Either way, you and the Flash are about to
find out what those worst parts are.

459
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,346
I've searched all the vacant buildings
in Central City,

460
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,511
and none of them fit the description
that we need.

461
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,188
And I've looked at
any draw upticks on the electrical grid.

462
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,315
Nothing out of the norm, I'm afraid.

463
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,735
We gotta do whatever it takes.

464
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,237
I'll be back.

465
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,819
Okay, come on.

466
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,217
Flash is coming for you, you know.

467
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,174
Yes, I'm sure he is.

468
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,432
You can't beat him.
I don't care what powers you have.

469
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,723
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

470
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,438
Oh, no.

471
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,109
Mr. Ramon? What are you doing down here?

472
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,950
I figured out where Patty is.

473
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,445
And how, exactly, did you do that?

474
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,281
Just a hunch.

475
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,413
We gotta tell Barry.

476
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,267
Again.

477
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,943
I've been doing this
for an hour. It's not working.

478
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,112
It's because you're trying to rush it.

479
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,782
This is the one time
when you need to slow down.

480
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,282
Let the energy pass over you,

481
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,613
then simply direct it
to where you want it to go.

482
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,791
All right, Jay, I don't know
if I'm gonna get this in time.

483
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,584
You'll get it. I believe in you.

484
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:28,253
The last person who helped me like this
was a man that I looked up to. Idolized.

485
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,130
He taught me how to get faster,
how to get stronger,

486
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,842
how to use my powers to save people.

487
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,257
That same man murdered my mother.

488
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,314
It's a tough break, but I'm not him.

489
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,858
Yeah.

490
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,318
I know where they are!

491
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,821
The abandoned Woodrue grow house.
That's where Slick's keeping Patty.

492
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,485
Dude, greatjob.

493
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,946
And I was thinking, if I were Sand Demon,

494
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,248
and I were attacking a speedster
on two fronts,

495
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,121
I would probably wanna slow you down,

496
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,829
like, by using a concussive bomb,
or something like that.

497
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,502
That's a good thought.
He's actually used one on me before.

498
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,001
His body absorbs the blast,
so it doesn't affect him.

499
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,674
Well, kid, you're gonna have to
think of something.

500
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,923
You know what,
what if we give Slick a diversion?

501
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,849
He knows you, right?
You said you went up against him.

502
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,766
Yeah, but, Barry, I don't have my speed.

503
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,348
He doesn't know that. You got your suit?

504
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,190
Sure. Well, except my helmet.

505
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,441
Helmet?

506
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,440
Silver kettle helmet? Gold wings?

507
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,858
Don't tell me you guys found it.

508
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,785
Never thought I'd see that again.

509
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,630
It was my father's,
from the War of the Americas.

510
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,873
Did you just say War of the Americas?

511
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,835
I wish you would've just told us
you lost your helmet.

512
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,966
Would've saved us all a headache.

513
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,555
Well, you sure you want to do this, Flash?

514
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,180
Yeah.

515
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,184
Let's go see what you're made of, Flash.

516
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,915
I'm in the security feed. Go, Barry!

517
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,259
Is that you, Flash? Found your way here?

518
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,257
I came quite a distance.

519
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:42,929
Thought you were dead.

520
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,560
You were wrong, like usual.

521
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,269
Let the girl go.

522
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,936
Have at it. But you touch her,
she goes boom!

523
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,448
Yeah, and I think even you aren't
fast enough to save her.

524
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,572
Quite a bit slower on this Earth,
aren't you, Flash?

525
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,258
You don't have your speed, do you?

526
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,135
Slick's distracted. Go, Barry!

527
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,160
- Jay!
- Barry!

528
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,587
Patty's alive.

529
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,414
Must be my lucky day.

530
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,628
Zoom sent me here to kill you.

531
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,838
Now I get to kill the Flash
from two worlds before I go home.

532
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,841
He's choking Jay!

533
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,014
Barry, you gotta do something now!

534
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,106
Come on!

535
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,217
You Okay?

536
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,478
Yeah, I'm okay. Nice shot, kid.

537
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,183
Flash?

538
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,484
Coming.

539
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,409
You're pretty good at this.

540
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,911
Had a lot of practice over the last year.

541
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,921
It was really courageous
doing what you did today.

542
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,677
Standing up to the Sand Demon
without any powers.

543
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:29,224
Uh, Barry did all the work.
I just stood there and took a few punches.

544
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,347
It was more than a few.

545
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,603
This is a lot harder than I thought.

546
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,184
Losing something that was
such a big part of who I was for so long.

547
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,937
I lost something
that was a part of me, too.

548
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,739
It's hard.

549
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,402
But it gets easier every day.

550
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,950
You just have to find a new way to live.

551
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:01,253
Just because it's a different life,
it doesn't mean it's a worse one.

552
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:10,391
And, speed or no speed,
in my book, you are still a hero today.

553
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:15,221
I'm just sorry
we did not realize it a little bit sooner.

554
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,431
Especially me.

555
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,642
I'll leave you two speedsters alone.

556
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,984
So, I hear they call you
the "Scarlet Speedster?"

557
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,614
Yeah.

558
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,821
- What about you?
- "Crimson Comet."

559
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,660
- Mmm.
- What is it with

560
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,571
alliteration and nicknames?

561
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,915
Hey, look, Jay, uh,

562
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,582
so thank you for all your help.

563
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,086
And for being so patient with me.

564
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,794
Anytime, kid. You're a quick study.

565
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,721
Took me a lot longer to learn
how to toss lightning, believe me.

566
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,264
I suppose I had the right teacher.

567
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,976
It's gonna be a lot harder
to take down Zoom.

568
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,225
Who is this guy?

569
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,856
No one knows. He showed up around
the same time as when I got my powers.

570
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,145
Killed a lot of people in my world.

571
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:10,200
I spent about two years tracking him down,
but he was too smart.

572
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,404
Too quick. He's always one step ahead.

573
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,663
You really think he'sjust
bringing these guys here to kill me?

574
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,497
Zoom was obsessed with destroying me.
Now he wants to destroy you?

575
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:23,751
Yeah.

576
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,923
He needs to be the best.

577
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,554
And he will do whatever it takes
to ensure he's the only speedster.

578
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,681
In any world.

579
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,221
- Officer Spivot.
- Detective.

580
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,308
- You're supposed to be home resting.
- I'm okay, sir, really.

581
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,815
Look, I'm sorry you got mixed up
in all this mess because of me.

582
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,771
It's not your fault.

583
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:51,366
Do you really think you have
what it takes to be part of my task force?

584
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,113
I know it, sir.

585
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,242
Well, I always check the jacket
of anyone I'm considering for it.

586
00:35:56,446 --> 00:36:00,417
In my research on you, I found out
we got a mutual acquaintance.

587
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,456
Mark Mardon.

588
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,507
I need you to be honest with me here.
Why do you want to do this?

589
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,761
Mark Mardon killed my dad.

590
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,762
He had a little shoe shop
down on Chesterfield.

591
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,725
It was a cash business,
and one night, he went to Fairfield Bank

592
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,278
to make his weekly deposit,
and the Mardon brothers showed up.

593
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,572
While he was waiting in line,
Mark shot my dad

594
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,404
in the face for a few hundred dollars.

595
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,368
Then, a few months later,
Mark and his brother got powers.

596
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,587
Two murderers got super powers.

597
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,539
So that's why I'm here, sir.

598
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,921
That's why I'm so hell-bent
on being on your task force.

599
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:57,133
'Cause there's some bad people out there
and they can do anything.

600
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,433
And I may not have powers,
but I want to stop them.

601
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:07,230
You're the only person I know
who wants to do that, too.

602
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,401
Monday, 8:00 a.m.

603
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,037
Don't be late.

604
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,160
But, late for what?

605
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,079
The task force, Detective.

606
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,386
Joseph.

607
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,554
Hi.

608
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,599
Been a long time.

609
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,734
Yeah, it has.

610
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,946
Why are you here?

611
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,656
Because you didn't return my calls.
And I wanted to see you.

612
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,659
And our daughter.

613
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,423
Any progress with the electrophotography?

614
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,923
The satellite picture
of the city's still rendering.

615
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:19,006
While we wait,
care to tell me what's going on with you?

616
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,340
What? Nothing.

617
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,718
Two hunches in one day.

618
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:29,562
Slick's locale and that he'd be using
a concussive bomb to thwart Barry.

619
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,811
Do I need to inform you of the odds
of such a prediction?

620
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:40,069
Something's happening to me.
I'm starting to perceive things.

621
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:44,747
Horrible things. lt started after
Wells killed me in the other timeline.

622
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,411
It came back
when Atom Smasher attacked on Flash Day,

623
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,963
and then again when Sand Demon showed up.

624
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:58,258
I get a vibe, and then a vision
of something that's already happened.

625
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,339
And then it's gone.

626
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,347
That's how I knew where Slick was.

627
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,898
Cisco, this is amazing. We have to
study this. Figure outjust what to do to.

628
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,475
No, no, no, we're not doing any of that.

629
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,151
And we're certainly not
telling anybody either.

630
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,274
Cisco, lwould think
you'd be the one most intrigued

631
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,901
with knowing exactly what this is
and how it works!

632
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,827
I'm seeing things I don't want to see,
and knowing things I don't want to know.

633
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,278
I just want it to stop.

634
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,740
Professor, I don't want anyone
to know about this.

635
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,283
Not yet.

636
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,331
It's okay to be afraid, you know.

637
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,376
Wells told me this was in my future,

638
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,799
that he gave me this power.

639
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,059
But everything he did was evil.

640
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,972
That's what scares me, Professor.

641
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,851
You have to promise me
that you won't tell anyone about this.

642
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,479
I promise.

643
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,198
Oh, wow.

644
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,825
It appears that while we were indeed
successful in closing the Singularity,

645
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,003
- there was an unfortunate side effect.
- What are you talking about?

646
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:17,048
Using electrophotography, Cisco and I
were able to search Central City

647
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,253
for any signs of energy
entering our Earth from another dimension.

648
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,635
From any breaches,
as Mr. Garrick described them.

649
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,718
But of course,
there isn'tjust one breach.

650
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,429
There's 52 of them,
scattered throughout the city.

651
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:36,144
Uh, these breaches are pockets of time
and space, folded into and upon itself.

652
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,197
But the most significant breach of all
appears to be this one.

653
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,822
And where exactly is that located?

654
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,197
It's here. Inside S.T.A.R. Labs.

655
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,874
And just beyond that breach
is an entirely...

656
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,715
Professor! Professor!

657
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,434
I'd like to personally welcome you

658
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:14,515
to the Scientific and Technological
Advanced Research Laboratories.

659
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,443
Or, as it's more commonly known,
S.T.A.R. Labs.

660
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,738
Founded in 1991,
S.T.A.R. Labs is leading the world

661
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:26,034
in exciting new technological discoveries
that, as our motto suggests,

662
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,454
are truly bringing us
tomorrow's world today.

663
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:34,501
Specializing in artificial intelligence,
genetics, and meta-human...

664
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,914
Oh.

665
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,373
Are we in for an unexpected treat.

666
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:44,548
It is my absolute honor to introduce you
to the founder of S.T.A.R. Labs,

667
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,880
the savior of Central City,

668
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,053
Dr. Harrison Wells.

669
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,853
Hello, kids.

670
00:41:57,877 --> 00:42:05,877
