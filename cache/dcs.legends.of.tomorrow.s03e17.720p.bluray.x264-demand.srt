00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,521
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,537
Sara can never find out the truth
about Ava.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,833
- I'm a...
- You're a clone.

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:07,924
I'm a future clone thing?

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,126
The first Totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,711
And time is his cage.

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,214
If you cannot
defeat me in this vessel,

8
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,722
how will you stop me once
I've assumed my true form?

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,144
Our family's destruction
looms in 1992.

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,813
You promised you'd save us.

11
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,435
Kuasa.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,106
<i>Gideon, set a course.</i>

13
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,733
I have to save my family.

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,118
Code 131, all hands on the bridge.

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,204
What's going on?

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,200
Yeah, I gotta get
back to <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

17
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,740
You read?

18
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,949
Code 131.

19
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,376
Come on, guys, I wrote a whole memo.

20
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,873
Yeah, nobody read it.

21
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,455
- I did.
- Thank you, Ray.

22
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,549
Pancakes for breakfast.

23
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,633
No, 131 is not...

24
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,854
- Is it?
- Yeah, does that mean no pancakes?

25
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,420
Anyway, I wrote a song to help us
remember all the codes.

26
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,213
It goes like this, from the top.

27
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,762
<i>If the code is 111</i>

28
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,389
<i>Mallus escaped the time dungeon</i>

29
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,095
<i>If the code is 112...</i>

30
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,396
All right, Nate, just tell us.

31
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,515
Someone stole the Jumpship.

32
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,278
Where's Amaya?

33
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,859
Uh, according to
the Jumpship logs,

34
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,281
Zambesi, 1992.

35
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,701
Right before the warlords
destroy her village.

36
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,073
And she dies.

37
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,280
The old her, that is.

38
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,913
Whoa, the temporal zone
is getting real choppy.

39
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,064
Yeah, the timeline was crumbling

40
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,774
even before Amaya
decided to change history.

41
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,632
If that happens, the Darhks
will be able to free their demon.

42
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,335
Oh, well, I better get back to my movie.

43
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,296
And we better stop Amaya
before she does something reckless.

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,381
Gideon, plot a course for...

45
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,578
<i>Pardon me, Captain Lance,</i>

46
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,764
<i>but we are receiving
an urgent call from Mr. Hunter.</i>

47
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,100
- You good?
- Gideon, put him on.

48
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,726
<i>The Bureau needs back-up.</i>

49
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,816
<i>Grodd's going after Barry.</i>

50
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,841
Well, that explains
the time turbulence.

51
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,865
Flash is always in trouble.
It's kind of his thing.

52
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,691
<i>Not that particular Barry.</i>

53
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,752
Barack Obama,

54
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,673
it will almost be
an honor to kill you.

55
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,567
All right, people, we're dealing
with two anachronisms now,

56
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,145
Zambesi and young Obama.

57
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,152
Wally, Nate, I want you guys
to go talk some sense into Amaya.

58
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,427
You mean, convince her to stand down

59
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,192
while her village and family
is torn apart?

60
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,620
What if I use my temporal
simulator to find some loophole

61
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,198
that Amaya can use
to help save Zambesi?

62
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,503
All right, do it.

63
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,829
The rest of us, we're on Obama care.

64
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,339
You will not escape.

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,797
Grodd will complete his mission.

66
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,393
Time to make America Grodd again.

67
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,679
Clearly you have some grievances.

68
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,353
But perhaps we can look for
a common ground.

69
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:14,980
Whoa!

70
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,197
Or not.

71
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,657
Finally, the cage is breaking.

72
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,201
I can feel his arrival.

73
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,576
Oh, goody.

74
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,645
Yes. Resist.
You will only prolong your suffering.

75
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,700
Should've wasted
your hairy ass in 'Nam.

76
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,332
Run, Barry, run.

77
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,080
A hairless ape
who fights with fire.

78
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,415
How primitive.

79
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,008
No!

80
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,147
Nora. Nora, honey.

81
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,233
Are you okay?

82
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,434
We were so close.

83
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,320
My master was escaping his bonds.
What happened?

84
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,988
Grodd's mission must have failed.

85
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,886
I mean, that could be a good thing.

86
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,053
It gives you and me time to figure

87
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,909
what the big guy's
arrival really means.

88
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,280
It means the end of history,

89
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,117
a chance for us
to live as gods.

90
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,753
As gods?

91
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,648
You know,
that sounds fantastic and all,

92
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,257
but what I just saw,
it seems like there won't be a you

93
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,760
anymore. It'll just be him.

94
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,009
That's what we always wanted.

95
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,643
Isn't it?

96
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,437
Totally.

97
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,096
100%.

98
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,835
You know, I'm just gonna
check on our grumpy gorilla

99
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,339
and see how he screwed this thing up.

100
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,820
I'll see you later.

101
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,986
No, you won't.

102
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,906
Of course.

103
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,750
'Cause once I complete
Grodd's mission, you will be gone.

104
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,412
What I meant to say was

105
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,543
I'll see Mallus later.

106
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,016
Goodbye, Nora doll.

107
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,613
Grodd will destroy you.

108
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,907
You're dead!

109
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:08,993
Nice work.

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,400
Let's get him back to the ship.

111
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,536
Yeah. Come on, teeny tiny Grodd.

112
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,933
I think we still have some chew toys

113
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,414
leftover from the saber tooth tiger.

114
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,792
Nice to meet you.

115
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,415
I'm a PhD student
doing history research.

116
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,338
- Andy Watkins.
- No one cares about the cover story.

117
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,883
Shut up, Darren Applebottom, talent
scout for the New York Knicks.

118
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,337
What are you doing here?

119
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,839
What are you doing here?

120
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,349
Preventing the genocide
of my people tomorrow.

121
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,722
We know, we're here to stop you.

122
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,933
Peacefully.

123
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,264
Look, Amaya.

124
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,895
I know you're upset about
what happened to Kuasa,

125
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,647
and all I can say is I am...

126
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,523
I'm truly sorry.

127
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,521
I don't blame you for
my granddaughter's death, Nathaniel.

128
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,827
I blame the warlords
who draw closer by the minute.

129
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,658
And I intend to stop them.

130
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,948
So stay out of my way.

131
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,832
I must say, it has been
such an honor, Barack.

132
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,710
Oh, I go by Barry.

133
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,249
I really like Barack.

134
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,047
Well, Barack is what
it says on my birth certificate.

135
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,756
Yeah, you might wanna
hold on to that.

136
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,433
So, what's the back-up plan?

137
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,021
Well, according to Ray's song,
this is a code 222.

138
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,231
What's that?

139
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,432
It means we're screwed
no matter what we do.

140
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,859
All right, crisis averted.

141
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,733
And a new one's just begun.

142
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,982
You're not getting Obama.

143
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,201
I'm not here for him.

144
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,489
I'm here for my daughter.

145
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,288
And I need your help.

146
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,359
I assure you this is
completely unnecessary.

147
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,966
I come, as they say, in peace.

148
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,586
And I, they say,
think you're full of crap.

149
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,257
I'm a changed man, Sara.

150
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,991
The only change I wanna see you
go through is from alive to dead.

151
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,974
Ray, how are we doing
with Constantine's spell?

152
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,348
Just need one more
splash of bat spleen.

153
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,559
Sorry, bat. And that should do it.

154
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,902
Maybe I missed an ingredient.

155
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,524
Your ankh symbol, it's upside down.

156
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,817
Uh...

157
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,111
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

158
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
No, it's not.

159
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,822
Ooh, I knew it'd be difficult
to get you guys to trust me.

160
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,528
Mmm, try impossible.

161
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,864
Which is why I brought
this gesture of good faith.

162
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,415
The Water Totem?

163
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,203
I borrowed it from my daughter after
she ripped it from Kuasa's chest.

164
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,291
Sorry about that, by the way.

165
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,698
Do you guys mind if
I give you a hand with this?

166
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,258
You seem to be struggling a bit.

167
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,139
Yeah? Okay, great.

168
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,188
Cool.

169
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,272
Uh, now, try to choke me.

170
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,358
- Really?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,522
- You can't.
- Satisfied?

172
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,615
Yeah.

173
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,566
That Water Totem's
gotta be worth something.

174
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,619
With all six, you guys might actually
have a chance against Mallus.

175
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,267
You mean the same demon you've been
creating anachronisms to release?

176
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,731
That was before I realized
what our partnership would cost me.

177
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,624
- Nora...
- Dies the moment the demon escapes.

178
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,169
Now I know this might
rankle you a bit, Sara,

179
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,083
but our interests are aligned.

180
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,632
We can save Nora and
stop Mallus from being freed

181
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,722
together.

182
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,882
- No.
- Excuse me?

183
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,926
Rory, kill him.

184
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,765
No, no... Wait, wait, wait.
Okay, look.

185
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,250
I know Damien has done
terrible things in his past,

186
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,813
which cannot be forgiven, but
I know that he loves his daughter.

187
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,397
We can't just kill him.

188
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,356
He was already dead. Killing him
would be repairing an anachronism.

189
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,357
So would incarcerating him
in the Bureau.

190
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,191
I agree with Rip.

191
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,486
We need to think through
this situation rationally.

192
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,741
Boss?

193
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,995
Stand down.

194
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,794
Glad to see you came to your senses.

195
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,871
Think this makes us
straight, you're wrong.

196
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,922
What are we even doing here, man?
We need to stop Amaya,

197
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,215
not party with the village.

198
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,854
There she is.

199
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,458
Okay. Great, let's get her out of here.

200
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,648
Not our Amaya.

201
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,234
That Amaya.

202
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,867
What's wrong?

203
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,401
Nothing, it just means

204
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,992
my Amaya comes back to Zambesi.

205
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,494
And we don't grow old together.

206
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,873
For thousands of years,

207
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,048
the Anansi Totem
has been in my family,

208
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:39,258
and tonight, it is my great joy

209
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:45,636
to pass this Totem
down to my own daughter.

210
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Make way

211
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,936
for the new protector of Zambesi.

212
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:53,980
Esi.

213
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,205
Kuasa,

214
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,870
where is Esi, child?

215
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,793
I'm sorry, Nana Baa,

216
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,706
but Mother isn't coming.

217
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,091
My daughter

218
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:27,385
has chosen to reject
her destiny and her duty.

219
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,021
I am sorry.

220
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,190
We have come here for nothing.

221
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:42,993
Come on.

222
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,870
Amaya.

223
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,413
What just happened?

224
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,988
My daughter rejected the Totem.

225
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,852
You sound more excited
than I thought you'd be.

226
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,162
Esi never bonded with the Totem.

227
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,249
This is why the warlords were
able to destroy my village.

228
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,298
You think you can convince Esi
to be a Totem bearer.

229
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,126
She'll protect the village tomorrow.

230
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,298
She'll protect Kuasa.

231
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,671
Everything will change.

232
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,887
That's the problem.

233
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,744
I saw what happened with Barry Allen

234
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,621
when he went back and
stopped his mother's murderer.

235
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,011
A little thing called Flashpoint.

236
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,437
We can't change history. I'm sorry.

237
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,223
Tell her, Nate.

238
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,069
Nate?

239
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,692
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but screw history for once.

240
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,942
Okay, so you go
talk to your daughter,

241
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,072
and I'll go talk to you.

242
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,828
The older you.

243
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,124
You always had a way with her.

244
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,418
Come on.

245
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,755
Wait, we're doing what?

246
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,465
So, listen.

247
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,096
Are you okay?

248
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,681
The hardest thing I ever had to do
in my life was to let Darhk live.

249
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,975
And now he's back.

250
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,805
And it is taking every
ounce of self-control

251
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,022
not to kill him.

252
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,027
And I keep asking myself

253
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
why?

254
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,776
For the good of the mission.

255
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,816
"For the good of the mission."

256
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,243
Listen to yourself,
you sound like some

257
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,661
- government...
- Clone?

258
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,739
I was gonna say stiff.

259
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,894
You know, Rip thought I could
talk some sense into you, but maybe...

260
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,918
Wait.

261
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,290
You're here because of Rip?

262
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,788
Why would you do
anything for that man?

263
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,300
Ava, he lied to you.

264
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,337
He implanted
false memories into your head,

265
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,468
he hired actors
to pretend to be your parents.

266
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,540
I mean, what more is it gonna
take to get you to confront him?

267
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,311
I am prioritizing the mission
over my own personal baggage.

268
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,997
You and your team
should try it sometime.

269
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,359
No.

270
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,193
That's not what you're doing.

271
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,860
You're covering,

272
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,321
because you're afraid of
what you might find out.

273
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,888
What else is there to find out, Sara?

274
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,721
I'm one of thousands.
I was grown in a lab.

275
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,486
There has to be
more to the story, Ava,

276
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,037
and you deserve to know.

277
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:53,874
Look, you need...

278
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,501
You need to
talk to Rip now.

279
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,833
Ah!

280
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,876
I could do with a wee nip myself.

281
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,217
Everything good, Director Sharpe?

282
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,724
Peachy.

283
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,176
Are we good to transport Mr. Darhk

284
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,351
back to the Bureau?

285
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,057
No, Rip, we're not.

286
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,275
Where are you going?

287
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,080
To go talk to someone
who can think straight

288
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,940
when the whole world has gone crazy.

289
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,438
So what you're saying is

290
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,740
you won't aid
the man that killed your sister

291
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,527
even if it'll prevent
Mollusk from escaping...

292
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,746
Mallus.

293
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,091
...from escaping his
interdimensional prison,

294
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,082
and wreaking havoc across time?

295
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,654
Yeah, when you put it that way,
it does sound kind of petty.

296
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,496
Not at all. It sounds...

297
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,630
It sounds human.

298
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,717
Okay.

299
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,632
But then what, I'm just
supposed to hand Darhk over

300
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,054
to Ava and let
the Time Bureau deal with him?

301
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,554
Your ex is clinging to
rules and regulations

302
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,269
in the face of the startling
revelation that she is...

303
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,230
I'm sorry, a clone, was it?

304
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,895
But here's the thing.

305
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,235
I'm not convinced

306
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,189
the Bureau is
best equipped to stop a demon.

307
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,656
No, it sounds like

308
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,073
that calls for a much more

309
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,829
unorthodox approach.

310
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,205
I really miss you.

311
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,674
Oh, hi, guys.

312
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,381
I do hope you're not feeling
all killy, killy, stabby, stabby.

313
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,890
I want you to listen to me carefully.

314
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,474
I don't believe for
a second that you have changed.

315
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,389
You're still the same
cowardly son of a bitch

316
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,940
that put an arrow in my sister.

317
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:48,236
But I will work with you
to defeat Mallus under one condition.

318
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,939
After this is over,

319
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,608
I'm putting you back
in the ground where you belong.

320
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,536
Deal.

321
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,091
Huh.

322
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,463
So, do any of these flashing
screens actually do anything?

323
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,592
Focus, Damien,

324
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,765
how do we capture
your demon daughter?

325
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:20,094
If we coordinate a strike between
the Legends and the Time Bureau,

326
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,100
we might be able to take it out.

327
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,390
How did that work
for you in Victorian London?

328
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,943
Besides, my little angel's
only gotten more powerful since.

329
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,570
What if we just ask Nora nicely?

330
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,486
I did have a bit of
a connection with her in Berlin.

331
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,613
Not that kind.

332
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,491
All right, maybe she'll
listen to her dear old dad.

333
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,914
Not anymore.
Nora only listens to Mallus now.

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,286
He's always in her ear.

335
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,209
That's it. What if I got inside Nora?

336
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,251
Not like that.

337
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,750
What if I shrunk down,

338
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,924
flew into her ear,

339
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,968
and pretended to be Mallus?

340
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,881
Okay, new guy on the team here,
is that a joke plan or a real plan?

341
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,010
We are so screwed.

342
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,181
No, this could work.

343
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,726
We just have to
convince her that it's actually him.

344
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,020
<i>This is how you
would serve your city?</i>

345
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,941
<i>You would risk its utter ruin?</i>

346
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,069
That's it.

347
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,170
<i>I did what I judged
to be right.</i>

348
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,072
<i>What you judged to be right.</i>

349
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,410
<i>You sent the ring
of power into Mordor</i>

350
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,530
<i>in the hands of a witless halfling.</i>

351
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,666
Well, the vocal similarity
to Mallus is uncanny.

352
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,835
Quiet!

353
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,253
Gideon? Who is that actor?

354
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,876
And how can we get him
without dealing with his agent?

355
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,213
Mr. Noble, uh, we have
some, uh, last minute rewrites.

356
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:44,137
Tell Peter Jackson no more chickens.
Huh?

357
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,430
I had four this morning. Hmm.

358
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,524
So what's up, mate?

359
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,897
Yeah, so the rewrites
are from Peter, and he'd like me to, uh,

360
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:51,987
run the lines with you.

361
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,312
You're kidding.

362
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,573
Okay.

363
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,235
Uh, let's see.

364
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,988
"Nora, you must heed my command."

365
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,114
Okay, that's good.

366
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,612
- Who's Nora?
- Nora?

367
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,618
Nora, she's a new character that, um...

368
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,916
They wanted to beef up
the female presence in the film.

369
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,416
You can't do that, mate.
It's Tolkien. <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

370
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,963
Right, right, but it's a studio note.

371
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,166
Oh, studio note. Very good, now I care.

372
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
Yeah, from the top.

373
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,839
Mmm.

374
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,217
"Nora, you must heed my command."

375
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,843
Uh, "What is it, Master?"

376
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,300
"Go to the <i>Waverider,</i> Nora."

377
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,223
"I cannot go to the <i>Waverider."</i>

378
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,556
"The Totems are ripe
for the picking."

379
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,710
This is crap, isn't it, eh?

380
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,521
- Oh, well...
- I mean, who wrote this?

381
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,297
- I mean somebody...
- Don't worry about it.

382
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,321
Don't worry about it.

383
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,112
"The Totems are ripe
for the picking."

384
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,064
"Your father will lead you to them."

385
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,159
"My father?"

386
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,575
Esi.

387
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,667
Who are you?

388
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,293
I am a distant cousin.

389
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,291
I came for the ceremony.

390
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,832
Sorry to disappoint you.

391
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,052
I love it here.

392
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,923
When I was a child, I'd come here
and lose myself in the stars,

393
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,635
think about where my life would lead.

394
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,889
For as long as I can remember,

395
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,068
the Anansi Totem
has been my destiny.

396
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,151
But now, I'm not sure I want it.

397
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,110
You wouldn't understand.

398
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,570
Try me.

399
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,869
My mother

400
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,372
is the great Amaya Jiwe.

401
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,130
She's protected
our village her entire life.

402
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,002
She never doubted,

403
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,716
never wavered.

404
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:39,803
That's not true.

405
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,714
Every Totem bearer
starts their journey with doubt.

406
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,768
Even your mother.

407
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,141
I will never live up to her legacy.

408
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,981
You have her strength

409
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,558
and the strength of
all others who've come before her.

410
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,186
But there is danger coming.

411
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,151
And your people need you
to stand up for them.

412
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,754
All right, you ff-thoom
into Amaya's hut,

413
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,804
grab the Totem,
and we'll give it to her daughter.

414
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,345
Nate, now that you have
some space from her,

415
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,094
I need you to come to your senses.

416
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,830
Amaya can't see that.
She's too close,

417
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,884
but she's going to cause
more harm than good

418
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020
if this releases Mallus.

419
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,562
- We don't know that.
- We do.

420
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,056
You do.

421
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,736
I can't not help her, Wally.

422
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,491
I love you, man, but I will stop you
if you take this too far.

423
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,382
Like stealing candy
from a very old baby.

424
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,593
Oh.

425
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,530
Ah!

426
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,824
Amaya, wait, it's me.

427
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,934
You know, I didn't think
this would do it for me,

428
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,039
but actually it kinda does.

429
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,333
Who are you?

430
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,455
It's me, Nate.

431
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,712
Who?

432
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,797
Nate.

433
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,485
I know it's been a while, but we
used to travel through time together,

434
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,466
you know, do other things.

435
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,502
If this is some kind of a joke...

436
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,178
It's not a joke. I have pictures

437
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,140
of us on my phone.

438
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,849
Ow!

439
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,818
This is me.

440
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Of course.

441
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,760
You really don't remember, do you?

442
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,320
How is this possible?

443
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,130
You were part of a bitchin' team that
traveled through time together.

444
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,904
I mean, the 1942 you.

445
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,866
Why are you here, time traveler?

446
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,455
To keep my promise to you.

447
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,832
By making sure your daughter, Esi,

448
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,715
gets the Spirit Totem tonight.

449
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,137
She didn't even show up
to her own ceremony.

450
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,466
Her head is always somewhere else.

451
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,343
She doesn't know what she wants.

452
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,056
Yeah, you had a hard time

453
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,186
figuring that out too
when you were her age.

454
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,773
But look, if Esi believed
you were truly in her corner,

455
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,817
she wouldn't doubt herself.

456
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,070
She would accept
the Totem and be unstoppable.

457
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:54,867
Just like you.

458
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,913
Uh, hey there, Nora doll.

459
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,090
Why am I still here?

460
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,251
Why is the master still in prison?

461
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,345
You failed me!

462
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,762
I know, it's terrible.

463
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,464
The Legends captured Grodd,

464
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,925
and this whole Obama thing
is just not working, so perhaps,

465
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,937
Mallus can advise us
as to what to do next.

466
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,569
Mallus

467
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,816
only speaks when he desires.

468
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,989
I can't just summon him.

469
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,074
Well, maybe we'll just

470
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,031
wait here until he gets the itch.

471
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:40,163
<i>Nora, you must heed my command.</i>

472
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,369
It's him. He's speaking to me

473
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,963
very loudly.

474
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,999
Really? Mallus is speaking to you?

475
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,925
Shh, I need to concentrate.

476
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,555
<i>Go to the</i> Waverider, <i>Nora.</i>

477
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,140
The <i>Waverider?</i> Why?

478
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,682
<i>The Totems are ripe for the picking.</i>

479
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,309
<i>Your father will lead you to them.</i>

480
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,399
My father?

481
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:07,148
What? Mallus has plans for me?
I wonder what those are.

482
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,106
The Legends' ship.
The master wants you to take me there.

483
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,943
Oh, I would in a heartbeat,

484
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,902
but we are hopelessly
outnumbered, honey.

485
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,996
There's just no...

486
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,697
<i>He must take you there now, Nora.</i>

487
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,875
Do it! Dad, do it! Don't be a fool.

488
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,668
No problemo. Let's go.

489
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,255
Those Totems should be
around here somewhere.

490
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,854
You.

491
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,935
What is this?

492
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,988
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but it's for your own good.

493
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,279
No.

494
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,779
No!

495
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,579
I get it.

496
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,250
You think that I failed you
because I joined with the Legends

497
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,375
and trapped you here.

498
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,625
Well, you're right. I did fail you.

499
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,085
But that's not how.

500
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,803
I was a terrible father.

501
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,425
I was obsessed with world domination.

502
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,226
Because of that,

503
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,187
I died.

504
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,556
Leaving you all alone as a child,

505
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:31,186
trapped with my name
and my foolish dreams.

506
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,490
Oh, I turned you into
a demon long before Mallus did.

507
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,241
That's why I'm begging you,

508
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,284
do not let him take you away from me.

509
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,912
Your daughter is long gone.

510
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:46,878
No!

511
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,124
I know you can hear me. Fight him!

512
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,713
Oh, there was no fight.

513
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,841
Her soul,

514
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,213
her flesh

515
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,391
were freely given.

516
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,760
You sick son of a bitch.

517
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,001
One more alteration to the timeline,

518
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,108
and my cage crumbles.

519
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,701
I can't believe that worked.

520
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,121
I can.

521
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,621
Sara knows what she's doing.

522
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,911
I may have my flaws,

523
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,121
but I do know how to pick
the best people for the job.

524
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,211
So why did you pick me?

525
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,964
What? Come on.

526
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,834
Brilliant mind, calm demeanor,
incredible strength,

527
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,012
and unlike the Legends,
you actually follow rules.

528
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,692
It almost sounds like
I was made for the job.

529
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,268
What are you getting at?

530
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,137
I know I'm a clone, Rip.

531
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,438
I see.

532
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,733
So why me, hmm?

533
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,604
Of all the clones in 2213,
why did you pick me?

534
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,198
You're special.

535
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,569
So why'd you erase my memory?

536
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,071
I thought it would be easier.

537
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,161
Easier?

538
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,703
Easier for you, or easier for me?

539
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,450
Don't lose focus, Ava,

540
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,328
you are too critical to this mission.

541
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,659
Well, the good news is, if I die,

542
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,587
you can just skip off to 2213
and get yourself another clone.

543
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,174
Oh, my God.

544
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:18,968
I wasn't even the first one, was I?

545
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,841
We both know how hard it is

546
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,131
to find agents as talented as you.

547
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,142
And to find one
who's also replaceable is invaluable.

548
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,514
How many?

549
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,105
How many?

550
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,273
You're the 12th.

551
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,193
The 12th?

552
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,733
So I wasn't even your first choice.

553
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,236
- Or your second, or...
- You don't understand.

554
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,277
- You are exceptional.
- Don't, Rip.

555
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Just don't.

556
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,253
Nora's gone.

557
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,214
It's just Mallus now.

558
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,715
You must be enjoying this.
Seeing your nemesis with a broken heart.

559
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,762
I didn't know you
had a heart to break.

560
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,678
Where was it the night
you murdered my sister?

561
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,470
Look, what I did was unforgivable.

562
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,542
But back then
I hadn't loved anyone enough

563
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,398
to understand the pain that I caused.

564
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,931
Not that it's any comfort,
but if I could take it all back,

565
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,114
I would.

566
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,774
We all have regrets.

567
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,989
But we can't undo
the things that we've done.

568
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,075
True.

569
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,541
But even the worst of us
can be made whole again.

570
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,793
You, for example.

571
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,460
League to Legend, killer to Captain.
That's not a bad makeover, is it?

572
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,041
It's not good enough.

573
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,134
Why?

574
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,980
Because you put on the Death Totem
and almost killed your entire team?

575
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,591
- Yes.
- But you didn't.

576
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,218
Did you. And you know why?

577
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,119
The same reason I'm spilling my guts

578
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,635
to a woman who's imagined
my death 1,000 times over.

579
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,140
More like 10,000.

580
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,397
Love,

581
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,191
Sara.

582
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,636
'Cause without it, people like us,

583
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,852
we're left alone with the darkness.

584
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,933
That's not good for anyone, is it?

585
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,290
I'm so proud of you, my child.

586
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,671
Esi's embraced her destiny.

587
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,351
Tomorrow when
the marauders come, she'll be ready.

588
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,833
And if she's not, we'll be
right there to fight alongside her.

589
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,723
You don't have to stay, Nathaniel.

590
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,875
I know that what I did was selfish.

591
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,606
You couldn't be selfish if you tried.

592
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,999
Now, you see that
booming granny over there?

593
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,818
She doesn't remember me.

594
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,779
Or the Legends.

595
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,618
You know why that is?

596
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,330
I must have erased my memory.

597
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,917
And why would you do that?

598
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,628
Because if I chose to come back here

599
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,332
after everything
we've been through, then

600
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,796
erasing you would be the only way

601
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,969
that I could be
the protector my people deserve.

602
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,473
Otherwise, I'd always
be split in two.

603
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,430
And part of me would be
in love with you.

604
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,583
I tried to reason with them,
but they won't listen.

605
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,223
Amaya is dead set
on saving her village.

606
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,318
And Nate, he's just...

607
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,796
- Whipped.
- I was gonna say in love.

608
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
But yeah, same thing.

609
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,704
Zari, please tell me
that you found a loophole

610
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,261
that allows Amaya
to save her village.

611
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,066
There is no loophole.

612
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,867
I tried billions of variations

613
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,990
but this event has
too many ripple effects.

614
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,408
<i>The village has to be destroyed.</i>

615
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,659
Or Mallus is freed.

616
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,116
And we're all doomed.

617
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,503
What if we're not?

618
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,583
Hmm?

619
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,544
We have the six Totems,

620
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,466
the only thing that
Mallus is afraid of.

621
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,920
But you can't fight
what you can't see.

622
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,049
What if the only way to kill Mallus
is to let him out?

623
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,930
Are you really suggesting
that we allow Mallus to escape,

624
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,900
because you have
a collection of magical stones?

625
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,264
We have two choices.
We fight Amaya, or we fight Mallus.

626
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,853
And I know it sounds
crazy to let a time demon out,

627
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,730
but it's a hell of lot
easier to stomach

628
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,193
than turning on a friend.

629
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,814
Okay, yes, but didn't
the original Totem bearers try

630
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,274
and face Mallus and blow it?

631
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,596
Constantine said that the only
reason they couldn't kill Mallus

632
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,577
was because the
Death Totem betrayed them.

633
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,978
And that's not gonna
happen this time.

634
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,535
How can you be so sure?

635
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,063
I needn't remind you what happened
the last time you tried to wield it.

636
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,294
She won't have to wield it.

637
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,422
I will.

638
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,590
The Death Totem was
attracted to Captain Lance

639
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,508
because of a unique quality
we both share.

640
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,719
We were both brought
back from the dead.

641
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,888
Plus, I have a personal stake

642
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,806
in wanting to send
Mallus straight to hell.

643
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,059
He took my little girl.

644
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,895
True as that may be,
there is no chance

645
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,724
that Captain Lance will trust you
with such a dangerous weapon.

646
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,107
Death Totem's all yours.

647
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,925
Sara, you can't be serious.

648
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,190
Ava, we don't have a choice.

649
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,117
Our only choice is to stop Amaya
and stop the anachronisms.

650
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,412
- This is insanity.
- Insane is what we do best, Ava.

651
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,725
I will not
condone this behavior

652
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,786
and the Bureau certainly
does not stand behind you.

653
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,771
Rip, let's go, we have work to do.

654
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,106
Remember when I told you
that we would need

655
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,587
the Legends before this was through?

656
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,174
Perhaps it is time that
we set aside the scalpel,

657
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,381
and let them be the chainsaw.

658
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,589
I will consider that
your resignation.

659
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,643
Ava.

660
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,562
Ava, wait.

661
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,213
This plan can work and you know it.

662
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,603
You just need to trust your gut.

663
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,364
My gut?

664
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,770
You mean the one that was
manufactured to factory settings?

665
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,611
The same gut that 11 other Avas used
and got killed?

666
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,367
Ava, please.

667
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,455
- Just trust me.
- You don't understand.

668
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,624
This plan breaks
every rule in every book,

669
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,998
and all I have right now
are the rules, okay?

670
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,501
You have me.

671
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,348
What are you doing?

672
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,555
I'm admitting something
that could save us both.

673
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,596
I love you.

674
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,022
There is no me to love.

675
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,619
She looks good out there. Ready.

676
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,580
Like mother, like daughter.

677
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,047
The warlords are early.

678
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,637
Hey. Don't. Don't. Puma pounces.

679
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,259
Really, Wally, you're gonna do this?

680
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,350
It's not like that, Nate.

681
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,676
- I know why you're here.
- No, no, you really don't.

682
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,499
Short version, Nora's on the ship,
tripping on Mallus juice.

683
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,231
Damien Darhk gave us the Water Totem
after they saved Barack Obama,

684
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,604
and, uh, we are here to
help you create the anachronism

685
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,654
so we can release Mallus
and then we can kill him.

686
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,067
Oh, and I met John Noble.

687
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,488
So you're working with Damien Darhk.

688
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,239
Please don't rub it in.

689
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,682
And you're letting him
wield the Death Totem.

690
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,823
In order to do justice
for someone I love.

691
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,061
Sure you can understand that.

692
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,997
Thankfully, that is
our only similarity.

693
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,046
- Hmm.
- So, who gets Earth, who gets Water?

694
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,374
Well, as a man of steel,

695
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,147
which is an element, I always felt
a strong connection to the Earth.

696
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,716
Actually, steel is
an alloy of iron and carbon.

697
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,133
Also, I've watched every
single episode of <i>Planet Earth</i>

698
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,425
on Blu-ray and I was
only stoned all of the time.

699
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,727
Can I just please have
the damn Totem? Thank you.

700
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,221
All yours. And Water, anyone?

701
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,557
Actually water is really powerful.

702
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,600
It's crucial to life on Earth.

703
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,607
Did you know that
we are made up of 60% water?

704
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,377
All right, I think we get it.
Take a Totem.

705
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,884
Oh, I wasn't making a pitch for one.

706
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,908
Just take the Totem.

707
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:38,993
Okay, cool.

708
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,429
All right, so is there like

709
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,445
an instruction manual,
a YouTube video...

710
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:43,664
You better figure it out.

711
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,869
Warlords are coming, and that means

712
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,913
Mallus is about to make his debut.

713
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,372
Dad.

714
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,583
Nora...

715
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,797
You're here, but

716
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,801
how? The Totem means you're dead.

717
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,684
No.

718
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,102
Not yet.

719
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,854
Mallus is trying to take me
but I'm still fighting him.

720
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,483
For now.

721
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,776
But Dad...

722
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,062
I made a mistake.

723
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,481
I'm sorry.

724
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,358
I don't want him to take me.

725
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,409
Please don't let him
take me. I'm scared.

726
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,036
You ready?

727
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,670
Yeah, let's do this
before it's too late.

728
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,549
This place has been sacred
to my people since dawn of time.

729
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,101
The Totems will be strongest here.

730
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,520
Oh, they'd better be.
Because mine's not turning on.

731
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,609
It's time.

732
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,567
As soon as Esi defeats the warlords,

733
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,645
our fight against Mallus begins.

734
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,121
Should we help your daughter?

735
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,004
Esi's got this.

736
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,339
No, no! No, no, don't kill me!

737
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,504
Looks like it's time
to meet our monster.

738
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:20,964
Or our maker.

739
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,261
I'm not dying today.

740
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,181
Here's Mallus.

741
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,850
Why isn't she transforming?

742
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,149
Rip, what gives?

743
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,772
Historical record is showing
that Zambesi is still destroyed.

744
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,963
It doesn't make any sense.

745
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,467
The battle is over.
The good guys won.

746
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,066
Rip, what's going on?

747
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Oh, my God.

748
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,765
The warlords don't
destroy the village.

749
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,910
The village is destroyed by
an angry gorilla.

750
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,381
I had to. She's my daughter.

751
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,467
You released Grodd.

752
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,088
I need history to run its course.

753
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,849
Your time must end.

754
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,275
This way. Quick.

755
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,193
You should go too, Mame.

756
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,612
I can handle this beast.

757
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,903
I believe in you, obaba.

758
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,508
Esi. No.

759
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,054
Amaya!

760
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,144
Amaya. Hey, hey.

761
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,397
Are you okay?

762
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,025
I'm okay.

763
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,728
Nate, my family. Ah!

764
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,483
I won't let them die.

765
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,819
I promise.

766
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,784
Damien, Mallus is coming.
This won't save Nora.

767
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,710
If there's a chance in hell,
I'm gonna take it.

768
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,116
I'll handle this.

769
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,712
Always incapacitate
your Speedster first.

770
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,005
That's day one stuff.

771
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,004
Let him go.

772
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,425
I'm warning you.
Don't stand in my way.

773
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,385
I was powerful
before I had this trinket

774
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,141
but now I'm unstoppable.

775
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,893
Yeah, we've heard that one before.

776
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,488
I don't wanna kill you.

777
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,234
I wanna kill them
to save my daughter.

778
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,111
Why can't you understand that?

779
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,175
I can't move.

780
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,269
What is happening?

781
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,973
Foolish human, you are
now mine to control.

782
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,937
You will not harm my village.

783
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,026
Mame.

784
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,568
Get away from him!

785
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,073
It worked!

786
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:40,669
Amaya.

787
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,130
Nathaniel.

788
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,015
I didn't take you for a Totem bearer.

789
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,179
That makes two of us.

790
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,019
Nora.

791
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,693
I'll find you, I promise.

792
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,946
Go.

793
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,831
Go!

794
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,378
Hey!

795
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,795
Performance anxiety, Raymond?

796
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,469
You're only proving my point that
this plan was never gonna work.

797
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,265
Oh, come on. Don't make me do this.

798
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:40,970
It's too bad, really.

799
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,389
I was just beginning
to like you after Berlin.

800
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,159
You literally stabbed me in the back.

801
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,995
It only seemed fitting.

802
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,051
You're lucky I wasn't
aiming for your heart.

803
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,161
I'm not gonna let
Nora be taken by him.

804
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,784
Nora's gone, Damien.

805
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:16,843
Finally,

806
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,092
I am free.

807
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:38,823
No.

808
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,371
- Nora.
- You can't help her, Ray.

809
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:42,916
Oh, my God.

810
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,921
I am so much more than a god.
