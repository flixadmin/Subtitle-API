more I can do. I can feel it.

you had a "feeling"

you could transform
without a cog?

You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

- I do trust in him.

124

Hey, if we did have cogs--

125
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,765
I'd transform into a
shovel and beat you.

I don't like how fast
you answered that.

Apology accepted.

Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

Feeling like I have
enough power in me

00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,902
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

163
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,563
You don't have
the touch or the power.

- Mm-hmm.

- You ready?
- Always ready.

167
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:35,076
Let's punch in.

168
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,781
[Elita] Here we go.
This one won't be open long.

169
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:38,112
Brace it up!

170

Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

The tunnel is closing.

I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

- You with me, D?
- [D-16] On your six! Keep going!

Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

I'm falling back to assist.

Do not break protocol. Evacuate!</i>

We're gonna need more lift.

198
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,610
It's closing!
Just grab your pack and go.

199
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,853
Yeah. Good idea.

200
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:51,185

Nothing much. Just normal

It's all good.
[deep rumbling]

What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

00:11:38,694 --> 00:11:41,268
- I did, eventually.
- If I get fired because of you--

00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,237
Oh, please.
They're not gonna fire you.

221
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,668
Elita-1, you're fired.

222
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:48,737
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

223
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,673
That is true. I was the
one who broke the rules.

224

No one asked you!

225

Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard for this.

226
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:57,713
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

227
00:11:57,713 --> 00:12:00,386
Report to waste management
immediately.

Waste management?

- Next time, why don't you stop and think

before you ruin someone's life?

231

I'm sorry!

- Don't do it.

I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

Guess which one? I'll
give you a "limited option."

[D-16] That really hurt. [sighs]

What'd you expect?
He's metal.

243

You know you were
out of line,

to a superior like that.

He deserves it.

Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

He had every right
to hit me. I interfered.

Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

I'm glad
you were there with me

That was fun.

But-- But if we beat

it proves
we're just as good as they are.

of so much more!

Or we get
publicly humiliated

and then busted
back to tier one.

306

Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

We can't fly,
we can't roll,

469
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:39,986
It's clear.

470
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:45,420
Orion Pax.

471
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,895
D-16.

472
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,534
What you two did today

473
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:52,130
was one of the craziest
things I've ever seen.

474
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,638
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

475
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:56,068
I loved it!

476
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,135
You did?

477
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,005
How could anyone
not love it?

478
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:01,777
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

479
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:04,175
So we're not
getting demoted?

480
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:05,374
Demoted?

481
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:08,212
[laughing]

482
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:10,115
[both laughing nervously]

483
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,479
Demoted.

484
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,755
[laughter continues]

485
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,482
What is happening?

486
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:17,089
[laughs awkwardly]

487
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,289
The fact of the matter is
we're halfway into the first shift

488
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:24,668
since the race ended and that mining
crew has already reached 150% quota.

489
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:26,802
You inspired them
to work harder!

490
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:28,903
Sentinel Prime, sir,

491
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:33,171
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

492
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,107
That we bots can do
more than just mine--

493
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:38,440
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

494
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,178
Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

495
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,477
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

496
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:44,622
[laughs] Wow! Okay, great.

497
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:46,415
[stammering]
That sounds incredible.

498
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:48,318
- I would love to--
- Sir, it's time.

499
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:49,957
Ah, yes.

500
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,629
I'm sorry, friends.

501
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,697
We're preparing our
next travel to the surface.

502
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:56,491
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

503
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:59,637
Hang tight. Airachnid,
have someone escort these heroes

504
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:01,496
to my personal
service facilities.

505
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,499
Best care in Iacon.

506
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,336
Until next time, legends.

507
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:14,113
Sentinel Prime. [laughs]
The Sentinel Prime!

508
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,214
- You still mad at me?
- I am less mad at you.

509
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,854
I'm telling you, D. I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

510
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:20,020
and we're gonna go--
[heavy footsteps]

511
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,858
[growling] Miners!

512
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,927
Hi, Darkwing.

513
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:29,491
- [Orion] Oh, no, no, no.
- [D-16] No! [yells]

514
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,066
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

515
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,563
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

516
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:38,874
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

517
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:40,370
I'll make sure of that.

518
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,680
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

519
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,814
[groans]
I hate that guy!

520
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,882
[clattering]

521
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:52,888
[clattering continues]

522
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:00,357
You! How did you get down here?

523
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:02,095
There's no access to this level.

524
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:04,130
There is nobody
down here but me.

525
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,671
[stammers indistinctly]
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

526
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:09,905
You're others!
You're not... me!

527
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:12,644
You're here,
and you're not me!

528
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:14,877
[laughs]

529
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,879
- Uh, yeah.
- Awesome!

530
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:19,376
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

531
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,576
I just haven't had
a lot of company

532
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:23,688
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

533
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:26,955
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

534
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,616
That's what I thought!

535
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:31,586
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

536
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:33,357
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

537
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:34,765
How long have you
been down here?

538
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,426
How long have I been here?
[laughs]

539
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:39,627
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

540
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:43,367
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

541
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:45,237
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

542
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:48,273
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

543
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,747
But you can call me B.

544
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:51,408
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

545
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:54,114
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

546
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,887
Which is actually pronounced...
[deep voice] "Badassatron."

547
00:26:57,887 --> 00:26:59,251
But if you have any critiques--

548
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,254
Yeah, great.
How do we get out of here?

549
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,190
Great question. You don't.

550
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,796
- We don't?
- Nope.

551
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:08,095
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

552
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:12,165
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

553
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:15,201
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

554
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,774
- Which is?
- Oh!

555
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:19,711
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

556
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,504
onto the conveyor belt.

557
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:24,441
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

558
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:27,147
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

559
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,182
So you watch garbage burn.

560
00:27:29,182 --> 00:27:30,678
Yes!

561
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:32,317
It is so great
that you're here now.

562
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,220
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

563
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,057
And then tell you
everything about me!

564
00:27:36,057 --> 00:27:38,961
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

565
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,292
with one or two
new best friends.

566
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,492
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

567
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,164
[splutters]
Where are my manners?

568
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,968
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

569
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:47,970
Hey, guys, we've got company!

570
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:51,776
This is EP-508,

571
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:55,538
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

572
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:57,947
- "Steve"?
- Yeah, he's foreign.

573
00:27:57,947 --> 00:27:59,916
Question:
Do they talk back to you?

574
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:02,215
Um, they're not real.

575
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:04,855
[laughing]
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

576
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:06,318
It's just
you've been down here a--

577
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,891
No, I was talking to Steve.
[beeps and whirs]

578
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:09,354
[indistinct robotic speech]
[laughs]

579
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,520
Classic Steve.

580
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,324
- What is that?
- Look at this guy.

581
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,360
[mocks electronic speech]
It's coming from inside.

582
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,868
Oh! Steve! No!

583
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:21,069
- I am so sorry.
- [dramatically] Steve, no!

584
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,170
- We can fix it, don't worry.
- My Steve!

585
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,076
[voice over transmission]
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

586
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:31,211
<i>Calling the High Guard for
immediate support. Immediate support!</i>

587
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,477
That's Alpha Trion.

588
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:35,017
One of the Primes?

589
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:37,349
<i>Repeat,
Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

590
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,187
- It's an SOS message.
<i>- Protect the Matrix!</i>

591
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:43,454
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

592
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:49,361
Holy Primus!

593
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,661
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

594
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:57,270
This could be where the Primes
died in the Quintesson war.

595
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,702
Which means
this is where we could find

596
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:03,045
the Matrix of Leadership.

597
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:06,576
What are you talking about? It's an old
beacon inside a statue made of garbage.

598
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,215
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

599
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:10,987
- the Matrix of Leadership.
- No. No way. Absolutely not!

600
00:29:10,987 --> 00:29:13,781
Hey, D, come on, this could be our
chance to show everyone we're not--

601
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,222
You already tried
to "show everyone"

602
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:16,751
in the race you
tricked me into running,

603
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,126
which got us
stuck down here

604
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:20,557
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

605
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,494
really cool guy.

606
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,727
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm just saying--

607
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:27,531
There's a reason no
one goes to the surface.

608
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:29,269
It's dangerous!

609
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,634
I'm waiting right here until
Sentinel Prime finds us.

610
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,504
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

611
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:36,573
Well, we'll just stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

612
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:37,981
Forever? This is great!

613
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,214
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

614
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,150
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

615
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,284
I usually sleep on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

616
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,813
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

617
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:47,551
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

618
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:49,960
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

619
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,063
Hey, D, what do you think Sentinel's reaction
would be if you personally handed him

620
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:57,033
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

621
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,937
Okay, stop.
I know what you're trying to do.

622
00:29:59,937 --> 00:30:02,203
And it's definitely working.

Someone to hug, B.
How should I know?

I'm not waiting around
to find out.

This way.
We're close.

794

[Orion] Quintessons haven't
been here for 50 cycles.

795

[Elita] It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

796
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:52,529
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

797
00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:02,198
[B-127] Knives coming
out of the ceiling. Amazing.

Everyone,
do we have to go insi--?

Okay, yep, we're going in.

Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place

I've ever seen

This is ridiculous.

It's Alpha Trion!

00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:40,730
[Orion] He's powered down.

Whoa, whoa, it's okay!
It's okay.

00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,665
You're safe now.

I failed you, old friend.

You deserved
so much better than this end.

828
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:47,995
No, you didn't fail.

829
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,833
We heard your message.
We've come to find the Matrix.

830
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:54,034
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

831
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,937
Who are you?

832
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:58,302
We're cogless miners,
from Iacon.

833
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,404
Miners? Why?

834
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:02,845
Well, we've had
to drill for Energon

835
00:44:02,845 --> 00:44:04,979
ever since
it stopped flowing.

836
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,277
Impossible.

837
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,510
That's why we came.
To fix things.

838
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,578
If we find
the Matrix of Leadership

839
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:12,316
and get it to Sentinel Prime,
he can fix--

840
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,693
Sentinel is no Prime.

841
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:19,455
- What?
- He's broken. Fantastic.

842
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:21,292
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

843
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,195
Sentinel Prime
is our protector.

844
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:25,329
He's been saving us from
the Quintessons ever since--

845
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,300
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

846
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,303
I saw the truth
with my own eyes.

847
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:35,438
Come. I will show you.

[heavy footsteps]

849
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:44,920
For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons

850
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,022
had been a brutal conflict.

851
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:56,228
<i>Until Sentinel,
the principal aide to the Primes,</i>

853
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:04,137
<i>There was going to be a secret
gathering of Quintesson commanders.</i>

854
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:06,909
<i>Their elimination
could end the war.</i>

855
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:13,080
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

856
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,348
We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,

857
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,988
here in this cave.

858

For all the power
of Cybertron.

[Alpha Trion] <i>But Sentinel never understood

No!

Wait. Hold on. You're saying that
the Matrix of Leadership just vanished?

No.

No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

Why would Sentinel
do that?

884
00:47:04,752 --> 00:47:06,358
To make a bargain.

885
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:08,294
A bargain? With who?

Energon away to our greatest enemies!

943
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,802
And what do you think he's going to
do to us when he finds out that we know?

944
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,903
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

945
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:49,575
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

946
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:51,346
That's the whole thing!

947
00:51:51,346 --> 00:51:53,744
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

948
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:58,078
Fantastic! Another Orion Pax
master plan. I can't wait to hear this.

949
00:51:58,078 --> 00:51:59,453
Don't you want
to stop him?

950
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,356
No, I want to kill him!

951
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:04,293
I want to put Sentinel in chains

952
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:05,954
and march him
through the mines

953
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:09,496
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

954
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:13,434
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

955
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:16,129
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

956
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:17,768
what I want, right, Pax?

957
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,376
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

958
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:28,218
[D-16 chuckles bitterly] We had limited
options, and now... now we have none.

959
00:52:29,518 --> 00:52:34,488
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

960
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,425
Oh, yeah. I've been with
myself since I came online,

961
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:40,395
and this slot's
always been empty.

962
00:52:40,395 --> 00:52:42,430
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

963
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,027
No. No way. Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

964
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:50,471
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

965
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:55,674
We were born with transformation cogs,
but he...

966
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:57,643
He took them from us.

967
00:52:57,643 --> 00:53:00,877
What defines a Transformer...
[grunts]

968
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,352
...is not the cog
in his chest

969
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:08,390
but the spark
that resides in their core.

970
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:13,725
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

971
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:18,224
My fellow Primes had that spark.

972
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:22,272
And I see their strength
in you.

973
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:30,346
Take their cogs and
access your full potential.

974
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,480
Prima.

975
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:35,010
Onyx.

976
00:53:35,617 --> 00:53:37,144
Alchemist.

977
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,355
Micronus.

978
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:45,185
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

979
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:49,189
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

980
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,766
[electronic whirring]

981
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:05,315
[electronic whirring continues]

982
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:20,462
They were one. You are one.

983
00:54:20,462 --> 00:54:23,333
All are one!

984
00:54:36,513 --> 00:54:39,976
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

985
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:43,485
The ability
to change your world.

986
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:48,655
How you choose to use
that power is up to you.

987
00:54:50,285 --> 00:54:51,757
[laughs]

988
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,594
[heavy thud]

989
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:54,925
They've found us.

990
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,631
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

991
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:01,503
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

992
00:55:04,706 --> 00:55:08,004
Embedded in this are the
records I have shown you.

993
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,479
Use it to reveal the truth.

994
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:12,844
We will.

995
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:14,978
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

996
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,849
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

997
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:19,345
[thudding boom]
We're out of time.

998
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:20,984
We got to move!

999
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,756
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

1000
00:55:23,756 --> 00:55:26,319
Your fight will come,
my friend.

1001
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,696
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

1002
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:31,632
But this fight...
[heavy booming thud]

1003
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,535
This fight is mine.

1004
00:55:33,535 --> 00:55:36,032
Now go!
[thudding continues]

1005
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:48,451
Stand down, old timer.

1006
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:51,454
Ah. Old, you say?

1007
00:55:51,454 --> 00:55:53,390
[rumbling]

[roars]

1013
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,244
Not too old for you.

1014
00:56:25,787 --> 00:56:27,281
[roaring]

1015
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:30,251
We need to hurry!

1016
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:31,956
I still think
we have better odds

1017
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:33,727
fighting than outrunning them.

1018
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,763
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

1019
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:39,733
- That's right. Everyone ready?
- I was born ready.

1020
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:41,394
On three. One--

1021
00:56:41,394 --> 00:56:43,066
[all yelling]

[faint yelling, grunting]

1023
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:50,876
Ah!

00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,484
[laserfire pulsing]

1025
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:56,684
[grunting]

1026
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:58,213
How do we use these things?

1027
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,149
I don't know. Just try.

1028
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:02,052
[straining]

1029
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:04,725
It's working. Ha! It's working!

1030
00:57:05,486 --> 00:57:06,562
My head! My head!

1031
00:57:06,562 --> 00:57:07,629
Whoa!

1032
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:09,466
Help! Help!

1033
00:57:14,132 --> 00:57:16,671
This is not faster!

1034
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,806
[yells, grunts]

1035
00:57:19,806 --> 00:57:21,577
Oh, come on!

1036
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:24,679
And transform!

1037
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,978
[yelling]

1038
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:28,716

Whoa.

[grunts, laughs]

1047
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:07,150
Oh, wow.

1048
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,690
- We're alive!
- I've never moved that fast.

1049
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,484
- That was incredible!
- Did you see me slide all over?

Yes!

[laughing deliriously]

1056
00:58:22,968 --> 00:58:24,530
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

1057
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:28,204
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

1058
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,371
We transform!

1059
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:32,010
Oh, hey! I know.

1060
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,111
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

1061
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,310
Looks like the fastest way

1062
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,048
- back to Iacon is--
- Here, I got it.

1063
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:38,544
Hey, what are you doing?

1064
00:58:38,544 --> 00:58:40,249
- Don't worry, I got it.
- Yeah, but be careful.

1065
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:43,087
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

1066
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:49,764
I... got... it.

1067
00:58:51,768 --> 00:58:53,031
Okay.

1068
00:58:56,938 --> 00:58:58,300
Follow me.

1069
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:05,241
[wheezes]

00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,408
Alpha Trion!

1071
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:10,246
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

1072
00:59:11,117 --> 00:59:13,051
You look horrible.

1073
00:59:13,823 --> 00:59:18,188
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

1074
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:21,455
- Primus will surely--
- Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

1075
00:59:21,455 --> 00:59:25,261
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

1076
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,735
Anything to get
out of working for you

1077
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:29,100
and that boring
council of elders.

1078
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,300
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

1079
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,434
spend half the day
losing a war

1080
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:38,274
and the other half sitting around
waxing poetic about loyalty and honor.

1081
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:39,572
And now look at you.

1082
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:43,411
Hear my words:
You will fall.

1083
00:59:43,411 --> 00:59:45,479
And a new Prime will rise--

1084
00:59:45,479 --> 00:59:47,019
There you go again.

1085
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:49,956
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

1086
00:59:49,956 --> 00:59:51,287
[groans]

1087
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,761
There were others
in the cave with you.

1088
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:53,828
Who are they?

1089
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:56,963
They are to be your undoing.

1090
00:59:56,963 --> 01:00:01,396
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

1091

01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:10,504
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

1094
01:00:10,504 --> 01:00:12,143
You heard me, right?

1095
01:00:12,143 --> 01:00:14,574
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

1096
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:17,478
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

1097
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:19,084
[sighs]

1098
01:00:19,084 --> 01:00:21,317
Okay. Hunt down the others.

1099
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,659
With pleasure.

[engines humming]

1101
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:40,501
Hey, buddy.

1102
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:42,536
Oh. Hey.

1103
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,343
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

1104
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:51,677
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

1105
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:55,516
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

1106
01:00:55,516 --> 01:00:59,729
We are. With Alpha's proof inside that
device, we will show everyone the truth.

1107
01:00:59,729 --> 01:01:02,831
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

1108
01:01:02,831 --> 01:01:04,833
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

1109
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:07,099
They worship Sentinel.

1110
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:09,134
There's got to be a better
way to bring him down.

1111
01:01:09,134 --> 01:01:11,840
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

1112
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,941
I trusted Sentinel!

1113
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:15,635
With everything.

1114
01:01:16,814 --> 01:01:22,114
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

1115
01:01:24,712 --> 01:01:26,448
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

1116
01:01:26,448 --> 01:01:27,647
[electrical crackling]

1117
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:28,956
[grunting]

1118
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:30,320
[electronic sputtering]

1119
01:01:37,098 --> 01:01:39,296
[voice] All right,
wake them up.

1120
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:40,726
[gasps]

1121
01:01:40,726 --> 01:01:42,299
[breathes heavily]

1122
01:01:47,108 --> 01:01:48,503
[grunts]

1123
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:05,487
Now, are you spies

1124
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:09,799
or just incompetent lackeys?

1125
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:12,626
- We're not spies.
- But he is incompetent.

1126
01:02:12,626 --> 01:02:16,971
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

1127
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:21,536
That just means he believes himself,
like any spy would.

1128
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:23,538
[muffled indistinct speech]

1129
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:26,079
Uh, why is he gagged?

1130
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,773
He wouldn't stop talking.

1131
01:02:27,773 --> 01:02:29,313
[muffled speech continues]
Even when he was unconscious?

1132
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:31,546
Especially when
he was unconscious!

1133
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:32,789
Enough!

1134
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:35,385
Two options for you!

1135
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:40,093
One, we slowly dismantle each
of you one bolt and screw at a time,

1136
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:42,755
and really make sure
you feel it.

1137
01:02:42,755 --> 01:02:43,899
Or two:

1138
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,692
In exchange
for a quick death,

1139
01:02:45,692 --> 01:02:48,134
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

1140
01:02:48,134 --> 01:02:50,136
access to the mines

1141
01:02:50,136 --> 01:02:53,843
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

1142
01:02:53,843 --> 01:02:55,372
Who exactly are you guys?

1143
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,077
[muffled grunting, straining]

1144
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,144
Ah!

1145
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:01,213
The Cybertronian High Guard!

1146
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:03,116
[growls] I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

1147
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:06,251
- Prestigious defenders of Iacon.
- Prestigious?

1148
01:03:06,251 --> 01:03:08,990
He's right. I read all
about you in the archives.

1149
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:12,422
You were the most legendary
warriors in all of Cybertron.

1150
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:14,226
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

1151
01:03:14,226 --> 01:03:17,130
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

1152
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,759
Raise your hand if "wave" is in
your name. There's a lot of "waves."

1153
01:03:19,759 --> 01:03:21,332
Silence!

1154
01:03:21,332 --> 01:03:23,466
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

1155
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,467
Whoo!

1156
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,304
We were once the High Guard.

1157
01:03:26,304 --> 01:03:30,044
We witnessed Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

1158
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:32,948
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

1159
01:03:32,948 --> 01:03:35,676
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

1160
01:03:35,676 --> 01:03:37,414
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1161
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:41,121
Okay, okay. We're good.
Everyone relax.

1162
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:43,618
I'm just saying we're allies.

1163
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:45,686
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

1164
01:03:45,686 --> 01:03:49,756
and now with your help, we can
unify Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.

1165
01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:53,903
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

1166
01:03:53,903 --> 01:03:58,765
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

1167
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:00,734
[all cheering]

1168
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:03,638
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

1169
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:05,574
Yeah. Just a little.

1170
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:06,949
Hey!

1171
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:08,511
What are you doing?

1172
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,747
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

1173
01:04:13,747 --> 01:04:17,685
I'm not cowering in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

1174
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:19,885
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

1175
01:04:19,885 --> 01:04:22,624
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

1176
01:04:22,624 --> 01:04:24,890
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

1177
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,892
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

1178
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:28,399
Today!

1179
01:04:28,399 --> 01:04:32,007
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

1180
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:36,044
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

1181
01:04:36,044 --> 01:04:37,705
[chuckles] Is that right?

1182
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,873
Well, how can you say so

1183
01:04:40,873 --> 01:04:42,842
with my head in your teeth?

1184
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:44,514

Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!

You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1194
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:14,984
[voice crackling] Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1195
01:05:14,984 --> 01:05:17,778
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

Please! I beg you!

Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

1201
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:44,805
Bear witness!

1202
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:47,610
This is the last time
I show mercy!

1203
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,283
Decide right now:

1204
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:54,914
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before your pathetic leader,

1205
01:05:54,914 --> 01:05:58,258
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

1206
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:01,822
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

1207
01:06:01,822 --> 01:06:04,297
[cheers, chanting]

[Orion coughs, clears throat]

1225
01:08:00,074 --> 01:08:02,712
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

1226
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:05,253
[groans]
Where are the others?

1227
01:08:05,253 --> 01:08:09,048
Sentinel's troops took as many
prisoners as they could carry.

1228
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:10,852
They got D-16 and B.

1229
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:12,722
Oh, no.

1230
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,296
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

1231
01:08:16,156 --> 01:08:17,298
[sighs]

1232
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:19,025
Our proof.

1233
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:20,466
It's gone.

1234
01:08:21,337 --> 01:08:23,601
So, what do we do now?

1235
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,207
D was right.

1236
01:08:25,207 --> 01:08:27,803
- About what?
- Everything.

1237
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:31,444
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1238
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,182
It's all my fault.

1239
01:08:33,182 --> 01:08:35,107
I should have
stayed on protocol.

1240
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:37,615
[sighs]

1241
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,787
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

1242
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,854
Are you listening?

1243
01:08:48,463 --> 01:08:49,858
I'm better than you.

1244
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,498
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

1245
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,127
I'm better than you
in every way,

1246
01:08:55,127 --> 01:08:57,635
except you have hope.

1247
01:08:57,635 --> 01:09:01,342
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1248
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:05,313
You snuck up to the surface
to find the Matrix of Leadership.

1249
01:09:05,313 --> 01:09:07,139
[chuckles] Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

1250
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:08,910
My point is,

1251
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:13,178
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1252
01:09:13,178 --> 01:09:16,291
This blind optimism
that you have

1253
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:20,658
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1254
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:23,529
that are also extremely stupid.

1255
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:26,092
First time
giving a pep talk?

1256
01:09:26,092 --> 01:09:27,863
You're inspiring.

1257
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:31,240
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

1258
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:35,343
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

1259
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:39,380
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1260
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:41,613
Listen to me.

1261
01:09:42,517 --> 01:09:43,714
We can do this.

1262
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:49,390
Those Energon trains will
be heading back to Iacon.

1263
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:52,118
If we intercepted one--

1264
01:09:52,118 --> 01:09:55,330
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

1265
01:09:55,330 --> 01:10:00,060
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1266
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:04,405
I was afraid
you'd say that.

1267
01:10:04,405 --> 01:10:08,002
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

1268
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:11,280
In order to save our captured friends,
we have to act now.

1269
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,579
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

1270
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:17,011
[pained grunt]
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1271
01:10:17,011 --> 01:10:20,256
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

1272
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:24,084
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1273
01:10:24,084 --> 01:10:25,756
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

1274
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:28,792
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

1275
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:33,764
Impossible. We do not have
enough soldiers or a way inside.

1276
01:10:33,764 --> 01:10:36,932
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

1277
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,571
Why should we follow you?

1278
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:41,409
We will follow you.

1279
01:10:41,409 --> 01:10:44,643
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

1280
01:10:44,643 --> 01:10:46,678
What is our first move?

1281
01:10:46,678 --> 01:10:47,844
[quietly] We roll out.

1282
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:50,451
What?

1283
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:51,881
Louder.

1284
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,323
[boldly]
Transform and roll out!

1285
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:07,864
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1286
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:11,472
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

1287
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:13,342
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

1288
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:16,939
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1289
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,480
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

1290
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,811
Oh-ho-ho!

1291
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:23,748
- You captured Starscream!
- It was too easy.

1292
01:11:23,748 --> 01:11:25,948
[high-pitch] I'm going to
rip you apart piece by piece

1293
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,455
so that your death
is painful! [laughs]

1294
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:28,753
You'll regret
the day you were--

1295
01:11:28,753 --> 01:11:30,722
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

1296
01:11:30,722 --> 01:11:33,758
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

1297
01:11:33,758 --> 01:11:37,663
Atop the leaderboard in your
sector and secretly a traitor.

1298
01:11:37,663 --> 01:11:39,764
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

1299
01:11:39,764 --> 01:11:42,503
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

1300
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:46,199
You've been working with the
Quintessons to sabotage my expeditions.

1301
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,641
You're the reason why I haven't
found the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1302
01:11:48,641 --> 01:11:49,939
None of that is true!

1303
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,545
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

1304
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:54,482
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

1305
01:11:54,482 --> 01:11:58,310
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1306
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:59,355
[thud reverberates]

1307
01:12:07,057 --> 01:12:09,464
Well, well.
What's this about?

1308
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:13,028
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

1309
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,997
Feeling confident, are we?

1310
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,231
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

1311
01:12:18,231 --> 01:12:19,331
Please.

1312
01:12:20,543 --> 01:12:23,577
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1313
01:12:23,577 --> 01:12:25,744
You took it all.

1314
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,483
I sure did.

1315
01:12:28,483 --> 01:12:29,880
[grunts]

1316
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,552
[gasps]
[groans]

1317
01:12:31,552 --> 01:12:33,950
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1318
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:38,427
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was the coolest Prime!

1319
01:12:38,427 --> 01:12:41,320
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

1320
01:12:42,565 --> 01:12:44,796
That's why,
after I killed him,

1321
01:12:45,832 --> 01:12:48,063
I took his cog for myself.

1322
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,571
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

1323
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:52,870
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1324
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:55,741
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1325
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:56,808
Here.

1326
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,274
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

1327
01:13:01,274 --> 01:13:02,814
[electrical crackling]

1328
01:13:02,814 --> 01:13:06,048
[pained shouts, groans]

1329
01:13:20,031 --> 01:13:22,570
Okay. [sighs]

1330
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:25,133
[stammers] I can do this.

1331
01:13:38,786 --> 01:13:42,282
[miner] You can't be serious. We
just worked 22 shifts without a break!

1332
01:13:42,282 --> 01:13:44,020
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

1333
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,319
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

1334
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:49,762
So get back in the mines before
I make you get back in the--

1335
01:13:49,762 --> 01:13:50,928
[aggressive thud]

1336
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:55,427
[triumphant electronic jingle]

1337
01:13:55,427 --> 01:13:57,429
- Who was that?
- Did you see who that was?

1338
01:13:57,429 --> 01:13:58,639
[miner] That can't be him.

1339
01:13:58,639 --> 01:13:59,739
[Jazz] Is that...

1340
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:02,434
It can't be.

1341
01:14:02,434 --> 01:14:04,975
- Orion?
- Jazz.

1342
01:14:04,975 --> 01:14:06,405
Is it really you?

1343
01:14:06,405 --> 01:14:08,814
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1344
01:14:08,814 --> 01:14:10,409
"Little"?

1345
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:12,246
There's nothing
"little" about you.

1346
01:14:12,246 --> 01:14:14,116
Uh, how is this possible?

1347
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,954
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1348
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:19,924
Sentinel is a liar.

1349
01:14:19,924 --> 01:14:21,959
- What?
- Huh?

1350
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:24,126
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

1351
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,635
I was never
the most focused miner.

1352
01:14:27,635 --> 01:14:30,099
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1353
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,002
[mechanical whirring]

1354
01:14:37,944 --> 01:14:42,177
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1355
01:14:43,653 --> 01:14:45,312
My friends,

1356
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:49,415
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

1357
01:14:50,451 --> 01:14:53,628
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

1358
01:14:53,628 --> 01:14:57,027
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1359
01:14:57,027 --> 01:14:59,194
He stole our freedom.

1360
01:15:03,002 --> 01:15:08,841
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1361
01:15:08,841 --> 01:15:12,977
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1362
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:17,509
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

1363
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:20,182
Right now.

1364
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,559
- How are we supposed to do that?
- We can't fight. We don't have cogs.

1365
01:15:25,893 --> 01:15:29,829
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1366
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:32,799
but the spark
that resides in their core.

1367
01:15:32,799 --> 01:15:36,968
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1368
01:15:36,968 --> 01:15:40,840
And that spark,
Sentinel can never take from us.

1369
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,238
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1370
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:47,011
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

1371
01:15:47,011 --> 01:15:49,079
We are not alone in this.

1372
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:51,884
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

1373
01:15:51,884 --> 01:15:53,545
we will have to
fight for it.

1374
01:15:53,545 --> 01:15:56,922
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

1375
01:15:56,922 --> 01:15:58,924
[supportive chatter]
...for ourselves.

1376
01:15:58,924 --> 01:16:00,354
[scattered cheers]

1377
01:16:01,258 --> 01:16:03,192
Stand up for this injustice.

1378
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:05,392
[cheers growing]

1379
01:16:05,392 --> 01:16:09,099
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

1380
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:11,772
Follow me.

1381
01:16:11,772 --> 01:16:14,676
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1382
01:16:14,676 --> 01:16:18,207
[cheering, chanting]
Together as one.

1383
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:22,717
[all chanting]
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

1384
01:16:22,717 --> 01:16:25,214
[Orion] <i>Elita, it's time.</i>

1385
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:26,545
You got it.

1386
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:28,822
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

1387
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:38,524
[groaning, gasping]

1388
01:16:38,524 --> 01:16:41,296
[determined groans]

1389
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:43,463
Not a good idea.

1390
01:16:45,632 --> 01:16:47,808
[whispering] D, stay down.
[groans]

1391
01:16:59,613 --> 01:17:01,448
Well, that's a shame.
[mechanical whirs]

1392
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:03,417
You really were
a great miner.

1393
01:17:07,929 --> 01:17:10,358
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

1394
01:17:11,163 --> 01:17:12,030
[grunts]

1395
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,172
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

1396
01:17:23,109 --> 01:17:24,812
High Guard, eject.

1397
01:17:24,812 --> 01:17:26,781
Come on! Move out!

1398
01:17:27,344 --> 01:17:28,508
[laserfire pulsing]

1399
01:17:41,655 --> 01:17:43,798
[alarm blaring] There's
too many. We have to abort!

1400
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:47,329
[yelps]
[alarm intensifying]

1401
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:50,497
We're not gonna make it.

1402
01:17:50,497 --> 01:17:52,532
[all yelling]

1403
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:54,336
Whoo-hoo!

1404
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,942
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1405
01:17:55,942 --> 01:17:57,702
Let's break some protocol!

1406
01:17:57,702 --> 01:17:59,473
[Elita] That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

1407
01:18:05,118 --> 01:18:06,711
[growling]

1408
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:09,021
[grunting]

1409
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:11,386
Whoa! That's intense.

1410
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:16,094
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

1411
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:18,998
That's right, you do.

1412
01:18:18,998 --> 01:18:21,737
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

1413
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:36,378
[alarmed chatter]
What's going on?

1414
01:18:39,185 --> 01:18:40,547

[panting heavily]

1579
01:31:06,965 --> 01:31:10,164
We were given the power
to change our world

1580
01:31:10,164 --> 01:31:12,672
and you chose to destroy it.

1581
01:31:12,672 --> 01:31:14,135
Just like Sentinel.

1582
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:18,007
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

1583
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:22,473
And you betrayed me.

1584
01:31:33,552 --> 01:31:34,628
Go.

1585
01:31:35,488 --> 01:31:38,159
Take the High Guard
and leave.

1586
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:42,999
You are banished from Iacon.

1587
01:31:47,874 --> 01:31:50,204
It didn't have to end
this way.

1588
01:31:52,538 --> 01:31:56,012
This isn't over, Prime.

1589
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,923
High Guard, follow me!

[Optimus Prime] <i>The line
between friend and enemy</i>

1591
01:32:22,071 --> 01:32:25,239

as I once believed.</i>

1592
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:29,177
<i>Once it's crossed,
there's no going back.</i>

1593
01:32:29,177 --> 01:32:33,214
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i>

1594
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,084
[Orion] Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

1595
01:32:35,084 --> 01:32:37,251
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

1596
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:39,088
[both] The greatest Prime

[both laugh]

1598
01:32:40,826 --> 01:32:43,587
- I'm D-16.
- Orion Pax.

1599
01:32:43,587 --> 01:32:45,996
You ever mine Energon before?

1600
01:32:45,996 --> 01:32:47,393
No. You?

1601
01:32:47,393 --> 01:32:49,604
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1602
01:32:50,299 --> 01:32:51,705
Well, I'll tell you what.

1603
01:32:51,705 --> 01:32:54,235
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

1604
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,434
All right.

1605
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:58,272
Thanks, Pax.

1606
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,617
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

1607
01:33:13,617 --> 01:33:15,729
And a new leader.

1608
01:33:15,729 --> 01:33:17,731
Yes, about that.

1609
01:33:17,731 --> 01:33:22,736
I could use some help from a bot
who is better than me in every way.

1610
01:33:22,736 --> 01:33:24,705
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1611
01:33:24,705 --> 01:33:27,103
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1612
01:33:27,103 --> 01:33:30,106
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

1613
01:33:30,106 --> 01:33:32,878
How's Major Elita sound?

1614
01:33:32,878 --> 01:33:35,441
How about Commander?

1615
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:37,410
[chuckles] Even better.

1616
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:41,381
And I'm sorry, B, but I cannot
let you go back to sublevel 50.

1617
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:43,218
I may be a Prime now,

1618
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:44,956
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

1619
01:33:44,956 --> 01:33:48,454
Are you serious? This is
the greatest day of my life.

1620
01:33:48,454 --> 01:33:50,654
I get to work
for the government.

1621
01:33:50,654 --> 01:33:54,295
[shimmering tone]
Okay. So that's new.

1622
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,967
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

Hey, guys! Great news,

And I have a cog
and I can transform!

1638

It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.
