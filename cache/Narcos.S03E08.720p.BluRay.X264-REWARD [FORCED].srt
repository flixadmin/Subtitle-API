1
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,377
Please...

2
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,970
Please...

3
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,970
- Careful.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,187
Were you shot?

5
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,564
No.

6
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,733
Get him out.

7
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,569
- You're scaring him.
- Out!

8
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,078
What happened last night...

9
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,746
someone pays.

10
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,708
We took care of Calderón,

11
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,087
but those fucking gringos
still knock on my door!

12
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,132
Where the fuck were the guards?

13
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,219
Where the fuck were our men?

14
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,891
How the fuck did they know where you were,
Dad? How the fuck...?

15
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,689
We have a rat.

16
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,607
An informant.

17
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,277
They found my ledger.

18
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,614
Hey, what about Enrique?

19
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,452
He was manning the checkpoint
when the cops came in.

20
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,001
Let's get inside.
Going once, going twice...

21
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:40,257
No. You can't go out that way.
Please, no, sweetie.

22
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,971
Honey, let's go inside. Inside.

23
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,319
- Hello?
<i>- Salcedo.</i>

24
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,530
No one's seen you since the raid.
Where the fuck are you?

25
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,740
<i>David.</i>

26
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,373
I'm having some trouble
with my wife lately...

27
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,292
but I'm monitoring my radio.

28
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,962
- Have you talked to Enrique?
<i>- Why?</i>

29
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,510
We've been trying to reach him.
My father wants to talk to him.

30
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,596
Your dad wants to talk to Enrique?

31
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,641
Do you have any problem with that?

32
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,228
I'll find him.

33
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,021
<i>Good. Bring him in.</i>

34
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,273
<i>And Salcedo, you come, too.</i>

35
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,278
Did you find her?

36
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,281
Sure you don't want something?

37
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,033
- The <i>picada</i> here is the shit.
- You have what I asked for or not?

38
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,707
Pretty girl.

39
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,834
Long way from home.

40
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,104
I'm imagining the headline...

41
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,941
"American woman held hostage
in Colombian jungle."

42
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,776
Fuck!

43
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,115
- Thanks for the info.
- Wait.

44
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,953
I'm going to help you rescue
the Barbie doll.

45
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:26,251
To do this job, we need to work
with some old friends of ours.

46
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,213
They can help us.

47
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,677
They know the terrain like the back
of their hand. How to get in and out.

48
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,816
What's it going to cost?

49
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,361
Cheap.

50
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,906
You just have to make me a promise, Peña.

51
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,452
When my name pops up
on the DEA to-do list...

52
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,747
you pick up the phone and call me.

53
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,834
So I can be cautious and protect myself.

54
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,462
I see now.

55
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,433
To us, Peña.

56
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,105
Enrique!

57
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:30,732
Boss.

58
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,609
Open the door. Quick.

59
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,282
- Boss...
- What are you doing? Get in.

60
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,704
- What happened?
- David has been calling.

61
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,707
What for?
He's never called before.

62
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:51,336
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Last night was a big fuck up.

63
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,922
You're in danger.
Pack a few things and let's go.

64
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,428
Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.

65
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,723
It doesn't matter, Enrique.
The DEA passed right in front of you.

66
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,851
I should just run, bro.

67
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,228
Like Córdova?

68
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,063
What? It doesn't matter!

69
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,483
Stay, run. It's the same fucking thing!

70
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,485
No matter what I do,
I'm a fucking dead man.

71
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,654
Nobody is going to die, you hear me?

72
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,407
Nobody is going to die.

73
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,952
But right now,
let's just get you to tomorrow, Enrique.

74
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,578
Why the fuck do I have to hide here?
I didn't do anything.

75
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,914
I know you didn't do anything.

76
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,417
This is David being an idiot.

77
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,504
But... trust me.

78
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,131
Have some patience.
I'll handle it.

79
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,469
Jorge...

80
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,182
last week, when you told me
to not say anything...

81
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,352
about the DEA and their safe house...

82
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,770
Hey, hey, hey...

83
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,064
That has nothing to do with anything.

84
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,732
Why are you bringing this up?

85
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,651
Stay focused.

86
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,110
Sit down.

87
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,529
Sit down.

88
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,869
It's very important you do what I say.

89
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,038
Don't leave this room.

90
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,624
And don't call anyone.

91
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,085
Not your mother, not your brother,
not your girlfriend.

92
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,045
No one. Understood?

93
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,550
Hey, look at me.

94
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,261
We'll get you through this.

95
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,972
I promise.

96
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,439
Thank you, Jorge.

97
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,317
Seriously.

98
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,785
- Jorge.
- Fercho, how's it going?

99
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,499
Don Miguel.

100
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,002
Where the fuck is Enrique, Jorge?

101
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,966
I left him messages at his house,
at the tap room,

102
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,093
but trust me, I'll find him.

103
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,054
Regardless of where he is,
you know him as well as me.

104
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,764
He's a man we can trust.

105
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,183
The thing is, Jorge...

106
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,644
I don't know Enrique.

107
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,397
Because I didn't hire him, you did.

108
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,610
No, Córdova hired him.
But that doesn't matter.

109
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,321
I don't like to make judgements
before I know all the facts,

110
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,156
and we don't know them, David.

111
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,075
I find that funny, you know?

112
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,788
Because lately,
you're missing too many facts.

113
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,374
More specifically,
about the fucking DEA, Jorge.

114
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,630
When the DEA burst into the building,
I was six feet away from your dad.

115
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:28,053
Don Miguel, I've been investigating
and it looks like Enrique did radio in.

116
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,806
I think the DEA is using a signal
to interfere with our radios.

117
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,933
Dad...

118
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,354
Dad, please.

119
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,439
It could be.

120
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,191
It could be.

121
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,777
But you know what, Jorge?

122
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,281
That doesn't explain how the DEA
knew where I was. Do you understand?

123
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,618
Yes, sir.

124
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,957
Someone sang and I want to know
who the fuck it was.

125
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,712
Find Enrique.
Let's have him speak for himself.

126
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,006
We fucking fix this once and for all.

127
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,239
Hi, fellas.

128
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,075
Hello.

129
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,376
Great machine.

130
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,714
You people know how to build
a fucking assault chopper.

131
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,838
Nice look, Berna.

132
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,007
You're coming on the raid?

133
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,051
Thanks, but no.

134
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,721
I'm coming to make sure all goes well
with our friends.

135
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,389
Look at me.

136
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,933
Do you think an important man like me...

137
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,730
is going to risk his life
for some gringo piece of ass?

138
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,613
You don't know how to take a joke.

139
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,423
I'll go in.

140
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,634
Sure.

141
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,969
But they go with you.

142
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,991
What about you, brother?

143
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,911
Are you trying to fuck us all or what?

144
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,162
Calm down, Gilberto.

145
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,040
<i>Franklin Jurado's in U.S. custody.</i>

146
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,542
<i>You don't want to surrender,</i>

147
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,920
and you let them get
the goddamn ledger!

148
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,296
<i>Since you were a kid,</i>

149
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,049
I had to tell you what to do
and what not to...

150
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,217
<i>You know what, Gilberto?</i>

151
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,303
Since you were a kid,
you had a big mouth.

152
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,722
Why don't you just shut up?

153
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,101
He's fucking lost his mind.

154
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,895
All these acts of violence
in the North Valley

155
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,273
are straining our friends' patience.

156
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,568
Any surrender deal
is hanging by a thread.

157
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,444
Uncle Miguel has to see that.

158
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,947
I told him, no violence.

159
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,076
Is this all my fault?

160
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,496
Haven't I always done
what was best for him?

161
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,459
Franklin Jurado.

162
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,173
I need to reach out to Chepe.
Or Pacho.

163
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,258
But how the fuck...?

164
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,011
There's no one else I can trust with this.

165
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,180
Let's see...

166
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,184
Dad.

167
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,029
Nicolás...

168
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,701
I need you to get involved
in the Jurado situation.

169
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,006
Hello.

170
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,550
Any news?

171
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,053
He has a girlfriend
on the other side of town.

172
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:24,933
Look, David, if Enrique was a rat,
he wouldn't be around anymore.

173
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,769
Thanks.

174
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,562
I think I'll wait here.

175
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,608
You know he's a mama's boy.
That fucker will be back.

176
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,153
So now what?

177
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,615
Now you go to Toro Negro.

178
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,244
Navegante's waiting for you.
He'll give you an assignment from my father.

179
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,996
Why didn't he call me?

180
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,084
I'm going to explain something to you.

181
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,963
Until this is figured out,
you only talk to me.

182
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,673
Understood?

183
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,883
Yes, sir.

184
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:05,181
Better get moving.
Navegante hates to wait.

185
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,956
<i>Coming up to coordinates Kirk 5-7,
manoeuvre incoming.</i>

186
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,770
Gentlemen.
So good to see you again.

187
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,273
Third generation night vision goggles.

188
00:21:55,398 --> 00:22:00,820
The same ones the Americans used
in Operation Desert Shield.

189
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:07,452
Peña, can we keep them afterwards
as a contribution to the cause?

190
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,435
This one has AFCS.

191
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,146
And the 701 engine.

192
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,361
- Not like last time.
- Last time?

193
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,571
The CIA.

194
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,532
They had us out here hunting commies
on Christmas day.

195
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,369
- That's real dedication.
- It is God's work.

196
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,455
Merry Christmas.

197
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,600
<i>My dad trusts him, but...
did you see him?</i>

198
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,977
<i>That son of a bitch looks nervous, right?</i>

199
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:19,440
<i>Never stopped adjusting the mirror,
staring.</i>

200
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,193
<i>I kind of love how much
this motherfucker hates me.</i>

201
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,115
<i>Our man in Bogotáconfirmed
there must be an informant.</i>

202
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,369
<i>Salcedo has to be the one
the gringos are calling "Natalia".</i>

203
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,372
<i>I'm going to love killing
that motherfucker.</i>

204
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:38,000
<i>You know who else I am going to kill?
His arrogant wife.</i>

205
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,504
<i>I'm going to leave
those poor girls orphans.</i>

206
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,714
<i>Poor things.
You can adopt them.</i>

207
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,300
<i>You son of a bitch...</i>

208
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,691
Answer.

209
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,697
<i>This is Paola, leave a message.</i>

210
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,031
Hello, love, it's me.

211
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:12,326
Paola, listen,
I need you to call me back.

212
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,036
It's very important.

213
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,020
3 NEW MESSAGES

214
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,022
DELETE?

215
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,899
CONFIRM

216
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,400
0 NEW MESSAGES

217
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,454
Take me to where you stashed him,
Jorge Salcedo.

218
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,334
Stashed who?

219
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,295
Pallomari.

220
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,384
Are we taking him someplace?

221
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,806
I see.

222
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,110
What do you mean,
you're going to a meeting?

223
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,655
I have a business to run, Guillermo.

224
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,532
A meeting with who?

225
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,660
With Fredy.
We're meeting a new client.

226
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,203
Fredy?

227
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,123
Patricia, the police
almost caught Miguel yesterday.

228
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,250
For fuck's sake.

229
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,752
What's the problem?

230
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,963
You didn't tell them where he was,
did you?

231
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,382
- No.
- No. What are you worried about?

232
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,635
Miguel likes you.
That's what you always tell me.

233
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,512
Yes, but always within limits.

234
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,181
You're worrying too much, Guillermo.

235
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:42,893
They need you. You're the brains
behind the organisation...

236
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,396
None of that matters, Patricia, none...

237
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,691
if they decide not to leave loose ends.

238
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,527
You're giving me a headache.

239
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,531
Listen to me.

240
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,827
My love, we have to get out of here
before it's too late.

241
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,675
It's just a couple hours.

242
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,680
Call me if there's a problem.

243
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,328
What is it, Jorge Salcedo?

244
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:48,209
What do we do if we find
Pallomari's family in the apartment?

245
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,672
Let's hope that we don't.

246
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:59,345
We'll need to be quick.
I have someplace to be.

247
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:07,561
The love of my life is in town
and we have a date.

248
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,732
That's great.

249
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,318
When was the last time you saw her?

250
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,529
Eight years.

251
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,990
Eight long years.

252
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,661
Why so long since last time
you saw her?

253
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:27,540
You know, she was abroad.

254
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,876
- In Japan.
- Japan?

255
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,838
Working?

256
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,967
She fucked a police captain.

257
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,469
Then tried to turn me in.

258
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,640
All these years, I've been hanging around
her parents' house

259
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,934
waiting for her to come back.

260
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:52,523
People say things happen for a reason.
All I know is... she came back.

261
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,650
She came back.

262
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,032
Beautiful day. Right?

263
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,121
How many tents, give or take?

264
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,124
I think around 20.

265
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,128
The FARC arrange themselves
in staggered positions, two circles.

266
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:19,091
Then they always go for lookouts
in high places along the trails.

267
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,427
The sun sets in three hours.

268
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,388
As soon as they hear the chopper,
they're going to hide.

269
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,225
Generators, flashlights, fires...
everything.

270
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,978
Those rats have a lot of practice hiding.

271
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:35,316
Once the lights go,
they'll use guidelines strung into the jungle.

272
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,944
They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.

273
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:44,325
Once we find one of those ropes...

274
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,830
It's a fucking slaughter.

275
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,624
Berna.

276
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,436
Look, I don't want a bloodbath.

277
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,814
Listen to me, Peña.

278
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,650
You want the girl...

279
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,985
There will be a body count.

280
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,904
This is a war zone.

281
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:27,201
But if you want,
we can still call this thing off.

282
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:31,914
I need to get her back.

283
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,919
Just to be clear...

284
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,714
something goes wrong...

285
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,802
you still keep your promise.

286
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:12,454
Hey, you talk to Pallomari,
try to keep him calm.

287
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,708
- Then I come in.
- OK.

288
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,590
Pallomari.

289
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,051
Pallomari!

290
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,919
He's not here, of course.

291
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,007
No luggage.

292
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,471
Must've freaked out
when Miguel almost got caught.

293
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:15,434
You know, Pallomari, he's the smart one.

294
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,563
Guess that's why he's the accountant.

295
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,273
And not a thug.

296
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,445
Hey, Salcedo.

297
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,406
You'll need to find him.

298
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,867
Miguel gave this priority.
Do you understand?

299
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,077
I'll take care of it.

300
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,205
Let me know when you have him.

301
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,794
I need tonight
for the business I told you about.

302
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:44,922
Sure.

303
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,927
Good luck then.

304
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,494
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>
- Salcedo! Busy today.

305
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,620
<i>Listen...</i>

306
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,039
Any chatter from Pallomari?

307
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,209
None I've heard. But we got him.

308
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,422
- Who?
<i>- Enrique.</i>

309
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,175
He called his brother, the idiot.

310
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,261
<i>David's on his way to get him.</i>

311
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,514
That's great news.

312
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,725
Miguel must be pleased.

313
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,672
- David?
<i>- We have him.</i>

314
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,425
Yes?

315
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,261
<i>He showed up at the house?</i>

316
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,556
Meet us at 11th & 614th.

317
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,737
You ever hear anything from Judy?

318
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,572
Not since you sold her out.

319
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,367
Who would've thought it, Javier?
Both of us, bosses.

320
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,912
They give you a nice place in Bogotá?

321
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,041
- It's good.
- You should see my house.

322
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,252
I can take a shit in a different bathroom
every day of the week.

323
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,171
My wife loves it.

324
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,507
Your wife?

325
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,135
I'm a family man.

326
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,306
Bet you still live out of a suitcase.

327
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,893
Guess catching guys like me...

328
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,897
makes it all worth it. Right?

329
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,741
Don't forget the suitcase.

330
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,160
Keep going!

331
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,330
Come on.
Let's go! Assume position!

332
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:39,930
<i>Be advised, team: five minutes to LZ.</i>

333
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:03,347
Let's see how our new toys work.

334
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:09,895
Get ready.

335
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,520
Our guest of honour's arrived.

336
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:57,359
What's going on here?

337
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,075
Jorge, you're going to have
to explain some things.

338
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,842
Alpha in position.

339
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,136
Tell him what you told us.

340
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:29,933
Salcedo knew about the DEA.

341
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,979
You're going to talk to me like a man,
motherfucker.

342
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,689
Salcedo works with the DEA!

343
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,483
He knew the DEA was in Cali.

344
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,405
He knew where they were at
and he told me to watch them.

345
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,491
And he told me not to tell you.

346
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,042
<i>Charlie in position.</i>

347
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,630
Bravo in position.

348
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:04,676
Everyone's in position.
Rotor, force them to the north.

349
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,762
<i>Copy that.
We're going to push them out.</i>

350
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,639
<i>We're circling back.
Arriving in 30 seconds.</i>

351
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,893
Is that true, Jorge?

352
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,728
Tell me.

353
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,730
Tell me.

354
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,191
Are you working with the DEA?

355
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,862
Sir... it's true I've been successful
tracking the DEA.

356
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,656
But saying that I knew
where their safe house is, that's absurd.

357
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:27,824
That's absurd.

358
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,244
<i>Rotor ETA five seconds.
We have visual.</i>

359
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,257
<i>FARC is on the move.
They're going dark.</i>

360
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:50,138
<i>Peña, they have your girlfriend
in the southeast part of camp.</i>

361
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,562
Let's move.

362
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,399
They're about to kill me because of you,
motherfucker!

363
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,485
That fucking son of a bitch is lying!

364
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,655
If you're looking for an infiltrator,
it's him, not me.

365
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,992
Shut up! Know what they're gonna do
to my family if you say that shit?

366
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,452
You son of a bitch!

367
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,704
- Get off him!
- I'll kill you, motherfucker!

368
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,916
- Let it go, motherfucker!
- Sir, that bastard is lying!

369
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,877
What do you want me to say
if that's the truth, motherfucker!

370
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,212
Cut the bullshit!

371
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,011
<i>All right, men,
let's get these fireworks started.</i>

372
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:34,224
<i>And don't be pussies.
This is easy. Get ready.</i>

373
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,893
<i>This shit is on!</i>

374
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,607
I'm tired of this, Dad.

375
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:43,775
Sir, no.

376
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:47,362
David, please. What is this?

377
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,574
- Sir, I have no idea...
- Dad...

378
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,959
What the fuck is that?

379
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,302
What the fuck is that?

380
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,015
Is that you, motherfucker?

381
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,350
- No.
- What the fuck is that?

382
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,359
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know, sir. I've never seen that!

383
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,863
Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.

384
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:35,243
<i>Let's give those fucking guerrillas
a rain of bullets!</i>

385
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,371
<i>They're in the river! Give them lead!</i>

386
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:41,958
Sir... it's a SkyPager.

387
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,585
It's American high-end tech.

388
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,922
- Don Miguel, please.
- Shut up.

389
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,174
What the fuck does it say?

390
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,177
These are messages in English.
He's your rat!

391
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,639
Motherfucker, you're going to have
my family killed dragging me into this!

392
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:57,933
It's not yours?

393
00:41:58,058 --> 00:41:59,142
It's not yours, Enrique?

394
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,978
Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.

395
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,606
I swear on my mum
I've never seen that before, Don Miguel.

396
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,942
Can they track us with this shit?

397
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:08,568
I think so, sir.

398
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,861
Motherfucker!

399
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,490
- No.
- Don't move.

400
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:18,286
- Please! Don Miguel, no!
- Don't move.

401
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,538
No!

402
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,125
Tell the truth, motherfucker!

403
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,378
Salcedo, you motherfucker!

404
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,505
Don Miguel!

405
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,680
Look, Jorge.

406
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,723
Your friend.

407
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,522
Stay where you are.

408
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:46,648
Put the gun down!

409
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,942
Don't move.

410
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,320
One more step and I'll...

411
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,590
The rat is dead.

412
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,266
What's wrong?

413
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,643
Start.

414
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:35,090
Yes, I know my signature.

415
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:38,760
- Hi!
- Hi, Dad!

416
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:39,886
Where's Mum?

417
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,681
Jorge?

418
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,224
She doesn't want to see you.

419
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,226
Paola!

420
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,436
Paola!

421
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:49,938
Paola!

422
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:51,898
Have some respect.
This is my mum's house.

423
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,404
What's going on?

424
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,158
What is it?

425
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:06,871
What's going on?

426
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,624
Breathe.

427
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,547
What happened?

428
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,717
What's going on? Come here.

429
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,988
That phone doesn't work.

430
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:29,699
Try number five.

431
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,209
You're Colombian.

432
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,545
Right?

433
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,423
I'm from Cali.

434
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,253
Yes?

435
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:26,714
<i>It's been taken care of.</i>
