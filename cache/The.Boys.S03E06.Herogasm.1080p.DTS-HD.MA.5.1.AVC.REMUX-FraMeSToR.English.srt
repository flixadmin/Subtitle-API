And all we ask in return

is that you add one more name to the list.

He's the new you.

But why him?

140

Let's just say you're not
the only one wants payback.

Mmm. Mmm.

142

All right.

Countess wasn't strong enough
to fuck him over on her own.

She had help.

Soldier Boy's just getting started.

[Starlight] Do you know
where any of them are?

154

Those shady-ass TNT Twins
got an address in Vermont.

Okay. Does Butcher have it?

156
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,581
No, but he'll get it.

157
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,669
I think Soldier Boy is bulletproof.

158

This ain't for Soldier Boy.

but we have to keep our heads on.

have to take the high road?

00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,313
but I got to turn the other cheek?

163
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,609
Fuck the high road,
fuck Butcher, and fuck Hughie.

164
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,277
Hughie is not himself right now.

165
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,571
Hughie is a grown-ass man
that's made his own choices.

166
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,949
MM! Please!

167
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,035
Soldier Boy is gonna kill more people.
I mean, fuck!

168
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,537
Kimiko is in the hospital.

169
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,205
She lost her powers.

170
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,500
Frenchie isn't answering, Alex is dead,

171
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,793
and Maeve...

172
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,342
We're all we've got.

173
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,304
It's up to us.

174
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,561
[cell phone ringing]

175
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,523
- Shit.

176
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,816
This is Starlight.

177
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,944
Yeah, of course, Ashley.
I'll be right there.

178
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,113
I got to go up
to the Tower for a little bit.

179
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,197
Now?

180
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,116
If I don't go,
they're gonna know something's up.

181
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,826
I'll be one hour.

182
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,288
Do I need to worry about you?

183
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,296
Okay.

184
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,840

Man, there's so much strength in dignity.

What are you doing about Blue Hawk?

193
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,159
Okay, first of all, everyone at Vought

194
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,745
is just heartbroken
over your brother's tragic accident.

195
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,831
It wasn't an accident.
Blue Hawk went apeshit for no reason.

196
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:23,957
Well, he said he felt threatened.

197
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,292
- Threatened?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,212
By what, a room full of Black people
with no superpowers?

199
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,089
Look, I've scheduled him for 12 weeks
of sensitivity training.

200
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,133
Fuck that. I want charges brought.

201
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:37,012
Okay, A-Train, persecuting Blue Hawk
will only make things worse.

202
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,222
This is a time for healing.

203
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,515
I don't give a shit.

204
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,059
I thought we got rid
of the Nazis around here.

205
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,144
[sighs] Vought rejects racism

206
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,188
- and Nazism unequivocally. Okay?
- Hmm.

207
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,940
Now, uh, can we talk about this later?

208
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,192
I have a lot going on today. Thank you.

209
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,820
You know, whatever. I don't need you.

210
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,280
I'll just ping his chip,
go get his ass myself.

211
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:59,201
No. Homelander wants everyone to present
a united front right now.

My brother is paralyzed.

213
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,288
I want some fucking justice.

214
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,707
Seriously? Justice?

215
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,000
- Yeah.
- You want justice?

216
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,293
- Yeah.
- [grunts]

217

Oh, fuck.

218
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:15,050
I have spent over 100 hours
in crisis management meetings

219
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,971
specifically figuring out
how to cover up your bullshit,

220
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,181
including all three
of your straight-up murders,

221
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,392
while you were out
in the club with your crew,

222
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,310
or getting your toe sucked by Popclaw,

223
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,021
who, let's not forget, you also murdered.

224
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,816
Yeah, that's right. I know about that.

225
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,902
You did not give a shit
about all the collateral you caused then.

226
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:37,906
Now, all of a sudden, you care
because it happened to you?

227
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,243
Go fuck yourself.

228
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,912
Yeah, that's right.

229
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,081
I said that.

230
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,002
Out loud.

231
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,764
- [door closes]
- [Deep] <i>Homelander.</i>

232
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,474
- What?
- Couple things. Uh...

233
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,936
Noir, he's, uh, he's gone.

234
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,814
What do you mean, he's gone?

235
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,232
He cut out his tracking chip.

236
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,909
No, he-he-he...

237
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,497
He-He wouldn't. Not Noir. He wouldn't run.

238
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,626
Well...

239
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,377
He wouldn't do that to me.

240
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,504
He wo... He wouldn't run.

241
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,301
Tell him... what we figured out.

242
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,594
Right.

243
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,596
We think Crimson Countess
was just the start.

244
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,724
We think... he's going after
his whole team, including Noir.

245
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,644
The good news is, that means we know
where he's probably headed next.

246
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,188
The twins. TNT.

247
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,482
They're the closest. Vermont.

248
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,278
Okay.

249
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,615
Okay? Really?
Homelander, thank you so much.

250
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,116
Shh, shh, shh.

251
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,582
You go there, and you check it out.

252
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,252
- Yeah.
- And if Soldier Boy does show up,

253
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,129
then, uh...

254
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,924
- You call me.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,345
- Uh... what should I tell the twins?
- I don't give a fuck.

256
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,429
Got it.

257
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,391
Babe, that was amazing.

258
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,184
Yeah, but I didn't need you
to jump in there like that.

259
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,686
- I had the whole thing.
- Hey, hey.

260
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,939
[scoffs] I'm just trying to help. Okay?

261
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,149
We're in this together, right?

262
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,193
Okay. Right.

263
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,237
Right. [chuckles]

264
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:43,949
[Deep sighs]

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,174
Why the long face, tiger?

266
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,512
What if I can't handle him?

267
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,850
I mean, if Noir ran...

268
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,935
Oh, you can handle him.

269
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,438
You're the top of the food chain.

270
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,024
Hey, hey.

271
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,570
When we were kids, alone in the bad room,

272
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,114
I got us through it, right?

273
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,450
Don't I always?

274
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,536
- Always.
- No matter what.

275
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,620
No matter what.

276
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,498
And now, I'll get us through this.

277
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,793
Just as long as you and me stick together.

278
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,713
But... what if Edgar's right?

279
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,383
What if it was a mistake
to take over Vought?

280
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,634
And-And...

281
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,180
And I am just talent,
and they all know I'm a fraud.

282
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,849
What do you care
what a bunch of mud people think?

283
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,142
[stammers]

284
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,226
Come on.

285
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,438
Tell me the real reason.
I want to hear you say it.

286
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,567
- Say it!
- I want them to love me.

287
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,860
Yahtzee!

288
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,781
Only it never seems to work out, does it?

289
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,909
Madelyn, Maeve, Stormfront,

290
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,202
even your own son.

291
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:15,999
So why do you keep running headfirst
into the same brick wall?

292
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:22,964
I don't know.

293
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,717
Pants on fire. You know.

294
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,346
It's because, deep down,
there's a part of you that is still...

295
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,431
human.

296
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,642
- No.
- Mm-hmm. Part of you is.

297
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,019
- Mm-mmm.
- A dirty, shriveled,

298
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,437
anemic little part of you

299
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,482
that still mewls for approval, and love,

300
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,985
and a mommy, and a daddy,
and a boo-hoo-hoo.

301
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,071
Look at me, tiger.

302
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,573
Look at me.

303
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,828
We got to cut that part
of you out like a cancer.

304
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:58,416
And then, well,
then, my boy, you can finally be

305
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,335
who you were always meant to be.

306
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,548
Pure. Clean.

307
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,675
Like marble.

00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,143
It's too late.

311
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,020
Afghanistan is ours.

312
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,648
Wrong. It's free.

313
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,152
And I'll stand by our <i>mujahideen</i> brothers
until the end.

314
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,863
You know what else I'll do?

315
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,031
What?

316
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,576
I'll distract you.

317
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,664

[Soldier Boy] These fucking twins.

You know they couldn't hit
their fucking marks?

321

Fucking unprofessionals is what they are.

Hey, uh, yeah, Butcher's gonna find them.

323
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,763
Why don't you, uh,
why don't you get some sleep?

324
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,433
Mmm, no. I've slept enough.

325
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,601
[sighs]

326
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,102
- [upbeat jingle playing]
- [announcer] <i>Dads.</i>

327
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,896
<i>We know you love taking
your babies everywhere.</i>

328
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,190
<i>No matter where you go,
Starlight Diapers...</i>

329
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,941
Do men really walk around like that?

330
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,652
Yeah. I mean, dads do.

331
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,237
Okay, well... [chuckles]

332
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,781
Bill Cosby is America's dad, and,

333
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,951
tell you one thing, he wouldn't
be caught dead in that pussy gear.

334
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,661
Lot to unpack there. Uh...

335
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,580
The Cos. That's a real man.

336
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,125
[chuckles] Holy shit,
did he make some strong drinks.

337
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,668
[whispers] Holy fucking shit.

338
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,004
But, seriously,
what passes as a man today?

339
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,423
Christ on a cross.

340
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,637
I read that we were ass up in Afghanistan.

341
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,266
The fuck is up with that?
Those were the good guys.

342
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,101
- I mean, when I left, it was, uh...
- Yeah, you know...

343
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:43,688
I mean, goddamn it.
We-We were ten and one, you know?

344
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,982
I lead the 116th onto Omaha Beach.

345
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,360
I was in the fucking Eagle's Nest.

346
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,945
I fought for this country.

347
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,030
[Geiger counter crackling]

348
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,783
I fought for this country.

349
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,786
And what did I get for it?

350
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:00,789
Forgotten.

351
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,962
Left to rot by my own team.

352
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,388
[chuckles]

353
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,224
You know, I wanted
some rug rats of my own,

354
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,477
with Countess. Yeah.

355
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,770
Ain't that a bitch.

356
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,607
You know, couple of little boys.
Raise them up to be men.

357
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,902
Now... [smacks lips]

358
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,405
Now I got nothing.

359
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,076
Hey, um, can I ask you something?

360
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,664
What happened in Midtown?

361
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,544
I don't know.

362
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,628
I mean, your team wasn't there,

363
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,255
so did someone do anything,
or say something...

364
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,841
- I said, I don't know.
- Okay. Okay, yeah.

365
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,850
I blacked out.

366
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,272
About ten minutes.

367
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,443
When I came to, the damage was done.

368
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,032
I didn't mean to hurt those people.

369
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,411
I'm not a bad guy.

370
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,123
But that won't happen again...

371
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,001
right?

372
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,379
Only if they got it coming.

373
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,131
[door opens]

374
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,925
Oi, oi.

375
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,096
You're bleeding.

376
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,181
Not mine.

377
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,058
Got an address.

378
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,018
We're off to Vermont.

379
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,622
[Tommy] Lord of the Seven Seas. Wow.

380
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,540
My man, I'm such an incredible fan.

381
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:11,211
Jesus, Tommy. Slather his balls
in peanut butter, why don't you?

382
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,588
Sorry. My sister's a goddamn bitch.

383
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,507
And, uh, TNT.

384
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,842
Right. I'm a big fan of yours, too.

385
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,386
Cool outfits.

386
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,680
Always felt you got railroaded
with that Starlight thing, by the way.

387
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,182
You know, like, what,

388
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,393
nowadays, you can't even
pay a lady a compliment.

389
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,728
- I know, right?
- You're disgusting.

390
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,856
Anyway, we are just so pleased, you know,

391
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,525
have a big star such as yourself

392
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,819
grace our humble soiree.

393
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,320
You guys having a party?

394
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,155
[dance music playing in distance]

395
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,449
[chattering, laughter]

396
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,245
Wait, is this...

397
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,749
This is Herogasm.

398
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,920
[moaning]

399
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,264
[Starlight sighs, clears throat]

400
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,853
I'm really glad you're here.

401
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,564
I missed you.

402
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,158
- Who's joining us?
- They didn't tell you?

403
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,451
Hey, there.

404
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,539
[chuckles] Hey, lady.

405
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:32,834
[bell rings]

406
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,252
The mayor can say anything she wants,

407
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,920
but Homelander is the one working

408
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,172
- to catch the guy.
- Mmm.

409
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,174
We're about to turn a corner here.

410
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,800
Absolutely, we are.

411
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,427
- Thank you, honey.
- Of course, sweetheart.

412
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,679
- That's reassuring.
- [chuckles]

413
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,141
But there are 19 dead
and dozens wounded.

414
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,851
Congresswoman Neuman,

415
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,729
what do you say to the Americans
who are watching right now

416
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,023
- and feeling scared?
- Yeah, look, it's understandable...

417
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,066
What kind of a-a nasty question is that?

418
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,237
- Oh, no, it's fine. I'm happy to answer...
- Starlight just said, and I keep saying,

419
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,031
this is not a problem. [sighs]

420
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,407
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean...

421
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,784
[Homelander] I don't have time
for your mediocre ambush.

422
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,995
Your job is to report facts,

423
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,456
not attack us when we sit here
and tell you the truth.

424
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,250
The American people, they know.

425
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,419
They know when someone's
telling them facts,

426
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,963
and they know when the media
is lying to them.

427
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,090
There is no problem.

428
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,718
It is safe to go out. Period.

429
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,803
You know what? We're done here.

430
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:30,099
[whispers] Stupid fucking hack.

431
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,312
Up next, Chuck makes empanadas
with Rachael Ray.

432
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,855
We'll be right back.

433
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,232
- [crew] And we're clear.
- [bell rings]

434
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,691
[Ashley] You fucking amateur.

435
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,027
The next report you're gonna be doing
is inside my fucking asshole,

436
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,195
you piece of shit.

437
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,113
Hey, uh, you free for a little catch-up?

438
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,075
You know what?
I'm-I'm a little slammed right now.

439
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,786
Oh, come on. Ten minutes won't kill you.

440
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,004
Hey, so, uh, where's Hughie?

441
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,132
Oh, he's just camping with his dad
for a couple of days.

442
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,636
[laughs] Okay. Okay, good.

443
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,472
Oh, great. I thought he was avoiding me
or something, you know

444
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,432
'cause he was scared
I was gonna pop his head.

445
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,519
[swallows] Hmm?

446
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,187
Come on, Annie.

447
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,982
Put them away.

448
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,944
I'm not gonna hurt you
or Hughie or your families.

449
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,154
Besides, you'd lose.

450
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,116
Then why are you here?

451
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,784
Because I want to help you.

452
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,161
Huh. Help.

453
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,623
From the psycho who blew up Congress.

454
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,126
Look, most of those guys
passed around deepfakes of me

455
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,044
on the House floor blowing bin Laden,

456
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,088
so I'm not exactly overwhelmed
with sympathy.

457
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,717
Annie, you need me.

458
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,385
You're all alone.

459
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,387
I mean, come on, that #HomeLight shit?

460
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,306
That looks like you're in a hostage video.

461
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,640
Blink twice if I'm wrong.

462
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,475
And, what, you got to play nice
with the guy

463
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,477
that throat-fucked you
on your first day of work.

464
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,480
And Maeve, they say Maeve is in rehab,

465
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,191
but you and I both know
she's probably dead.

466
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,569
I'm all you got.

467
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,780
Come on, Annie, you and I were friends.

468
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,449
None of that has changed for me.

469
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,075
Are you ever gonna get to the point?

470
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,705
You have 193 million Instagram followers.

471
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,124
Lend me your influence,
and I'll lend you mine.

472
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,001
I can protect you from Homelander.

473
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,420
You'll finally be team captain for real.

474
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,797
And in return, you help me
goose my numbers.

475
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,925
I can finally get
my education reform bill passed.

476
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,844
We can make things better, Annie.

477
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,848
For my daughter, for a lot of daughters.

478
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,101
Come on, what do you say?

479
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,609
You're right.

480
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,783
This whole place.

481
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,078
I'm so fucking tired...

482
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,333
of listening to people tell me

483
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,211
I need to be shitty in order to win.

484
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:06,923
Fuck you.

485
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,385
And fuck Homelander, and fuck Vought

486
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,721
and this "whatever it takes" crap.

487
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:18,017
You're just gonna end up sitting on top
of the steaming pile of shit

488
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,394
that you built.

489
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,813
I'm done.

490
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,525
I'm fucking done.
I'm not doing it anymore.

491
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,277
You're not gonna be doing anything
if Homelander kills you.

492
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,821
Yeah, maybe.

493
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:33,074
But then I'll know I'm not
working with a fucking nutjob.

494
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,745
So, either pop my head
or get the hell out.

495
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,014
Hey, keep this between us?

496
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,643
It'd be really tough to take out
America's sweetheart,

497
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,562
but not impossible.

498

[Cherie whispers] I'm so sorry.

501
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,103
[Frenchie] No.

502
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,772
[grunting]

503
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:55,823
[panting] No. <i>S'il vous plait,</i> no.

504
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,700
Don't do this.

505
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,911
His body is a masterpiece, no?

506
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,498
[Little Nina inhales]

507
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:08,669
Do you know the story
behind this one? [exhales]

508
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,923
Oh, years ago, my cousin Kolya
went State's witness,

509
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,549
so I send my Serge.

510
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,969
Not even three bullets
could stop my attack dog.

511
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,557
Bar fight on the Basque coast.

512
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,101
He started it.

513
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,980
Oh, my beast. This is my favorite.

514
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:33,027
When Serge was 14 years old,
he dropped a glass.

515
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:38,282
His father told him to kneel in the shards
and not move until he said so.

516
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,370
Little Serge did not shift an inch,

517
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:45,122
not even after his father left
to get drunk

518
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,999
and pass out in the whorehouse.

519
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,962
Oh, please, don't cry for Serge.

520
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,089
He likes to be told what to do.

521
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,551
And he loves to be punished when he's bad.

522
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,845
Makes him hard.

523
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,430
No.

524
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,182
So... Cherie...

525
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,976
- No.
- [Little Nina] ...or Kimiko?

526
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,185
[Frenchie] No, don't do it.

527
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,437
Don't do this! Nina!

528
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,732
You must choose, Serge.
If not, I will kill both of them,

529
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:15,194
and when you've finished
screaming, crying, I will kill you, too.

530
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,697

[Frenchie] Kimiko!

543
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,380
No!

[Frenchie] <i>Mon coeur.</i>

<i>Mon coeur.</i>

551
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,468
She's gone.

552
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,346
[panting] Nina's gone.

553
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,724
It's over.

554
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,310
- [sighs]
- [Frenchie] It's over.

555
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,114
Have you always had that?

556
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,701
I don't know what you're talking about.

557
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,375
[sighs] I grew up in Harlem,

558
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,169
brownstone filled with family.

559
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:40,214
Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins.

560
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,385
One night, there was a ruckus outside.

561
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,638
I looked out the window,
and it was Soldier Boy.

562
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,891
He had pulled up on some kids
that were trying to boost a Benz,

563
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,686
and so I run and wake up my granddad.

564
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,106
"Grandpa, Grandpa.
It's Soldier Boy. Come look."

565
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,734
Soldier Boy takes the Benz,

566
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:03,571
and he hurls it through our house,
like a fucking freight train.

567
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,365
It missed me by about six inches.

568
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,284
And my grandpa...

569
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,911
One minute he was there...

570
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,458
and then he wasn't.

571
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,586
And I woke him up.

572
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,880
I put him in that spot.

573
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,592
That is not your fault.

574
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,928
That's when this whole OCD shit started.
I mean, I don't understand it.

575
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:31,348
All I know is that if I didn't
check the burners three times a night,

576
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,684
Soldier Boy would come back
and kill the rest of us.

577
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,481
And I'm still that kid.

578
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,737
Still getting up in the middle
of the night, checking the burners.

579
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,656
'Cause if I don't,

580
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,659
Soldier Boy's gonna come back,

581
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,622
and he's gonna kill my family.

582
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,504
I got to get this motherfucker
out of my head,

583
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,799
and end this.

584
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,052
Or it'll end me.

585
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,943
- [gasps] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, hell nah.

more than welcome to party.

- [Love Sausage] Yeah.

00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,501
- Fuck me.
- Oh.

00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,087
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

595
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,255
You seem familiar.

596
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,507
You about to get familiar with these hands

You are not Supe.

I'm with her. For the fuck party.

Yeah. Um, mm-hmm.
No, he's very good at cunnilingus.

602

Yeah, his tongue is just... Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

[gasps]

642
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:48,003
[Supe 2] Oh, shit.

643
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,422
Lick it up, you yummy brown bear.

644
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,924
[door closes]

645
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:55,928
I can't.

646
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,389
I need a bathroom.

647
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,641
Right now.

648
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,395
[Hughie] Oh, okay.
So, this-this is an actual orgy.

649
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,688
That's what this is.

650
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,273
[Butcher] Fucking Herogasm.

651
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,317
Still a thing, eh?

652
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,570
It's my thing. I founded it in '52.

653
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,948
Me and this other Supe, Liberty.

654
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,950
Man, was she a firecracker.

655
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,326
[Soldier Boy chuckles]

656
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,204
Frenchie's gonna be heartbroken
he missed this.

657
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,958
There are a lot of people in there.

658
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,505
Well, as long as they stay out
of my way, they'll be fine.

659
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,884
Okay, all right.
Just, uh, give me three minutes.

660
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,094
I'll jump in, I'll jump back out.

661
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,220
I'll tell you exactly
where to find the twins.

662
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,722
Nobody else in your way.

663
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,224
Three minutes.

664
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,689
[Blue Hawk] Soldier Boy?
Nah, he's dead as dog shit.

665
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,815
No, he's not.

666
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,526
I swear, this is really happening.

667
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,113
Please, you need to help me
get people out of here, now.

668
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,157
Starlight, come on.

669
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,534
Do not let them do this to you.

670
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,745
- [sighs]
- This... this fear.

671
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,079
You heard what Homelander said.

672
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:07,124
Lamestream media's making
a fucking mountain out of a molehill.

673
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,418
- Do the research.
- Oh, my God.

674
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,711
This is real.

675
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,005
These attacks are real.

676
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,299
Soldier Boy is real.

677
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,510
Well, I just think you could stand to be
a little better informed.

678
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,930
Homelander's gonna take care of it, okay?

679
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,225
I'm gonna go find a salad to toss.

680
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,061
Excuse me.

681
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,063
[moaning in distance]

682
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,941
[panting]

683
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,027
[Supe 3] You melted my cock ring.

684
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,616
[loud moaning]

685
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,826
[person] Oh, Jesus,
your stretching powers!

686
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,706
[Deep] Oh, my God, your mouth is amazing.

687
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,334
It's like a velvet vacuum
draining my balls.

688
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,753
[Deep] Oh, yeah. You are so fucking hot.

689
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,797
Oh...

690
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,882
God, your legs go on for days.

691
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,386
- [grunts]
- [squishing]

692
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:04,264
Ooh. Ooh. Oh, my God.

693
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,974
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

694
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,684
It's not what it looks like.

695
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:08,977
What are you doing here?

696
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,771
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.
Why would you even...

697
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,689
This octopus was sick.
Why would you ask that?

698
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:13,899
Homelander is gonna love this.

699
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,526
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please. Stop.

700
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,027
Stop, stop, stop. No.

701
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,946
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Look.

702
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,782
That's why I'm here. It's his idea.

703
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:25,953
What's his idea?

704
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,083
I said no cameras in the toilets, Tommy.

705
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,419
- Give it back.
- You're pathetic.

706
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,753
You know what?

707
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,589
Let's see how everyone feels

708
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:41,093
about close-ups of their assholes
without consent!

709
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,386
Fuck you. I'm done.

710
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,972
[distant] I never want to see you again.

711
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,394
Oh. That's so sweet.

712
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,439
Uh, just... I got to give
my asshole a breather.

713
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:54,731
You know?

714
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,942
[Tessa] Then say goodbye
to that Westfield mall

715
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,944
opening next week in Poughkeepsie,

716
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,364
'cause nobody is coming
to see you without me.

717
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:05,242
[Tommy] I fucking hate you.
I hate your mouth.

718
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,077
I hate the way your jaw pops
when you chew.

719
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,873
And I hated every second I spent
holding that clammy hand.

720
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,708
I should've killed you in the womb.

721
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,792
Ah, fuck you!

722
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:14,960
Fuck you!

723
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,545
Fuck you, Tommy!

724
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,714
- [both grunt]
- Sorry.

725
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:21,258
Ah.

726
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,970
Hey, I know you like fucking Supes,
but I'm off the table.

727
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,513
That's not why I'm here, okay?

728
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,474
You're here, too, you know.

729
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:29,766
Whatever, Pornhub.

730
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,852
I don't have time for you right now.

731
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,111
Hey.

732
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,030
You never said you were sorry.

733
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,114
What?

734
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:45,407
For Robin.

735
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,411
You never apologized for Robin.

736
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:52,456
- Jesus, you want to do this right now?
- Yeah, I do.

737
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,333
You just get away
with everything, don't you?

738
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,169
Just running past all the broken people
you leave behind.

739
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,132
All right, you know what?

740
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:03,425
What?

741
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,180
I'm sorry.

742
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,475
Is that what you want to hear?

743
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,811
'Cause I am.

744
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,524
Okay?

745
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:19,942
It's fucked up,

746
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,445
seeing somebody that you love
get hurt like that.

747
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,657
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,495
I'm fucking sorry, Hughie.

749
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,082
[Hughie panting]

750
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,170
- Hughie. Hughie.
- How did you do that?

751
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:42,631
- Stop, stop!
- No, no, no. How the fuck did you do that?

752
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,882
- I'll show you again!
- No.

753
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,801
That is not going to happen.

754
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:47,844
A-Train, get out of here.

755
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,472
Not that you deserve the warning.

756
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,392
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

757
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,897
- [panting]
- Is he here?

758
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,650
He's only here for the twins, all right?

759
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,318
Nobody else has to get hurt.

760
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:06,363
You don't get to decide who to serve up
on a platter here, okay?

761
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,824
These are real people.
We need to clear the house now.

762
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,617
This is about to be a fucking bloodbath.

763
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,370
No, it won't. I made Soldier Boy
promise not to do anything...

764
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,289
Hughie, stop it. Listen to me.

765
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,584
Homelander is coming.

766
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,378
The Deep told me.

767
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,088
When those two start fighting...

768
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,467
Please. Help me.

769
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,645
- You have to go.
- No. I need to stop him.

770
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,022
Annie. No, Annie.

771
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:42,107
Annie!

772
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,276
[Annie gasps]

773
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,279
Oh, my God... You teleported me?

774
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,405
What the fuck?

775
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,825
I saved you, Annie.

776
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,495
Jesus Christ. All I want is to save you.

777
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:58,624
You keep saying that,
but I don't need you to save me.

778
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,960
Right, God forbid I help you,
because I always have to be the weak one,

779
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,420
- the one you have to rescue.
- No.

780
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,963
You always have to be the strong one.

781
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,382
You always have to be
so much stronger than me.

782
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,510
I thought that you didn't care about that.

783
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,055
I mean, on our first date,

784
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,140
you said that it didn't bother you.

785
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,308
I know.

786
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,773
But it does.

787
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,693
Sometimes.

788
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:29,780
A little.

789
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:37,579
I thought the drugs
had fucked you up, Hughie, but...

790
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,458
this is you.

791
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,296
This is all you.

792
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,449
[inhales]

793
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:21,707
Halothane.

794
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,629
What'd you think
you were gonna do with that?

795
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,431
You killed my family.

796
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:39,891
Which one?

797
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,691
[Butcher] Oi.

798
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:51,278
Not him.

799
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,450
Twins are out there.

800
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:03,206
[sighs]

801
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,544
[panting]

802
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,922
So you get Homelander,

that it was the Supervillain
and that they have it handled.

They don't.

I know I sound insane, but...

do to me for telling the truth,

and I should've done it sooner.
