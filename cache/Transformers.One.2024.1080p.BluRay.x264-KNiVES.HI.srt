How could anyone not love it?

473
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,732
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

474
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,151
So we're not getting demoted?

475
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,319
Demoted?

476
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,155
[laughing]

477
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,074
[both laughing nervously]

478
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,450
Demoted.

479
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,701
[laughter continues]

480
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,453
What is happening?

481
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,039
[laughs awkwardly]

482
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,249
The fact of the matter
is we're halfway into the first shift

483
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:24,630
since the race ended and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

484
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,757
You inspired them to work harder!

485
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,842
Sentinel Prime, sir,

486
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:33,138
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

487
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,057
That we bots can do more than just mine--

488
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,394
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

489
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,145
Perhaps you two could tour the mines,

490
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,439
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

491
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,566
[laughs] Wow! Okay, great.

492
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,360
[stammering] That sounds incredible.

493
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,278
-I would love to--
-Sir, it's time.

494
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,905
Ah, yes.

495
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,281
I'm sorry, friends.

496
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,659
We're preparing our next travel
to the surface.

497
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,453
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

498
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,581
Hang tight. Airachnid,
have someone escort these heroes

499
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,458
to my personal service facilities.

500
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,461
Best care in Iacon.

501
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,296
Until next time, legends.

502
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:14,054
Sentinel Prime. [laughs]
The Sentinel Prime!

503
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,848
-You still mad at me?
-I am less mad at you.

504
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,809
I'm telling you, D-- I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

505
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,977
-and we're gonna go--
-[heavy footsteps]

506
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,813
[growling] Miners!

507
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,899
Hi, Darkwing.

508
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,445
-[Orion] Oh, no, no, no.
-[D-16] No! [yells]

509
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,781
Wait, wait! You don't understand!

510
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,534
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

511
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,829
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

512
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,330
I'll make sure of that.

513
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,624
You're making a mistake! Ask Sentinel!

514
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,835
[groans] I hate that guy!

515
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,837
[clattering]

516
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,843
[clattering continues]

517
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,309
You! How did you get down here?

518
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,061
There's no access to this level.

519
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,104
There is nobody down here but me.

520
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,607
[stammers indistinctly]
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

521
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,860
You're others! You're not... me!

522
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,613
You're here, and you're not me!

523
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,823
[laughs]

524
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,825
-Uh, yeah.
-Awesome!

525
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,328
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

526
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,538
I just haven't had a lot of company

527
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,624
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

528
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,919
Fifty? But there are only 40 sublevels.

529
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,420
That's what I thought!

530
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,548
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

531
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,300
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

532
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,345
-How long have you been down here?
-How long have I been here? [laughs]

533
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,598
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

534
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,310
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

535
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,187
'cause I'm so good at what I do.

536
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,232
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

537
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,650
But you can call me B.

538
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,360
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

539
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,071
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

540
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,825
Which is actually pronounced...
[deep voice] "Badassatron."

541
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,076
But if you have any critiques--

542
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,204
Yeah, great. How do we get out of here?

543
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,164
Great question. You don't.

544
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,541
-We don't?
-Nope.

545
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,043
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

546
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,131
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

547
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,175
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

548
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,718
-Which is?
-Oh!

549
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,680
The scrap comes in from the chute there

550
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,223
onto the conveyor belt.

551
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,393
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

552
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,104
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

553
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,148
So you watch garbage burn.

554
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,649
Yes!

555
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,276
It is so great that you're here now.

556
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,194
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

557
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,029
And then tell you everything about me!

558
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,907
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

559
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,242
with one or two new best friends.

560
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,452
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

561
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,912
[splutters] Where are my manners?

562
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,914
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

563
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,916
Hey, guys, we've got company!

564
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,712
This is EP-508,

565
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,507
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

566
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,885
-"Steve"?
-Yeah, he's foreign.

567
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,887
Question: Do they talk back to you?

568
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,181
Um, they're not real.

569
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,808
[laughing] Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

570
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,101
It's just you've been down here a--

571
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,853
-No, I was talking to Steve.
-[beeps and whirs]

572
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,313
-[indistinct robotic speech]
-[laughs]

573
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,480
Classic Steve.

574
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,274
-What is that?
-Look at this guy.

575
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,360
-[mocks electronic speech]
-It's coming from inside.

576
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,821
Oh! Steve! No!

577
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,033
-I am so sorry.
-[dramatically] Steve, no!

578
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,118
-We can fix it, don't worry.
-My Steve!

579
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,831
[voice over transmission]
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

580
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,168
<i>Calling the High Guard
for immediate support. Immediate support!</i>

581
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,420
That's Alpha Trion.

582
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,963
One of the Primes?

583
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,299
<i>Repeat, Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

584
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,135
-It's an SOS message.
<i>-Protect the Matrix!</i>

585
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,430
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

586
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,311
Holy Primus!

587
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,606
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

588
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:57,236
This could be where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

589
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,656
Which means this is where we could find

590
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,741
the Matrix of Leadership.

591
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,536
What are you talking about? It's an old
beacon inside a statue made of garbage.

592
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,121
Or it's a clue of how we could find

593
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,958
-the Matrix of Leadership.
-No. No way. Absolutely not!

594
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,752
Come on. This could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

595
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,713
You already tried to "show everyone"
in the race you tricked me into running,

596
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:20,509
which got us stuck down here
in this waste hole with this, uh...

597
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,470
really cool guy.

598
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,681
-Oh, thank you.
-I'm just saying--

599
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,892
There's a reason no one goes
to the surface. It's dangerous!

600
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,603
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime finds us.

601
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,105
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

602
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,525
Well, we'll just stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

603
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,943
Forever? This is great!

604
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,153
I have new coworkers and roommates.

605
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,947
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

606
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,241
I usually sleep on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

607
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,784
I'll sleep in the corner next to A-A-Tron.

608
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,327
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

609
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,413
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

610
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,249
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be

611
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:57,004
if you personally handed him
the Matrix of Leadership that you found?

612
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,881
Okay, stop.
I know what you're trying to do.

613
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,175
And it's definitely working. I'm in.

614
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,678
-Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
-How do we get to the surface?

615
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,847
Pfft! You kidding me? The surface?

616
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,016
Easy. I know a way.

617
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,768
But it won't be easy.

618
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,730
[D-16] Why is there so much trash? Ah!

619
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,107
[Orion] Warn me next time, please.
My mouth was open.

620
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,609
[B-127] Only 49 sublevels to go!

621
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,779
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

622
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,573
that go all the way to the surface.

623
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,409
[D-16] Yeah, but they don't allow
passengers. The trains are autonomous.

624
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,828
Yeah, that's the "won't be easy" part.

625
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,289
It's perfect.

[Elita] It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

786
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,473
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

787
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,150
[B-127] Knives coming
out of the ceiling. Amazing.

-Okay, yep, we're going in.

Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place

00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,533
I've ever seen in my entire life.

792
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,620
This is ridiculous.

00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,978
I don't believe it.

00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,105
[Orion] The Primes.

[Elita] We're here.

It's Alpha Trion!

803

[Orion] He's powered down.

804

But his spark is still lit.

[electrical crackling]

Whoa, whoa, it's okay! It's okay.

You're safe now.

00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,368
I failed you, old friend.

817
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,331
You deserved so much better than this end.

818
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,959
No, you didn't fail.

819
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,795
We heard your message.
We've come to find the Matrix.

820
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,048
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

821
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,883
Who are you?

822
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,261
We're cogless miners, from Iacon.

823
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,347
Miners? Why?

824
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,807
Well, we've had to drill for Energon

825
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,934
ever since it stopped flowing.

826
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,102
Impossible.

827
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,479
That's why we came. To fix things.

828
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,523
If we find the Matrix of Leadership

829
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,275
and get it to Sentinel Prime, he can fix--

830
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,653
Sentinel is no Prime.

00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,407
-What?
-He's broken. Fantastic.

832

What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

833
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:25,288
Sentinel Prime is our protector.
He's been saving us from the Quintessons--

834
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:29,250
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

835
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,253
I saw the truth with my own eyes.

836
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,381
Come. I will show you.

[heavy footsteps]

838

For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons

839
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,977
had been a brutal conflict.

<i>Their elimination could end the war.</i>

844
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:13,044
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

845
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:17,298
We agreed to meet Sentinel
for his sensitive intel in secret,

846
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,926
here in this cave.

Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

Sentinel Prime has been forcing us to
work in the mines until our gears strip,

and all the while he's been giving
the Energon away to our greatest enemies!

That's the whole thing!

and march him through the mines

00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:09,460
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

But we all know that it doesn't matter
what I want, right, Pax?

00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,363
Oh, yeah. I've been with myself
since I came online,

948
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:40,366
and this slot's always been empty.

949
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,368
What are you saying? Are you saying--

950
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:45,996
No. No way. Nobody could be
that evil, not even Sentinel.

951
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,417
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

952
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:55,631
We were born with transformation cogs,
but he...

953
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,591
He took them from us.

954
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,844
What defines a Transformer... [grunts]

955
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,305
...is not the cog in his chest

956
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:08,352
but the spark that resides in their core.

957
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:13,691
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

958
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:18,195
My fellow Primes had that spark.

959
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:22,241
And I see their strength in you.

960
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:30,290
Take their cogs
and access your full potential.

961
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,459
Prima.

962
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:34,962
Onyx.

963
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,131
Alchemist.

964
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,299
Micronus.

965
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:45,139
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

966
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:49,143
Their uniqueness enhanced by these.

They were one. You are one.

970
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,302
All are one!

971
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,943
Wait. We have... You-- You gave us...

972
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,447
The ability to change your world.

973
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:48,619
How you choose to use that power
is up to you.

974

[heavy thud]

976

They've found us.

977
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,586
Oh, yes! Time to fight back!

978
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,465
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

979
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,971
Embedded in this
are the records I have shown you.

980
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,432
Use it to reveal the truth.

981
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:12,643
We will.

982
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,937
This tunnel leads to the mountains.

983
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,815
Cybertron's future is in your hands.

We got to move!

986
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,695
Wait, we can't just leave you here.

987
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,281
Your fight will come, my friend.

988
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,660
Primus has a purpose for us all.

989

-But this fight...
-[heavy booming thud]

-Now go!
-[thudding continues]

992

I still think we have better odds

1004
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,682
fighting than outrunning them.

1005
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,727
Wait! We have cogs. We can transform now.

1006

-That's right. Everyone ready?
-I was born ready.

I don't know. Just try.

Hey, whoa, buddy. You okay?

00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:28,171
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

1045
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,340
We transform!

1046

Oh, hey! I know.

1047
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,052
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

1048

Looks like the fastest way

-Yeah, but be careful.

you're spilling it everywhere.

You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

-Primus will surely--
-Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

1062
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:25,228
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

1063
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:29,066
Anything to get out of working for you
and that boring council of elders.

1064
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,276
Seriously, I would watch you Primes

1065

spend half the day losing a war

1066

and the other half sitting around
waxing poetic about loyalty and honor.

1067

And a new Prime will rise--

There you go again.

Who are they?

1075

They are to be your undoing.

You heard me, right?

This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

1082

Oh. Hey.

You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

1090
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:51,648
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

1091
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,485
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

1092
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:59,698
We are. With Alpha's proof inside that
device, we will show everyone the truth.

1093
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,784
You honestly believe it'll be that easy?

1094
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,786
Iacon doesn't want to hear the truth.

They worship Sentinel.

There's got to be a better way
to bring him down.

We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

I trusted Sentinel!

With everything.

1100

I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,604
-We're not spies.
-But he is incompetent.

1112
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,942
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

1113
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:21,488
That just means he believes himself,
like any spy would.

1114
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,490
[muffled indistinct speech]

1115
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,034
Uh, why is he gagged?

1116
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,577
He wouldn't stop talking.

1117
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,287
-[muffled speech continues]
-Even when he was unconscious?

1118
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,498
Especially when he was unconscious!

1119
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,749
Enough!

1120
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,126
Two options for you!

1121
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:40,048
One, we slowly dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

1122
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,717
and really make sure you feel it.

1123
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:43,802
Or two:

1124
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,637
In exchange for a quick death,

1125
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,098
you give us intel on the Energon trains,

1126
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,100
access to the mines

1127
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,812
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

1128
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,313
Who exactly are you guys?

1129
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,023
[muffled grunting, straining]

1130
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,108
Ah!

1131
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,152
The Cybertronian High Guard!

1132
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,071
[growls] I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

1133
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,199
-Prestigious defenders of Iacon.
-Prestigious?

1134
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,952
He's right.
I read all about you in the archives.

1135
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,372
You were the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

1136
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,456
Look, look, look!

1137
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,085
That's Starscream,
and you're Shockwave, and Soundwave.

1138
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,713
Raise your hand if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

1139
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,298
Silence!

1140
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,425
The yellow annoying one is correct.

1141
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,342
Whoo!

1142
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,261
We were once the High Guard.

1143
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:30,015
We witnessed Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

1144
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,892
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

1145
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,645
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

1146
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,355
That's great! We're-- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1147
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:41,067
Okay, okay. We're good. Everyone relax.

1148
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,570
I'm just saying we're allies.

1149
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,655
We were on our way back to Iacon,

1150
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:49,701
and now with your help, we can unify
Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.

1151
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:53,872
The idea of a unified Cybertron is a myth.

1152
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:58,710
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

1153
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,712
[all cheering]

1154
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,590
Okay. So, these guys are a little intense.

1155
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,550
Yeah. Just a little.

1156
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,885
Hey!

1157
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,470
What are you doing?

1158
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,725
I tell you what I'm not doing.

1159
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,645
I'm not cowering in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

1160
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,856
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

1161
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,567
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

1162
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,861
I found out that Sentinel is rotten today,

1163
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,863
and I'm gonna make him pay for it.

1164
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,073
Today!

1165
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:31,951
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

1166
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:35,997
No one leaves here unless I say so.

1167
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,665
[chuckles] Is that right?

1168
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,835
Well, how can you say so

1169
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,796
with my head in your teeth?

1170
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,464
-[grunts]
-D!

1172

[both grunting]

1173
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,305
Whoa!

1176
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,686

01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,148
-Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!
-[crowd cheers]

1178
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,693
-[laughs]
-[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

1179
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:12,867
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1180
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,953
[voice crackling] Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1181
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,747
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

1182
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:20,792
[yells angrily]

1183
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,544
[mechanical whirring]

1184
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,469
[panting]

1185
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,475
Please! I beg you!

1186
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,311
Stop! D, he's not the enemy!

1187
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,774
Bear witness!

1188
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,569
This is the last time I show mercy!

1189
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,238
Decide right now:

1190
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,868
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before your pathetic leader,

1191
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,204
or follow me as we march on Iacon

1192
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,791
and I take down Sentinel once and for all!

1193
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,252
[cheers, chanting]

1194

[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

1195

[grunts]

1203

[Airachnid] Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

1204
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,039
[grunts angrily]

1205
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,416

1208
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:37,428

1209
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:42,517
[grunts]

1210
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,992
[Orion coughs, clears throat]

1211
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,662
I feel like someone dropped a cliff on me.

1212
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,206
[groans] Where are the others?

1213
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:09,002
Sentinels troops took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

1214
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,795
They got D-16 and B.

1215
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,672
Oh, no.

1216
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,258
And half of those High-Guard nutjobs.

1217
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,260
[sighs]

1218
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,970
Our proof.

1219
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,430
It's gone.

1220
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,558
So, what do we do now?

1221
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,143
D was right.

1222
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,770
-About what?
-Everything.

1223
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:31,399
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1224
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,067
It's all my fault.

1225
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,069
I should have stayed on protocol.

1226
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:37,572
[sighs]

1227
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,746
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

1228
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:45,830
Are you listening?

1229
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,876
I'm better than you.

1230
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,462
Yeah, okay, I'm hearing you.

1231
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,089
I'm better than you in every way,

1232
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,592
except you have hope.

1233
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:01,304
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1234
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:05,266
You snuck up to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

1235
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,101
[chuckles] Yeah, and how'd that work out?

1236
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,770
My point is,

1237
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:13,149
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1238
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,235
This blind optimism that you have

1239
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,615
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1240
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,493
that are also extremely stupid.

1241
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,037
First time giving a pep talk?

1242
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,830
You're inspiring.

1243
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:31,209
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

1244
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:35,296
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

1245
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,342
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1246
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,594
Listen to me.

1247
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,680
We can do this.

1248
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:49,352
Those Energon trains
will be heading back to Iacon.

1249
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,063
If we intercepted one--

1250
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:55,274
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

1251
01:09:55,358 --> 01:10:00,029
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1252
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,367
I was afraid you'd say that.

1253
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,954
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave. You in the back.

1254
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,249
In order to save our captured friends,
we have to act now.

1255
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,543
How about I blast you back to Iacon?

1256
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,963
[pained grunt]
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1257
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,216
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

1258
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,053
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1259
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,722
at the top of Sentinel's tower.

1260
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,766
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

1261
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:33,730
Impossible. We do not have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

1262
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,899
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

1263
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,526
Why should we follow you?

1264
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,362
We will follow you.

1265
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:44,615
Attention, High Guard. Prepare for battle.

1266
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,617
What is our first move?

1267
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:47,827
[quietly] We roll out.

1268
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:50,413
What?

1269
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,831
Louder.

1270
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,292
[boldly] Transform and roll out!

1271
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,805
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1272
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:11,434
Look at this rowdy bunch! The High Guard!

1273
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,311
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

1274
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:16,898
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1275
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,442
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

1276
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,568
Oh-ho-ho!

1277
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,696
-You captured Starscream!
-It was too easy.

1278
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,907
[high-pitch]
I'm going to rip you apart piece by piece

1279
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,408
-so that your death is painful!
-[laughs]

1280
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:28,701
You'll regret the day you were--

1281
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,661
You sound ridiculous. It's weird.

1282
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,706
Oh, D-16, what a tragic story you'll be.

1283
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,627
Atop the leaderboard in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

1284
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,712
I'm not a traitor. You're the traitor.

1285
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:42,465
Nuh-uh. You, all of you, are traitors.

1286
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:46,177
You've been working with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

1287
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,596
You're the reason why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1288
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,806
None of that is true!

1289
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:54,435
Oh, trust me, it'll be very true when I'm
executing you in front of all of Iacon.

1290
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:58,272
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1291
01:11:58,356 --> 01:11:59,315
[thud reverberates]

1292
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,408
Well, well. What's this about?

1293
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,995
I'm not kneeling in front of you.

1294
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,956
Feeling confident, are we?

1295
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,209
You don't scare me. You want to know why?

1296
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,293
Please.

1297
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,548
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1298
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,716
You took it all.

1299
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,427
I sure did.

1300
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,846
[grunts]

1301
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,514
-[gasps]
-[groans]

1302
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,933
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1303
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,396
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was the coolest Prime!

1304
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,274
The biggest! The baddest! The toughest!

1305
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:44,777
That's why, after I killed him,

1306
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,030
I took his cog for myself.

1307
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,533
He was greater than you'll ever be!

1308
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,827
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1309
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,705
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1310
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:56,789
Here.

1311
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,252
Let's make sure it doesn't come off.

1312
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:02,753
[electrical crackling]

1313
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:06,007
[pained shouts, groans]

1314
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,523
Okay. [sighs]

1315
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:25,109
[stammers] I can do this.

1316
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:42,251
[miner] You can't be serious.
We just worked 22 shifts without a break!

1317
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:43,961
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

1318
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,297
Sentinel Prime wants more Energon.

1319
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,717
So get back in the mines
before I make you get back in the--

1320
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,885
[aggressive thud]

1321
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,389
[triumphant electronic jingle]

1322
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,391
-Who was that?
-Did you see who that was?

1323
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,601
[miner] That can't be him.

1324
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,685
[Jazz] Is that...

1325
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,396
It can't be.

1326
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,941
-Orion?
-Jazz.

1327
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,317
Is it really you?

1328
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,778
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1329
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,363
"Little"?

1330
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,198
There's nothing "little" about you.

1331
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,075
Uh, how is this possible?

1332
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,911
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1333
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,872
Sentinel is a liar.

1334
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,916
-What?
-Huh?

1335
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,085
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

1336
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,588
I was never the most focused miner.

1337
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:30,049
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1338
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,968
[mechanical whirring]

1339
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:42,144
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1340
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,272
My friends,

1341
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:49,402
we were all born with transformation cogs.

1342
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,572
And then Sentinel, he stole them from us.

1343
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:56,993
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1344
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,161
He stole our freedom.

1345
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:08,796
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1346
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:12,925
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1347
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,471
or fight back against Sentinel with me.

1348
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,057
Right now.

1349
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,519
-How are we supposed to do that?
-We can't fight. We don't have cogs.

1350
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:29,775
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1351
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,737
but the spark that resides in their core.

1352
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,907
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1353
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:40,786
And that spark,
Sentinel can never take from us.

1354
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,205
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1355
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:46,959
And we have one. Elita is bringing troops.

1356
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,045
We are not alone in this.

1357
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,839
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

1358
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,507
we will have to fight for it.

1359
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:56,886
Now is the time for us to stand up...

1360
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,888
-[supportive chatter]
-...for ourselves.

1361

[scattered cheers]

1362
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,142
Stand up for this injustice.

1363
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,352
[cheers growing]

1364
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:09,065
I promise you this fight will be worth it.

1365
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,734
Follow me.

1366
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,612
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

I'm talking about, Pax!

You can't win, miner. I see everything!

That's right, you do.

about to crash into.

What has he done to you?

This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

[Sentinel] You pathetic little twits.

1420
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:48,284
Did you really think that you could
knock down everything I've built?

1421
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,828
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.

1422
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,121
[Sentinel] What truth?

1423
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:54,832
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1424

I promise to watch yours.

1587
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:55,403
All right.

1588
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:58,239
Thanks, Pax.

1589
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,588
A new beginning for Cybertron.

1590
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,673
And a new leader.

1591
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,425
Yes, about that.

1592
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:22,680
I could use some help from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

1593
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:24,641
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1594
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:27,060
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1595
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,063
Well, Captain, I do owe you a promotion.

1596
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,816
How's Major Elita sound?

1597
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:35,401
How about Commander?

1598
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:37,153
[chuckles] Even better.

1599
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:41,324
And I'm sorry, B, but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

1600
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,159
I may be a Prime now,

1601
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:44,911
but I'm gonna need you by my side.

1602
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:48,414
Are you serious?
This is the greatest day of my life.

1603
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,625
I get to work for the government.

1604
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:54,254
-[shimmering tone]
-Okay. So that's new.

1605
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:55,922
I'm sorry, what is happening?

Hey, guys! Great news, the Energon's back!

1620
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,948
And I have a cog and I can transform!

1621
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,866
It's a long story. I'll fill you in later.

1622
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:50,453
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up swords.

1623

Watch this. Sword hands!
