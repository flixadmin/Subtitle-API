1
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:22,576
<i>Alert, alert, alert!</i>

2
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:59,736
<i>You three criminals have been caught
in a further act of seditious treason.</i>

3
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:04,656
<i>General Zod, your only feeling
was contempt for our society.</i>

4
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:07,656
<i>Your only desire was to command.</i>

5
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:12,936
<i>Ursa, the only feeling you showed
was for your vicious general.</i>

6
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,976
<i>Your only wish, to rule at his side.</i>

7
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:21,936
<i>Non, you are as without thought
as you are without voice.</i>

8
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:26,776
<i>This council has no hesitation
in proclaiming you...</i>

9
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,976
<i>...all guilty!</i>

10
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,256
<i>Guilty!</i>

11
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,416
<i>You will lie down before me, Jor-El.</i>

12
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,176
<i>Both you and them one day, Jor-El.</i>

13
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,056
<i>Jor-El!</i>

14
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,456
<i>- Here, I'll just get the door for you.
- Yeah, thanks...</i>

15
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:48,736
Sorry, after you.

16
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:55,056
- 'Morning, Phil.
- Excuse me, Kent.

17
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:02,696
<i>Hi, Alice. That's a very pretty blouse
you're wearing today...</i>

18
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,336
Catch you later, Clark.

19
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:09,176
<i>Hello. I don't know. Okay...</i>

20
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:11,256
- 'Morning, Louise.
- I'll check it.

21
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,976
Mr. White, how long should
the pressroom hold the front page?

22
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,456
Give it another 10 minutes. I'll tell him.

23
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:20,416
Thank you.

24
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:23,256
If we don't get anything new
in the next 10 minutes...

25
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:27,536
...go with the wire service copy under
the 40 point banner. Picture in 3 columns.

26
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:32,576
Kent, do a background story for the page
three sidebar on this terrorist group.

27
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,416
Right!

28
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:36,896
Sorry. Terrorists?

29
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,816
Get your heads out of the clouds.
Where have you been?

30
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,096
I was at home.

31
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:42,536
Don't you watch TV?

32
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:46,176
I don't enjoy TV, there's too much violence.
I was just reading Dickens.

33
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:49,536
Mr. Kent, a gang of terrorists
seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

34
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:53,056
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.
You do, don't you, Kent?

35
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,216
- Yes. Has anyone been hurt?
- So far the hostages are unharmed.

36
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:57,176
Hostages?

37
00:09:57,256 --> 00:10:00,496
- Tourists, about 20 of them.
- That's just penny ante stuff.

38
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:03,176
If the French government
doesn't meet their demands...

39
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:05,536
...they've got a Hydrogen bomb
to level Paris.

40
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,736
Mr. White, that's terrible!

41
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:10,656
That's why they call them terrorists, Kent.

42
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:14,456
Get to the morgue. I want to know
everything there is on terrorism...

43
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:16,416
Does Lois know about this yet?

44
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:19,056
- Does she know about it? She's in it!
- She's what?

45
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:22,176
When the story broke,
I bundled her on the first Concorde.

46
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,376
If Paris might go kablooey,
I want my best reporter there.

47
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:26,336
<i>But gee...</i>

48
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,896
No offense. You're good,
but Lois Lane is better.

49
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:31,896
No, I meant,
isn't that a little bit dangerous, sir?

50
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,296
That goes with the territory, Kent.

51
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:38,456
Don't worry, if I know Lois Lane,
she'll not only come back...

52
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:41,496
...with a Pulitzer Prize story,
but a one-on-one interview...

53
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:44,536
...with the hydrogen bomb titled:
"What Makes Me Tick. "

54
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,216
<i>Now don't stand around, Kent...</i>

55
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:18,576
<i>Merci, Merci.</i>

56
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:29,216
How did they get up there?

57
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,776
They were disguised as workers
to do repairs.

58
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:34,256
Can you say why they released
the first hostages?

59
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:38,296
We insist they do this to show good faith.
If not, we refuse to negotiate.

60
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:40,336
Will they release the other hostages?

61
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,976
In return for a guarantee
that we will not launch an attack on them.

62
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:47,736
There will no be attack?
No attempt to overpower the terrorists?

63
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:50,096
- We've made this guarantee.
- You'll honor it?

64
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,176
We have not the choice to refuse.

65
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:54,736
If we believe it's a real
hydrogen bomb they have.

66
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:55,936
Where is the bomb?

67
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,576
It's in a big oil can.

68
00:11:57,656 --> 00:12:00,136
A hydrogen bomb? Are you sure?

69
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:05,896
How can we be sure? Today it's possible
to make a bomb if you have the equipment.

70
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:08,656
<i>- This could blow up all of Paris.
- Oui.</i>

71
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:11,656
The position of your government?
Will they meet the demands?

72
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:14,176
I am not authorized
to say what they will do.

73
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:18,136
At this moment there is an emergency
meeting in the Elysée Palace.

74
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:20,496
<i>Non, ce n'est pas possible.</i>

75
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:25,296
<i>Excusez-moi? No. No comprende.
Moi, journaliste Americaine.</i>

76
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,056
<i>Non, non, c'est interdit!
Complétement interdit.</i>

77
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:29,696
<i>Attends. Wait.</i>

78
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:37,016
<i>- Voilà. Qu'est-ce que c'est le mot pour...
- Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?</i>

79
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,816
<i>- Stairs. Stairs?
- Stairs...</i>

80
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:48,256
<i>S- T... S-T-A...</i>

81
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:51,976
<i>Mademoiselle!</i>

82
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:05,216
We'll bring them down now.

83
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:06,096
Get in.

84
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:10,536
<i>- Come on. Watch out for any tricks.
- Do we look like the sort...</i>

85
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:12,416
I don't know what you look like.

86
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,656
You're being released, so shut up.

87
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:57,416
- Come on then, everybody out.
- Okay, we're ready.

88
00:13:58,776 --> 00:13:59,576
This way.

89
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,496
Come on. Quick.

90
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:08,176
Look, you're being released. Get moving.

91
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,416
I'll take a last look around.

92
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,376
Okay, send them down.

93
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:26,936
Up we go.

94
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,416
Pulitzer Prize.

95
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:35,736
<i>CapitaI P...</i>

96
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,456
Should we have let the hostages go?

97
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:57,496
They'll give in to us
as soon as we plant the bomb.

98
00:14:57,616 --> 00:14:59,816
It doesn't matter one way or the other.

99
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:05,216
Nobel Prize. Capital N...

100
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:07,936
...little o, little b...

101
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,256
...little e, little I.

102
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,696
<i>Nobel. Nobel. Nobel, Nobel...</i>

103
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,216
Prize!

104
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:28,136
Be careful.

105
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:31,736
It's me that controls the bomb,
not the bomb that controls me.

106
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:34,536
I hope you have
not many sins left to be forgiven.

107
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:38,616
Because if you let go of that,
you'll have only 60 seconds to list them.

108
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:43,416
You are right. Do you hear something?

109
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:46,416
It sounded like
someone moving underneath.

110
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:47,736
It's your nerves.

111
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,216
Where are they now?

112
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:54,136
They are near to the lift.

113
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:58,096
One is still inside with the bomb.

114
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:02,536
<i>Ils sont prés de I'ascenseur. Y en a un
dedans avec la bombe. Il y en a un qui sort.</i>

115
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:05,576
The third one has come out of the lift now.

116
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:07,936
<i>The third one is out now.</i>

117
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:09,616
The bomb is still in there?

118
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:11,056
<i>Yes, we think so.</i>

119
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:17,896
This is the boring bit.

120
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:40,416
Tell them to get ready.

121
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:44,056
<i>Standby. Attention! Préparez-vous.</i>

122
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:47,016
Get ready.

123
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:48,936
Come on.

124
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,936
We'll cut the lead cable
when we get the word.

125
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:55,336
Haven't they had time to find the bomb?

126
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:59,016
Of course not. They haven't.
We've been watching them all the time.

127
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,256
<i>Vas-y! Go. Now!</i>

128
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,416
- It started!
- Oh, my God.

129
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:56,776
I believe this is your floor.

130
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,936
Thank God.

131
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,576
How did I get myself into this?

132
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:06,216
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

133
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:11,096
- A bomb! There's a bomb up there!
- I know.

134
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:42,456
<i>Fresh melons here! Nice fresh melons...</i>

135
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:51,976
Hi, Lois.

136
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,056
Hi, Clark.

137
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:06,056
Clark!

138
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:10,936
<i>- Have you ever heard of crosswalks?
- Yeah, but you know, I mean...</i>

139
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,296
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?

140
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:15,336
Freak!

141
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:20,616
Clark, you were lucky that time.

142
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:24,616
You must more careful. To cross
the street you've got to look both ways.

143
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:26,616
Lois, usually I do.

144
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,696
Maybe you ought to
get your glasses checked.

145
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:46,456
Not everybody can have
"x-ray vision," you know.

146
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:50,336
Do I detect a note of jealousy
in that voice?

147
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:53,496
Jealousy? No, not me.

148
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,176
Golly Lois, what are you doing?

149
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:01,016
When was the last time
you heard me sneeze?

150
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,816
You are never going to
hear me sneeze again!

151
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,216
I read this book,
and it says if you get 1,000 milligrams...

152
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:11,816
...of vitamin C every day,
you stay in perfect health.

153
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,856
Golly, 1,000?
That's certainly a lot of oranges, isn't it?

154
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:20,336
- There are pills, you know. I've seen them.
- Pills. That's the modern way to do things.

155
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,656
This is natural.

156
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,536
Besides, I get my exercise that way.

157
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:29,936
And Clark, you don't have to be jealous.

158
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,616
I don't?

159
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:34,256
No, you've got so much going for you.

160
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:35,656
I do?

161
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:38,616
Do you mind if I give you
a little constructive criticism?

162
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:42,256
- Actually, yes.
- Be more aggressive! You have to...

163
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:46,176
...go from the instinct. You see something,
you want it, you go for it!

164
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:47,296
That's what I do.

165
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:48,936
Yes, I've noticed.

166
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:52,736
- Perhaps I could help you there.
- Thanks, that would be great.

167
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:54,456
Let's see.

168
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,776
You put the orange in there.
That's very clever.

169
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:03,176
Clark...

170
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:09,376
...you know that I wouldn't say
all those things if I didn't really care.

171
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:12,896
You do?

172
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:16,736
What else are friends for?

173
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:19,856
"Friends"?

174
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:25,296
Here.

175
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:28,736
Here's to friendship.

176
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,776
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

177
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,856
Not with a whimper. Not with a bang.

178
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:58,696
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

179
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:00,976
...the greatest genius in this world?

180
00:23:01,136 --> 00:23:05,176
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

181
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,056
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

182
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:16,336
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

183
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,416
I mean, California almost
fell down right in the ocean.

184
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:21,336
Millions of people almost died.

185
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:24,536
<i>If it hadn't been for Superman,
that overgrown Boy Scout...</i>

186
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:26,696
I want my Liberace record back tonight.

187
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:29,696
What are you going to do
with a guy like that?

188
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:32,456
He flies around so fast and everything.

189
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:37,216
I mean they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

190
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:40,616
Every time they try he just flies off.

191
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:42,056
- Where?
- North.

192
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,216
Why?

193
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,496
To ski?

194
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:49,456
Every man has his vulnerable point.

195
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:52,096
Some, like you Otis, have more than one.

196
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:54,496
I didn't see Superman's in time.

197
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:57,576
But now through patience,
invention, and skill...

198
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:02,336
...my little black box is just about ready.

199
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,456
Oh! That little black box in our cell.

200
00:24:09,136 --> 00:24:11,296
That little black box, Mr. Luthor.

201
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:14,176
What's it for?

202
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:19,536
That little black box
goes beyond any conventional radar.

203
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:22,456
It tracks alpha waves.

204
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,736
Alpha waves.

205
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:37,296
Those alpha waves will take me north
to his secret.

206
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:42,136
And his secret will give me Superman.

207
00:24:45,256 --> 00:24:48,576
<i>The MAB is 196 at. 5.</i>

208
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:51,016
<i>We ought to see the old beauty when we...</i>

209
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:57,096
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
It's giving me a headache.

210
00:24:57,536 --> 00:25:00,496
Anyway, somebody's got to check up
on those guys.

211
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:02,936
Yeah, I keep forgetting about them.

212
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:05,976
How long they been up there, 45 days?

213
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:08,736
The whole world's forgotten about us.

214
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,936
Houston calling Artemis II.

215
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,976
Houston calling Artemis II, come in.

216
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,776
<i>'Morning, Houston.</i>

217
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:20,216
<i>Hold on, Nate.</i>

218
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,536
<i>- Yo!
- How are things going?</i>

219
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,456
All systems normal, Houston.

220
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,696
<i>Andy is out doing the geological survey...</i>

221
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:30,296
<i>More rocks.</i>

222
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:34,376
And Cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

223
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:37,336
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

224
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,976
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

225
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,616
Just a little détente humor there, Houston.

226
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,536
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

227
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:48,496
It's mighty pretty out there. Mighty...

228
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:51,736
...pretty.

229
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,176
<i>Mighty pretty, right.</i>

230
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:56,976
<i>Look, Nate...</i>

231
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,416
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

232
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:01,696
That's it. I'm dreaming.

233
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:03,616
<i>Artemis, come in.</i>

234
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:08,656
Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

235
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:10,296
Unidentified?

236
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:14,736
<i>- What does it look like?
- A lot like a...</i>

237
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:16,536
...like a girl.

238
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:38,656
You.

239
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:43,896
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

240
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:45,696
A man?

241
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,336
<i>What's your name?
Where are you from?</i>

242
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:50,976
What a fragile sort of life form it is.

243
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:20,856
Houston, come in. Houston!

244
00:28:30,656 --> 00:28:31,776
Come in, Houston.

245
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:36,656
Houston!

246
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:49,376
Somebody help me!

247
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:58,096
- Artemis, this is Houston calling.
- What's up?

248
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:02,616
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in please.
- What's going on?

249
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:05,736
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

250
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:07,656
I mean really.

251
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,056
Artemis, come in please. Houston calling.

252
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:14,736
What was that he said before?
He saw a girl?

253
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:19,536
- I thought he said "curl".
- What's a "curl"?

254
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:24,496
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used
to call a comet on an east-west trajectory?

255
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,656
How should I know?
I was in back high school in those days.

256
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:32,776
Strange.
I tore those metal fibers like paper.

257
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:34,896
And what he did...

258
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:36,576
...was amazing!

259
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,336
- Something is happening.
- Yes. To all of us.

260
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,816
The closer we come
to an atmosphere with only one sun...

261
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:50,096
...a yellow sun...

262
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:54,536
...the more our molecular density
gives us unlimited powers!

263
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:56,416
They come from there...

264
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,536
...a place called Houston.

265
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:00,776
Then we will go there too.

266
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:02,856
To rule.

267
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,856
Finally... To rule!

268
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,856
380 out.

269
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:30,936
381 out.

270
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:33,936
382 out.

271
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:36,576
383 out.

272
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:39,736
384 out.

273
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:43,016
385 out.

274
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:48,536
Lights out, Luthor.

275
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:52,016
I said, "Lights out! "

276
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:58,776
You guys are about ten seconds away
from solitary, you know that?

277
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:02,896
I told you to...

278
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:23,016
Freeze, freeze!

279
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,736
Go out there and find it.

280
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:42,576
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

281
00:31:54,816 --> 00:31:56,576
I think I found it.

282
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:04,096
What is it?

283
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:07,696
It's a ladder, you dummy.

284
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,456
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

285
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:20,696
Come on.

286
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:22,736
Hurry up.

287
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:25,256
Come on, hurry.

288
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:32,976
Otis, hold that ladder, hurry up.

289
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:46,456
Come up.

290
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:49,256
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

291
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,216
Otis, we're sinking!

292
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:55,616
Get off, get off!

293
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:41,176
Excuse me.

294
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,736
<i>If you'd like to carry Mrs...</i>

295
00:33:46,296 --> 00:33:48,176
<i>...Smith over the threshold...</i>

296
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:50,256
- What?
- It's sort of traditional.

297
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,456
<i>I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting...</i>

298
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:54,936
No. Of course not.

299
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:58,336
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.
- Certainly, dear.

300
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:04,576
- Here you are.
- Sure is pink.

301
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:07,216
Careful with the bags, please.

302
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,176
First visit to Honeymoon Haven?

303
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,296
- Yes.
- Together, anyway.

304
00:34:12,336 --> 00:34:13,256
Yes.

305
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:15,936
Let me just show you
some of our special features.

306
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:20,016
These are our "Flames of Love,"
exclusive with this motel in the area.

307
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:23,256
If you want the flames to go higher,
you just pull this.

308
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,456
I see.

309
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:27,296
- Look dear, that's kind of romantic.
- In July?

310
00:34:29,176 --> 00:34:29,976
Honey?

311
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:33,256
For a nominal charge,
our staff photographer will be happy...

312
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:37,056
...to prepare a special souvenir album
of your honeymoon stay.

313
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:40,576
He'll photograph you
in some of our more intimate locations...

314
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:43,656
<i>...in the "tub for two",
on the bear skin rug...</i>

315
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,616
Gee, reaI polyester!

316
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:47,896
And here's the bed.

317
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:49,776
Right. Thank you.

318
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:51,296
Thank you, sir.

319
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:53,856
Of course.

320
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:59,536
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. And have a happy...

321
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:01,656
...whatever.

322
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,376
Can you believe this?

323
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:11,896
Posing as newlyweds to expose
a honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls!

324
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:16,656
What a waste of a great writer. Writers.

325
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,816
Perry White
and his Sunday magazine exposés.

326
00:35:20,936 --> 00:35:24,296
How am I supposed to get a Pulitzer Prize
writing about a pink bear?

327
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:27,016
I don't know,
I think this should be exposed.

328
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:30,616
They get kids who are just
starting out and take them for every cent.

329
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,696
That's what Mr. White says.

330
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:37,536
On the other hand, this is kind of nice.
"Complimentary Champagne. "

331
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:39,936
- Kissing contest tonight.
- Really?

332
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:42,696
Lois would... No.

333
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:45,336
Look at this.

334
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:48,096
Lois? Gee.

335
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:52,256
Look, I found a complimentary corsage.

336
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,376
Everything's complimentary here
until you get the bill.

337
00:35:58,496 --> 00:36:00,496
Gee, you look very pretty.

338
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:04,896
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

339
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:10,536
You know, Lois,
I was sort of thinking, later on...

340
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:16,096
...I was just wondering what you
wanted to do about the arrangements.

341
00:36:16,536 --> 00:36:18,216
What arrangements, Clark?

342
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:23,536
I was thinking primarily about the...

343
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:26,416
...the sleeping arrangements.

344
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:28,536
Mr. Smith...

345
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,416
<i>- ... The complimentary couch.
- Right.</i>

346
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,056
What?

347
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,736
Gosh, it's alive.

348
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:48,936
Very good, Miss Teschmacher. Very good!

349
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:51,056
Why am I here? What am I doing here?

350
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,696
Miss Teschmacher,
is this a philosophy seminar?

351
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:56,576
No.

352
00:36:56,656 --> 00:36:57,816
This is a getaway.

353
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,096
- Getaway?
- Right.

354
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,776
Lex, how could you do that to Otis?

355
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:03,736
What else is ballast for?

356
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:05,776
Miss Teschmacher...

357
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:09,016
...north. Due north.

358
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:12,696
Right, north.

359
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:36,096
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Isn't it beautiful?

360
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:38,536
Just gorgeous. Gorgeous.

361
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,696
- Lois?
- Yes?

362
00:37:40,776 --> 00:37:45,296
Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands, too?

363
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,016
- Here's my hand Clark, hold it.
- Thanks.

364
00:37:49,776 --> 00:37:52,416
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

365
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:55,456
- Why?
- If they let go, straight to the lawyer.

366
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:58,536
I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

367
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,896
Because you're blind.

368
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:02,336
Yeah.

369
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:04,656
- Here.
- No, I've got it.

370
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:08,536
You've got to look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

371
00:38:09,256 --> 00:38:10,216
<i>Lois...</i>

372
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:11,256
Here.

373
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:13,496
<i>- Right.
- Don't say I never did anything...</i>

374

Thank you.

375
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:19,736
Son! Excuse me, please.

376
00:38:20,136 --> 00:38:21,136
Be careful!

377
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,136
Get down. Get down!

378
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:29,296
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

379
00:38:32,096 --> 00:38:35,136
<i>Did you see what almost happened there?
That little boy...</i>

380
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,296
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

381
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:42,056
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Because I'm hungry?

382
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:46,096
No, I mean here you stand with one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

383
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:49,056
...and you're thinking about food.
Aren't you impressed?

384
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:54,696
Once a girl's seen Superman in action,
Niagara Falls kind of leaves you cold.

385
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:56,816
- You know what I mean?
- Him again?

386
00:38:58,456 --> 00:38:59,576
I'm sorry.

387
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:02,256
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

388
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:05,856
My one track mind's
telling me that I'm hungry.

389
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:07,776
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

390
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:12,376
- Could I have some orange juice?
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

391
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:21,056
Mom, look!

392
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,696
Yeah, honey, that's nice.

393
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:35,096
Oh, my God!

394
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:37,496
Help!

395
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:42,536
Somebody help!

396
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,296
Way to go, Superman!

397
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:07,816
What a nice man!

398
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:24,176
- There you go.
- Again! Again!

399
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:26,896
I'm sorry. Only one ride to a customer.

400
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:31,056
Superman! Superman, it's me, Lois!

401
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:34,856
<i>Come here. You're going to get it!
Give me a heart attack...</i>

402
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:38,856
It's me. It's Lois. Lois Lane.

403
00:40:41,376 --> 00:40:42,736
Hello and goodbye.

404
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:46,896
What's the hurry, seeing as you
happen to be in Niagara Falls?

405
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,256
<i>Happen to be in Niagara Falls...</i>

406
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,656
<i>And, Clark...</i>

407
00:40:54,856 --> 00:40:57,256
Clark is not around as usual.

408
00:41:12,696 --> 00:41:13,936
Lois?

409
00:41:17,536 --> 00:41:19,536
- Here you go.
- Where were you?

410
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:22,256
I was getting hot dogs.
What do you mean?

411
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:27,216
It just seems kind of strange to me
that every time Superman's around, you...

412
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:28,496
...disappear.

413
00:41:28,776 --> 00:41:31,656
Superman? You mean he was here?
Golly!

414
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,696
And you weren't. As usual.

415
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:40,216
- What have you got to say about that?
- Darn, I forgot your orange juice.

416
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,616
Clark!

417
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:44,536
No orange juice?

418
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:58,256
- Mush! Mush!
- I am mushing.

419
00:41:58,856 --> 00:42:01,936
Ice and snow:
Is this your idea of a good time?

420
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:06,816
A good time? Is that all you care about?
North, Miss Teschmacher.

421
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:09,896
North!

422
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:11,736
Yes, Lex, north.

423
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:15,496
Look. It's his home.
It's Superman's home.

424
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,616
Good, more ice.

425
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:25,656
- Fantastic!
- Fantastic.

426
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:28,696
It's fantastic!

427
00:42:31,736 --> 00:42:35,456
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

428

- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

429
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:50,896
- This place is genius!
- Genius.

430
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:56,776
- Lex!
- I'll be all right.

431
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:58,136
No, me.

432
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:03,136
Why can't you be more carefuI?

433
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:07,536
- This is beautiful.
- BeautifuI.

434
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:09,256
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

435
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:15,016
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

436
00:43:22,056 --> 00:43:24,536
This looks like some kind of control panel.

437
00:43:28,616 --> 00:43:30,976
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

438
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:35,296
- Ice.
- I said don't touch it.

439
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,696
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

440
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:50,616
<i>Kryptonian memory bank,
education crystal #308.</i>

00:45:47,176 --> 00:45:51,776
<i>On Earth, they would have the same
powers, each one of them...</i>

475
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,296
<i>...that you have.</i>

476
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:54,936
Think of it.

477
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:56,496
<i>- The first of the three...
- Three.</i>

478
00:45:56,576 --> 00:46:00,096
<i>- ... is their leader, General Zod.
- Count them, three super-villains.</i>

479
00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:04,296
<i>- Together with Non and Ursa...
- Each one with the same power he has.</i>

480
00:46:05,376 --> 00:46:08,536
Each one totally dedicated to corruption,
violence, and evil.

481
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:12,936
Wait. That explains the three Alpha Waves
I've been getting on my black box.

482
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:15,056
They'll need a contact here on Earth.

483
00:46:15,136 --> 00:46:18,936
Someone with the same contempt for life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

484
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,336
South, Miss Teschmacher!

485
00:46:21,216 --> 00:46:22,776
You know, it's really amazing.

486
00:46:22,856 --> 00:46:26,736
I never started to put it together
before now. It's just kind of funny...

487
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:29,736
...because a good reporter
can't let anything slip by her.

488
00:46:29,816 --> 00:46:33,536
- Of course not.
- I'm beginning to get the picture.

489
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:39,296
As usual, Lois, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

490
00:46:40,576 --> 00:46:43,216
Tell you what,
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

491
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:45,056
What's your hurry, Superman?

492
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:49,656
Sorry?

493
00:46:52,616 --> 00:46:56,136
I've got to admit, your disguise is
nearly perfect. You had me fooled.

494
00:46:56,496 --> 00:46:58,696
And I am nobody's fool, believe me.

495
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:00,296
No, of course not.

496
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:04,016
You just have an active imagination.
You get carried away sometimes.

497
00:47:04,056 --> 00:47:06,616
- I understand. It can happen to anybody.
- Listen...

498
00:47:07,376 --> 00:47:11,536
...I'm so sure that you're Superman
that I'm willing to bet my life on it.

499
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:12,896
What?

500
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:16,896
If I'm right, you'll turn into Superman.

501
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:19,816
If I'm wrong...

502
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:22,896
...you've got yourself one hell of a story.

503
00:47:24,616 --> 00:47:27,296
You think I'm Superman?

504
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:30,016
Boy, you certainly have some imagination.

505
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:32,976
For a minute, you almost
had me convinced. For a minute.

506
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:35,016
Bye-bye, baby.

507
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,016
Oh, my god!

508
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:46,376
Excuse me, please.

509
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:47,536
Help!

510
00:47:57,976 --> 00:47:59,576
Superman!

511
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:03,576
Lois, swim!

512
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:05,856
Help!

513
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:09,376
Look out for the rocks! Oh, God!

514
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:11,936
Clark!

515
00:48:36,736 --> 00:48:38,776
- Grab that branch!
- What?

516
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:46,936
Help!

517
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:08,336
Lois, you all right?

518
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:21,296
Here!

519
00:49:34,216 --> 00:49:37,816
- You were what I thought was Superman?
- Sorry.

520
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:41,136
This is really embarrassing.

521
00:50:10,456 --> 00:50:12,496
So this is planet Houston?

522
00:50:15,936 --> 00:50:17,936
A very strange surface.

523
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:04,536
A primitive sort of life form.

524
00:51:15,496 --> 00:51:16,936
Did you see that?

525
00:51:18,256 --> 00:51:19,656
Did you see what I did?

526
00:51:20,656 --> 00:51:23,056
I have powers beyond reason here.

527
00:51:23,856 --> 00:51:25,616
We all have them, my dear.

528
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:48,856
I must've looked like an idiot...

529
00:51:49,296 --> 00:51:52,096
...jumping in the river,
waiting for Mr. WonderfuI...

530
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,456
...who obviously had better things to do.

531
00:51:57,216 --> 00:52:00,256
I'm sure it must've been
something very important, Lois.

532
00:52:00,656 --> 00:52:02,736
<i>And then thinking you were...</i>

533
00:52:05,216 --> 00:52:07,096
<i>If Perry White could see me now...</i>

534
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:12,776
Where's my comb?

535
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:20,256
God, not only have I lost my mind,
I lost my comb.

536
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:23,136
Can you pass me that brush over there?

537
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:24,336
Sure.

538
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,976
- No. It's okay.
- Let me see your hand. Give it to me.

539
00:52:38,056 --> 00:52:40,376
- No. It's all right, Lois.
- Let me look at it.

540
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:55,336
- You are Superman.
- Come on, don't be silly.

541
00:53:16,816 --> 00:53:17,816
I'm sorry.

542
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,776
No, you don't have anything
to be sorry about.

543
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:27,016
I don't know why I did that.

544
00:53:27,976 --> 00:53:29,216
Maybe you wanted to.

545
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:31,656
I don't think I did.

546
00:53:34,056 --> 00:53:39,056
Maybe you didn't want to with your mind,
but maybe you wanted to with your heart.

547
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:45,496
We'd better talk.

548
00:53:51,976 --> 00:53:53,336
I'm in love with you.

549
00:53:57,056 --> 00:53:58,656
We really better talk.

550
00:54:00,896 --> 00:54:01,936
I'm listening.

551
00:54:03,496 --> 00:54:07,336
We can't talk here. Perry will call
at about 6:00 to find out what's happening.

552
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:11,456
"What's happening"?
That's the understatement of the year.

553
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:19,896
Where do you want to... Talk?

554
00:54:26,976 --> 00:54:27,976
Lois...

555
00:54:31,256 --> 00:54:34,056
...now that you know,
I think you should know it all.

556
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:35,936
I want to.

557
00:54:38,256 --> 00:54:39,496
Let's go to my place.

558
00:54:43,216 --> 00:54:44,896
Maybe I should change first.

559
00:54:50,736 --> 00:54:52,216
Maybe you should, too.

560
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:23,976
- They have a wide selection.
- I can't eat fish.

561
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:28,296
You can eat anything you want, Duane.
You can eat meat and potatoes.

562
00:55:28,736 --> 00:55:31,536
I couldn't go anywhere
where I was expected to eat fish.

563
00:55:31,656 --> 00:55:33,176
They got beans.

564
00:55:33,696 --> 00:55:36,976
I can't eat beans.
I come out in a rash if I eat beans.

565
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:41,736
Look, Duane, they have a wide selection.

566
00:55:43,656 --> 00:55:45,536
I think I'll try the fish.

567
00:55:52,656 --> 00:55:56,976
I don't know, from the look of them,
I'll bet $10 they're from Los Angeles.

568
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:05,416
Hey, hippies! Get your butts off the road!

569
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,576
I like the globe that flashes red
like our Krypton sun.

570
00:56:10,096 --> 00:56:12,176
But not this irritating noise.

571
00:56:12,896 --> 00:56:13,776
Make way!

572
00:56:15,696 --> 00:56:19,296
Did I hear right?
Did that son of a bitch give me an order?

573
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:21,816
Duane, you take care of it.

574
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:22,936
But...

575
00:56:23,216 --> 00:56:26,496
You got to learn to kick ass
if you want to be a peacemaker.

576
00:56:34,856 --> 00:56:38,616
All right. Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

577
00:56:39,216 --> 00:56:42,856
What is this symbol?
Do you follow another leader?

578
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:44,816
Follow the leader?

579
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,496
Holy skunk sweat!

580
00:56:49,376 --> 00:56:51,536
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort?

581
00:57:01,856 --> 00:57:03,696
How in the hell did you do that?

582
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:12,736
Jesus H. Christ!

583
00:57:14,656 --> 00:57:16,296
Crude noise-maker.

584
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,176
<i>Just checking the tire...</i>

585
00:58:39,096 --> 00:58:41,616
- Wow, this is your home!
- No.

586
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:45,216
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

587
00:58:47,096 --> 00:58:49,416
This is a very special place for me.

588
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,176
I wanted you to see it.

589
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:53,896
Listen, you warm enough?

590
00:58:55,656 --> 00:58:57,816
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

591
00:58:57,896 --> 00:59:00,776
Good. Come on, let me show you.

592
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,136
You see? You only smell strong.

593
00:59:46,576 --> 00:59:48,016
Baby!

594
00:59:51,536 --> 00:59:54,656
It's only because I didn't want to
lose my place in the orchestra.

595
00:59:57,696 --> 01:00:00,176
The circus is in town!

596
01:00:02,456 --> 01:00:05,896
Hey, sweet thing!
Set them buns down here!

597
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:14,016
Let's just hold hands.

598
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,376
Let me know if this tickles.

599
01:00:28,816 --> 01:00:31,696
Your right front tire is flat, Duane.

600
01:00:37,336 --> 01:00:39,496
Sheriff, what happened?

601
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:41,976
<i>Willie...</i>

602
01:00:42,896 --> 01:00:44,536
I think my arm's broke.

603
01:00:45,696 --> 01:00:46,896
Girl or no girl...

604
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,736
...you're going to spit teeth! Get up!

605
01:00:56,096 --> 01:00:57,936
What the sam hill?

606
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:05,496
Is that you, Boog?

607
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:14,776
All right.

608
01:01:15,096 --> 01:01:16,496
Get 'em up, keep 'em up!

609
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:19,376
These humans are beginning to bore me.

610
01:01:29,976 --> 01:01:31,736
- Please, Mister!
- He's a general.

611
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:34,016
Mr. General! Please let my daddy down!

612
01:01:40,136 --> 01:01:41,496
You okay, Jody?

613
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:47,056
When my father died...

614
01:01:47,656 --> 01:01:49,736
...this is my Earth father, I mean...

615
01:01:50,896 --> 01:01:53,536
...I found this crystal.

616
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:59,056
This is kind of hard to explain,
but you see...

617
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:00,936
...it called to me.

618
01:02:03,336 --> 01:02:05,616
Yeah. And it brought me here.

619
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:08,216
It helped me to build this place.

620
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:11,136
Actually it built it, really.

621
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:16,816
That's when I found out who I really was...

622
01:02:17,136 --> 01:02:18,776
...and what I had to do.

623
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:25,896
So what do you think? You like it?

624
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:27,416
Like it?

625
01:02:28,576 --> 01:02:29,976
It's incredible!

626
01:02:30,936 --> 01:02:34,496
I mean, not that it couldn't use
a woman's touch...

627
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:36,416
...especially around dinner time.

628
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:40,616
Dinner. I'm sorry.
I don't usually do too much about...

629
01:02:41,256 --> 01:02:44,056
Listen, tonight, sky's the limit.
Anything you want.

630
01:03:32,456 --> 01:03:33,376
I'm home!

631
01:03:35,096 --> 01:03:36,136
Should we eat?

632
01:03:38,456 --> 01:03:39,816
- Sure.
- Great.

633
01:03:43,536 --> 01:03:46,896
Good morning, America.
This is East Houston, Idaho...

634
01:03:46,976 --> 01:03:49,296
...until yesterday,
another middle American town...

635
01:03:49,376 --> 01:03:51,336
...that middle America had forgotten.

636
01:03:51,696 --> 01:03:55,576
But today the population,
exaggerated reports put it at 123...

637
01:03:55,696 --> 01:03:57,176
...has increased by three.

638
01:03:57,456 --> 01:04:00,496
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

639
01:04:00,576 --> 01:04:03,576
As I look west into East Houston
this morning...

640
01:04:03,616 --> 01:04:05,296
...I see a town gripped with...

641
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:07,096
...fear.

642
01:04:08,816 --> 01:04:10,496
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

643
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,336
<i>Okay, yeah, we've got a P.O...</i>

644
01:04:14,336 --> 01:04:15,176
No.

645
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:17,776
<i>We've got a slight crack in that diode.</i>

646
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,456
<i>- Come in on him if you can.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

647
01:04:21,536 --> 01:04:22,936
Who else is seeing this?

648
01:04:23,696 --> 01:04:27,856
With this satellite link up,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

649
01:04:27,936 --> 01:04:31,056
- The whole planet Houston?
- Earth.

650
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,176
The whole planet Earth.

651
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,496
<i>Get over to the commentator.</i>

652
01:04:35,776 --> 01:04:37,296
<i>You may continue.</i>

653
01:04:38,096 --> 01:04:40,976
<i>As the extraordinary story continues...</i>

654
01:04:42,816 --> 01:04:44,816
<i>As this extraordinary story...</i>

655
01:04:44,896 --> 01:04:48,776
If the whole planet is watching, can't we
show them something more interesting?

656
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:51,296
<i>Throw down your arms and surrender!</i>

657
01:04:51,816 --> 01:04:53,416
<i>This is an order!</i>

658
01:04:56,456 --> 01:04:59,776
GeneraI Zod does not take orders.
He gives them.

659
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:26,016
You all right, buddy?

660
01:05:55,056 --> 01:05:58,016
He was right in the line of fire
and nothing happened to him!

661
01:05:58,056 --> 01:06:00,456
I haven't seen the likes of this
since Superman.

662
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:05,216
<i>Yes. The Newsbeat control room
has just informed me...</i>

663
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:08,296
<i>...that a fleet of helicopter gun ships
is on it's way...</i>

664
01:06:08,376 --> 01:06:11,856
<i>- Mr. President, can't we...
- I'm afraid there's nothing anybody can do.</i>

665
01:06:11,936 --> 01:06:14,336
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

666
01:06:14,576 --> 01:06:17,096
Where's Superman? Where is he?

667
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:18,976
Why doesn't he do something?

668
01:06:19,536 --> 01:06:22,776
General Smythson has informed us
that nuclear weapon strikes...

669
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:26,736
...have been ruled out because of
the danger to the civilian population.

670
01:06:35,856 --> 01:06:37,256
<i>Starting firing run now.</i>

671
01:06:39,816 --> 01:06:41,296
<i>Standby, rockets.</i>

672
01:06:42,016 --> 01:06:42,816
<i>Fire one.</i>

673
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:47,216
<i>Fire again.</i>

674
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:50,256
<i>Fire again.</i>

675
01:06:58,656 --> 01:07:00,536
<i>The rockets didn't have any effect.</i>

676
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:04,616
Look, they need machines to fly!

677
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:08,376
What bravery!

678
01:07:09,016 --> 01:07:11,656
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

679
01:07:20,656 --> 01:07:23,256
<i>We're out of control. I don't understand.</i>

680
01:07:25,696 --> 01:07:28,176
<i>We're coming in... Coming down...
can't control it!</i>

681
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:30,536
<i>We're coming down!</i>

682
01:07:44,296 --> 01:07:45,176
I win.

683
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:48,696
I always win.

684
01:07:50,736 --> 01:07:53,656
<i>Is there no one on this planet
to even challenge me?</i>

685
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,976
That was good.

686
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,096
I thought we might...

687
01:08:05,776 --> 01:08:07,736
...abandon the orange juice for once.

688
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:18,536
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

689
01:08:22,776 --> 01:08:25,056
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

690
01:08:26,256 --> 01:08:27,296
No.

691
01:08:29,216 --> 01:08:30,856
I really like it sometimes.

692
01:08:31,456 --> 01:08:33,736
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

693
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,416
You know, if it weren't for him...

694
01:08:38,256 --> 01:08:39,856
...I never would have met you.

695
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:44,216
But... He is you.

696
01:08:46,016 --> 01:08:47,816
It's kind of confusing.

697
01:08:49,696 --> 01:08:51,016
Not to me, it isn't.

698
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:55,536
For the first time in my life...

699
01:08:56,976 --> 01:08:58,296
...everything's clear.

700
01:09:22,816 --> 01:09:25,896
I'm going to go change into something
more comfortable.

701
01:09:40,696 --> 01:09:44,296
Come forward.
Your general wishes to speak.

702
01:09:44,696 --> 01:09:46,776
I am General Zod.

703
01:09:47,776 --> 01:09:48,776
Your ruler.

704
01:09:50,296 --> 01:09:53,696
Yes, today begins a new order!

705
01:09:54,576 --> 01:09:58,376
Your lands, your possessions,
your very lives...

706
01:09:58,456 --> 01:10:02,136
...will gladly be given
in tribute to me, General Zod!

707
01:10:02,976 --> 01:10:04,736
In return for your obedience...

708
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:07,776
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

709
01:10:07,856 --> 01:10:10,816
In other words, you will be allowed to live.

710
01:10:14,296 --> 01:10:16,256
<i>So you are a general...</i>

711
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:20,336
And who is your superior?

712
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:25,376
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me...

713
01:10:27,576 --> 01:10:30,776
...or all of his cities
will end up like this one!

714
01:10:31,736 --> 01:10:35,376
<i>Your father and I have tried to anticipate
your every question, Kal-El.</i>

715
01:10:35,616 --> 01:10:38,096
<i>This is the one we hoped
you would not ask.</i>

716
01:10:38,576 --> 01:10:42,536
But I have to, because...
she's everything I want in life.

717
01:10:43,896 --> 01:10:46,216
<i>And she, the one you have chosen...</i>

718
01:10:47,096 --> 01:10:49,096
<i>...she feels as much for you?</i>

719
01:10:50,136 --> 01:10:50,976
Yes.

720
01:10:51,056 --> 01:10:52,816
<i>Then if this is what you wish...</i>

721
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:56,016
<i>...if you intend to live your life
with a mortal...</i>

722
01:10:56,576 --> 01:10:59,096
<i>...you must live as a mortal.</i>

723
01:10:59,656 --> 01:11:01,536
<i>You must become one of them.</i>

724
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:07,976
<i>This crystal chamber has harnessed
the rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

725
01:11:08,856 --> 01:11:11,376
<i>Once exposed to these rays, all...</i>

726
01:11:11,456 --> 01:11:15,016
<i>...your great powers on Earth
will disappear forever.</i>

727
01:11:20,296 --> 01:11:21,696
<i>But consider...</i>

728
01:11:22,336 --> 01:11:24,376
<i>...once it is done, there is no return.</i>

729
01:11:24,856 --> 01:11:26,776
<i>You will become an ordinary man.</i>

730
01:11:27,336 --> 01:11:29,736
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

731
01:11:30,496 --> 01:11:33,456
<i>You can be hurt like an ordinary man.</i>

732
01:11:44,136 --> 01:11:47,056
<i>My son, are you sure?</i>

733
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:55,816
Mother...

734
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:58,776
...I love her.

735
01:13:48,896 --> 01:13:50,576
You did all that for me?

736
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:55,536
I don't know what to say.

737
01:13:57,816 --> 01:13:59,336
Just say you love me.

738
01:14:50,216 --> 01:14:53,936
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

739
01:14:54,176 --> 01:14:57,096
Imagine what they'll do to the world
if we resist.

740
01:16:02,576 --> 01:16:04,456
The whole place is going to fall!

741
01:16:04,536 --> 01:16:05,376
Watch it!

742
01:16:41,456 --> 01:16:43,376
You are the one they call President?

743
01:16:43,976 --> 01:16:44,816
I am.

744
01:16:48,256 --> 01:16:51,496
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

745
01:16:53,056 --> 01:16:54,136
Good.

746
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,536
Rise before Zod.

747
01:17:01,776 --> 01:17:04,776
Now, kneel before Zod.

748
01:17:18,976 --> 01:17:20,496
You are not the President.

749
01:17:20,856 --> 01:17:24,496
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

750
01:17:25,896 --> 01:17:27,656
I am the man they are protecting.

751
01:17:28,896 --> 01:17:30,216
I am the President.

752
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:33,936
I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.

753
01:17:34,336 --> 01:17:37,656
It will. Starting with your own.

754
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:55,496
What I do now, I do for
the sake of the people of the world.

755
01:17:56,816 --> 01:18:00,696
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

756
01:18:01,216 --> 01:18:03,696
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

757
01:18:04,176 --> 01:18:05,296
I wish I knew.

758
01:18:10,776 --> 01:18:11,936
God.

759
01:18:12,656 --> 01:18:13,576
Zod.

760
01:18:17,856 --> 01:18:21,216
You're awfully quiet over there.
I'm supposed to be the shy one.

761
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,216
Yeah, I was just thinking...

762
01:18:26,136 --> 01:18:29,216
...I can't believe
what you've given up for me.

763
01:18:30,656 --> 01:18:33,776
Are you kidding?
I didn't do it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

764
01:18:34,536 --> 01:18:37,776
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

765
01:18:37,936 --> 01:18:40,976
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

766
01:18:41,896 --> 01:18:43,136
Hurry up.

767
01:18:43,736 --> 01:18:45,176
- Come on.
- Okay.

768
01:18:46,016 --> 01:18:47,536
My back's stiff.

769
01:18:48,976 --> 01:18:50,776
Come on, it's my treat.

770
01:18:55,176 --> 01:18:57,296
Oh, boy, it's Mr. WonderfuI.

771
01:18:58,856 --> 01:19:00,176
Thank you.

772
01:19:03,616 --> 01:19:05,976
- Do you have a men's room?
- Right in the corner.

773
01:19:06,376 --> 01:19:08,496
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

774
01:19:11,056 --> 01:19:12,656
What would you folks like?

775
01:19:12,776 --> 01:19:16,136
I'd like a cheeseburger
with everything on it and a Coke...

776
01:19:16,296 --> 01:19:19,936
...and an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

777
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,736
For you, sir?

778
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:25,776
- I'll think about it when I get back.
- Right.

779
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:28,576
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- My Coke, please.

780
01:19:28,616 --> 01:19:29,576
Coming up.

781
01:19:30,936 --> 01:19:32,376
Sorry, that seat's taken.

782
01:19:32,536 --> 01:19:34,176
It is now, sweetheart.

783
01:19:35,696 --> 01:19:37,456
Can I buy you something to eat?

784
01:19:38,296 --> 01:19:39,656
No, thank you.

785
01:19:40,816 --> 01:19:43,056
Excuse me.
I think you're sitting in my seat.

786
01:19:44,016 --> 01:19:46,176
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

787
01:19:49,616 --> 01:19:53,096
I think, perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

788
01:19:54,576 --> 01:19:57,176
Yeah? Let me know when he comes in.

789
01:19:57,296 --> 01:19:59,456
<i>- Look, we can just...
- Honey...</i>

790
01:20:01,056 --> 01:20:03,416
Excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

791
01:20:03,616 --> 01:20:06,256
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

792
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:12,216
Now listen, your steak's coming right up.

793
01:20:12,976 --> 01:20:16,296
Keep it on the flame,
this is just a minute steak.

794
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:19,376
After you.

795
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:30,256
You all right?

796
01:20:30,336 --> 01:20:32,576
He's going to be fine, just give me that.

797
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:36,136
Blood. It's my blood.

798
01:20:37,496 --> 01:20:38,416
I think...

799
01:20:39,056 --> 01:20:41,776
...maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard
from now on.

800
01:20:42,256 --> 01:20:45,416
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

801
01:20:45,696 --> 01:20:47,096
I know that.

802
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:49,856
I wish he were here.

803
01:20:59,016 --> 01:21:02,136
Boy, you just don't have enough sense
to stay down do you?

804
01:21:16,976 --> 01:21:19,216
I don't like your meat, anyway.

805
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,776
Oh, God.

806
01:21:34,376 --> 01:21:35,376
Can you get up?

807
01:21:36,176 --> 01:21:38,136
- It's all right. I got you.
- Go slow.

808
01:21:38,216 --> 01:21:39,256
Try and get up in that chair.

809
01:21:42,216 --> 01:21:44,176
- Sit down.
- I'm all right.

810
01:21:47,016 --> 01:21:50,016
He's all right. Just relax.
We'll have some fresh coffee.

811
01:21:50,136 --> 01:21:51,936
I'll turn the box on.

812
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:56,096
<i>We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...</i>

813
01:21:56,176 --> 01:21:58,496
<i>...from the President of the United States.</i>

814
01:21:59,496 --> 01:22:01,216
<i>This is your President.</i>

815
01:22:01,936 --> 01:22:06,536
<i>On behalf of my country and in the name
of the other leaders of the world...</i>

816
01:22:07,376 --> 01:22:09,536
<i>...with whom I have today consulted...</i>

817
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:13,016
<i>...I hereby abdicate...</i>

818
01:22:13,616 --> 01:22:17,256
<i>...all authority
and control over this planet...</i>

819
01:22:18,376 --> 01:22:19,496
<i>...to General Zod.</i>

820
01:22:21,776 --> 01:22:25,416
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...</i>

821
01:22:26,376 --> 01:22:30,056
<i>...will the lives
of innocent millions be spared.</i>

822
01:22:30,816 --> 01:22:32,456
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

823
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:36,136
<i>- Superman, where...
- Who is this Superman?</i>

824
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:38,896
<i>You'll find out! And when you do...</i>

825
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:42,416
<i>Come to me, Superman! If you dare!</i>

826
01:22:42,856 --> 01:22:44,336
<i>I defy you!</i>

827
01:22:44,576 --> 01:22:47,976
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod!</i>

828
01:22:53,456 --> 01:22:55,336
- Here? When?
- When?

829
01:22:55,456 --> 01:22:56,656
Where have you been?

830
01:22:56,936 --> 01:22:58,656
On a desert island?

831
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,256
I have to go back.

832
01:23:03,816 --> 01:23:05,496
You can't go back.

833
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,976
- There's no way, now.
- I have to.

834
01:23:08,496 --> 01:23:11,776
I've got to try, damn it!
I've got to try something. Anything!

835
01:23:12,016 --> 01:23:14,096
It's not your fault.

836
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,816
You didn't know this was going to happen.

837
01:23:19,616 --> 01:23:21,176
They knew.

838
01:23:21,736 --> 01:23:23,416
I heard them.

839
01:23:24,216 --> 01:23:26,216
I just didn't listen.

840
01:23:56,296 --> 01:23:57,936
Hey, come on!

841
01:24:42,576 --> 01:24:43,976
Father?

842
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:45,936
Mother?

843
01:24:48,936 --> 01:24:51,376
I really wish you could hear me.

844
01:24:52,776 --> 01:24:54,536
Because I need you.

845
01:24:56,816 --> 01:24:58,216
See, I...

846
01:25:01,136 --> 01:25:02,656
<i>...I...</i>

847
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,816
I failed.

848
01:25:11,336 --> 01:25:13,336
Father!

849
01:26:27,656 --> 01:26:29,136
You're master of all you survey.

850
01:26:30,456 --> 01:26:32,376
And so I was yesterday.

851
01:26:32,736 --> 01:26:34,456
And the day before.

852
01:26:49,216 --> 01:26:50,176
Hello, there.

853
01:26:51,896 --> 01:26:53,416
Lex Luthor.

854
01:26:58,736 --> 01:27:01,496
You may know the name.
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

855
01:27:02,256 --> 01:27:04,696
I told you this was a puny planet.

856
01:27:04,976 --> 01:27:06,576
Wait, just a moment.

857
01:27:06,776 --> 01:27:09,736
Wait until you get to know me better,
will you, please?

858
01:27:10,216 --> 01:27:13,856
Wait, I can give you anything you want.

859
01:27:14,016 --> 01:27:17,936
I can give you the brass ring,
the unlimited freedom to maim...

860
01:27:18,256 --> 01:27:20,336
...kill, destroy.

861
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:25,576
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

862
01:27:26,216 --> 01:27:30,456
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

863
01:27:32,336 --> 01:27:34,696
We have all of this without you.

864
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,656
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

865
01:27:38,376 --> 01:27:40,136
Magnificent One.

866
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:44,736
What I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

867
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,416
The son of Jor-El.

868
01:27:46,896 --> 01:27:49,656
The son of Jor-El? On this planet?

869
01:27:50,456 --> 01:27:54,496
<i>Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage, or his...</i>

870
01:27:54,856 --> 01:27:56,376
...name he travels under.

871
01:27:56,456 --> 01:27:57,216
Superman.

872
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:02,136
So, this is Superman.

873
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:06,496
- How do you know of Jor-El?
- My Fullness...

874
01:28:06,976 --> 01:28:09,216
<i>...as I explained to you before...</i>

875
01:28:10,616 --> 01:28:12,016
I'm the best there is.

876
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:15,576
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer.

877
01:28:15,816 --> 01:28:18,776
- Revenge!
- Revenge! Now we're cooking!

878
01:28:19,056 --> 01:28:20,936
- He flies?
- Constantly.

879
01:28:21,216 --> 01:28:24,576
<i>- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly. But...</i>

880
01:28:26,896 --> 01:28:30,416
Magnificent One, he's just one...

881
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,936
...where you are three.

882
01:28:34,616 --> 01:28:36,256
Or four if you count him twice.

883
01:28:36,336 --> 01:28:38,016
We will bring him to his knees.

884
01:28:38,096 --> 01:28:38,776
Wait!

885
01:28:41,136 --> 01:28:42,296
First, you must find him.

886
01:28:42,816 --> 01:28:45,456
And Lex baby is the only one
who knows where he is.

887
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:50,096
What... Do you want?

888
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:51,776
<i>Well, General...</i>

889
01:28:52,776 --> 01:28:54,696
The world is a big place.

890
01:28:55,416 --> 01:28:57,216
Thank goodness...

891
01:28:58,056 --> 01:28:59,736
...my needs are small.

892
01:29:01,456 --> 01:29:06,896
As it turns out, I have this affinity
for beachfront property.

893
01:29:09,096 --> 01:29:10,136
What do you want?

894
01:29:11,696 --> 01:29:12,736
Australia.

895
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:18,976
I can't understand it!

896
01:29:19,256 --> 01:29:22,416
Where is he? He shows up every time
a cat gets stuck in a tree...

897
01:29:22,536 --> 01:29:25,016
...and now he's decided to pull
a disappearing act?

898
01:29:25,096 --> 01:29:28,056
- We haven't figured out his game plan.
- Game plan!

899
01:29:28,536 --> 01:29:32,816
It's fourth down, the two-minute warning
has sounded and the ball is in our territory.

900
01:29:32,896 --> 01:29:35,896
How brilliant do you have to be? I mean...

901
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:41,536
Superman's got something up his sleeve,
that's for sure.

902
01:29:41,936 --> 01:29:44,936
- We haven't figured it out. Right?
- He'll be here!

903
01:29:46,016 --> 01:29:48,056
If it's at all possible, he'll be here.

904
01:29:48,696 --> 01:29:49,456
See?

905
01:29:49,736 --> 01:29:52,336
And she knows his plays
better than anybody.

906
01:29:56,216 --> 01:29:58,256
Better than anybody.

907
01:29:58,776 --> 01:30:01,176
Maybe he hasn't heard about it yet.

908
01:30:10,096 --> 01:30:11,496
Sounds like an earthquake.

909
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:57,136
Quick, take a picture!

910
01:31:24,936 --> 01:31:26,656
You all right, chief?

911
01:31:27,256 --> 01:31:31,016
Even with accumulated knowledge when'll
these dummies learn to use a doorknob?

912
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:32,736
Hi!

913
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:37,896
You should see the White House,
months of cleaning.

914
01:31:39,456 --> 01:31:41,296
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

915
01:31:44,176 --> 01:31:45,256
Yes, your Grace.

916
01:31:45,976 --> 01:31:46,936
But...

917
01:31:47,176 --> 01:31:49,456
...what I've given you
is the next best thing.

918
01:31:49,496 --> 01:31:50,936
Hold on to that little lady...

919
01:31:51,016 --> 01:31:52,696
...and he'll be along.

920
01:31:53,616 --> 01:31:55,336
They have this relationship.

921
01:31:55,496 --> 01:31:59,296
She does all his public relations
and he gives her every exclusive.

922
01:31:59,656 --> 01:32:02,376
They're the best of friends.
Know what I mean?

923
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:06,056
What an undemanding male
this Superman must be.

924
01:32:06,256 --> 01:32:08,336
You could use a tuck here and there.

925
01:32:08,976 --> 01:32:09,776
Wait!

926
01:32:10,656 --> 01:32:12,496
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

927
01:32:13,216 --> 01:32:14,376
Kill the rest...

928
01:32:14,816 --> 01:32:15,776
...starting with him.

929
01:32:17,256 --> 01:32:18,816
Wait. Wait.

930
01:32:19,456 --> 01:32:21,496
Remember the White House?
The Oval Room?

931
01:32:21,816 --> 01:32:23,256
We had a few laughs, right?

932
01:32:41,976 --> 01:32:43,016
General...

933
01:32:44,496 --> 01:32:46,296
...would you care to step outside?

934
01:32:46,696 --> 01:32:47,896
Superman!

935
01:32:48,816 --> 01:32:50,016
Superman, thank God.

936
01:32:50,976 --> 01:32:52,336
I mean, get him!

937
01:32:53,016 --> 01:32:55,376
Come to me, Son of Jor-El!

938
01:32:55,656 --> 01:32:57,976
Kneel before Zod!

939
01:33:17,776 --> 01:33:19,776
Watch out. You all right?

940
01:33:29,536 --> 01:33:30,896
Wait there.

941
01:33:41,216 --> 01:33:42,576
Son of Jor-El!

942
01:33:43,376 --> 01:33:45,736
We were beginning to think
you were a coward!

943
01:33:46,216 --> 01:33:47,416
I'm not a coward.

944
01:33:48,896 --> 01:33:50,536
Let him prove it!

945
01:34:09,776 --> 01:34:12,296
Then die as you deserve to!

946
01:34:22,576 --> 01:34:24,776
Come on, get him!

947
01:34:25,136 --> 01:34:27,136
This is going to be good!

948
01:34:32,056 --> 01:34:34,216
Take him. He's yours.

949
01:35:01,576 --> 01:35:03,576
Come on! Kill him!

950
01:35:04,216 --> 01:35:05,616
<i>Superman...</i>

951
01:35:14,336 --> 01:35:17,136
The big one's just as strong as Superman!

952
01:35:49,296 --> 01:35:50,056
Hold him.

953
01:35:52,936 --> 01:35:54,616
Home run!

954
01:36:43,296 --> 01:36:47,016
This "super" man is nothing of the kind.

955
01:36:47,536 --> 01:36:49,656
I've discovered his weakness.

956
01:36:50,336 --> 01:36:51,376
He cares.

957
01:36:51,896 --> 01:36:54,856
He actually cares for these Earth people.

958
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:58,096
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

959
01:36:58,976 --> 01:37:00,856
Sentimental idiot.

960
01:37:06,376 --> 01:37:07,896
He's caged Non.

961
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:11,176
I'll draw his fire.

962
01:37:11,376 --> 01:37:13,216
With some of my own.

963
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:51,296
Get out of here! The rig's going to blow!

964
01:39:41,496 --> 01:39:43,536
Superman, help us!

965
01:40:44,696 --> 01:40:47,136
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

966
01:40:49,296 --> 01:40:50,856
You people, get back.

967
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:53,216
Here, take the end of this.

968
01:41:07,256 --> 01:41:09,216
No. Don't do it!

969
01:41:09,936 --> 01:41:11,336
The people!

970
01:41:51,456 --> 01:41:53,256
Where's you wife, sir?

971
01:41:53,336 --> 01:41:55,536
I got her. Don't worry.

972
01:41:55,696 --> 01:41:56,856
He's dead.

973
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,936
Superman is dead.

974
01:42:02,336 --> 01:42:03,656
They killed Superman.

975
01:42:07,096 --> 01:42:08,136
Let's get them!

976
01:42:08,496 --> 01:42:10,576
Come on, let's go!

977
01:42:45,816 --> 01:42:47,256
Forgot your change!

978
01:42:50,776 --> 01:42:52,256
Wait a minute!

979
01:42:56,976 --> 01:42:58,696
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

980
01:43:00,736 --> 01:43:02,336
I can't see what's happening!

981
01:43:08,096 --> 01:43:09,696
- My hair!
- What about mine?

982
01:43:10,576 --> 01:43:11,336
Hold on!

983
01:44:34,736 --> 01:44:35,616
He's alive!

984
01:44:55,496 --> 01:44:57,456
Come back, please!

985
01:45:01,376 --> 01:45:02,176
So...

986
01:45:02,936 --> 01:45:05,416
...he is a coward after all.

987
01:45:07,936 --> 01:45:09,416
Come back, Superman!

988
01:45:17,216 --> 01:45:19,896
- Don't leave us!
- We can't handle it without you.

989
01:45:20,336 --> 01:45:23,336
- It's not our fault.
- He chickened out.

990
01:45:24,456 --> 01:45:25,336
Phony!

991
01:45:26,656 --> 01:45:28,536
Superman didn't even do nothing!

992
01:45:29,056 --> 01:45:30,736
Come on, let's go!

993
01:45:32,616 --> 01:45:34,176
Get away from here!

994
01:45:39,376 --> 01:45:40,856
Our victory is complete!

995
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:42,936
The son of Jor-El has fled.

996
01:45:43,256 --> 01:45:44,416
Superman fled?

997
01:45:45,016 --> 01:45:46,256
I don't believe you.

998
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,896
- The next time we will kill him!
- The next time?

999
01:45:50,616 --> 01:45:52,096
The next time?

1000
01:45:53,336 --> 01:45:55,336
What am I going to do with you people?

1001
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:58,216
I held up my end, I delivered the Blue Boy.

1002
01:45:58,576 --> 01:46:00,456
What do I get from my triple threat?

1003
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:03,736
"Bow, yield, kneel," that kind of stuff
closes out a town.

1004
01:46:04,176 --> 01:46:08,136
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

1005
01:46:08,496 --> 01:46:11,536
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

1006
01:46:12,736 --> 01:46:15,576
Extinguish the greatest
criminaI flame of our age?

1007
01:46:15,776 --> 01:46:18,376
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Kill him!

1008
01:46:19,216 --> 01:46:20,696
Superman's address?

1009
01:46:23,416 --> 01:46:24,896
Come!

1010
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:28,416
The three of us will crush...

1011
01:46:28,656 --> 01:46:30,656
...the son of our jailer.

1012
01:46:30,736 --> 01:46:33,176
Why not increase his handicap?

1013
01:46:33,816 --> 01:46:36,536
Since he cares so much
for these Earth creatures...

1014
01:46:36,976 --> 01:46:39,096
...let us take his favorite.

1015
01:47:33,656 --> 01:47:35,296
Ever heard of parachutes?

1016
01:47:40,656 --> 01:47:42,576
Another small step for mankind.

1017
01:47:44,176 --> 01:47:45,376
Scruffy.

1018
01:47:46,776 --> 01:47:48,256
So morbid.

1019
01:47:48,936 --> 01:47:52,216
A sentimental replica
of a planet long since vanished.

1020
01:47:53,656 --> 01:47:56,056
- No style at all.
- I expect...

1021
01:47:56,856 --> 01:47:58,696
...better manners from my guests.

1022
01:48:14,496 --> 01:48:16,136
We must combine our strength.

1023
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,936
Fools!

1024
01:48:42,456 --> 01:48:43,576
Take him!

1025
01:49:18,016 --> 01:49:20,856
We played this game at school.
Never was very good at it.

1026
01:49:22,656 --> 01:49:24,856
Superman, I knew that you'd...

1027
01:49:29,416 --> 01:49:31,016
Wrong again!

1028
01:49:34,256 --> 01:49:36,056
No, no!

1029
01:49:36,856 --> 01:49:38,016
Release the General...

1030
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,056
...or we'll tear her apart.

1031
01:49:40,096 --> 01:49:41,136
Superman, no!

1032
01:49:42,856 --> 01:49:44,056
Superman, don't!

1033
01:49:45,256 --> 01:49:45,976
All right!

1034
01:49:58,096 --> 01:50:01,136
Did you really think
we would give up our advantage?

1035
01:50:01,496 --> 01:50:02,576
Now...

1036
01:50:02,976 --> 01:50:05,216
...the son of Jor-El will be my slave.

1037
01:50:05,536 --> 01:50:06,256
Forever.

1038
01:50:07,016 --> 01:50:10,016
If not,
the millions of earthlings you protect...

1039
01:50:10,496 --> 01:50:12,616
...will pay for your defiance.

1040
01:50:13,096 --> 01:50:14,856
Destroy this place.

1041
01:50:15,056 --> 01:50:18,176
- Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- We have no more use for this one.

1042
01:50:18,536 --> 01:50:19,336
Kill him.

1043
01:50:19,776 --> 01:50:20,856
Me?

1044
01:50:24,776 --> 01:50:27,296
You came to me with nothing,
I gave you Superman.

1045
01:50:27,776 --> 01:50:28,816
Silence!

1046
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,416
<i>Well, look...</i>

1047
01:50:30,816 --> 01:50:32,816
Watch it. Don't touch me!

1048
01:50:35,136 --> 01:50:36,696
Guy's a clod.

1049
01:50:38,536 --> 01:50:40,776
Promises were made, gifts exchanged.

1050
01:50:41,256 --> 01:50:44,376
I got to hand it to you.
You always told the truth.

1051
01:50:44,776 --> 01:50:47,296
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

1052
01:50:50,056 --> 01:50:53,096
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber.

1053
01:50:53,936 --> 01:50:57,456
It takes away their powers, see,
and turns them into ordinary...

1054
01:50:57,616 --> 01:51:00,056
<i>...human beings. Now, if you could...</i>

1055
01:51:03,176 --> 01:51:04,656
Don't go in there, it's a trap!

1056
01:51:04,736 --> 01:51:06,216
You poisonous snake!

1057
01:51:06,816 --> 01:51:08,336
That's a molecule chamber.

1058
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:11,816
It makes people like you
into people like me.

1059
01:51:12,456 --> 01:51:13,896
You've done well.

1060
01:51:16,656 --> 01:51:19,456
The crystal there activates the mechanism.

1061
01:51:20,136 --> 01:51:22,656
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia.

1062
01:51:23,016 --> 01:51:24,656
Activate the machine!

1063
01:51:27,736 --> 01:51:28,856
Thank you.

1064
01:51:31,776 --> 01:51:33,536
With your permission.

1065
01:52:46,976 --> 01:52:48,016
And now...

1066
01:52:49,016 --> 01:52:50,016
...finally.

1067
01:53:00,576 --> 01:53:02,096
Take my hand...

1068
01:53:03,096 --> 01:53:08,056
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1069
01:53:47,976 --> 01:53:49,096
He switched it!

1070
01:53:49,576 --> 01:53:53,216
He did it to them!
I mean the lights were on out here...

1071
01:53:53,896 --> 01:53:55,496
...while he was safe in there!

1072
01:53:57,696 --> 01:53:59,256
You know, something?

1073
01:54:00,056 --> 01:54:02,136
You're a real pain in the neck!

1074
01:54:11,696 --> 01:54:13,776
Are you all right?

1075
01:54:14,816 --> 01:54:18,336
I knew you'd double-cross me.
A lying, weasel like you couldn't resist.

1076
01:54:19,896 --> 01:54:23,216
Are you kidding?
I was with you all the time.

1077
01:54:23,936 --> 01:54:25,096
That was beautiful.

1078
01:54:25,176 --> 01:54:27,376
Did you see the way they fell into our trap?

1079
01:54:27,736 --> 01:54:29,616
Too late!

1080
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:32,616
Look.

1081
01:54:33,456 --> 01:54:34,696
I got a proposition.

1082
01:54:35,456 --> 01:54:38,016
Don't stop me
until you've heard this because...

1083
01:54:38,616 --> 01:54:41,816
...I know I owe you one,
but we're in the north pole, right?

1084
01:54:42,576 --> 01:54:44,256
Let's wipe the slate clean.

1085
01:54:44,456 --> 01:54:48,096
<i>If you give me a ride back,
I promise to turn over a new leaf...</i>

1086
01:54:52,296 --> 01:54:54,776
It looks so beautiful from up here.

1087
01:54:55,736 --> 01:54:58,736
I guess I'll never get to fly
with you again.

1088
01:54:59,536 --> 01:55:01,936
No. Anywhere you want to go.

1089
01:55:02,856 --> 01:55:04,496
You don't have to worry.

1090
01:55:04,936 --> 01:55:07,296
I'll never tell them who you really are.

1091
01:55:07,856 --> 01:55:09,336
I know.

1092
01:55:24,256 --> 01:55:25,856
See you later.

1093
01:55:57,696 --> 01:55:58,896
Hi.

1094
01:56:26,336 --> 01:56:27,496
How did you sleep?

1095
01:56:30,896 --> 01:56:33,616
No. I didn't close my eyes all night.

1096
01:56:39,216 --> 01:56:42,296
- Look...
- I understand.

1097
01:56:44,976 --> 01:56:48,656
I sat up all night listening to
the voices of reason.

1098
01:56:49,736 --> 01:56:52,816
You know how vile it is to hear
the first bird of the morning...

1099
01:56:52,896 --> 01:56:54,936
...when you've been crying all night?

1100
01:56:55,056 --> 01:56:55,856
I'm sorry.

1101
01:56:56,856 --> 01:56:58,256
I'm sorry, too.

1102
01:56:59,456 --> 01:57:03,736
I guess it's sort of like being
married to a doctor, you know.

1103
01:57:04,296 --> 01:57:06,216
The doctor's awakened at night...

1104
01:57:06,296 --> 01:57:09,416
...and the wife has to cope with the fact
that he's gone.

1105
01:57:10,656 --> 01:57:12,256
I guess I'm just too selfish.

1106
01:57:13,256 --> 01:57:15,136
No. You're not selfish at all.

1107
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:17,696
I am selfish, when it comes to you.

1108
01:57:17,896 --> 01:57:19,376
I am selfish.

1109
01:57:20,056 --> 01:57:22,616
I'm jealous of the whole world.

1110
01:57:27,296 --> 01:57:31,696
It may not be easy for you
to hear this now, but someday you'll...

1111
01:57:36,136 --> 01:57:38,616
Don't tell me that I'll meet somebody.

1112
01:57:39,816 --> 01:57:43,176
You're kind of a tough act to follow,
you know?

1113
01:57:47,416 --> 01:57:50,296
I'm going to be fine,
you don't have to worry about me.

1114
01:57:55,296 --> 01:57:57,336
I like worrying about you.

1115
01:57:58,976 --> 01:58:00,656
Would you stop?

1116
01:58:01,496 --> 01:58:04,176
Don't you know that this is killing me?

1117
01:58:04,776 --> 01:58:08,616
Do you know what it's like
to have you come in here every morning...

1118
01:58:08,736 --> 01:58:11,176
...and not be able to talk to you?

1119
01:58:11,936 --> 01:58:15,256
Not be able to show
I have any feelings for you?

1120
01:58:15,776 --> 01:58:19,056
Not be able to tell anyone
that I know who you are.

1121
01:58:19,616 --> 01:58:22,136
I don't even know what to call you.

1122
01:58:26,256 --> 01:58:28,256
I don't know what to say.

1123
01:58:31,696 --> 01:58:34,296
I don't know. Say that you love me.

1124
01:59:22,736 --> 01:59:25,176
Gee, are you okay? What happened?

1125
01:59:25,496 --> 01:59:28,176
- You all right?
- I just got so dizzy.

1126
01:59:29,896 --> 01:59:32,816
That's what happens
when I don't have my orange juice.

1127
01:59:33,616 --> 01:59:36,296
- I'm fine.
- Breathe.

1128
01:59:36,376 --> 01:59:39,736
- I'm breathing, for heaven's sake.
- Good for you. Good.

1129
01:59:40,136 --> 01:59:42,056
- God.
- Just drink.

1130
01:59:42,456 --> 01:59:45,056
- Okay.
- Just sip it. Sip it. Sip it.

1131
01:59:45,136 --> 01:59:46,416
I'm fine.

1132
01:59:49,376 --> 01:59:51,216
What was I talking about before?

1133
01:59:51,456 --> 01:59:53,936
If I know you,
it was probably about Superman.

1134
01:59:54,496 --> 01:59:55,736
Him again?

1135
01:59:55,856 --> 02:00:00,576
You've got to stop being threatened
every time the guy's name's mentioned.

1136
02:00:00,616 --> 02:00:03,536
I mean, nobody expects you to be
anything but what you are.

1137
02:00:03,616 --> 02:00:05,016
I'll try to remember that.

1138
02:00:05,096 --> 02:00:07,816
You better remember that.
I appreciate you.

1139
02:00:07,896 --> 02:00:09,616
- You do?
- Sure.

1140
02:00:09,976 --> 02:00:12,176
Especially if you get me a hamburger.

1141
02:00:12,696 --> 02:00:16,056
<i>A hamburger. At 9:00 a. M.?</i>

1142
02:00:16,496 --> 02:00:18,256
Yeah, and everything on it, okay?

1143
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:19,936
Everything on it.

1144
02:00:20,976 --> 02:00:24,096
- And...
- Orange juice. Freshly squeezed.

1145
02:00:25,056 --> 02:00:26,816
Isn't he a nice guy?

1146
02:00:27,856 --> 02:00:31,056
Let's see what trouble I can get into today.

1147
02:00:35,216 --> 02:00:36,816
What's happening in the world?

1148
02:00:55,416 --> 02:00:57,376
Give me another plate of this garbage.

1149
02:00:57,576 --> 02:01:00,536
Garbage? That's my number one special!

1150
02:01:00,616 --> 02:01:03,856
All right!
Get me some more coffee too, will you?

1151
02:01:05,496 --> 02:01:09,296
Gee, that's funny.
I've never seen garbage eat garbage before.

1152
02:01:17,896 --> 02:01:20,816
Excuse me, sir.
I think you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1153
02:01:21,616 --> 02:01:23,096
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1154
02:01:27,936 --> 02:01:29,016
Now cool it!

1155
02:01:30,896 --> 02:01:31,896
Take it easy.

1156
02:01:31,976 --> 02:01:34,656
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1157
02:01:53,016 --> 02:01:54,016
God!

1158
02:02:06,016 --> 02:02:07,736
This order's to go.

1159
02:02:15,896 --> 02:02:18,896
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

1160
02:02:22,136 --> 02:02:23,456
I've been...

1161
02:02:24,136 --> 02:02:25,656
...working out.

1162
02:02:49,736 --> 02:02:51,576
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

1163
02:02:51,856 --> 02:02:53,696
Sorry I've been away so long.

1164
02:02:55,096 --> 02:02:57,216
I won't let you down again.
