1
00:00:01,038 --> 00:00:02,309
My name is Sara Lance.

2
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:05,407
Last year, a former Time Master
named Rip Hunter recruited

3
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:08,273
a team of heroes and villains
to save the world, and we did,

4
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:11,358
but in the process we
destroyed the Time Masters.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,126
Now we've taken up their mantle

6
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:15,696
of protecting the timeline
from time criminals.

7
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:18,031
We are no longer saving the world.

8
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:19,266
We are saving history.

9
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,769
But don't call us heroes.

10
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,539
We are legends.

11
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,607
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

12
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,042
Heywood. Dr. Nate Heywood.

13
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:31,278
I need to talk to you about
Sara Lance, Ray Palmer,

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,347
and the rest of the Legends.

15
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:34,581
I think they're all in trouble.

16
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,216
I am piloting us on a collision course

17
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:37,250
with a torpedo.

18
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:42,689
- Gideon.
- I'm here, Captain.

19
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:45,792
Where's Captain Hunter?

20
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:48,059
I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,563
Together, you are the best crew,

22
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:52,766
the best team a captain
could ever hope for.

23
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:53,800
Good luck.

24
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:56,336
What do you guys say we get out of 1942?

25
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,338
Not until you answer a few questions.

26
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:04,010
We're the Justice Society of America.

27
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:05,712
And you're coming with us.

28
00:01:05,714 --> 00:01:06,713
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:08,315
You're Commander Steel.

30
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:12,919
Who the hell are you?

31
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:14,354
- Whoa, whoa.
- Just relax.

32
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:15,689
We're all friends here.

33
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:17,357
Rex Tyler told us about the JSA.

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,558
You guys are awesome.

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,660
Hey. The name's Jax.

36
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,662
Rex never mentioned any of you.

37
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,964
Mind telling us what you were doing

38
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,098
impersonating OSS agents?

39
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,600
It's quite simple, actually.

40
00:01:26,602 --> 00:01:29,536
We were protecting Albert
Einstein from Nazi agents

41
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,271
who were attempting to kidnap him

42
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:33,673
and force him to build an atomic bomb

43
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,208
in the future.

44
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,310
Time travel. It's... it's hard to explain.

45
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:39,146
You can take all the time you need.

46
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:40,614
In custody.

47
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:43,517
Whoa, take it easy.
Let's talk for a minute.

48
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,651
I mean, after all, you're my...

49
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:54,461
Obsidian, shut off the lights!

50
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:58,732
Wow, that's pretty neat.

51
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,884
She's trying to kill us!

52
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:19,252
Nah, she's just flirting.

53
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:35,735
We don't want to fight!

54
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:51,017
You win!

55
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:22,992

56
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,488
You just had to mention
time travel, didn't you?

57
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,924
Yeah, well, at least he
didn't throw the first punch.

58
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:33,633
I'm perfectly capable of
defending myself, Raymond.

59
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,091
I'm pretty sure that you got knocked out

60
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:37,226
by a teenager in a star-spangled leotard.

61
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:38,561
Her name's Stargirl.

62
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:40,463
Did anybody catch her
regular-person name?

63
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:42,398
I'm surprised you
didn't ask for her number.

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,967
Oh, so it's my fault that
we got our asses handed to us?

65
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,903
Look, they're just better
coordinated than us.

66
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:48,071
You guys, just listen to me for two...

67
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:49,081
Pretty, shut up.

68
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,973
If I recall, you were late
coming to the party.

69
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,642
Oh, is that right? How did you see that?

70
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,744
Never laid eyes on
them before in my life.

71
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:57,647
They seemed quite
adamant that they knew you.

72
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:00,049
Believe me, if I'd met this bunch,

73
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,584
pretty sure I'd remember.

74
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:02,719
What do you propose we do with 'em?

75
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,687
If I may be so bold, sir,

76
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,322
I say we find the darkest hole

77
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:08,324
in Leavenworth and throw away the key.

78
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:12,095
I say we ship 'em to the boys in
Bellevue Mental Hospital.

79
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,664
I suppose before we do anything,

80
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,765
we ought to question them.

81
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,433
So far up Mr. Goggle's...

82
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,437
If we can even manage to get a word in.

83
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,572
I don't understand why they were

84
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,140
tracking us in the first place.

85
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:26,042
Because they're the
Justice Society of America,

86
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:28,911
the single greatest secret force
this country has ever known.

87
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:31,547
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

88
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:34,784
Because his Nazi handlers
have briefed him, no doubt.

89
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:37,487
Look, I'm not a Nazi.
I'm a historian.

90
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:39,956
Here we go with the time
travel nonsense again.

91
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,891
070233.

92
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:44,293
What?

93
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:46,729
Those are numbers on your dog tags.

94
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,331
They're not disclosed on any documents,

95
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,600
military or otherwise.

96
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:52,235
How do you know that?

97
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,610
You gave these to your wife

98
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:03,746
after the birth of your son in 1955.

99
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:06,015
The dent in the front was
from an assassin's bullet

100
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:09,152
when you saved President
Roosevelt in 1939.

101
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:12,588
Your son passed them down to his son,

102
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,357
me.

103
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:26,536
You are late, Herr Thawne.

104
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:28,070
You'll find that I have

105
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:32,074
an entirely different
concept of time than most.

106
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,409
Did you locate the item?

107
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:35,444
It's in Berlin.

108
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,547
The Fuehrer refuses to part with it.

109
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:40,883
I have something much
more valuable to offer him.

110
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:44,754
The JSA are basically a
group of super-soldiers.

111
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:48,891
To win, the Reich will need their own.

112
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,560
This is just a taste.

113
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:53,229
Enough to dose one person.

114
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,865
Proof of concept.

115
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:57,667
Give me what I want

116
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,536
and your Fuehrer
will be planting his flag

117
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:03,940
on the White House lawn
within a matter of months.

118
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:10,646
Do we have an accord?

119
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,286
Mr. Tyler.

120
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:18,955
See? Rex Tyler.

121
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:20,189
Told you we knew the guy.

122
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:21,524
I don't know you.

123
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:22,692
Any of you.

124
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:24,036
Tell me what the heck is going on here.

125
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:26,543
- Well, we tried explaining...
- I'm sorry, ma'am,

126
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:28,513
I was addressing the team leader.

127
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:29,514
Uh... uh... oh.

128
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:31,049
Oh, well, simply put,

129
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:33,218
we've come here as time travelers

130
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,421
to identify aberrations in
history and correct them.

131
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:37,922
We're superheroes, like you guys.

132
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:40,458
You think you're just like us?

133
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,126
What are your qualifications?

134
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:43,761
Well, I used my personal fortune

135
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:45,530
to create an advanced exo-skeleton,

136
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,232
which is powered by dwarf star alloy.

137
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:50,134
And I'm nothing like you. I'm a criminal.

138
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,737
Are there any other felons on your team?

139
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,205
- No, no...
- Yes.

140
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,875
She's an assassin,
but never convicted, right?

141
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:00,445
We're protecting history.
It's pretty important.

142
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,780
In the future, you risk your own life

143
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:05,783
to save us, Mr. Tyler.

144
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:07,285
How do you know my name?

145
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:09,287
Because you told us your name

146
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,322
in 2016.

147
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:13,424
My name is Rex Tyler,

148
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:16,361
and I'm a member of the
Justice Society of America.

149
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:18,196
Never heard of 'em, pal.

150
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,231
That's because I'm from 1942.

151
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,300
The same year in which all of you will...

152
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:23,901
Bite the bullet?

153
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,105
So if we don't go back to 1942,
we're safe, right?

154
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:28,373
Not to be rude,

155
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,708
but how do we know you
are who you say you are?

156
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,044
You all have no idea
what you're up against.

157
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:37,915
If you return to 1942,
the consequences will be

158
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,384
catastrophic.

159
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:45,423
That was weird.

160
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:51,262
So I crashed your ship,

161
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,898
told you some bunk about
not staying in 1942,

162
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,434
and then I just disappeared?

163
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:59,570
It was more like "fritzing" out.

164
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:00,638
You might've been on to something

165
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,006
with the Bellevue idea.

166
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:07,812
Yes, Mr. President, sir?

167
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:08,980
FDR?

168
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:12,817
Oh, tell him I'm a big
fan of the New Deal.

169
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,986
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about earlier.

170
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:16,421
I just, uh,

171
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:19,057
I never imagined meeting you like this.

172
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,059
I actually never imagined
meeting you at all

173
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:24,796
because you're dead.

174
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:28,199
I mean, where I come from,
you're... you're dead.

175
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:32,437
My dad used to tell me
bedtime stories about you.

176
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:35,606
All the battles you fought.

177
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:37,342
You're a hero to me.

178
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,677
I'm a hero to a lot of people.

179
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,979
That's the job.

180
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,215
Of course. All right.

181
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:46,784
You can count on us, sir.

182
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:48,186
All right, we have to move out.

183
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,021
Baron Krieger's been spotted in Paris.

184
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:51,489
If it's permissible, sir,

185
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,624
I'll fly ahead and record
Krieger's movements.

186
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,727
Sensible, as always.

187
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:58,796
We could help you out with that.

188
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,698
Fighting Nazis is kind of our thing.

189
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah. Last time we tried,

190
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:04,736
we ended up at the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean.

191
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:07,238
We can handle Adolf's buddies.

192
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,640
I think it's best for
the 20th Century if...

193
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:12,009
For us to leave it?

194
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,912
And that's why you're team leader.

195
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:17,982
Well, I guess we'll be on our way, then.

196
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,754
Can you believe what we
just saw with our own eyes?

197
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:24,055
The actual JSA.

198
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:26,524
And Hourman? That guy's amazing.

199
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:29,160
Aw, haircut's in love.

200
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:31,396
Come on.

201
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,531
Those guys were precise, professional,

202
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,832
in constant agreement.

203
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:35,933
We can't even agree on

204
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,368
whose turn it is to make dinner.

205
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,302
Not it.

206
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:39,937
I can't argue with you, man.

207
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,305
They got some serious skills.

208
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:42,573
Big deal.

209
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:45,643
Apart from the fancy
headquarters, discipline,

210
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:47,512
and calls from the White House,

211
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:49,680
I mean, what do they have that we don't?

212
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,582
An actual leader.

213
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:52,850
Rip's gone,

214
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:54,452
and who knows when or if

215
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:55,953
we'll ever find him.

216
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:57,321
In the meantime,

217
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:59,357
we need someone who can
make the tough calls.

218
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:01,692
Let me guess, you're volunteering?

219
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:03,127
With all due respect, Raymond,

220
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,263
I think there's a reason
Mr. Tyler just naturally

221
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:08,199
assumed I was in charge.

222
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:11,769
Yeah, because Mr. Tyler is from 1942

223
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,472
and you're some old white dude.

224
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:16,274
"Old," meaning

225
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:17,542
experienced.

226
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:19,510
- What about...
- Martin's right.

227
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,380
With Rip gone, we could use
some adult supervision.

228
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:24,148
Congratulations,

229
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,417
Captain.

230
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,885
Well, then.

231
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:29,520
Thank you all for your support.

232
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,589
Now, I believe our first order of business

233
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,759
concerns Dr. Heywood.

234
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:43,000
Is that Grandpa?

235
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:44,535
Yeah.

236
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:46,070
Pictures of him are hard to find.

237
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:47,438
You just got to know where to look.

238
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,006
Well, that must've been something,

239
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:51,843
getting the chance to meet him.

240
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:53,211
You would think so, right?

241
00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:56,647
But... I don't know.

242
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,484
Felt empty somehow.

243
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:02,420
Well, meeting your idols usually does.

244
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:03,888
Think of it this way.

245
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,923
You are gonna have one hell of a story

246
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,192
to tell your friends when
you get back home.

247
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:11,095
Back home? 2016 back home?

248
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:12,497
You can't cut me from the team.

249
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:13,698
Well, you're right,

250
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,267
because you're not a member of it.

251
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,971
And even if you were,
history can be dangerous,

252
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:21,372
and it's no place for a...

253
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:22,507
A historian?

254
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:25,610
I'm more than...

255
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:26,711
that's weird.

256
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:28,012
It's really not so weird.

257
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,146
You don't have any superpowers.

258
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,414
You don't even have training...

259
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,184
Not that. My grandfather's dog tags.

260
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:34,652
They aren't around my neck.

261
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:36,153
So?

262
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,588
So I haven't taken
'em off since I was a kid.

263
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,790
They were here a minute ago,
and now they've...

264
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,492
Vanished.

265
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:42,994
What does that mean?

266
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,829
That history has changed.

267
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,967
What are you doing?

268
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:53,104
Reviewing my notes on the JSA.

269
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,775
We have to go back to 1942.

270
00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:00,011
Nate, the JSA was pretty explicit

271
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:02,346
on us not going back to 1942.

272
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:03,848
That mission the JSA went on

273
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,518
to track down Baron Krieger in Paris,

274
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,353
they're all gonna die there tomorrow.

275
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,391
My grandfather too.

276
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,770
_

277
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,248
And this is where the JSA's gonna die?

278
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,349
Not unless we save them,

279
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,285
including my grandfather.

280
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,020
Well, first we got to find them.

281
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,922
Fortunately, we know they're looking for

282
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:31,558
a Nazi named Krieger.

283
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,992
A Nazi named Krieger...

284
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:34,594
can someone please help
me operate this thing?

285
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:35,695
Oh, God.

286
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:36,896
Thank you.

287
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:39,666
Krieger and his men
frequent Folies-BergÃ¨re.

288
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:42,435
We find Krieger, we find the JSA.

289
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:45,371
So how do we sneak into a Nazi nightclub?

290
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,474
I have a plan.

291
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,776
Are any of you familiar
with Max Suelzenfuss,

292
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,778
better known by his stage name,

293
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,179
Max Lorenz?

294
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:55,982
He was Hitler's favorite
singer and, fortunately,

295
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:00,153
bears a passing resemblance to moi.

296
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,588
That's French.

297
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,989
Hm.

298
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,791
Grey.

299
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:06,259
Are you sure about this?

300
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,994
'Cause bluffing at a
card game isn't exactly

301
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,529
the same as bluffing Nazis.

302
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,331
You disapprove of my plan?

303
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,799
I'm just saying, we're
dropping into the middle

304
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,201
of World War II here,
and you're not exactly

305
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:17,303
a wartime consigliere.

306
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:19,772
- And let me guess, you are?
- I...

307
00:13:19,774 --> 00:13:23,109
Or perhaps you would prefer
the arsonist, the assassin,

308
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,044
or the incredible shrinking man?

309
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:26,446
I'm just saying,

310
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:29,149
you're smart and analytical and stuff,

311
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:30,550
and real deliberate,

312
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:32,218
but when bullets start flying,

313
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,820
analytical's not gonna cut it.

314
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:36,022
Well, thank you for pointing
out my inadequacies.

315
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,090
Come on, Grey.

316
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:40,426
It's Captain Grey now.

317
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,462
Well, I'm glad it hasn't
gone to your head.

318
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,301
Ouch. Where'd you get that?

319
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:49,969
Uh, it must have happened

320
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:53,072
when I fell after my
grandfather decked me.

321
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:55,341
Hey, that fabrication room's pretty cool.

322
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:57,577
Can it really make clothes from any era?

323
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,312
Yeah, you know, we may not have trophies

324
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,047
or framed letters from former presidents,

325
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,650
but we've got a few cool toys.

326
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:06,719
Including ingestible translator.

327
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,820
Swallow this,

328
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:09,389
you'll be able to speak and understand

329
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,224
any language spoken to you.

330
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,692
That's cool, but I already speak

331
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:15,929
German, French, Japanese,
Italian, and Latin.

332
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:17,130
What?

333
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:18,932
You speak six different languages;

334
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,667
you have a tendency to
run towards danger;

335
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:23,403
and you're related to
a member of the JSA.

336
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,238
Why did you become a historian?

337
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,839
It's a long story.

338
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,007
Um, hey, where do I go

339
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,643
to get a gun?

340
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,212
You ever shoot someone before?

341
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:33,846
I mean, I may not be trained by

342
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:35,148
the League of Assassins,

343
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,916
but I can take care of myself.

344
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,551
Not out here you can't.

345
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:40,453
Out here, even the strongest

346
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,222
and the bravest of us die.

347
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:45,825
Like Captain Hunter?

348
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:48,528
I'm just trying to make sure
you get home safe and sound.

349
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,966
So the lady does have a heart.

350
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,567
Don't tell anyone.

351
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,509
Excuse me...

352
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:07,013
The club is closed tonight
for a private function.

353
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:10,083
Do you have any idea who I am?

354
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:13,086
I am Max Lorenz.

355
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,687
- Did you say Max Lorenz?
- Yes.

356
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:18,091
And I have never been
treated with such rudeness.

357
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:19,325
Of course not.

358
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,761
You're more than welcome here, Herr Max.

359
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:23,563
Thank you.

360
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,318
No sign of Krieger or the JSA.

361
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,654
Canvass the area and stay on the comms.

362
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:51,671
Think I got something.

363
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:53,573
The lady with the animal powers.

364
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:56,276
But she looks different.

365
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:57,978
You mean hot.

366
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:03,650
May I?

367
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:07,687
What are you doing?

368
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:09,322
I'm on a covert mission.

369
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:10,857
Not for long.

370
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:14,194
You and your team are all 24
hours away from being killed.

371
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:15,529
What are you talking about?

372
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:18,331
I'm a time traveler, remember?

373
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,866
Something changes in the future,

374
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:22,969
and you all die.

375
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,404
But if we do,

376
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:27,641
how do you know it's not
because of your team?

377
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:30,143
Hadn't thought of that.

378
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:31,645
Look who I found,

379
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:33,046
and she's thrilled
we've offered our help.

380
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:35,415
Herr Lorenz, I must introduce you

381
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:38,018
to General Gerd von Rundstedt.

382
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,985
He's a huge fan.

383
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:41,154
Oh, lovely to meet you, General.

384
00:16:41,156 --> 00:16:43,790
You are Max Lorenz?

385
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:46,726
Lorenz is well over 6 feet tall.

386
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:47,794
Ah.

387
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:50,764
My towering voice often causes people

388
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:53,867
to overestimate my height.

389
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,470
Perhaps you will treat us
to a song, Mr. Lorenz?

390
00:16:57,472 --> 00:16:59,339
Maxie has a concert tomorrow night

391
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:02,042
and needs to rest his pipes.

392
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:04,444
I insist, Fraulein.

393
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:07,414
And, uh, please,

394
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,050
no Negro music.

395
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:11,117
- I sw...
- Mm,

396
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,552
not worth it.

397
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:15,088
It'd be a little worth it.

398
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,125
Heads up. Baron Krieger just arrived.

399
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:21,995
Is this on?

400
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:25,298
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

401
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,834
My name is Max Lorenz,

402
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:30,303
and, uh, this little waltz

403
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,805
I am about to sing for you

404
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,673
is an original song.

405
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:36,409
Uh, very popular in Austria

406
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,812
where... where the hills are alive

407
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:41,615
with the sound of music.

408
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,250
Key of A.

409
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:45,352
Watch me for the changes

410
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,053
and try to keep up.

411
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:52,092
One, two, three. One, two, three.

412
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:03,403
♪ Edelweiss, Edelweiss ♪

413
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:06,272

418
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:24,090
No, no, Herr Krieger, please.

419
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:27,661
The Askaran Amulet is
not degenerate artwork.

420
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:29,562
It is a masterpiece.

421
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:31,364
Which you will help my men transport

422
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:34,801
to the exchange tomorrow at 01000.

423
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:38,171
Refusing would meet with
the Fuehrer's disapproval.

424
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:39,673
♪ Edelweiss ♪

425
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:41,007
I know the Baron's plan.

426
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,409
Let's get out of here.

427
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:45,445
Hey.

428
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:49,516

429
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:56,356

Heil Hitler!

431
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,466
Heil Hitler!

432
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:10,770
You did not salute the Fuehrer.

433
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:12,272
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.

434
00:19:12,274 --> 00:19:14,374
I'm all about saluting the Fuehrer.

435
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:15,709
You're lying.

436
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:17,577
I was watching you the entire time.

437
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:19,625
Uh, you know what? I... I just...

438
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,447
I have a little crick in my neck,

439
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:24,117
and it's really hard for
me to straighten my arm.

440
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,120
Heil Hitler.

441
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,988
Heil Hitler!

442
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,258
H...

443
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,593
h...

444
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:35,495
Ha...

445
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:37,230
Ha... aw, hell.

446
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:40,533
Why do you get to punch him?

447
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:45,305
Protect Max Lorenz!

448
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:12,532
What the hell are you doing here?

449
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:16,002
We came back to...

450
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:17,270
to rescue you.

451
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:29,654
If we're meant to be impressed
by all this technology,

452
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,830
it has the opposite effect.

453
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:33,732
It only makes you that
much more dangerous.

454
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,633
Well, and there's evidence
to support that,

455
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,068
but I think what's important now

456
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,570
is for all us to stop arguing.

457
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,171
Does your team ever stop arguing?

458
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,506
Fair point.

459
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,274
I think what Martin is trying to say

460
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,343
is we're gonna help you
whether you like it or not.

461
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,145
You're going after Krieger.

462
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:48,813
We know where he's going next.

463
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,649
And given the laws of
temporal mechanics,

464
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,851
if you die,

465
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,552
your grandson ceases to exist.

466
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,154
Well, I don't pretend
to understand any of

467
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:59,290
this time travel bunk,
but these fellas do have a timeship.

468
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,759
Might come in handy.

469
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,161
And having them as our
back-up might be the only way

470
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,896
to keep them out of trouble.

471
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:06,031
Let's put it to a vote, then.

472
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:11,503
The ayes have it.

473
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:16,074
Did your reconnaissance at the
club yield any usable intel?

474
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,275
Only to map the area.

475
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,843
Bringing one online now.

476
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,278
- What was that?
- AI.

477
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,980
A talking computer.

478
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:23,314
What's a computer?

479
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,916
There. The Fontainebleau Forest.

480
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:27,385
Now, I saw a few of Krieger's
men studying a map of it.

481
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,887
That must be where Krieger's planning on

482
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,255
making the exchange.

483
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:32,424
Nate overheard Krieger talking about

484
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:33,691
making a trade for something

485
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,326
called an Askaran Amulet.

486
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,728
Hitler has long amassed

487
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,396
ancient artifacts such as this one.

488
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,998
He may want the amulet
because it conveys

489
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,533
some sort of occult power.

490
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:43,201
Our objective should
be to take out the Baron

491
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:44,836
and stop this exchange at all costs.

492
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:48,006
I propose we survey all
military activity in the area

493
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:49,541
to learn what we're up against.

494
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:50,708
We don't have time for that.

495
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,743
I concur.

496
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:52,981
We should have both teams gear up while

497
00:21:52,982 --> 00:21:54,612
Dr. Stein and I finalize the details.

498
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,449
Be ready to go at first light.

499
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,588
How are things with your grandfather?

500
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,824
You know, I think he's
avoiding me for some reason.

501
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,359
Well, it's hard for people
to look at their future.

502
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,361
Maybe.

503
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,766
Oh, one of the Nazis at
the club had a knife.

504
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:17,469
Well, that should have
stopped bleeding by now.

505
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,704
I'm just gonna get a new bandage.

506
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,774
To go with your bruise?

507
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:25,677
Well, you know how fragile
we historians can be.

508
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,312
This isn't fragility.

509
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:30,682
I know my cuts and bruises.

510
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,584
You're a hemophiliac.

511
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,686
Your blood doesn't clot,
wounds can't heal,

512
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,754
and if it's bad, you can bleed to death.

513
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,490
Yeah, well, you don't have
to worry about that.

514
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:39,390
Too late.

515
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,059
You could've died tonight.

516
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:42,827
But I didn't. In fact,
it was the opposite.

517
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,163
I never felt more alive.

518
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,465
Look, when I was five years
old, I cut my knee,

519
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:50,368
and my mother wouldn't let me
out of the house till I was 16.

520
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,171
I'm a grown man.
I can make my own decisions.

521
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:54,739
- Not on this ship, you can't.
- Sara...

522
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,142
Look, I cannot let you
go out there tomorrow,

523
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:58,943
knowing that you could get killed.

524
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,846
I have enough deaths on
my conscience as it is.

525
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:05,550
Look, I know you don't think
I can add anything to this team,

526
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,019
but out there? Out there is history.

527
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:10,788
And nobody knows more about it than me.

528
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,994
Well, we've been managing
just fine without you.

529
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:17,395
Mostly fine.

530
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,302
Your suit looks a bit cumbersome.

531
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:27,472
Oh, actually, I made it
to fit me perfectly.

532
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,607
It's constructed out
of a proprietary alloy,

533
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,443
and it's been battle-tested quite a bit.

534
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,879
I even wore it in space once.

535
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,247
Personal highlight.

536
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,882
So your superpower is

537
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,084
wearing the suit?

538
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,619
Yeah, I guess so,

539
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:45,523
it's a little more complicated
than that, but yeah.

540
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,958
You're still mad at me for punching out

541
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,493
that Nazi in the club, huh?

542
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:51,362
I'm mad because you blew my cover.

543
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:55,366
I'll never be able to go
undercover in Paris ever again.

544
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:58,269
Yeah, sorry, I didn't think about that.

545
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,972
I imagine that's a pattern
with you and your group.

546
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:02,373
But I can't dwell on it.

547
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,008
Getting stuck on past mistakes

548
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,377
only takes focus off the
primary goal at hand.

549
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,446
Well, I got to admit,
watching your team work

550
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,748
like a well-oiled machine
kind of makes me feel

551
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,184
like I'm doing this
whole hero thing wrong.

552
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:15,720
If it's any consolation, Dr. Palmer,

553
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,689
you're not really a hero.

554
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,325
We better get ready.

555
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,769
We've spotted the Baron's caravan.

556
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:32,770
ETA five minutes.

557
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,705
I've got eyes on the Baron.

558
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,415
What the hell's going on down there?

559
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,150
Animal Girl and I are
going after Krieger.

560
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,386
In the field, I'm called Vixen.

561
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:22,420
Negative, Raymond.

562
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:24,622
Our target is the convoy.

563
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:27,158
We've got the convoy
covered. Pursue the Baron.

564
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:33,031
The mission is the amulet.

565
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,198
Our mission is Krieger.

566
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,533
We don't have time for this.

567
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,168
Give me a moment. I... I...

568
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,336
need to assess the situation.

569
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,471
Krieger's getting away, man.

570
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:01,359
What the hell was that?

571
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:06,764
We're under attack.

572
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,333
It's Krieger! He turned into a...

573
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:09,834
We need backup!

574
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,938
Dr. Palmer? Vixen? Do you read?

575
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,473
Their comms are down.

576
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:16,941
Oh, my God.

577
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:32,857
I've got the amulet.

578
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:33,891
Good work.

579
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,393
Dr. Mid-Nite, Stargirl,

580
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:37,595
Vixen and Dr. Palmer need assistance.

581
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,663
Copy that.

582
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,365
But I think we have a new problem.

583
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,176
Grey, you got to get 'em out of there!

584
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,478
I just need a minute.

585
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,985
Come on, Grey! Do something!

586
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,687
Uh...

587
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,622
Fall back. Get Obsidian.

588
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,924
Mick, lay down fire to cover our retreat.

589
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:10,661
Now you're talking.

590
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,866
Mick! Come on!

591
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:17,468
Uh... Commander Steel, do...
do you still have the amulet?

592
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,404
Yes, sir! En route to your position.

593
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,905
What about Ray and Amaya?

594
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:22,039
You just can't leave 'em there.

595
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,408
Nor can we engage this super-Nazi.

596
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,343
Not without compiling
more information first.

597
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:27,078
This is not a science debate, Grey!

598
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,414
Damn it! Jefferson, I know that!

599
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,916
But for now, they're on their own.

600
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,582
I must admit, it's a feat of engineering.

601
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:48,717
Far beyond anything I have ever seen

602
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:52,621
or expected from you Americans.

603
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:54,056
Well, maybe you Germans

604
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:55,925
should just stick to your luxury cars.

605
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:58,561
Why should I fear a robot suit

606
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:00,796
when I have become der Ubermensch?

607
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:02,631
You really think a single case

608
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:05,267
of 'roid rage is gonna win you the war?

609
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,269
Yeah.

610
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,405
Once I have replicated the super-serum

611
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:11,607
for the entire Wehrmacht.

612
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:13,642
But you haven't replicated the...

613
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:15,711
what'd you call it? Super-serum?

614
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:17,213
Kind of on the nose, don't you think?

615
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:19,682
If all this is just a
preamble to you killing us,

616
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:21,083
get it over with.

617
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:26,622
I was hoping to torture
you a little bit first,

618
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:28,357
but since you're in such a rush,

619
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,725
I will be glad to accommodate you

620
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,026
with your schedule.

621
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,194
Wait, wait.

622
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:33,395
I'm a scientist.

623
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:35,731
That exo-suit? I invented it.

624
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:38,467
I can help you with your little
supply and demand problem.

625
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,002
I'll even improve it.

626
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:42,338
Just don't shoot her.

627
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:49,211
I hope you are as
smart as you say you are,

628
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:51,413
for her sake.

629
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:59,788
You know he's gonna kill us both

630
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,791
even if you help him.

631
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,193
I have a plan.

632
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:06,929
That's what I'm afraid of.

633
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,231
We have the amulet. Now what?

634
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,934
First priority is making
sure Ray and Amaya are alive,

635
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:13,602
and then getting them out of the bunker

636
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,070
where the Nazis are holding them.

637
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:16,872
Actually, our first priority
is destroying the Baron

638
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:19,308
and whatever serum is
making him indestructible.

639
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,843
Perhaps we could propose a trade.

640
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:22,645
Their lives for the Amulet.

641
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:24,280
Unfortunately, the amulet's
not ours to barter with.

642
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:26,048
We need an extraction plan.

643
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,917
We need to eliminate the threat.

644
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,685
Now, Professor Stein, please, tell us,

645
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,854
what is your plan of action?

646
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:33,689
How... how am I supposed
to come up with a plan

647
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:37,693
when I can't even hear myself think?

648
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:39,562
Would... would you please all just leave?

649
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:42,698
I... I need a moment
to collect my thoughts.

650
00:29:50,473 --> 00:29:51,941
What the hell, Grey?

651
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:54,343
I can practically feel you
going crazy inside my head.

652
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:55,644
I'm fine,

653
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:57,246
Jefferson, I'm trying to determine

654
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:58,480
the best course of action.

655
00:29:58,482 --> 00:29:59,715
I wouldn't believe that even if

656
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:01,283
we didn't have a psychic connection,

657
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:03,719
which... hold on... we do.

658
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:07,356
I just don't know how Rip
was able to do all this.

659
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:10,225
So many decisions to make,
consequences to manage,

660
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:11,701
opinions to consider.

661
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,957
Trying to reach a
consensus with this team

662
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:16,133
is like something akin to chaos theory.

663
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:17,121
That's the thing, Grey.

664
00:30:17,123 --> 00:30:19,089
We don't need someone
to reach a consensus.

665
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:21,158
We just need someone
who can call the shots.

666
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,127
Then you should have put a tactician,

667
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,429
not a theoretician, in charge.

668
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:27,698
You were right, Jefferson.

669
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,934
I'm not a wartime consigliere.

670
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:40,377
Are they gonna be okay?

671
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,346
They'll live to fight another day.

672
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:44,748
It's what we do.

673
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,717
I used to fantasize about meeting you.

674
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:51,388
Trading stories or having a beer.

675
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:55,793
Or just making eye contact.

676
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:59,129
I'm sorry, I, uh,

677
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:03,000
I guess back at, uh, headquarters,

678
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:05,169
I was afraid to get too close to you.

679
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:07,204
Why? You're my grandfather.

680
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:09,540
You're... you're more than that.
You're a hero to me.

681
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,975
I don't want to be anyone's hero.

682
00:31:11,977 --> 00:31:14,278
That look you gave me
when we first met,

683
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,480
I've seen it before,

684
00:31:16,482 --> 00:31:19,049
when people look up to me,

685
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:20,884
decide that they have
to act a certain way,

686
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:23,587
a way that's likely to get them killed.

687
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:28,559
I do what I do

688
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,694
so that others don't have to.

689
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:32,129
So you wouldn't have to.

690
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:33,864
My whole life, people
have been trying to

691
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:38,602
shield me from the
world, your son included.

692
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:43,640
Meanwhile, all I ever wanted
to be was a soldier, like you.

693
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:45,642
It's a parent's job

694
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:47,644
to protect their child,

695
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:49,513
but it's a child's obligation
to themselves

696
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:51,715
to live their own life.

697
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:53,817
You can and should

698
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:56,820
do whatever you set your mind to.

699
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:02,793
But you should know,

700
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,394
you don't have to be a soldier

701
00:32:04,396 --> 00:32:07,030
to be a hero.

702
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:12,970
And we approach from the southwest,

703
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,205
destroy the weapons lab
and the Baron in one move.

704
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:16,740
Except for the last time we faced him,

705
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:18,041
he took out both of our teams.

706
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:19,376
The last time, we weren't being backed

707
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:20,944
by a squadron of B-17s.

708
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:22,546
Then how do we get Ray and Amaya out

709
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:24,148
before the bombs start falling?

710
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,382
We don't.

711
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,019
This conflict is bigger
than any one of us.

712
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:30,954
If it means ending the
war one day sooner,

713
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:33,357
Amaya would happily make that sacrifice.

714
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,092
But she doesn't have to.

715
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:37,227
Look, I know you and your team think

716
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:39,396
we're a group of irresponsible losers,

717
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:40,697
but I know Ray Palmer,

718
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:42,933
and he has a plan to
get out of that bunker.

719
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:44,604
We just need to give him time...

720
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:46,703
Which means giving the Nazis time.

721
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:48,572
I'm calling in the strike.

722
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:49,807
I can't let you do that.

723
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:51,408
You don't have the authority.

724
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,878
Yes, she does.

725
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,814
Miss Lance speaks for all of us.

726
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:58,816
I have watched her
become the beating heart

727
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:01,585
and steady hand of this team.

728
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:04,688
She is the proper person to lead us.

729
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,789
And if she says that we are

730
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:08,559
going to rescue our people,

731
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:10,928
that is what we are going to do.

732
00:33:20,257 --> 00:33:23,191
This would go a lot faster
if I wasn't handcuffed.

733
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:24,659
I mean, what do you
think, I'm gonna escape

734
00:33:24,661 --> 00:33:27,295
using a microscope?

735
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,899
Are you going to make more serum,

736
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:33,268
or is your friend going to die?

737
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,370
First off, it's not a serum.

738
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:37,405
It's a biomolecular enhancer.

739
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:38,573
By the way, who gave you this?

740
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:40,675
Because from an engineering standpoint,

741
00:33:40,677 --> 00:33:42,077
it's really rather ama...

742
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,679
Yes. I can make more.

743
00:33:44,681 --> 00:33:47,849
Ray, don't do it.

744
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:48,950
Don't help him.

745
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:57,592
Back to work.

746
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:07,836
Watch them.

747
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,504
How can you do this?

748
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:13,141
No member of the JSA
would ever help the Nazis.

749
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:15,677
Neither would a Legend.

750
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,785
Damn, I really wanted to do
it with just the microscope.

751
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:25,020
Get the handcuff keys.

752
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:30,225
Alpha-stabilizer's damaged.

753
00:34:30,227 --> 00:34:31,793
Suit's not gonna work.

754
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:35,330
They took my amulet.

755
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:37,098
And without it,
I'm guessing you're just...

756
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,299
A 5th-degree black belt,

757
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:40,035
with training in edged weapons combat.

758
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,736
Nice, but

759
00:34:41,738 --> 00:34:44,239
I think we'll need more than
that to get past super-Krieger.

760
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:45,407
What are you doing?

761
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:47,075
I told you I had a plan.

762
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:49,344
It was to get my hands on this

763
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:52,013
and enhance it, but not for them.

764
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:54,249
I'm not only a man in a metal suit.

765
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:56,251
At least not after this.

766
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,156
We are under attack.

767
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:03,091
Baron Krieger has ordered
us to transport you

768
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:04,759
to a more secure location.

769
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:06,227
Who's attacking you?

770
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,396
Sir, the sentries are reporting

771
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,498
a man made of fire flying
through the forest.

772
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,468
Lock down the base.

773
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,569
Now.

774
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:41,029
Firestorm is drawing the
troops away from the bunker.

775
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:42,297
Copy that.

776
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:44,933
We still need to find Ray and Amaya.

777
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:48,937
Mick, look out!

778
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,309
Thanks, Haircut.

779
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:57,112
I believe this belongs to you.

780
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:02,083
Steel, Mid-Nite, we've
recovered the rest of the team.

781
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,621
I suggest you save the
teary reunion for later.

782
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,990
Hourman ordered the bombers to strike.

783
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:10,725
They're five minutes out.

784
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:16,231
But Herr Krieger is here right now!

785
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:29,077
Come on, you Nazi bastard.

786
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:49,197
- Get on!
- What are you doing here?

787
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,332
Saving you! Get on!

788
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:07,815
Bombing run about to commence.

789
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:09,217
All points, get clear.

790
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:10,785
Working on it!

791
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:27,135
What was that?

792
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:28,503
He's dead.

793
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:31,206
You did it. You saved us!

794
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,345
I'm afraid Mr. Heywood's
vitals are dropping.

795
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:53,530
There's got to be something on board
this tub to get him back on his feet.

796
00:37:53,531 --> 00:37:55,137
You people are from the future,
for God's sake!

797
00:37:55,138 --> 00:37:57,565
The bomb blast caused
massive internal bleeding,

798
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,907
and because his body lacks
the normal clotting factor,

799
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:01,642
there's only so much Gideon can do!

800
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,313
Were you two close?

801
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:08,149
No, not really,

802
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:09,683
but if it wasn't for Nate,
I'd still be trapped

803
00:38:09,685 --> 00:38:10,951
in the Cretaceous period,

804
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:14,321
being chased by a T. rex.

805
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:15,856
I'm sorry.

806
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:18,359
This is our fight, not yours.

807
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:20,494
- The Nazis are not...
- Nazis.

808
00:38:20,496 --> 00:38:22,730
Nazis.

809
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:23,898
You kept the serum?

810
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,399
There may be enough.

811
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:29,837
I think I can save him, with this.

812
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,639
Is that the Nazi serum that created

813
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,908
that hideous berserker? Are you mad?

814
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,776
I did a little tinkering
to the formula, so...

815
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:37,311
So what will it do now?

816
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:39,380
With any luck, save his life.

817
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:41,248
How do we know if it's working?

818
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,317
He's not dead yet, so that's a good sign.

819
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:45,819
And he's not turning
into a Nazi berserker.

820
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,455
His vitals are improving.

821
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,293
He's stabilizing.

822
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:59,967
What'd the Nazis want with
a piece of jewelry anyway?

823
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,268
No idea.

824
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,438
Hitler's known to be
obsessed with the strange.

825
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,106
We'll keep it safe, in any case.

826
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:08,909
I guess that's your
way of saying thanks.

827
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:11,111
Right, well, I think it's time

828
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:13,214
we got out of 1942.

829
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:14,548
This was fun.

830
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,085
It was unusual.

831
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:19,520
Hey,

832
00:39:19,522 --> 00:39:20,788
I wanted to

833
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,724
apologize for what I said.

834
00:39:23,726 --> 00:39:25,726
About me not being a hero?

835
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:27,695
You're not a superhero,

836
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:30,297
but what you did for Nate,

837
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:31,465
giving him the serum,

838
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:34,401
giving up your chance at real powers,

839
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:35,803
that was heroic.

840
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:46,947
Oh, it's about time, Sleeping Beauty.

841
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,716
I was afraid you wouldn't wake up in time

842
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:49,984
for me to say good-bye.

843
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:53,087
And here I was afraid

844
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:56,290
I wasn't gonna wake up at all.

845
00:39:56,292 --> 00:39:57,791
I was afraid of that too.

846
00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:02,596
I'm sorry if I didn't

847
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:05,165
live up to the version
of Commander Steel

848
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:08,168
you dreamt of meeting.

849
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,671
Nah, I like the real version better.

850
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:15,242
Well, I'll be damned.

851
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:23,517
Guess this means we're
both gonna make it.

852
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,287
Not bad for a historian.

853
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:28,222
Not bad for a hero.

854
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:45,806
Hello, Rex.

855
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:46,774
Who are you?

856
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,075
Oh, we've met before.

857
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:49,877
Quite a number of times, actually.

858
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:52,413
In fact, after our last go,
you discovered my plan

859
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:54,214
and then traveled through time yourself

860
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:56,116
to stop the Legends from coming here.

861
00:40:56,118 --> 00:40:58,485
They... they said I disappeared.

862
00:40:58,487 --> 00:40:59,987
Not disappeared.

863
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:00,821
No.

864
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:02,823
Erased from the timeline.

865
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:05,526
Like this.

866
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:07,127
No.

867
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:16,637
Rex?

868
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,297
Rex?

869
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:21,642
Rex.

870
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,378
Rex, no.

871
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,047
Time...

872
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:29,283
time traveler.

873
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:31,552
No.

874
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:32,920
Rex.

875
00:41:39,187 --> 00:41:44,146
