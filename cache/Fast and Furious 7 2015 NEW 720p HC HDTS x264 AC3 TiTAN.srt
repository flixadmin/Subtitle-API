LONDON, ENGLAND

3
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,799
They say if you want a glimpse of the future...

4
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:55,454
Just look behind you.

5
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:59,061
I used to think that was bollocks.

6
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:02,349
Now I realize...

7
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,567
you can't outrun the past.

8
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,061
When we were kids...

9
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:18,745
You'd start fights with the toughest bastards in the yard.

10
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:20,960
But I was the one...

11
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:23,334
who were to step in and finish them.

12
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:25,623
Rest now, little brother.

13
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,317
While I settle your one last score.

14
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,473
Take care of my brother.

15
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:39,367
Anything happens to him...

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,295
I'll come back looking for you.

17
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:05,317
Here.

18
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:06,317
Hold this.

19
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:05,110
<b>FAST & FURIOUS 7</b>

20
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,491
Come on, Dom, so where are you taking me?

21
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:17,457
They say an open road helps you think...

22
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:20,062
about where you've been...

23
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:22,057
where you're going.

24
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,750
So you don't remember any of this yet?

25
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:28,437
It's not fair.

26
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:30,602
You know I don't.

27
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:38,206
So what is it exactly that you're trying to show me?

28
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,524
That.

29
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:46,522
Race Wars.

30
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,764
We used to come here?

31
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,296
"Come here"?

32
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:52,961
We invented it.

33

RACE WARS

34
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,247
Keep it under 9000 rpms.

35
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:40,629
Kid's gonna fire his pistons after the first 200.

36
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:44,262
You know that's not my style, I got to ride or die, right?

37
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:48,249
How about you just ride on this one.

38
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:07,999
Are you ready?

39
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,872
I know you're ready!

40
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,175
Go!

41
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,185
Nice job!

42
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:17,781
Hey!

43
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,538
That's the girl I heard so much about.

44
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,882
Where you been at, ghost girl?

45
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:27,863
That's the girl...

46
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:30,713
Ghost girl...

47
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:41,053
Letty, what the hell?

48
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:50,577
Damn, Dom! Your girl's still got that swing, homie.

49
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,187
You never could take a punch.

50
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,158
Right, right.

51
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,108
Hey, man, I'm glad you're back, man. It's good to see you.

52
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,204
Good to see you, Hektor.

53
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:23,961
Alright. We made it, Jack.

54
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:26,346
- Yeah, we made it! - Yeah, we made it.

55
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,261
I just gotta, find that door button.

56
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:29,956
Buddy where's the door button at? Do you know?

57
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,004
- Hey. - Hey.

58
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,119
Yeah, of course.

59
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:35,865
I'm new to this.

60
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,658
Yeah, you don't seem like the minivan type.

61
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:38,430
No, not exactly.

62
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,452
Hey buddy you didn't give me a high-five? Wait, wait, wait.

63
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:42,259
High-five! All right! Yeah, buddy.

64
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:43,848
Appreciate it, thank you.

65
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,668
Don't worry, you'll get used to this in no time.

66
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,332
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

67
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:23,494
First time I saw this...

68
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,918
I thought it was kind of funny.

69
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:33,479
I guess now, the joke's on me.

70
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,366
What are you doing?

71
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:40,004
What I should've done a long time ago.

72
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:42,634
Stop!

73
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,342
Look at it.

74
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:47,538
It's the truth.

75
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,966
That's the date that I lost my memory.

76
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:54,892
That's the date that Letty died.

77
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,982
And I was born.

78
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:58,592
No.

79
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:00,346
You never died.

80
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,995
Do you know how hard it is for me when you look at me?

81
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,769
And you see me through 15 years of memories?

82
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,346
Every beautiful moment we've ever had.

83
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:11,698
I see it in your eyes.

84
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,399
I can't give that to you.

85
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,578
I got nothing.

86
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,000
You got me.

87
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,091
And you've got only a piece of me.

88
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:25,241
I have to find myself.

89
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:26,482
For me.

90
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:43,500
Goodbye, Dom.

91
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:58,317
DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE LOS ANGELES DIVISION

92
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,510
You're disappointed, aren't you?

93
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,354
What are you talking about?

94
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:10,486
The last arrest.

95
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,729
It was too easy. Target didn't even run.

96
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:14,841
Ah, it's okay.

97
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,139
Gives me a chance to hit the iron.

98
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:20,735
Also, lets me work on my stamping skills.

99
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:23,854
You're a terrible liar.

100
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:26,605
See you tomorrow, boss.

101
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:28,621
- I'll see you then. - Don't stay too late.

102
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,216
I'll stay as long as I want, woman.

103
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:31,941
I knew you'd say that.

104
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:45,618
Elena?

105
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:54,436
What's this?

106
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,786
It's the letter of recommendation you asked for.

107
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,490
Just know I meant every word in there.

108
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:03,575
Thanks, Hobbs.

109
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,302
Thanks for everything.

110
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,977
Come on, way too sentimental right now.

111
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,784
Get home. Good night.

112
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,157
Okay. Bye.

113
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,399
Just one sec.

114
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:58,498
You sure as hell ain't the IT guy so you better start talking...

115
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:00,927
before I break that finger six different ways...

116
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:03,052
and stick it straight right where the sun doesn't shine.

117
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,153
Agent Hobbs, right?

118
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,125
That's right.

119
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,453
I'm also the last man on Earth whose computer you wanna be hacking into.

120
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:17,179
You just earned yourself a dance with the devil, boy.

121
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,630
You're under arrest.

122
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:23,524
Like I said, I'm here for the team that crippled my brother.

123
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,602
There ain't no goddamn team.

124
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:30,323
It was just one man, and he's standing right in front of you.

125
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:39,931
The lady was right.

126
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:43,729
You are a terrible liar.

127
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,376
Goddamn IT guys.

128
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:00,826
Hobbs!

129
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:03,063
On me!

130
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,173
Elena!

131
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:36,552
Hobbs?

132
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,719
Hobbs!

133
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,714
Alright buddy, we gotta go or we'll be late.

134
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,827
Come on.

135
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,980
Okay, uhh.

136
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
What do you think?

137
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,419
Parking brake slide right up to the school?

138
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:19,633
Where's mommy?

139
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,642
I don't know. She's up there. She's coming.

140
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,955
Oh.

141
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:29,692
Watch your head.

142
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:32,967
Dom, you have a package out here.

143
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:34,537
From Tokyo.

144
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:35,845
Tokyo?

145
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:39,230
What's Han trying, to convert me over to a turbo charger?

146
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:40,634
You ready?

147
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:42,313
There we go.

148
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,990
Hey buddy, cars don't fly.

149
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,299
Hey, cars don't fly.

150
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:48,268
This one did, huh?

151
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,389
Brian in a minivan.

152
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:52,273
Things have changed.

153
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:53,894
He's struggling, Dom.

154
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,529
He doesn't want me to see it...

155
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:00,004
but the white picket fence is like an anchor for him. I can tell.

156
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,130
I tried to talk to him the other night. Do you know what he said?

157
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:07,096
He doesn't miss the girls. He doesn't miss the cars.

158
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,802
He misses the bullets.

159
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,894
Let him settle in. Give him time.

160
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:15,961
How does nine months sound?

161
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,245
I'm having another baby.

162
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,206
And you didn't tell him, did you?

163
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:32,251
You gotta tell him.

164
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:37,184
I don't want him to be disappointed with this life.

165
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:40,725
With me.

166
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:43,790
He will never be disappointed with you.

167
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,466
You're the best thing that's ever happened to him.

168
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,162
Thank you.

169
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:01,812
Yeah?

170
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,447
Dominic Toretto.

171
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:06,336
You don't know me.

172
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,568
You're about to.

173
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:09,179
Private number Tokyo, Japan

174
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:12,232
Get down!

175
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:32,594
Jack!

176
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:38,994
Jack!

177
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:13,942
Shattered his collarbone, fractured his leg in two places.

178
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,327
He only regained consciousness this morning.

179
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:19,470
First thing he said was, "Get me Dom".

180
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,125
He's in there.

181
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:35,768
You okay?

182
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:38,861
I'm fine.

183
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:41,664
He's waiting. Let's go.

184
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:53,713
Got something for you.

185
00:18:57,112 --> 00:18:58,304
Your files.

186
00:18:58,376 --> 00:18:59,454
Thank you.

187
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,296
You risk life and limb to save the free world...

188
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:04,761
and what do they give you?

189
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:07,815
Jell-O and a bad 70's TV show.

190
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:13,255
Y'know, it's got its perks.

191
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:14,528
Sponge baths ain't that bad.

192
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:15,636
Dad!

193
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:16,712
I'm sorry, baby.

194
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,981
"Dad"?

195
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,492
Honey, I want to introduce you to somebody.

196
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:22,346
He's a, uhh...

197
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:24,345
He's an old friend.

198
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:25,846
Go on and say hello.

199
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,146
Dominic Toretto, right?

200
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:30,940
My dad said, he kicked your ass once.

201
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:32,951
Who did this?

202
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,102
You remember Owen Shaw?

203
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:40,239
The one we tore half of London down trying to get.

204
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:41,335
Well...

205
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:43,403
This is his big, bad brother.

206
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:44,528
Take a look at this.

207
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,669
"Deckard Shaw"

208
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,182
British Special Forces assassin.

209
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:57,417
The kind of unique asset...

210
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,648
that no government would ever admit to employing.

211
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,912
Black Ops boys.

212
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,749
Worse. They created a monster.

213
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:08,048
They felt Shaw was a necessary evil until eventually...

214
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:10,929
they decided he was unnecessary.

215
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:15,727
The powers that be, felt that he knew just a little bit too much.

216
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,563
The asset became a liability.

217
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:20,450
So they sent in 20 elite operatives to retire him.

218
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,279
And they missed.

219
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,977
That was 6 years ago and Shaw's been a ghost ever since.

220
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:26,172
Until now.

221
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:30,269
How do I find him?

222
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:33,182
The official answer is: you don't.

223
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:37,934
He killed Han.

224
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,890
Almost killed my family.

225
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,018
He also tried to put me in a body bag, too.

226
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:44,585
Which is why when I get out, I'm gonna put a hurt on him so bad...

227
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:47,365
he's gonna wish his mother had kept her legs closed.

228
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:50,382
But until then, my official answer to you...

229
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:52,328
is stand down.

230
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,343
Now you know I can't do that.

231
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,682
I do know you, Dom.

232
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:59,491
Which is why now I give you a brother to brother answer.

233
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:02,131
You do whatever it is you gotta do.

234
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,049
When you find that sumbitch...

235
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:06,852
Just do me one favor.

236
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:08,040
What's that?

237
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,362
Don't miss.

238
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:17,653
MONTECRISTO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

239
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,384
Thank you so much for letting us stay, Mando.

240
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:23,632
I hope it's not a problem.

241
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:26,561
Listen, Dom needed a safe delivered to Rio in two days.

242
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:27,807
That was a problem.

243
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:30,053
Hosting his family in the Dominican Republic,

244
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:31,361
that is vacation.

245
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:32,810
Anyone messes with you here...

246
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,820
they're messing with the entire country.

247
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:35,976
You'll be safe.

248
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:47,335
Yeah, they're here. I picked them up myself at the airport.

249
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,513
Hold on. Your brother.

250
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,150
Dom.

251
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:52,477
Yeah, Mia, it's me.

252
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,595
How's it going there?

253
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:56,320
We're at Mando's. This place is like a fortress.

254
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:59,840
You should see Brian. He's in full FBI mode.

255
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,124
He built a surveillance hub in Mando's garage and everything.

256
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:05,682
What about you? Did you find out who's after us?

257
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:08,666
Looks like the sins of London have followed us home.

258
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:10,540
How did Buster take the news?

259
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:11,652
I can't tell him.

260
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:14,195
If he knew about the baby, he'd stay here with us.

261
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:17,042
And with all that's going on, you're gonna need him by your side.

262
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:20,067
Just watch out for him. Keep him safe.

263
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,086
And come home together.

264
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,823
Tell Brian I'll see him in LA in two days.

265
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:26,566
Where are you going?

266
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:27,589
Tokyo.

267
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,167
I'm bringing Han home.

268
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,143
Authorities are still trying to determine...

269
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,862
the motive behind this daring attack here at the office...

270
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:41,285
of the US Diplomatic Security Service in downtown Los 羘geles...

271
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,435
less than 36 hours ago.

272
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,825
Facts are still coming in...

273
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,933
but what is known is the suspect entered the building's 4th floor...

274
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,292
Hey.

275
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:52,369
- You okay? - Yeah.

276
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:56,380
This guy's just, relentless.

277
00:22:58,282 --> 00:22:59,798
That's why Dom needs you.

278
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:03,361
You two need to find this guy and you need to stop him...

279
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,769
before he does any more damage to our family.

280
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:09,173
I just...

281
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,923
I've screwed up so many things.

282
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:16,853
I couldn't live with myself if I screwed this up, too.

283
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:18,880
You won't.

284
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:21,115
I believe in you.

285
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,779
I believe in us. That's all that matters.

286
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:27,654
I love you, Brian.

287
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,512
Love you, baby.

288
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:44,304
Just promise me. After this, we're done.

289
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,761
No more jobs, no more enemies.

290
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:48,896
Come back to us.

291
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,884
I won't let you down, Mia.

292
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:53,761
I know.

293
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:58,772
TOKYO, JAPAN

294
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,789
Hey yo, Sean!

295
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:12,469
Hey, check this out, man.

296
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,026
This dude over here wanna race the new DK.

297
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:16,271
Not tonight, Twinkie.

298
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:19,803
He said he knew Han.

299
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,244
Han said you was fast, but not that damn fast.

300
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:33,520
Who said American muscle can't drift?

301
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:37,811
Han mentioned he left his enemies in his rear view.

302
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,960
He never talked about it much.

303
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:44,665
Always playing it close to the vest.

304
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:52,305
We found a couple of things by the crash.

305
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:55,298
Wasn't much left.

306
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:03,788
Gisele.

307
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,060
Yeah.

308
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,325
There's one more thing.

309
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:15,614
I found this.

310
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,182
Must've meant something to him.

311
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,211
When you find the guy that killed Han...

312
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,065
What are you going to do?

313
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:31,730
Words ain't even been invented yet.

314
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:56,551
They say to live in the hearts of those we leave behind...

315
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:58,932
is not to die.

316
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,789
But he put you in his grave.

317
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,689
So now I'll do the same to him.

318
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,133
I can't do no more funerals.

319
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:15,922
First, Han...

320
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:21,221
Now Hobbs is laid out, of all people.

321
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:27,963
We're being hunted.

322
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,772
You know he's out there somewhere watching, right?

323
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:39,072
I hope so.

324
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:40,609
That means he's close.

325
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:43,753
Just promise me, Brian.

326
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,363
No more funerals.

327
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,152
Just one more.

328
00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:53,197
His.

329
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,797
You never should've messed with a man's family.

330
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,891
I told your brother the same thing.

331
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:30,857
Reinforced your chassis.

332
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:33,873
Just like going into the ring with weighted gloves.

333
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:36,394
Your mistake. I'm not here to play games.

334
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,486
See, you and me...

335
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:40,912
We're from different worlds.

336
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,919
Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner streets than the ones you're used to.

337
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,492
Stick around.

338
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,493
It's gonna get a lot meaner.

339
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,363
You think this was gonna be a street fight?

340
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:14,782
On the ground!

341
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:16,548
Now!

342
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:20,607
Drop him or I will drop you!

343
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:21,718
Woah, woah!

344
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:24,832
Easy, guys. We're on the same team here.

345
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,077
Mr. Toretto...

346
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:28,728
I'm here on the recommendation...

347
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:30,345
of a, mutual friend of ours.

348
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:32,175
- Mr. Hobbs? - Who the hell are you?

349
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,760
Me? I'm just a guy.

350
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:36,240
I'm, Mr. Nobody.

351
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:38,445
That's a big entrance for a nobody.

352
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:41,305
And the guy who put our mutual friend in the hospital...

353
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,990
you just let him get away.

354
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:47,448
I think I might've just saved your ass there, Dom.

355
00:30:47,822 --> 00:30:50,743
Listen, you think you can let go of my guy there?

356
00:30:50,853 --> 00:30:52,403
He's beginning to turn a little blue.

357
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:55,816
I appreciate that.

358
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,042
Here they come.

359
00:30:58,872 --> 00:30:59,872
Listen, Dom.

360
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:04,383
There's a war going on between shadows and ghosts like me.

361
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:09,353
You and your team unwittingly walked into the middle of it in London...

362
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,586
and it appears it's now followed you home.

363
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:15,343
It's up to you.

364
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,761
I'm gonna have a beer.

365
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:19,553
You're welcome to join me.

366
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,192
By the way, I can get you Deckard Shaw.

367
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:32,405
BASE OF OPERATIONS EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA

368
00:31:35,372 --> 00:31:36,372
Belgian ale.

369
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:41,651
Man, those monks got it right.

370
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:45,759
I don't know about the whole celibacy thing, but when it comes to beer...

371
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,305
Would you like one?

372
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:50,714
I'm more of a Corona man myself.

373
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,451
Your files, not only detailed...

374
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,509
It's, extremely entertaining.

375
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,585
Look, Shaw's power is that he's a shadow.

376
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:13,396
He's really good at getting in and out of places...

377
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:15,849
without being seen and leaving nothing but a body count in his wake.

378
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,045
He's a legitimate English badass.

379
00:32:19,324 --> 00:32:23,134
But to be honest with you Dom, I don't give two shits about Deckard Shaw.

380
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:24,548
It's you I want.

381
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:29,164
Because you and I can help each other get what we both need.

382
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:31,720
I'm listening.

383
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,700
Just recently, a private military company...

384
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,865
led by a wanted terrorist named Mose Jakande...

385
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,385
kidnapped a hacker known only by the name "Ramsey".

386
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,451
Lady Liberty's got her panties in a bunch over this but rightfully so...

387
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,808
because this Ramsey has created something interesting.

388
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:47,140
- Bring it up. - Yes, sir.

389
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:48,736
Say hello...

390
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:51,095
To God's Eye.

391
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,970
Now this little bastard hacks into anything that's on a digital network.

392
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:57,661
That means every cellphone, satellite, ATM machine, and computer,

393
00:32:57,773 --> 00:32:58,773
simultaneously.

394
00:32:59,013 --> 00:33:02,642
If it's got a microphone or a lens, God's Eye can use it to find you.

395
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,230
So you invited me here to show me a tracking device.

396
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:06,971
On steroids. Lots of them.

397
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:08,558
Let me put it to you this way.

398
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:11,621
It took us nearly a decade to find Osama bin Laden.

399
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:14,352
With this, we could locate him anywhere on the planet

400
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:15,582
in a couple of hours.

401
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:18,105
Now that's a serious piece of machinery...

402
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,340
that could be catastrophic in the wrong hands.

403
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:22,607
But for some very nauseating, political reasons...

404
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:26,815
any rescue plans involving any US government forces or entity...

405
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:28,861
has been strictly ruled out.

406
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:32,388
And that's why I need you.

407
00:33:32,537 --> 00:33:34,261
But why do I need you?

408
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:39,112
I mean I could go back outside, enjoy the rest of the Coronas...

409
00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:41,257
let Shaw come to me.

410
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,205
You could do that. How's that working out for you so far?

411
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,655
You got one friend in the ground, another one in the hospital...

412
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:49,005
and then of course there's that little issue of the bomb...

413
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:50,412
that destroyed your home.

414
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:54,613
Shaw lives in a world that doesn't play by your rules.

415
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,169
Like it or not...

416
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,984
you live in that world now, too.

417
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,059
You wanna know how to kill a shadow?

418
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,143
You just shine a little light on it.

419
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:06,605
If you get the God's Eye for me...

420
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:10,266
I've already got authorization for you to use it until you get Shaw.

421
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,733
You go from the hunted, to the hunter.

422
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:15,210
And there's no place on Earth Shaw can hide from you.

423
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:16,492
More importantly,

424
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,721
you and your family...

425
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,547
don't go to any more funerals.

426
00:34:23,472 --> 00:34:26,574
You get Ramsey, you get the God's Eye...

427
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:27,789
You get Shaw.

428
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,521
Well that's the windup and the pitch.

429
00:34:32,463 --> 00:34:37,331
Now that I've given you this incredibly sensitive and highly classified information...

430
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,528
What do you think, Toretto?

431
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,063
I think you already know what I'm gonna do.

432
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:43,143
Good.

433
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,744
But, it'll be my way.

434
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:48,059
And my crew.

435
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,931
I assumed you might say that.

436
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:53,992
Which is why I've taken the liberty of gathering your team.

437
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,762
This is crazy.

438
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,612
What the hell is going on in here?

439
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:16,653
Our intelligence suggests that Ramsey will be transported...

440
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:19,155
by an armed motorcade through the Caucasus mountain range.

441
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:21,418
If they clear this range and reach their destination...

442
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:23,235
Ramsey's as good as gone.

443
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:24,541
So let me get this straight.

444
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:26,838
There's only one road that leads in or out...?

445
00:35:26,945 --> 00:35:28,789
Sheer drops on every side...

446
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,070
A motorcade from hell protected by a small army...

447
00:35:32,182 --> 00:35:33,878
from one mile on either direction?

448
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,751
Yeah, that's about it.

449
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,284
- You done? - No, I'm not done.

450
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:42,451
So you all wanted me to break into a police station, fine.

451
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,378
Then you asked me to stop a tank.

452
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,362
I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.

453
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,284
Then you came up with this brillant idea...

454
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:51,639
to shoot down one of the largest airplanes, ever.

455
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:53,728
I shot that shit outta the sky...

456
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:56,668
It's nothing.

457
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:58,469
But this right here, my friend...

458
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:03,012
happens to be the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my life.

459
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,733
I forgot that, you were the only one to bring that plane down.

460
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:08,851
No, only thing I've ever seen him take down was "No knees" Denise.

461
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,451
Remember? At prom?

462
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:13,179
Really, Brian? You're gonna do that right here?

463
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:15,005
See, y'all try'na get me off my point.

464
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:18,690
All I'm saying is, I'm tired of everybody around me...

465
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:20,170
making all the decisions.

466
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:22,268
This time, I lead.

467
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:25,900
Seriously. If I don't start making decisions, I'm out.

468
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:27,036
All right, Roman.

469
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,213
What do you got?

470
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,369
I mean, I wouldn't try to get into the whole leadership thing, like, now.

471
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:36,806
You know what I'm saying? I'm just kind of...

472
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,036
Talking about like, at some point.

473
00:36:38,181 --> 00:36:39,599
Like, you know, when we...

474
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:42,181
Whatever. I mean, I think...

475
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:45,824
Let's hit it from here.

476
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:47,690
- I don't think that that's... - No, don't think.

477
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:49,309
That's my job.

478
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:53,528
Okay.

479
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:56,817
It is impossible to hit it there.

480
00:36:57,652 --> 00:37:00,387
That is literally the most secure spot on the mountain.

481
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:03,568
Why? Because you cannot physically access it.

482
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:05,556
Now see, that's what makes it so sweet.

483
00:37:05,702 --> 00:37:08,746
Because it's the place that they least expect us to hit them from.

484
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:11,811
As much as I hate to admit it, he's on to something there.

485
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:12,925
What do you think, Dom?

486
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:14,748
Here?

487
00:37:14,771 --> 00:37:15,771
Yeah.

488
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,688
I think we got a plan.

489
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:21,365
Completely wrong thinking.

490
00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:22,599
And I like it.

491
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:25,166
- You see? - I'm good at this.

492
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,860
Good?

493
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:28,128
Okay.

494
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:30,784
How are you planning on getting on that road?

495
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,425
Well, Tej?

496
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,489
I think I may actually have a plan for that.

497
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,086
What? I delegated.

498
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:42,436
That's what good leaders do.

499
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,510
Leader!

500
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:47,070
You know, when I was reading your files...

501
00:37:47,186 --> 00:37:49,563
I was impressed with what you've accomplished with your team.

502
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,356
But, meeting them now I gotta say, Dom...

503
00:37:53,501 --> 00:37:54,880
you truly have a gift.

504
00:37:58,346 --> 00:38:01,996
Consider my workshop your new playhouse.

505
00:38:02,106 --> 00:38:03,500
I think you'll find our cars...

506
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:05,315
extremely appealing.

507
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,454
And your team...

508
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:09,516
is now complete.

509
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:21,844
I went to the house.

510
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:24,849
I was looking for you everywhere.

511
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:28,215
You scared the shit outta me.

512
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:34,164
You will never be alone...

513
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:38,643
Where did you find that?

514
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:43,791
Found it in Han's car.

515
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,677
It was left as a message.

516
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,713
A message I plan on returning.

517
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,594
Can you ride?

518
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,253
Yeah, of course I can.

519
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:54,568
Han was my family, too.

520
00:38:59,224 --> 00:39:00,224
Brian!

521
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,891
We're gonna need long travel suspension...

522
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:05,108
limited slip differentials in all of them.

523
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,208
How you doing.

524
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:07,791
Tej!

525
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:10,887
I want the demon lovechild between that...

526
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,539
and that.

527
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,201
That's a lot of armor.

528
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,981
Just gonna add more weight, slow you down.

529
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:23,998
This time it ain't just about being fast.

530
00:39:30,956 --> 00:39:32,869
Yeah, I'm good.

531
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,648
From the streets, you know what I'm sayin'?

532
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,405
It's nothing.

533
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:46,849
Hey, Roman, you're freaking out, ain't you?

534
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:49,054
- No. - Yeah, you are.

535
00:39:49,126 --> 00:39:50,126
I said, no.

536
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:53,586
Listen man, it takes a grown man to embrace his feelings.

537
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,971
If you need to cry, just go ahead and cry.

538
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,963
As your friend, you know I'm concerned about your well-being.

539
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:01,550
Which is why I took the precaution...

540
00:40:01,623 --> 00:40:04,010
of putting some adult diapers in your glove compartment.

541
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:05,320
Can you just chill out, man?

542
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:10,074
I have seen some crazy shit, Dom, but this really could make some waves.

543
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,005
So let's just try to keep it as low key as possible, huh?

544
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,628
Don't I always?

545
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:17,728
I tell you what: you knock it down a couple of notches this time...

546
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,076
and I'll swap out my Belgian for a keg of Corona.

547
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:23,925
You'd be doing yourself a favor there.

548
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:27,414
Can somebody just walk me through what we're supposed to be doing here?

549
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:29,318
Come on, Rom. This was your plan, you gotta embrace it.

550
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:30,684
No, this was not my plan.

551
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:36,505
Yeah, here we go. Gametime.

552
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,570
Roman, you need some fresh air?

553
00:40:51,597 --> 00:40:53,514
'Cause you about to get a whole lot of it.

554
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,469
Okay, here we go!

555
00:41:16,565 --> 00:41:18,590
Just when you didn't think it can get any better, huh?

556
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,382
Oh, shit!

557
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:42,407
Now we're moving.

558
00:41:49,545 --> 00:41:52,456
Everybody good? Everybody make it out?

559
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,889
You should tell 'em, that this is not for you!

560
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:00,965
This is not your mission!

561
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,838
Rom, what's up man! Talk to me, come on!

562
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:06,101
- I can't do it. - The hell, you can't!

563
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:09,643
Come on man! You throw that thing in reverse and get your ass out here now!

564
00:42:09,644 --> 00:42:12,114
Look I can't do it, okay? Listen to what I'm saying.

565
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:13,114
Now isn't the time!

566
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,588
I'mma stay up here with the pilot.

567
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:17,815
We're gonna circle around and make sure we're holding them down from up here!

568
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:19,221
We're running out of time!

569
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,492
The chute is guided by GPS!

570
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:23,405
You don't have to do anything!

571
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:25,181
- Tej! - I'm already on it.

572
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,063
Listen, man. Listen

573
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:30,521
I'm sorry to let y'all down, okay? I'mma go ahead and stay up here.

574
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:31,447
No, brother.

575
00:42:31,563 --> 00:42:33,829
- I'm sorry to let you down. - What?

576
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:36,487
Is that...?

577
00:42:39,438 --> 00:42:41,460
Tej! What are you doing?

578
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:48,646
No!

579
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:49,920
Tej!

580
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,784
I hate you, Tej!

581
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:58,137
Get ready!

582
00:42:58,146 --> 00:42:59,659
Ground's coming fast!

583
00:43:07,514 --> 00:43:08,755
C'mon, baby.

584
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,018
Come on.

585
00:43:57,889 --> 00:43:59,130
Touchdown, baby!

586
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:05,030
Car check. Call it in.

587
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:06,286
- Check. - Check.

588
00:44:06,288 --> 00:44:07,347
I'm good, let's do this.

589
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:11,898
Hello? Please man!

590
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:13,735
Get me outta here, somebody!

591
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:15,097
No! The trees!

592
00:44:15,804 --> 00:44:16,804
Shit.

593
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:18,688
Sit tight, Roman. We'll come back for you.

594
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:20,047
This is not the plan!

595
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:28,860
CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS, AZERBAIJAN

596
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:41,449
All right.

597
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:42,902
You got one chance to hit them here, Dom.

598
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,563
You miss, they'll make it to their black site...

599
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,177
they'll squeeze whatever information they need out of Ramsey.

600
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,079
The device and your chance of ever getting Shaw will be gone for good.

601
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,210
That ain't gonna happen.

602
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:52,905
I'll see you at the pickup.

603
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,574
Ramsey, will be in the bus.

604
00:44:59,623 --> 00:45:00,623
Then let's do this.

605
00:45:10,264 --> 00:45:12,197
Captain we have company. Four cars inbound.

606
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:14,275
What, no!

607
00:45:39,643 --> 00:45:41,018
- Tej, shoot it! - I'm on the way!

608
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,159
All right, formation!

609
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,114
Bulletproof, baby.

610
00:46:01,063 --> 00:46:02,063
Punch it!

611
00:46:26,806 --> 00:46:27,806
Strike!

612
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:39,340
Guns, free.

613
00:46:40,168 --> 00:46:41,168
Yes, sir.

614
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:45,936
No!

615
00:46:49,137 --> 00:46:50,137
Shit!

616
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:51,418
Get out of the way!

617
00:47:04,617 --> 00:47:06,534
Those aren't guns, those are goddamn cannons!

618
00:47:06,644 --> 00:47:07,835
Armor piercing rounds!

619
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:33,023
Hook 'em up.

620
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,445
Brian, Tej, blow it!

621
00:47:50,425 --> 00:47:51,425
Lock it up.

622
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:03,938
Brian, you're up!

623
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:23,945
Little closer, Tej!

624
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:00,278
Ramsey?

625
00:49:00,385 --> 00:49:01,751
Stay away from me! Stay back!

626
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:03,090
Don't you touch me!

627
00:49:03,197 --> 00:49:04,942
My name's Brian, and I'm gonna get you out of here...

628
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,197
but I'm gonna need you to settle down, all right?

629
00:49:06,273 --> 00:49:07,570
I'm gonna cut those things off of you.

630
00:49:23,275 --> 00:49:24,275
Sir?

631
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,304
Sir, we have an unidentified vehicle approaching.

632
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:30,869
Come on! Closer!

633
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,302
You have to jump!

634
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:33,594
We're out of time. Come on.

635
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:34,952
We gotta get out of here!

636
00:49:35,608 --> 00:49:36,608
Come on!

637
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:38,001
Look at me!

638
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:40,246
If you don't jump, we're gonna die! Okay?

639
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:42,360
You're jumping. Come on!

640
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:43,474
One.

641
00:49:43,862 --> 00:49:44,862
Two!

642
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,150
Well, well, well.

643
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:02,739
Take my hand!

644
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:20,597
Welcome to the party, Mr. Shaw.

645
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:11,592
Letty, stay with Brian.

646
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Oh shit!

647
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,364
What are you doing? This is crazy!

648
00:51:43,481 --> 00:51:44,740
Keeping you alive!

649
00:52:30,068 --> 00:52:31,068
There's a cliff.

650
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:33,119
Cliff! cliff!

651
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:15,494
No!

652
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:06,476
Too slow!

653
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,807
Yeah!

654
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,690
I'm back, bitches!

655
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:27,929
You good?

656
00:56:27,976 --> 00:56:29,181
Thank you.

657
00:56:46,452 --> 00:56:47,822
Roman! Get back to the others.

658
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:48,447
What about you?

659
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:49,914
Don't worry about me.

660
00:57:47,893 --> 00:57:50,519
I have to say, I am impressed.

661
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:53,905
I would very much like to know the name...

662
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:57,478
of the man who is causing me so much trouble.

663
00:57:58,518 --> 00:57:59,974
There is no way out of there.

664
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:01,963
What is he doing?

665
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:03,938
He's frozen like a damn deer on headlights.

666
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,742
Toretto ain't no deer.

667
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:07,012
Come on, Dominic.

668
00:58:07,672 --> 00:58:10,943
Give us the girl, and I'll let you live.

669
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:12,599
What are you going to do?

670
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:17,347
You might wanna put on your helmet for this one.

671
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:28,052
Target the driver!

672
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,961
Dammit! What is he thinking?

673
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:39,818
You're insane!

674
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:49,516
You're pointing the wrong way!

675
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:51,166
Am I now?

676
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,740
Fire on my mark.

677
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:01,858
Interesting.

678
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:03,090
Three!

679
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:04,751
Two!

680
00:59:05,246 --> 00:59:06,246
Hold on.

681
00:59:06,248 --> 00:59:07,248
One!

682
00:59:08,289 --> 00:59:09,289
Fire!

683
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:06,137
Looks like our demon lovechild worked.

684
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:07,833
That's one way down a mountain.

685
01:00:09,126 --> 01:00:10,126
Where's Ramsey?

686
01:00:24,244 --> 01:00:26,007
Hello Kitty's awake.

687
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,409
She don't look like a hacker to me.

688
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:34,259
Oh yeah? And what do hackers look like?

689
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,458
They don't suppose to look...

690
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,570
like that.

691
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:41,094
I'm just saying, like, how they normally wear them li'l weird glasses...

692
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:45,056
that's all crooked, with pimples all over they face from drinking soda.

693
01:00:45,603 --> 01:00:48,498
I mean trust me, with a body like that...

694
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:50,414
I ain't gonna park it behind a computer.

695
01:00:51,139 --> 01:00:52,139
How you feeling?

696
01:00:52,518 --> 01:00:53,574
Did you hit your head?

697
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:57,264
Feeling nauseous? Ears ringing?

698
01:00:57,757 --> 01:00:58,757
No?

699
01:00:58,782 --> 01:01:00,152
Where's my shoe?

700
01:01:00,262 --> 01:01:02,389
It flew off when you crashed.

701
01:01:02,501 --> 01:01:05,195
When you start experiencing any of those things, let me know. Okay?

702
01:01:05,922 --> 01:01:08,117
I don't know whether to thank you for rescuing me...

703
01:01:08,117 --> 01:01:10,746
or to kick your ass for throwing me off a cliff.

704
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:13,664
Thank us or kick our ass, huh?

705
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,016
How about you tell us where that device is?

706
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:21,360
I mailed it to a friend.

707
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,057
In Abu Dhabi.

708
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:24,976
That was pretty easy.

709
01:01:25,677 --> 01:01:28,112
That other team would've tortured you for that information.

710
01:01:28,112 --> 01:01:29,418
I didn't trust them.

711
01:01:30,407 --> 01:01:31,597
I trust you.

712
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:36,028
Now why would you trust us? You barely know us.

713
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:37,476
I know enough.

714
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:42,597
Ex-cop. Military, something like that.

715
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,407
The way you took out those guys, serious training.

716
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:49,670
Tech guy. Offended by the hacker remark, naturally.

717
01:01:50,717 --> 01:01:51,717
Alpha.

718
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Mrs. Alpha.

719
01:01:56,157 --> 01:01:57,157
Joker.

720
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:58,902
Wrong.

721
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:01,646
Double Alpha.

722
01:02:02,204 --> 01:02:04,438
Man-candy. Y'know what I'm saying?

723
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,030
Man, sit your candy-ass down.

724
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:10,407
The disrespect is real around here.

725
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,311
Life is binary. Zeroes and ones.

726
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,469
Only two things keep a group like this together.

727
01:02:15,505 --> 01:02:16,989
Fear or loyalty.

728
01:02:17,105 --> 01:02:19,615
And I don't see a drop of fear among you guys.

729
01:02:19,724 --> 01:02:22,168
Very impressive. Just one thing.

730
01:02:22,748 --> 01:02:24,070
They're not married.

731
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:26,521
She's so off as crack, you're just gonna roll with it?

732
01:02:26,637 --> 01:02:29,199
You're telling me there can't be a double alpha in one group?

733
01:02:29,273 --> 01:02:30,498
You work for the US government?

734
01:02:32,409 --> 01:02:34,172
We got similar interests.

735
01:02:37,893 --> 01:02:39,762
Tej, call it in.

736
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:41,708
We're going to the Middle East!

737
01:03:03,161 --> 01:03:05,394
Hey, Dom, it was pretty wild in that mountain, huh?

738
01:03:05,943 --> 01:03:07,427
That was too close.

739
01:03:08,195 --> 01:03:09,860
But we got the job done.

740
01:03:11,697 --> 01:03:13,818
Know what the crazy thing is? It's...

741
01:03:14,978 --> 01:03:16,452
You missed the bullets.

742
01:03:18,012 --> 01:03:19,650
That's messed up, huh?

743
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,789
Brian, I've seen you jump from trains, dive from planes.

744
01:03:24,438 --> 01:03:26,894
Hell, I saw your courage the day I met you.

745
01:03:27,014 --> 01:03:28,014
Right.

746
01:03:28,568 --> 01:03:30,929
You wanna know the bravest thing I've ever saw you do?

747
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:34,710
Be a good man to M韆.

748
01:03:35,615 --> 01:03:38,563
Being a great father to my nephew, Jack.

749
01:03:40,304 --> 01:03:41,864
Everyone's looking for their thrill...

750
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:43,197
but what's real,

751
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:45,835
is family.

752
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:47,751
Your family.

753
01:03:48,547 --> 01:03:50,275
Hold on to that, Brian.

754
01:03:58,398 --> 01:04:01,297
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

755
01:04:55,786 --> 01:04:58,193
This was hotter than I thought it would be.

756
01:04:58,302 --> 01:05:00,804
Yeah, well, we are in the desert so, it would be hot.

757
01:05:00,954 --> 01:05:02,686
No, I ain't talking about the weather.

758
01:05:08,521 --> 01:05:09,626
My, my, my.

759
01:05:18,018 --> 01:05:21,079
Now that, is a woman that's worth falling out a plane for.

760
01:05:21,911 --> 01:05:25,155
Get outta there, man. I got dibs on that. You see me looking at that.

761
01:05:25,264 --> 01:05:26,340
Did you just say "dibs"?

762
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:27,771
What are you, in the fourth grade?

763
01:05:27,846 --> 01:05:29,320
Man, can you just get outta there?

764
01:05:29,402 --> 01:05:30,556
It's a free market.

765
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:31,885
What are you talking about?

766
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:33,146
- Get outta that. - Free.

767
01:05:33,181 --> 01:05:34,461
Rock, paper, scissors for it.

768
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:37,226
Are you guys for real right now?

769
01:05:37,327 --> 01:05:38,623
Look at you.

770
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:42,382
You both look whooped already. You got stalker eyes.

771
01:05:42,456 --> 01:05:45,762
I tried to call dibs on Ramsey. Two years ago.

772
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,534
Her knee, my balls.

773
01:05:47,646 --> 01:05:49,775
Trust me, you don't wanna do that.

774
01:05:50,503 --> 01:05:52,653
Hey! Ramsey!

775
01:05:53,255 --> 01:05:54,670
Hello, Zafar.

776
01:05:58,331 --> 01:05:59,266
So you made some new friends.

777
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,576
Yeah, some short- tempered new friends.

778
01:06:01,646 --> 01:06:03,597
I need the speed drive I sent you. Where is it?

779
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,077
Oh good, you will be pleased to know. I sold it.

780
01:06:06,952 --> 01:06:08,032
You sold it?

781
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:09,487
You hear that?

782
01:06:09,512 --> 01:06:11,807
I asked you to take care of it.

783
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:12,713
Why on Earth would you sell it?

784
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,306
We're gonna need it back.

785
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,257
Impossible.

786
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:19,688
Zafar, I stashed something inside it. It's important.

787
01:06:19,797 --> 01:06:20,811
Okay.

788
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:23,596
Good news: It is safe.

789
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,648
And the bad news?

790
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:27,590
It is very safe.

791
01:06:28,755 --> 01:06:31,369
Sold it to a Jordanian prince living up there.

792
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:32,931
Trust fund billionaire.

793
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,771
Said he wanted it in his supercar.

794
01:06:34,918 --> 01:06:36,686
Now see, this...

795
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:39,750
This I like. Billionaire, supercar.

796
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,322
What makes it so, "s鷓er"?

797
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:44,139
242 mile per hour, top speed.

798
01:06:44,253 --> 01:06:46,489
And, it's bulletproof.

799
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,641
Am I the only one around right now?

800
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:53,523
It's like, y'know what I'm sayin?

801
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:54,632
.....

802
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:56,141
Whatever.

803
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:57,172
Where does he keep it?

804
01:06:58,961 --> 01:06:59,961
In his penthouse.

805
01:06:59,985 --> 01:07:01,106
Tower number one.

806
01:07:02,347 --> 01:07:04,777
Now why in the hell would he keep his car in his penthouse?

807
01:07:04,885 --> 01:07:06,177
He's a billionaire, my friend.

808
01:07:06,262 --> 01:07:07,940
He can do whatever he wants.

809
01:07:08,664 --> 01:07:10,936
Now, tomorrow happens to be the longest day of the year.

810
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:14,416
Prince wants to celebrate it, host a party, tomorrow afternoon.

811
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,001
So you can get us up there, right?

812
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:16,822
Sure.

813
01:07:16,972 --> 01:07:20,155
But not dressed like that.

814
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:50,867
What?

815
01:07:51,177 --> 01:07:52,208
Something wrong?

816
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,346
There's a billion things wrong.

817
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,385
But not in this moment.

818
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,324
You look handsome.

819
01:08:00,054 --> 01:08:01,460
I feel awkward.

820
01:08:03,054 --> 01:08:04,351
You and me both.

821
01:08:05,356 --> 01:08:06,597
Seeing you dressed like this...

822
01:08:06,739 --> 01:08:08,655
Just reminds me of something.

823
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:11,331
Of what?

824
01:08:14,045 --> 01:08:15,382
Old times.

825
01:08:28,323 --> 01:08:29,323
You okay?

826
01:08:29,908 --> 01:08:31,353
Yeah, I'm fine .

827
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:34,319
Showtime.

828
01:09:09,537 --> 01:09:10,670
No, listen, man.

829
01:09:10,784 --> 01:09:12,936
They're telling me they party like this everyday,

830
01:09:13,051 --> 01:09:14,652
on this level, they party everyday.

831
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,336
This is crazy. I might have to move out here.

832
01:09:17,043 --> 01:09:20,037
I think I'mma start a new culture. It's called "Blarab".

833
01:09:20,148 --> 01:09:21,551
You know, like Black Arab?

834
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:22,886
How are we looking, Tej?

835
01:09:22,997 --> 01:09:24,256
We're almost in position.

836
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,625
Okay, so this is how we work this.

837
01:09:26,113 --> 01:09:28,298
We gotta move in sync if we're gonna pull this off so let's...

838
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,654
go over it to make sure everyone clearly understands their role.

839
01:09:31,765 --> 01:09:33,208
Roman, that means you.

840
01:09:33,323 --> 01:09:35,713
You know what? You're being real unprofessional right now, Tej.

841
01:09:35,832 --> 01:09:39,202
The God's Eye chip is hidden in a speed drive installed in the prince's car...

842
01:09:39,271 --> 01:09:40,949
which he keeps in a safe room vault.

843
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:43,502
Now I make 8 to 10 playing closed security.

844
01:09:43,614 --> 01:09:44,841
Not to mention the prince...

845
01:09:45,563 --> 01:09:48,042
and his personal bodyguards.

846
01:09:48,152 --> 01:09:49,778
Security cameras are clustered by the north wall

847
01:09:49,877 --> 01:09:50,577
that's where the vault is.

848
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,877
Now to get in that vault, we gotta tap into the security system...

849
01:09:53,993 --> 01:09:55,453
which can be accessed in the prince's bedroom.

850
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:57,207
Alright, guys. I'm going in.

851
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:00,867
Excuse me.

852
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:02,534
I was just looking for...

853
01:10:03,796 --> 01:10:05,595
- The party is that way. - What?

854
01:10:05,704 --> 01:10:06,704
This room is off...

855
01:10:13,054 --> 01:10:14,054
Now once we're tapped in

856
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,427
Ramsey and I can hack into the network and pop the door

857
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,122
so you can get in and get that chip.

858
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:20,257
Wait, wait. You missed a step.

859
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:22,381
What about my steps? What am I supposed to be doing?

860
01:10:22,497 --> 01:10:23,756
No, we didn't miss anything.

861
01:10:23,831 --> 01:10:26,096
You're special team, so when we need you...

862
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,496
do what you do best.

863
01:10:27,614 --> 01:10:28,792
And that is?

864
01:10:29,778 --> 01:10:33,615
Shine brightly, like only Roman Pearce can do.

865
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,595
Now we're talking.

866
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:38,363
Alright, Tej. I'm in.

867
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:40,604
Find a phone jack. The tap always runs behind that.

868
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:44,291
It's gonna be a 350 mega Hertz CAT5 D cable.

869
01:10:44,402 --> 01:10:45,943
They probably got a couple dozen back there.

870
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,212
But this'll be the bonded pair with a plenum coat.

871
01:10:48,284 --> 01:10:49,729
English, Tej.

872
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:51,076
It'll be the orange wire.

873
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:56,033
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the pilot's seat.

874
01:11:00,404 --> 01:11:01,404
Alright, Roman.

875
01:11:02,204 --> 01:11:04,243
Do whatever it is you do.

876
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,159
It's your birthday, right?

877
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:07,994
Are you Jasmine?

878
01:11:08,113 --> 01:11:10,416
God, no. Not the birthday routine.

879
01:11:10,529 --> 01:11:12,106
Happy birthday to you. This way.

880
01:11:12,182 --> 01:11:15,351
Excuse me, so sorry. I'm coming through, sorry.

881
01:11:15,496 --> 01:11:16,496
Right this way.

882
01:11:16,557 --> 01:11:18,212
Listen, excuse me one second.

883
01:11:18,637 --> 01:11:20,430
Man, you ain't...

884
01:11:20,546 --> 01:11:22,493
Sir, thank you so much.

885
01:11:22,605 --> 01:11:25,087
Listen, people. Please everybody, gather around.

886
01:11:25,204 --> 01:11:27,435
Understand something right now.

887
01:11:27,542 --> 01:11:29,350
Listen to what I'm telling y'all.

888
01:11:29,457 --> 01:11:34,134
We are here to celebrate Jasmine's 18th birthday.

889
01:11:34,246 --> 01:11:35,479
Happy birthday, my dear.

890
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:40,231
Happy birthday to you.

891
01:11:41,608 --> 01:11:43,064
To you.

892
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:45,489
To you.

893
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:48,359
I wish I didn't see that.

894
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:54,134
Ramsey, open it up for us.

895
01:11:54,246 --> 01:11:55,247
Copy that.

896
01:11:55,356 --> 01:11:56,534
You're in.

897
01:12:11,046 --> 01:12:12,046
You realize what this is?

898
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:14,162
Lykan HyperSport.

899
01:12:14,283 --> 01:12:18,029
$3.4 million. 0 to 60 in less than 30 seconds.

900
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:21,074
There's 7 of these things in the world and this guy keeps it locked up in a vault.

901
01:12:21,182 --> 01:12:24,676
Nothing's sadder than locking a beast in a cage.

902
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,953
Right now I really wanna punch him in the face.

903
01:12:28,068 --> 01:12:29,146
Okay.

904
01:12:30,623 --> 01:12:31,738
Let's get to work.

905
01:12:39,716 --> 01:12:40,716
You got this, right?

906
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:41,740
Go.

907
01:12:42,604 --> 01:12:43,604
All right.

908
01:13:00,653 --> 01:13:03,158
Would you believe I knocked him out with my charm?

909
01:13:03,784 --> 01:13:05,945
You ain't that charming, bitch.

910
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,519
Intruders.

911
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:14,635
Lock it down.

912
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:18,306
No!

913
01:13:18,502 --> 01:13:21,819
Tej, our magic trick is failing. We're losing systems.

914
01:13:21,926 --> 01:13:22,926
I know.

915
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:24,810
I see it.

916
01:13:24,856 --> 01:13:26,588
Tej, talk to me.

917
01:13:26,664 --> 01:13:28,859
I'm trying but their security system is locking us out.

918
01:13:28,983 --> 01:13:30,840
Listen, ladies and gentlemen...

919
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:32,449
Oh, there he is. These your dancers?

920
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,560
This is a party, baby!

921
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:39,957
Some of ya'll probably went to the bathroom

922
01:13:40,063 --> 01:13:42,476
and noticed that all the hairspray was missing.

923
01:13:42,594 --> 01:13:44,653
Yep. She did it.

924
01:13:44,765 --> 01:13:46,305
Thank you.

925
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,542
And we're so happy for you to be here.

926
01:13:54,657 --> 01:13:56,310
You look like you got some missiles underneath that dress.

927
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,792
He did not just...

928
01:13:57,867 --> 01:13:59,106
Did you just say that?

929
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:12,823
Shit! Not the gate!

930
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:16,574
Brian, faster!

931
01:14:17,246 --> 01:14:18,567
We're playing all the defense we can up here.

932
01:14:18,637 --> 01:14:20,358
But we're gonna lose, you gotta hurry up.

933
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:24,889
Thank god, you showed up.

934
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:29,373
These parties bore me to death.

935
01:15:21,962 --> 01:15:23,885
Guys get out of there right now.

936
01:15:23,992 --> 01:15:25,542
You've got an army headed your way.

937
01:15:25,618 --> 01:15:26,922
Brian, get up! Forget it!

938
01:15:29,523 --> 01:15:30,685
Tej, we're taking the car.

939
01:15:33,636 --> 01:15:36,592
This is what I do. Y'know what I'm sayin'?

940
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:46,412
Letty, Letty, talk to me.

941
01:15:46,487 --> 01:15:47,487
Are you okay?

942
01:15:48,453 --> 01:15:50,341
Guys I can't hold it. I'm losing the final gate.

943
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:51,421
You gotta get out of there.

944
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:53,375
Tear off the dash!

945
01:15:53,676 --> 01:15:54,676
Go through it.

946
01:15:59,796 --> 01:16:02,350
Wait, just hold on man.

947
01:16:14,421 --> 01:16:16,176
Time to unleash the beast.

948
01:16:37,863 --> 01:16:38,863
Go!

949
01:16:42,176 --> 01:16:43,456
Stay with me, I got you.

950
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:45,855
Let's get the hell outta here.

951
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,865
Dom. Cars don't fly!

952
01:17:29,381 --> 01:17:30,381
Cars don't fly!

953
01:17:31,664 --> 01:17:32,664
Shit!

954
01:18:01,615 --> 01:18:02,615
No brakes!

955
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,640
What?

956
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,966
- No brakes! - Shit!

957
01:18:21,637 --> 01:18:22,637
No!

958
01:19:02,256 --> 01:19:03,256
- Got it! - Get out!

959
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:29,543
TORRES ETHIHAD Abu Dhabi

960
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:45,167
Still miss the bullets, Brian?

961
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:26,981
There they are, disaster.

962
01:20:27,085 --> 01:20:27,634
I'm sorry.

963
01:20:27,771 --> 01:20:31,525
I get you an invite to the most exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.

964
01:20:31,837 --> 01:20:32,501
Zafar.

965
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,578
No, no, you steal the host's car.

966
01:20:35,355 --> 01:20:37,154
And you jump it between two buildings.

967
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:38,791
Actually, it was three buildings.

968
01:20:38,844 --> 01:20:42,585
Oh! Two, insult. Three, honor. My bad

969
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:43,737
Wow, wow, wow.

970
01:20:43,761 --> 01:20:45,248
I have to say...

971
01:20:45,572 --> 01:20:50,649
You've got an interesting interpretation there of low key, Mr. Toretto.

972
01:20:51,412 --> 01:20:54,403
I thought we had an understanding.

973
01:20:55,331 --> 01:20:57,176
Sometimes you have to play the hand you're dealt.

974
01:20:57,292 --> 01:20:59,828
That's why I prefer to be the dealer.

975
01:21:01,328 --> 01:21:02,328
Good night.

976
01:21:08,425 --> 01:21:09,918
Kicked out of my own garage.

977
01:21:09,987 --> 01:21:10,987
This is great.

978
01:21:12,627 --> 01:21:13,993
May I?

979
01:21:15,275 --> 01:21:17,015
Brian.

980
01:21:17,992 --> 01:21:19,110
Give it to him.

981
01:21:36,384 --> 01:21:39,257
All that trouble for this little.... thing.

982
01:21:40,569 --> 01:21:42,305
With all due respect, Dom...

983
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:45,416
You really did great work back there. All of you.

984
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:48,466
All of my men are now standing by...

985
01:21:48,466 --> 01:21:51,018
and are fully at your disposal.

986
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,077
Your call.

987
01:21:59,273 --> 01:22:00,273
Ramsey.

988
01:22:03,743 --> 01:22:06,911
Fire it up, and find me Shaw.

989
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:13,904
Damn, this is crazy.

990
01:22:14,198 --> 01:22:15,711
Thank you.

991
01:22:17,064 --> 01:22:18,561
Give me a second.

992
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:23,855
What is it doing now?

993
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,057
It's hunting.

994
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:28,534
Hacking into the security cameras at Ethihad Towers.

995
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:30,735
That's the last place we saw Shaw so that's where we start.

996
01:22:32,908 --> 01:22:33,908
That's him, right there.

997
01:22:35,137 --> 01:22:37,335
Wait. What are these numbers out here for?

998
01:22:37,402 --> 01:22:39,390
It's biomapping Shaw's face.

999
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:44,939
It will run that against every camera...

1000
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:48,707
Every audio device in this hemisphere.

1001
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:03,481
Bingo. Looks like he's holed up here.

1002
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:05,319
That's perfect.

1003
01:23:05,342 --> 01:23:07,813
Automated factory, no people. Lots of places to hide.

1004
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:10,667
You just changed the face of manhunts forever.

1005
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,220
Congratulations.

1006
01:23:14,033 --> 01:23:16,728
Can I check my e-mail real quick?

1007
01:23:18,037 --> 01:23:19,537
Dawn's up in two hours.

1008
01:23:22,474 --> 01:23:24,137
We're gonna go take down Shaw then.

1009
01:23:25,082 --> 01:23:26,202
Go get changed.

1010
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,395
We should go now.

1011
01:23:33,545 --> 01:23:35,670
Just you, your team and me.

1012
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,087
I thought you said at dawn?

1013
01:23:38,204 --> 01:23:39,204
My guys are racers.

1014
01:23:39,296 --> 01:23:40,742
Best drivers in the world.

1015
01:23:41,019 --> 01:23:42,596
But they ain't killers.

1016
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:43,733
Told you he'd say that.

1017
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:46,389
I know you too well, Dom, and I'm going with you.

1018
01:23:47,181 --> 01:23:49,770
Looks like we got a nice little hunting party.

1019
01:23:50,118 --> 01:23:51,807
Let's go bag a shadow.

1020
01:23:59,489 --> 01:24:02,221
Ten clicks out, boys. Get ready to rock and roll.

1021
01:24:08,381 --> 01:24:09,899
Here we go. Weapons hot.

1022
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:33,153
You ready for this?

1023
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:34,225
Yeah.

1024
01:25:04,067 --> 01:25:06,015
I hope you're enjoying your last meal.

1025
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:14,454
This is it?

1026
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:16,216
This is all you want?

1027
01:25:17,046 --> 01:25:18,591
A dozen men?

1028
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,372
I think you'll find it's more than enough.

1029
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,289
I'm ready to meet my maker.

1030
01:25:38,095 --> 01:25:39,095
Are you?

1031
01:25:39,363 --> 01:25:41,957
What were you expecting, Toretto? Catch me off guard?

1032
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:45,529
Me standing here, waving a white flag?

1033
01:25:46,052 --> 01:25:47,421
Have you ever heard the saying:

1034
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:49,020
"The enemy of my enemy...

1035
01:25:49,135 --> 01:25:50,720
is my friend"?

1036
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:53,176
I don't have friends.

1037
01:25:53,972 --> 01:25:55,197
I got family.

1038
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:59,054
Well, I got a lot of friends.

1039
01:26:13,012 --> 01:26:15,204
Keep your formation! Sheppard, clear one!

1040
01:27:15,078 --> 01:27:16,434
Brian, leave it!

1041
01:27:30,967 --> 01:27:31,967
Get down!

1042
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:44,805
I got you.

1043
01:28:08,155 --> 01:28:09,345
The God's Eye.

1044
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:32,002
You didn't really think I was gonna walk in there naked, did you?

1045
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:35,470
You got hit bad.

1046
01:28:36,155 --> 01:28:37,528
Look. Toretto.

1047
01:28:38,645 --> 01:28:40,372
I know you won't listen to me.

1048
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:43,360
You're not gonna wanna hear what I have to say.

1049
01:28:44,123 --> 01:28:45,525
But the truth is...

1050
01:28:46,215 --> 01:28:47,658
you really ought to...

1051
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:50,659
try that Belgian ale, man.

1052
01:28:51,737 --> 01:28:52,930
It's something special.

1053
01:28:53,757 --> 01:28:54,877
Belgian ale, huh?

1054
01:28:58,511 --> 01:28:59,890
We gotta get you to a hospital.

1055
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:00,970
No, you're not.

1056
01:29:01,207 --> 01:29:02,889
I carry my own health insurance.

1057
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:08,590
SOCOM Medics on standby. They're already inbound.

1058
01:29:10,213 --> 01:29:11,288
Pull over, kid.

1059
01:29:26,011 --> 01:29:28,149
Dom, you got to protect Ramsey.

1060
01:29:28,297 --> 01:29:29,846
As long as she's alive,

1061
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,501
she can lock them out of God's Eye and they know that.

1062
01:29:33,573 --> 01:29:36,389
That means, they're not gonna stop coming until they've got her.

1063
01:29:37,229 --> 01:29:38,677
And this time when they come...

1064
01:29:38,789 --> 01:29:40,841
They're gonna come with everything they've got.

1065
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:42,750
I'm not leaving you.

1066
01:29:42,862 --> 01:29:43,917
You're not.

1067
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:45,867
I'm leaving you.

1068
01:29:49,047 --> 01:29:50,292
Go now, Dom.

1069
01:30:04,673 --> 01:30:07,387
A war is coming to us whether we like it or not.

1070
01:30:08,509 --> 01:30:09,793
But if a war's coming...

1071
01:30:12,561 --> 01:30:14,725
We're gonna face them on the streets we know best.

1072
01:30:20,585 --> 01:30:23,168
I'm all for winging it, but this is crazy, man.

1073
01:30:23,686 --> 01:30:26,224
We got mercenaries with some real heat on us.

1074
01:30:27,591 --> 01:30:29,046
I mean I ain't scared of nothing but...

1075
01:30:29,148 --> 01:30:30,641
..I don't even have a gun.

1076
01:30:31,966 --> 01:30:32,966
Gun?

1077
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,697
We got a whole city.

1078
01:30:36,809 --> 01:30:38,260
And we may have more than that.

1079
01:30:38,367 --> 01:30:39,555
If they use God's Eye...

1080
01:30:39,664 --> 01:30:41,865
it will tap the cameras around to find our location.

1081
01:30:41,934 --> 01:30:43,809
Which means we could plant a virus.

1082
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,115
And then break in when they access it.

1083
01:30:46,813 --> 01:30:49,255
So you're talking about hacking my hacking device.

1084
01:30:49,369 --> 01:30:50,454
That's brilliant.

1085
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:52,729
Yeah, but there's one problem.

1086
01:30:52,837 --> 01:30:53,850
The signal strength.

1087
01:30:53,962 --> 01:30:57,319
We can't start a hack on them until they're within a two mile range.

1088
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:59,122
- That's really close. - Close?

1089
01:30:59,265 --> 01:31:00,463
These guys are military.

1090
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:03,270
If they're within two miles of us, we already dead.

1091
01:31:03,378 --> 01:31:07,632
I don't know about y'all, but I didn't really plan on dying today.

1092
01:31:07,744 --> 01:31:09,646
Only one way to stay alive.

1093
01:31:10,452 --> 01:31:12,324
We play keepaway with Ramsey.

1094
01:31:12,434 --> 01:31:13,154
What?

1095
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:14,914
They can't hit us if we keep moving.

1096
01:31:14,992 --> 01:31:16,224
And I'll take Shaw.

1097
01:31:16,755 --> 01:31:19,953
So basically we're just gearing up for a big game of hot potato, huh?

1098
01:31:22,298 --> 01:31:24,650
Why does it feel like I'm not gonna see you again?

1099
01:31:38,203 --> 01:31:39,640
I'll come back for that.

1100
01:31:41,398 --> 01:31:42,398
Promise?

1101
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:46,238
Promise.

1102
01:32:06,248 --> 01:32:07,314
Brian, are you okay?

1103
01:32:07,435 --> 01:32:08,599
M韆, listen to me.

1104
01:32:09,184 --> 01:32:10,802
Something's about to go down.

1105
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:13,538
If you don't hear from me in 24 hours...

1106
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,868
I need you to take Jack and move on.

1107
01:32:21,146 --> 01:32:22,146
You understand?

1108
01:32:24,046 --> 01:32:25,052
You understand what I'm saying?

1109
01:32:25,161 --> 01:32:26,894
No I can't do that, Brian.

1110
01:32:27,618 --> 01:32:28,618
No, I can't.

1111
01:32:30,438 --> 01:32:31,733
We're gonna have another baby.

1112
01:32:33,067 --> 01:32:34,180
It's a little girl.

1113
01:32:37,229 --> 01:32:38,871
And she's going to need her father.

1114
01:32:38,972 --> 01:32:41,043
So you have to finish what you're doing...

1115
01:32:41,161 --> 01:32:42,521
and you have to come home to her.

1116
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:45,490
You have to come home to us.

1117
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:49,340
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

1118
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:53,143
I was scared you'd be disappointed with domestic life.

1119
01:32:55,582 --> 01:32:58,786
You know the best decision I ever made was stepping into that store...

1120
01:33:00,354 --> 01:33:01,704
buying that first sandwich.

1121
01:33:04,233 --> 01:33:06,405
It was such a bad s醤dwich.

1122
01:33:07,176 --> 01:33:08,546
I know.

1123
01:33:08,694 --> 01:33:09,770
But I ate a lot of 'em.

1124
01:33:19,492 --> 01:33:20,492
I love you, M韆.

1125
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:24,930
Don't do that.

1126
01:33:24,953 --> 01:33:25,953
What?

1127
01:33:26,568 --> 01:33:27,573
The way you said it. It's like goodbye.

1128
01:33:27,694 --> 01:33:28,975
Say something else.

1129
01:33:30,912 --> 01:33:32,738
Okay. Kiss Jack for me.

1130
01:33:35,512 --> 01:33:36,512
I will.

1131
01:33:43,251 --> 01:33:44,434
I love you, Brian.

1132
01:33:48,118 --> 01:33:49,453
I love you, M韆.

1133
01:34:21,105 --> 01:34:23,054
One last ride.

1134
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:33,319
Boot up God's Eye, and find them.

1135
01:35:47,626 --> 01:35:48,626
I'm getting something.

1136
01:35:51,981 --> 01:35:53,997
I got a positive ID. It's Toretto.

1137
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,189
God's Eye is placing him at Hill and Seventh.

1138
01:36:01,845 --> 01:36:03,000
Should we follow him?

1139
01:36:03,184 --> 01:36:05,448
No. Let Shaw take care of him.

1140
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:06,296
Find Ramsey.

1141
01:36:06,404 --> 01:36:07,470
Yes, sir.

1142
01:36:14,234 --> 01:36:16,256
I don't know why we gotta keep driving around like this.

1143
01:36:16,409 --> 01:36:17,926
Why can't we just pull over somewhere...

1144
01:36:18,037 --> 01:36:20,881
park, gather our thoughts in like a bunker somewhere?

1145
01:36:20,993 --> 01:36:22,796
Because it does not work like that.

1146
01:36:22,947 --> 01:36:25,067
We gotta stick close enough to the bad guys...

1147
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:27,155
in order to get in range for Ramsey to hack 'em...

1148
01:36:27,268 --> 01:36:30,152
but we gotta be mobile enough not to get shot like fish in a barrel.

1149
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:32,712
So do me a favor, focus on the mission, keep us from getting killed.

1150
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:36,393
Got them. Target acquired.

1151
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:38,592
She's riding shotgun in a blue GT-R.

1152
01:36:46,954 --> 01:36:48,041
Guys, they're here.

1153
01:36:48,157 --> 01:36:49,412
How many cars?

1154
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:50,253
None.

1155
01:36:50,367 --> 01:36:51,909
And that's kind of the problem.

1156
01:36:59,516 --> 01:37:00,871
Let's give them a tour.

1157
01:37:00,947 --> 01:37:02,141
Break on my mark.

1158
01:37:02,253 --> 01:37:04,349
Three, two, one.

1159
01:37:04,458 --> 01:37:05,458
Go!

1160
01:37:09,417 --> 01:37:10,475
Splitting up won't work.

1161
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:12,503
You can't hide from God's Eye.

1162
01:37:16,667 --> 01:37:17,667
In range.

1163
01:37:18,034 --> 01:37:19,180
Ramsey, start the hack.

1164
01:37:19,293 --> 01:37:20,684
Initiating.

1165
01:37:21,777 --> 01:37:22,777
Now.

1166
01:37:24,967 --> 01:37:27,975
Sir, I think someone's trying to hack the system.

1167
01:37:28,052 --> 01:37:29,204
It's Ramsey.

1168
01:37:29,318 --> 01:37:30,905
Send in the predator!

1169
01:37:31,001 --> 01:37:32,001
Take her out!

1170
01:37:32,024 --> 01:37:33,395
Releasing predator.

1171
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:06,729
I think we lost the chopper.

1172
01:38:12,787 --> 01:38:14,514
I think we got bigger problems than that!

1173
01:38:16,595 --> 01:38:17,867
Oh, my God.

1174
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,581
What are you doing?

1175
01:38:21,694 --> 01:38:22,694
Going old school!

1176
01:39:25,809 --> 01:39:26,809
PUBLIC PARKING

1177
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:45,466
It's coming back around!

1178
01:39:58,404 --> 01:40:00,056
The predator's back on 'em.

1179
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:01,173
Ready missiles!

1180
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:02,250
Roger that.

1181
01:40:03,476 --> 01:40:04,476
Fire!

1182
01:40:05,801 --> 01:40:06,801
Shit!

1183
01:40:16,739 --> 01:40:18,167
I need a lateral.

1184
01:40:18,277 --> 01:40:19,386
Rom, where are you?

1185
01:40:19,457 --> 01:40:21,083
Running back! Charging in.

1186
01:40:39,728 --> 01:40:41,050
Meet me on Third and Spring.

1187
01:40:41,127 --> 01:40:42,127
You got it!

1188
01:40:49,106 --> 01:40:50,185
I'm halfway there.

1189
01:40:50,265 --> 01:40:51,814
Grab your computer and get in the window!

1190
01:40:51,889 --> 01:40:52,929
- Why? - Do it, now!

1191
01:40:58,328 --> 01:40:59,552
You gotta go! Right now!

1192
01:41:04,203 --> 01:41:05,203
Fire!

1193
01:41:15,707 --> 01:41:16,707
No!

1194
01:41:34,467 --> 01:41:35,467
He made it!

1195
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,036
Can't believe we pullled that off!

1196
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:52,296
Wait, we're still being hacked.

1197
01:41:52,411 --> 01:41:52,876
What?

1198
01:41:52,984 --> 01:41:54,502
God's Eye is still tracking Ramsey.

1199
01:41:54,579 --> 01:41:56,150
Keep the drone in pursuit of her.

1200
01:41:56,259 --> 01:41:58,019
The signal has to be coming from somewhere.

1201
01:42:38,046 --> 01:42:39,552
Breaking news out of Los 羘geles tonight.

1202
01:42:39,663 --> 01:42:42,978
In what can only be described as vehicular warfare,

1203
01:42:43,054 --> 01:42:45,177
police are engaged in a high speed pursuit...

1204
01:42:47,595 --> 01:42:51,092
I got it. The piggyback in the hack off that satellite tower right there.

1205
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:52,238
Take it out!

1206
01:43:03,823 --> 01:43:04,836
Toretto.

1207
01:43:13,965 --> 01:43:16,337
Wait, what happened? We were almost there.

1208
01:43:17,027 --> 01:43:18,652
They've cut the signal. I can't finish the hack.

1209
01:43:18,755 --> 01:43:19,626
What do you mean?

1210
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:23,292
Brian, they took out the tower!

1211
01:43:28,021 --> 01:43:30,110
Dad, what's going on?

1212
01:43:31,775 --> 01:43:33,317
Daddy's gotta go to work.

1213
01:43:51,221 --> 01:43:52,623
Alright, baby girl.

1214
01:43:52,731 --> 01:43:54,353
Elena's gonna be here in a little bit.

1215
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:55,810
You know our drill.

1216
01:43:55,911 --> 01:43:57,229
Give me three for the road.

1217
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,762
You thought this was gonna be a street fight?

1218
01:44:32,996 --> 01:44:34,579
You're goddamn right it is.

1219
01:45:20,822 --> 01:45:22,002
There has to be another way.

1220
01:45:22,117 --> 01:45:25,395
Wait. I'm seeing half a dozen cell towers between Sixth and State.

1221
01:45:25,471 --> 01:45:28,177
Brian, if you can get to the top of any one of those buildings around there...

1222
01:45:28,292 --> 01:45:30,945
we can reroute the signal manually and finish the job.

1223
01:45:31,057 --> 01:45:32,057
I'm on it.

1224
01:45:35,164 --> 01:45:36,389
Sir, did you hear that?

1225
01:45:36,421 --> 01:45:38,252
O碈onner is on foot heading for a repeater.

1226
01:45:38,362 --> 01:45:39,875
He's gonna try to reinitiate the hack.

1227
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,551
Keep the drone on the girl.

1228
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:43,211
Kiet.

1229
01:45:44,002 --> 01:45:46,159
O碈onner's on foot somewhere between Sixth and State.

1230
01:45:46,234 --> 01:45:47,541
Don't let him make it there.

1231
01:46:02,863 --> 01:46:04,020
Boys is on us!

1232
01:46:04,143 --> 01:46:05,613
And them boys ain't ready for this!

1233
01:46:10,074 --> 01:46:11,207
Shit!

1234
01:46:30,046 --> 01:46:31,795
First a tank, then a plane...

1235
01:46:31,904 --> 01:46:33,492
Now we got a spaceship?

1236
01:46:33,609 --> 01:46:35,020
That's not a spaceship, that's a drone!

1237
01:46:35,132 --> 01:46:35,894
Oh it's a drone?

1238
01:46:36,005 --> 01:46:37,565
Now you gonna break it down and be articulate...

1239
01:46:37,659 --> 01:46:39,854
like you already know what the hell is going on?

1240
01:46:39,935 --> 01:46:41,496
Shut your ass up and drive the car!

1241
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,899
Letty, the football's on fire!

1242
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:50,980
We need help!

1243
01:46:51,671 --> 01:46:52,978
Hang on! I'm coming!

1244
01:47:28,858 --> 01:47:30,655
Ramsey, get ready to go again.

1245
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:34,552
Drone has missile lock.

1246
01:47:34,668 --> 01:47:35,668
Fire!

1247
01:47:45,582 --> 01:47:46,582
Target destroyed.

1248
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:54,055
Wait! God's Eye still has her.

1249
01:47:54,202 --> 01:47:55,202
How can that be?

1250
01:48:08,467 --> 01:48:11,569
Get up. Come on.

1251
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:13,403
Let's go! Let's go.

1252
01:48:17,252 --> 01:48:18,692
They switched her under the bridge.

1253
01:48:19,127 --> 01:48:20,127
What?

1254
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,889
You gotta get outta here, it's on your trail and it's coming fast.

1255
01:48:25,006 --> 01:48:25,649
Got it.

1256
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,461
So if this car goes south, who's coming to save us?

1257
01:48:28,882 --> 01:48:31,435
Save us, honey? We're it.

1258
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:32,216
Where are they now?

1259
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:33,957
Six blocks east, hauling ass.

1260
01:48:34,997 --> 01:48:36,480
Where we heading, Tej?

1261
01:48:36,628 --> 01:48:38,829
There's a service elevator past the maintenance center.

1262
01:48:38,908 --> 01:48:40,690
It will take you directly up to the repeater.

1263
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,198
Brian, you gotta hurry!

1264
01:50:43,162 --> 01:50:44,521
Too slow!

1265
01:50:59,568 --> 01:51:00,692
It's coming back.

1266
01:51:00,813 --> 01:51:01,896
We'll lose them in the tunnel.

1267
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:03,820
Got it!

1268
01:51:03,845 --> 01:51:04,845
Fire!

1269
01:51:21,770 --> 01:51:22,930
I can't shake this thing!

1270
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:27,536
The predator has missile lock.

1271
01:51:27,972 --> 01:51:28,972
Take it out!

1272
01:51:55,711 --> 01:51:56,711
No way.

1273
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:10,014
Wait! What happened?

1274
01:52:10,121 --> 01:52:12,356
Sir, someone just double tapped our drone.

1275
01:52:12,516 --> 01:52:13,516
What?

1276
01:52:14,725 --> 01:52:17,313
Hey, did you bring the cavalry?

1277
01:52:17,631 --> 01:52:20,207
Woman, I am the cavalry.

1278
01:52:23,641 --> 01:52:24,971
Who is that?

1279
01:52:28,012 --> 01:52:29,130
That's Hobbs!

1280
01:52:38,216 --> 01:52:39,219
I'm at the repeater.

1281
01:52:39,338 --> 01:52:40,835
The access cable's in the base.

1282
01:52:40,943 --> 01:52:43,850
Just plug it into your phone and Ramsey will be back online.

1283
01:52:45,578 --> 01:52:46,716
Ramsey, go!

1284
01:52:50,871 --> 01:52:53,323
Brian did it. We're back in.

1285
01:52:57,525 --> 01:52:59,101
We've got God's Eye back.

1286
01:53:06,801 --> 01:53:08,773
- We lost the God's Eye! - What?

1287
01:53:09,101 --> 01:53:10,101
Shit!

1288
01:53:14,568 --> 01:53:16,881
Military's inbound. Three minutes and closing.

1289
01:53:16,947 --> 01:53:18,038
We need to get the hell outta here.

1290
01:53:20,382 --> 01:53:22,676
Tej, Roman, I'm on my way.

1291
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:24,368
Alright, homie. I'll see you there.

1292
01:54:11,552 --> 01:54:12,985
I have eyes on Toretto.

1293
01:54:33,551 --> 01:54:34,744
Shaw's in the way.

1294
01:54:34,858 --> 01:54:37,143
Then it seems our friendship is at an end.

1295
01:54:37,725 --> 01:54:39,020
Do it.

1296
01:54:54,345 --> 01:54:56,025
The thing about street fights?

1297
01:54:58,801 --> 01:55:00,756
The street always wins.

1298
01:55:29,211 --> 01:55:30,398
Goodbye, Toretto.

1299
01:55:39,029 --> 01:55:40,828
Take him out!

1300
01:55:51,284 --> 01:55:52,284
Son of a...

1301
01:56:10,331 --> 01:56:11,331
I need some help out here!

1302
01:56:11,426 --> 01:56:13,082
We're getting killed.

1303
01:56:13,155 --> 01:56:14,845
I need some backup!

1304
01:56:23,757 --> 01:56:25,791
No! Son of a bitch.

1305
01:56:28,243 --> 01:56:29,252
He's getting away!

1306
01:56:29,358 --> 01:56:31,037
No, stop them.

1307
01:57:27,029 --> 01:57:28,029
Don't miss.

1308
01:58:01,738 --> 01:58:02,738
Dom!

1309
01:58:48,015 --> 01:58:49,015
Come on.

1310
01:58:49,265 --> 01:58:50,265
C'mon, buddy.

1311
01:58:55,109 --> 01:58:56,109
Is he breathing?

1312
01:58:56,134 --> 01:58:58,046
Here's what I need you to do. Keep his head tilted up.

1313
01:58:58,117 --> 01:58:59,707
All right. Keep it back like this.

1314
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,657
Clinch his nose, keep his head tilted. Breathe in him now. Go.

1315
01:59:03,034 --> 01:59:04,034
That's good.

1316
01:59:04,059 --> 01:59:04,882
Come on, Dom.

1317
01:59:04,963 --> 01:59:07,652
Come on, goddammit!

1318
01:59:07,766 --> 01:59:08,876
You come on, you breathe!

1319
01:59:08,993 --> 01:59:10,182
Go, go, breathe!

1320
01:59:10,329 --> 01:59:13,358
C'mon, dammit. Let's go. Come on, Dom! I need you to breathe.

1321
01:59:14,298 --> 01:59:16,115
Come on, Dom. Come back, c'mon.

1322
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,884
Come on, buddy. Dom, come on!

1323
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:19,283
Back off!

1324
01:59:19,393 --> 01:59:21,412
Will you stop? Breathe into him.

1325
01:59:21,487 --> 01:59:22,938
You breathe into him.

1326
01:59:23,051 --> 01:59:25,604
- You breathe into him. - Back off!

1327
01:59:27,057 --> 01:59:30,052
Please, please, Dom.

1328
01:59:30,637 --> 01:59:31,896
Dom, baby.

1329
01:59:31,974 --> 01:59:33,769
I know you're hurting right now.

1330
01:59:34,489 --> 01:59:35,787
But I want you to listen.

1331
01:59:35,896 --> 01:59:39,182
Stay awake and focus on me.

1332
01:59:45,002 --> 01:59:47,270
I remember everything.

1333
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:50,217
It came to me like a flood.

1334
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:55,587
That night, in the Dominican Republic.

1335
01:59:57,023 --> 01:59:58,444
The night we got married.

1336
02:00:01,552 --> 02:00:02,838
Who has the ring?

1337
02:00:11,488 --> 02:00:12,708
Will this do?

1338
02:00:14,144 --> 02:00:16,516
With this silver necklace, love...

1339
02:00:16,671 --> 02:00:18,313
We have eternity in this moment.

1340
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:22,185
You will never be alone again.

1341
02:00:22,257 --> 02:00:25,100
I vow, wherever you go, I go.

1342
02:00:25,253 --> 02:00:26,292
You ride, I ride.

1343
02:00:26,367 --> 02:00:28,631
You fight, I fight.

1344
02:00:28,779 --> 02:00:30,936
And if you ever die on me, Dominic Toretto...

1345
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:32,818
I'm gonna die with you.

1346
02:00:36,757 --> 02:00:37,757
I love you, Letty.

1347
02:00:37,782 --> 02:00:38,976
I will always love you.

1348
02:00:39,128 --> 02:00:41,827
If you die, I die.

1349
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:47,481
And I'm not ready to leave this place yet.

1350
02:00:48,137 --> 02:00:50,944
This moment, still ours.

1351
02:00:55,488 --> 02:00:57,882
I remember everything.

1352
02:00:58,418 --> 02:01:00,556
I remember it all.

1353
02:01:02,777 --> 02:01:04,025
It's about time.

1354
02:01:12,618 --> 02:01:13,618
Oh, God.

1355
02:01:19,559 --> 02:01:21,546
Why didn't you tell me we were married?

1356
02:01:30,127 --> 02:01:32,661
Because you can't tell someone they love you.

1357
02:01:43,289 --> 02:01:44,671
Holy shit.

BLACK SITE --- CIA

1359
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:13,623
You sure you brought enough backup with you, Hobbs?

1360
02:02:14,591 --> 02:02:15,850
Oh, they ain't mine.

1361
02:02:17,042 --> 02:02:18,488
They're here to protect you.

1362
02:02:18,908 --> 02:02:20,792
From me killing your ass.

1363
02:02:37,722 --> 02:02:40,278
You do know, none of this will keep me, right?

1364
02:02:44,570 --> 02:02:47,641
Well I want you to dig through 38 feet of concrete and steel...

1365
02:02:47,643 --> 02:02:51,203
and my fist and a bodybag will be waiting for you on the other side.

1366
02:02:51,836 --> 02:02:54,301
So I suggest you get to digging, boy.

1367
02:03:31,202 --> 02:03:33,675
- Daddy, come play. - Yeah.

1368
02:03:33,823 --> 02:03:35,762
Look at him, look at him.

1369
02:03:38,496 --> 02:03:39,974
Yeah, buddy.

1370
02:03:41,132 --> 02:03:42,550
- Duty calls. - It does.

1371
02:03:42,663 --> 02:03:44,970
- Come on... - Let's get momma...

1372
02:03:45,051 --> 02:03:47,667
Y'know we gotta tan because...

1373
02:03:47,774 --> 02:03:49,840
the sun is out, you know...

1374
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:52,333
medium rare, but I can get like...

1375
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:54,640
well done, like really dark.

1376
02:03:56,197 --> 02:03:58,957
- What you nudging me for? - Close your mouth for two seconds.

1377
02:04:00,536 --> 02:04:02,369
Just open your eyes, man.

1378
02:04:06,476 --> 02:04:07,476
Beautiful.

1379
02:04:09,024 --> 02:04:10,862
That's where he belongs.

1380
02:04:11,729 --> 02:04:12,787
Home.

1381
02:04:14,393 --> 02:04:16,663
Where he's always belonged.

1382
02:04:21,364 --> 02:04:23,739
Things are gonna be different now.

1383
02:04:33,067 --> 02:04:34,144
You got it. What...

1384
02:04:46,921 --> 02:04:49,052
One more time.

1385
02:04:50,895 --> 02:04:52,658
You aren't going to say goodbye?

1386
02:04:58,618 --> 02:05:00,466
Yeah! Good job!

1387
02:05:02,895 --> 02:05:03,895
My man.

02:05:04,293 --> 02:05:05,872

It's been a long day without you, my friend

1391
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:20,466
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

1392
02:05:21,042 --> 02:05:26,546
We've come a long way from where we began

1393
02:05:26,654 --> 02:05:32,591
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

1394
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:35,435
When I see you again

1395
02:05:38,855 --> 02:05:40,576
First you both go out your way

1396
02:05:40,725 --> 02:05:42,094
And the vibe is feeling strong

1397
02:05:42,166 --> 02:05:43,609
And what's small turn to a friendship

1398
02:05:43,722 --> 02:05:45,203
A friendship turn into a bond

1399
02:05:45,282 --> 02:05:46,724
And that bond will never be broken

1400
02:05:46,797 --> 02:05:49,536
And the love will never get lost

1401
02:05:50,872 --> 02:05:52,636
And when brotherhood come first

1402
02:05:52,743 --> 02:05:54,113
Then the line will never be crossed

1403
02:05:54,261 --> 02:05:55,559
Established it on our own

1404
02:05:55,704 --> 02:05:57,076
When that line had to be drawn

1405
02:05:57,185 --> 02:05:58,675
And that line is what we reach

1406
02:05:58,773 --> 02:06:00,212
So remember me when I'm gone

1407

When I see you again

Hey, thought you could leave without saying goodbye?

1412
02:06:25,322 --> 02:06:29,271
I used to say I lived my life a quarter mile at a time.

1413
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:32,440
And I think that's why we were brothers.

1414
02:06:33,909 --> 02:06:35,724
Because you did, too.

Wanna go for a drive?

whether it's a quarter mile away,
