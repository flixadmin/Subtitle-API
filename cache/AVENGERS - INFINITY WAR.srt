1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,736
This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.

2
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,950
We are under assault.
I repeat, we are under assault.

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,658
The engines are dead,
life support failing.

4
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,790
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.

5
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,953
We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.

6
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,582
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.

7
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,166
We have very few soldiers here.

8
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,210
This is not a warcraft.

9
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,295
I repeat, this is not a warcraft.

10
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,770
Hear me and rejoice.

11
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,818
You have had the privilege...

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,574
...of being saved
by the Great Titan.

13
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,750
You may think this is suffering.

14
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,384
No.

15
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,339
It is salvation.

16
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,930
Universal scales
tip toward balance...

17
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,758
...because of your sacrifice.

18
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,806
Smile.

19
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:50,691
For even in death,
you have become Children of Thanos.

20
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,163
I know what it's like to lose.

21
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,297
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

22
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,793
...yet to fail, nonetheless.

23
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,511
It's frightening.

24
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,813
Turns the legs to jelly.

25
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,059
But I ask you, to what end?

26
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,072
Dread it, run from it...

27
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,654
...destiny arrives all the same.

28
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,703
And now, it's here.

29
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,122
Or should I say...

30
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,950
...I am.

31
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,756
You talk too much.

32
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,509
The Tesseract.

33
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,004
Or your brother's head.

34
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,054
I assume you have a preference.

35
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,601
Oh, I do.

36
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,062
Kill away.

37
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,450
All right, stop!

38
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,963
We don't have the Tesseract.

39
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,966
It was destroyed on Asgard.

40
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,638
You really are
the worst brother.

41
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,562
I assure you, brother...

42
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,697
...the sun will shine on us again.

43
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,652
Your optimism
is misplaced, Asgardian.

44
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,786
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

45
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,161
And for another...

46
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,749
...we have a Hulk.

47
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,850
Let him have his fun.

48
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,611
Allfathers...

49
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,735
...let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

50
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,660
...time.

51
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,960
That was a mistake.

52
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,514
No!

53
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,272
You're going to die for that.

54
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,285
My humble personage...

55
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,001
...bows before your grandeur.

56
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,512
No other being
has ever had the might...

57
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,592
nay, the nobility...

58
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,685
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

59
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,565
The universe lies
within your grasp.

60
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,560
There are two more stones on Earth.

61
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,524
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

62
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,237
Father, we will not fail you.

63
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,901
If I might interject.

64
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,369
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

65
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,876
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

66
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,375
If you consider
failure experience.

67
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,207
I consider experience experience.

68
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,917
Almighty Thanos...

69
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,886
...I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

70
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,894
...Odinson...

71
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,729
...the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

72
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,228
...god of mischief...

73
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,605
...do hereby pledge to you...

74
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,902
...my undying fidelity.

75
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,955
Undying?

76
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,424
You should choose your words
more carefully.

77
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,133
You...

78
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,662
...will never be...

79
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,657
...a god.

80
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,992
No!

81
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,271
No resurrections this time.

82
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,050
No. Loki.

83
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,838
Seriously, you don't have any money?

84
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,970
Attachment to the material
is detachment from the spiritual.

85
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,430
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

86
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,469
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

87
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,479
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

88
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,743
Dollars?

89
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,148
- Rupees.
- Which is?

90
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,146
Buck and a half.

91
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,526
What do you want?

92
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,318
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

93
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,752
Thanos is coming.

94
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,538
He's coming.

95
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,131
Who?

96
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,099
Slow down, slow down.

97
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,270
- I'll spell it out for you.
- You're totally rambling.

98
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,309
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

99
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,725
Look, you know how you're having a dream,
and in the dream you gotta pee.

100
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,893
- Yeah.
- Okay.

101
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,185
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.

102
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,441
There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

103
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,521
- Oh, someone's watching.
- Right.

104
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,606
- Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants."
- And then you wake up...

105
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,903
...and in real life
you actually have to pee.

106
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,024
- Yes.
- Yeah.

107
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,213
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

108
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,078
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

109
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,409
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

110
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,209
It was so real.

111
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,996
We named him after your eccentric uncle.
What was his name?

112
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,415
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

113
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,209
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

114
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,968
...and thought that we were...

115
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,219
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

116
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,341
- Yes?
- No.

117
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,083
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

118
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,359
If you wanted to have a kid...

119
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,388
...you wouldn't have done that.

120
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,020
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

121
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,864
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

122
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,193
You're not helping
your case.

123
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,586
- No, this is detachable. It's not a...
- Okay?

124
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,135
You don't need that.

125
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,536
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just trying to protect us...

126
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,485
...and future usses and that's it.

127
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,214
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet...

128
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:26,071
- ...instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

129
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,203
You know me so well.

130
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,998
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

131
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,409
You should have shirts
in your closet.

132
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,880
Yeah.

133
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,501
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

134
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,001
We're just gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

135
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,966
Show off this Harry Winston.

136
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,385
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

137
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,590
I should promise you.

138
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,051
- Yes.
- I will.

139
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,554
Thank you.

140
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,806
Tony Stark...

141
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,972
...I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

142
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,568
Oh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

143
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,603
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets or something?

144
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,109
We need your help.

145
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,112
It's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the universe is at stake.

146
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,739
And who's "we"?

147
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,491
Hey, Tony.

148
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,697
Bruce.

149
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,491
- Pepper.
- Hi.

150
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,121
You okay?

151
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,087
At the dawn of the universe,

152
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,134
there was nothing. Then...

153
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,799
Boom.

154
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,682
...the Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

155
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,685
...hurtling across
the virgin universe.

156
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,267
These Infinity Stones...

157
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,270
...each control an essential
aspect of existence.

158
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,397
Space...

159
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,691
...Reality...

160
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,486
...Power...

161
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,863
...Soul...

162
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,157
...Mind...

163
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,322
...and Time.

164
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,166
Tell me his name again.

165
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,467
Thanos.

166
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,923
He's a plague, Tony.

167
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,880
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

168
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,265
He wipes out
half the population.

169
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,059
He sent Loki.

170
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,600
The attack on New York,
that's him.

171
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,306
This is it.

172
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,475
What's our timeline?

173
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,776
No telling. He has the Power
and Space Stones.

174
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,730
That already makes him the strongest
creature in the whole universe.

175
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,075
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

176
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,320
He could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

177
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,371
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

178
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,968
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

179
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,169
Is that what it is?

180
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,917
I'm going to allow that.

181
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,343
If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just
stick this one down a garbage disposal?

182
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:50,386
No can do.

183
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,098
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

184
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,382
And I swore off dairy...

185
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,060
...but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me, so...

186
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,602
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

187
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,138
A bit chalky.

188
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,123
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge
is our favorite.

189
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:03,233
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

190
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,397
Point is, things change.

191
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,403
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

192
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,697
And this stone may be the best chance
we have against Thanos.

193
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,651
Yeah, so conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us.

194
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,201
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

195
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,989
What is your job exactly?
Besides making balloon animals.

196
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,743
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

197
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,329
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

198
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:27,060
The fact is we have this stone.
We know where it is.

199
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,467
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

200
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,744
...and we have to find him now.

201
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,631
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?

202
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,974
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder.

203
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,176
He's offline.

204
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,511
- What?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,680
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

206
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,015
I didn't lose him.
He's more than that. He's evolving.

207
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,649
Who could find Vision then?

208
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,792
Shit.

209
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,653
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.

210
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,325
Maybe.

211
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,091
But...

212
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,532
Call him.

213
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,580
It's not that easy.

214
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,537
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

215
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,621
No.

216
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,377
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

217
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,091
Broke up?

218
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,970
Like a band? Like...
Like the Beatles?

219
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,967
Cap and I fell out hard.

220
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,137
We're not on speaking terms.

221
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,096
Tony, listen to me.

222
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,522
Thor's gone.

223
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,396
Thanos is coming.

224
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,372
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

225
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,762
Flip phone.

226
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,076
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be
moving your hair, would ya?

227
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,113
Not at the moment, no.

228
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,648
You okay?

229
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,787
- Help him!
- Banner!

230
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,527
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

231
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,816
Friday, what am I looking at?

232
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,154
Not sure. I'm working on it.

233
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,657
Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone
in your back pocket, Doc!

234
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,034
Might wanna use it.

235
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,768
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

236
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,228
Holy shit.

237
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,147
We're all gonna die!

238
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,443
There's a spaceship!

239
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,321
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

240
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,955
What's the matter with you kids?

241
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,828
You never seen
a spaceship before?

242
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,510
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

243
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,845
- Notify first responders.
- Will do.

244
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,127
Hear me and rejoice.

245
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,090
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

246
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,717
Be thankful...

247
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,428
...that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

248
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,553
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

249
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,438
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

250
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,723
Stonekeeper...

251
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,026
...does this chattering animal
speak for you?

252
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,899
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

253
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,777
You're trespassing in this city
and on this planet.

254
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,241
He means get lost, Squidward.

255
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,573
He exhausts me.

256
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,700
Bring me the stone.

257
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,789
Banner, you want a piece?

258
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,160
No, not really.

259
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,704
- But when do I ever get what I want?
- That's right.

260
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,630
Okay. Push!

261
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,256
It's been a while.

262
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,917
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

263
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,135
Okay just...

264
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,921
Let me just... I need to concentrate
here for a second.

265
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,339
Come on, come on, man.

266
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,070
God!

267
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,094
Where's your guy?

268
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,066
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

269
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:35,372
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

270
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,082
That's the thing
right there. Let's go.

271
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:45,282
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

272
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,637
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

273
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,288
It's okay.

274
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,739
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

275
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,247
- I have him.
- Damn it.

276
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,106
Where'd that come from?

277
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,741
It's nanotech. You like it?
A little something I...

278
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,695
Doctor Banner, if the rest of
your green friend won't be joining us...

279
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,713
We got to get that stone
outta here, now.

280
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,263
It stays with me.

281
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,633
Exactly. Bye.

282
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,185
Tony, you okay?

283
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,313
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.

284
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,689
Really good. Do you plan
on helping out?

285
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,978
I'm trying. He won't come out.

286
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,943
Hammer.

287
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,571
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

288
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,865
Come out! Come out! Come out!

289
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,250
No!

290
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,918
What do you mean, "no"?

291
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,460
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

292
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,263
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.

293
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,366
What is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

294
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,931
He's from space.

295
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,982
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

296
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,469
Your powers are quaint.

297
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,297
You must be popular with children.

298
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,055
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

299
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,186
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

300
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:37,410
You'll find removing a dead man's
spell troublesome.

301
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,160
You'll only wish you were dead.

302
00:23:49,935 --> 00:23:50,966
No!

303
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,090
Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

304
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,804
On it!

305
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,600
Not cool.

306
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,014
Gotcha!

307
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,609
Wait!

308
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,661
Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

309
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,166
Hang on, kid.

310
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,851
Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

311
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,726
Give me a little juice, Friday.

312
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,873
Unlock 17:A.

313
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,743
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

314
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:23,724
But you said save the wizard!

315
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,485
I can't breathe.

316
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,257
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

317
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,310
Yeah. That makes sense.

318
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,496
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

319
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,709
Happy trails, kid.

320
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,211
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.

321
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,634
Oh, come on!

322
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,054
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

323
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,938
Tony? Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

324
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,978
- What's going on?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just think...

325
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:12,317
- ...we might have to push our 8:30 res.
- Why?

326
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,400
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for a while.

327
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,816
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.

328
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,242
God, no, please tell me...

329
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,140
- ...you're not on the ship.
- Honey, I'm sorry.

330
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,409
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

331
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,830
Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God...

332
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,915
- Pep.
- ...come back here right now.

333
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,034
Come back...

334
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,100
Boss, we 're losing her.

335
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,334
...I'm going too...

336
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,673
Oh, my God!

337
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,104
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

338
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,820
Where you going?

339
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,489
The Time Stone's been taken.

340
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,578
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

341
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,667
What will you do?

342
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,124
I'm gonna make a call.

343
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,583
Sing it, Drax!

344
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,551
Why are we doing this again?

345
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,345
It's a distress signal, Rocket.

346
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,429
Someone could be dying.

347
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:15,645
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.

348
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,730
And maybe whoever it is will give us
a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

349
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,071
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

350
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,153
- I mean, if he doesn't pony up...
- We take his ship.

351
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,989
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

352
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,194
All right!

353
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,831
We are arriving.

354
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,452
All right, Guardians, don't forget
this might be dangerous...

355
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,917
...so let's put on our mean faces.

356
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,715
Groot, put that thing away, now.

357
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,901
I don't wanna tell you again.

358
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:46,005
Groot.

359
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,382
- I am Groot!
- Wow! Language!

360
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,849
Hey!

361
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,681
You got some acorns on you, kid.

362
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,472
Ever since you got a little sap,
you're a total d-hole.

363
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,685
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash
that thing to pieces.

364
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,155
What happened?

365
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,539
Oh, my God.

366
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,872
Looks like we're not getting paid.

367
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,092
Wipers! Wipers!

368
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,549
Get it off.

369
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,971
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

370
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,934
He is not a dude.

371
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,645
You're a dude.

372
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:42,024
This... This is a man.

373
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,148
A handsome, muscular man.

374
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,400
- I'm muscular.
- But who are you kidding, Quill?

375
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,944
- You're one sandwich away from fat.
- Yeah, right.

376
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,619
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

377
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,954
What?

378
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,750
Gamora, do you think I'm...

379
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,631
He is anxious, angry.

380
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,668
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.

381
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,297
It's like a pirate
had a baby with an angel.

382
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,425
This is a real
wake-up call for me. Okay.

383
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,310
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

384
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,649
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

385
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:18,249
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?

386
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,634
It's like his muscles are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

387
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:23,485
Stop massaging his muscles.

388
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,980
Wake him up.

389
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,212
Wake.

390
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,920
Who the hell are you guys?

391
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,344
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

392
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,477
To bring balance to the universe
by wiping out half of all life.

393
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,608
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

394
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,060
massacre by massacre.

395
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,729
Including my own.

396
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,489
If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

397
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,865
...he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

398
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,453
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

399
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,412
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

400
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,546
Your father killed my brother.

401
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,089
Oh, boy.

402
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,920
Stepfather, technically.

403
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,006
And she hates him
as much as you do.

404
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,261
Families can be tough.

405
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,594
Before my father died,
he told me that I had a half-sister...

406
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,013
...that he imprisoned in Hel.

407
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,149
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

408
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,605
So I had to kill her.

409
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,816
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

410
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,500
Goes round and round and...

411
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,085
I feel your pain.

412
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,446
I feel your pain as well,
because...

413
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,155
I mean, it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

414
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,825
My father killed my mother...

415
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,699
...and then I had to kill my father...
...and that was hard.

416
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,744
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

417
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,164
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

418
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,049
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

419
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,970
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of...

420
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,053
...a four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

421
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,512
- What are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

422
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,017
No, you're not.

423
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:29,020
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

424
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,899
Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

425
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,444
- No.
- You are.

426
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,329
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

427
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,660
No, I'm not.

428
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,871
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

429
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,145
Are you mocking me?

430
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,423
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

431
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,180
- He's trying to copy me.
- I need you to stop doing that.

432
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,799
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

433
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,341
We need to stop Thanos.

434
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,130
Which means we need to find out...

435
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,554
- ...where he's going next.
- Knowhere.

436
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,393
He must be going somewhere.

437
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,558
No, no. Knowhere...

438
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,398
...it's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

439
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,984
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

440
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,571
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

441
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,906
Because for years...

442
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,979
...the Reality Stone's been
safely stored...

443
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:21,767
...there with a man
called the Collector.

444
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,857
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

445
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,626
Only an idiot would give
that man a stone.

446
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,101
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

447
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,592
...he's not going
for one of the other stones?

448
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,166
There are six stones out there.

449
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,551
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

450
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,009
...because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

451
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,512
He stole the Space Stone from me...

452
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,347
...when he destroyed my ship
and slaughtered half my people.

453
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,738
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

454
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,777
- The Avengers?
- The Earth's mightiest heroes.

455
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,100
Like Kevin Bacon?

456
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,850
He may be on the team. I don't know.
I haven't been there in a while.

457
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,417
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

458
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:56,929
No one even knows where it is.

459
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,734
Therefore Thanos can't get it...

460
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,431
...therefore he's going to Knowhere...

461
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,867
...hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

462
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:03,966
You're welcome.

463
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,679
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

464
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:09,634
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

465
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:11,594
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

466
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,841
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

467
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,977
I mean that place is a legend.
They make the most...

468
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:20,306
...powerful, horrific weapons
to ever torment the universe.

469
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,554
I would very much like
to go there, please.

470
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:23,796
The rabbit is correct
and clearly...

471
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,273
- ...the smartest among you.
- Rabbit?

472
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:28,388
Only Eitri the Dwarf
can make me the weapon I need.

473
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,000
- I assume you're the captain, sir.
- You're very perceptive.

474
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,317
You seem like a noble leader.

475
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,154
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

476
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,943
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

477
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,858
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

478
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,235
- Except for that I'm the captain.
- Quiet.

479
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,911
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

480
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,697
Look, this is my ship.

481
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,615
And I'm not goin' to...

482
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,709
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

483
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,119
The Thanos-killing kind.

484
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,942
Don't you think that we should all
have a weapon like that?

485
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:55,941
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

486
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:58,569
Your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed into madness.

487
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:00,402
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

488
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,593
A little bit, yeah.

489
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,683
If we don't go to Knowhere
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

490
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,389
...he'll be too powerful to stop.

491
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,725
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

492
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,057
We got two ships
and a large assortment of morons.

493
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,478
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here...

494
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,488
...and the morons will go to Knowhere
to try to stop Thanos.

495
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,569
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

496
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,030
For the record...

497
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,462
...I know that you're only going with him
because it's where Thanos isn't.

498
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:29,122
You know, you really shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.

499
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,459
Come on, Groot.

500
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,713
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

501
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,261
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

502
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,546
Bye.

503
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,437
Vis?

504
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,818
Is it the stone again?

505
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,608
It's as if it's speaking to me.

506
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,951
What does it say?

507
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,204
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

508
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,659
Hey.

509
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,005
Tell me what you feel.

510
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,730
I just feel you.

511
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,819
So there's a 10:00 a.m. to Glasgow...

512
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,252
...which would give us more time
together before you went back.

513
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:48,909
- What if I miss that train?
- There's an 11:00.

514
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,369
What if I missed all the trains?

515
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,459
What if this time
I didn't go back?

516
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,292
- But you gave Stark your word.
- I'd rather give it to you.

517
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,773
Well, there are people
who are expecting me too, you know.

518
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:02,801
- We both made promises.
- Not to each other.

519
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,437
Wanda...

520
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,513
...for two years,
we've stolen these moments...

521
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,721
...trying to see
if this could work and...

522
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,476
I don't know.

523
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,603
You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

524
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,476
I think...

525
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,731
- It works.
- It works.

526
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,187
It works.

527
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,895
Stay.

528
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,485
Stay with me.

529
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,490
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

530
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,290
What are they?

531
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,046
What the stone
was warning me about.

532
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,353
I have to go.

533
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,818
No, Vision...

534
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,306
Vision, if that's true,

535
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,331
then... then maybe going
isn't the best idea.

536
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,319
Wanda, I...

537
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,527
Vision!

538
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,348
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

539
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,630
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

540
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,025
My systems are failing.

541
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,990
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

542
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,365
Vis!

543
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,621
Give up the stone, and she lives.

544
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,958
Hands off.

545
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,009
Come on. Come on.

546
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,973
Come on, you gotta get up.

547
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,355
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

548
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,854
Hey. We have to go.

549
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,362
Please. Please leave.

550
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,276
You asked me to stay.

551
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,696
- I'm staying.
- Please.

552
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,606
- Get up.
- I can't.

553
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,484
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

554
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,816
You'll never get
the chance again.

555
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,333
Can you stand?

556
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,506
Thank you, Captain.

557
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,840
Let's get you on the jet.

558
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,226
Now, I thought we had a deal.

559
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,109
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

560
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,610
I'm sorry.

561
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,566
We just wanted time.

562
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,525
Where to, Cap?

563
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,862
Home.

564
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,498
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

565
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,250
Zehobereians...

566
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,021
Mother! Where's my mother?

567
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,530
...choose a side or die.

568
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,156
Mother!

569
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,489
One side is a revelation...

570
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,700
...the other an honor
known only to a few.

571
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,081
What's wrong, little one?

572
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,123
My mother. Where is my mother?

573
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,133
What's your name?

574
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,132
Gamora.

575
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,756
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

576
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,990
Come. Let me help you.

577
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,316
Look.

578
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,658
Pretty, isn't it?

579
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,875
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

580
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,788
Too much to one side
or the other...

581
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,636
Here. You try.

582
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,476
Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.

583
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,270
Concentrate.

584
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,027
There. You've got it.

585
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,624
Gamora...

586
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,860
...do you know if these grenades...

587
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,210
...are the blow-off-your-junk kind
or the gas kind?

588
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,965
Because I was thinking about
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

589
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,524
- But I don't want to if they're the...
- I need to ask a favor.

590
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,719
Yeah, sure.

591
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,675
One way or another,
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

592
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,810
Which is what the grenades are for.

593
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,189
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

594
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,781
If things go wrong...

595
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,276
If Thanos gets me...

596
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,786
...I want you to promise me...

597
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,947
...you'll kill me.

598
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,806
What?

599
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,247
I know something he doesn't.

600
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:25,000
And if he finds it out,
the entire universe could be at risk.

601
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,220
What do you know?

602
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,427
If I tell you, you'd know too.

603
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,311
If it's so important...

604
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,813
- ...shouldn't I?
- Only if you wanna die.

605
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,021
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

606
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,004
Just...

607
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,398
...trust me,
and possibly kill me.

608
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,908
I mean, I'd like to...

609
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,911
...I really would. But you...

610
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,287
Swear to me.

611
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,081
Swear to me on your mother.

612
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,352
Okay.

613
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,300
Okay.

614
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,571
Dude...

615
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,334
...how long have you been
standing there?

616
00:46:31,376 --> 00:46:34,002
- An hour.
- An hour?

617
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,911
Are you serious?

618
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,247
I've mastered the ability...

619
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,999
...of standing
so incredibly still...

620
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,799
...that I become
invisible to the eye.

621
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,476
Watch.

622
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,931
You're eating a zarg-nut.

623
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,804
But my movement...

624
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,261
...was so slow...

625
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,938
...that it's imperceptible.

626
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,526
No.

627
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,856
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.

628
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,581
Damn it.

629
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,211
This place looks deserted.

630
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,130
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

631
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,219
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

632
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,100
Let's put down right here.

633
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,402
I don't have it.

634
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,741
Everyone in the galaxy knows
you'd sell your own brother...

635
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,781
...if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

636
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,619
...to your pathetic collection.

637
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,838
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

638
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,264
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

639
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,102
I told you...

640
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,000
...I sold it.

641
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,767
Why would I lie?

642
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,152
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

643
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,696
Like suicide.

644
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,356
So you do understand.

645
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,319
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

646
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,862
I didn't know what it was.

647
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,832
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

648
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,200
It's him.

649
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,834
Last chance, charlatan.

650
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,338
Where's the stone?

651
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,736
Today...

652
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:49,916
Drax. Drax.

653
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:52,051
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

654
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,173
Drax, wait.

655
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,465
Not yet, not yet, not yet. Drax.

656
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,596
Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

657
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,015
He doesn't have the stone yet.

658
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,809
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

659
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,817
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

660
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,072
No.

661
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:16,280
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

662
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,031
Sleep.

663
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,975
Okay.

664
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,220
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

665
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,839
The other right.

666
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,873
Why?

667
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,971
Why you, daughter?

668
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,715
That was quick.

669
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:48,244
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

670
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,297
Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?

671
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,920
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.

672
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,556
But one never knows for sure.

673
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,617
Reality is often disappointing.

674
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,031
That is, it was.

675
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,451
Now...

676
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,252
...reality can be whatever I want.

677
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,258
You knew I'd come.

678
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,045
I counted on it.

679
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,761
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

680
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,104
Thanos!

681
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,733
No!

682
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,702
Let her go, Grimace.

683
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,306
Peter...

684
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,865
I told you to go right.

685
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,825
Now? Really?

686
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,414
You let her go!

687
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,545
Ah, the boyfriend.

688
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:15,769
No.

689
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,044
Like to think of myself more...

690
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,592
...as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

691
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,799
- Let her go.
- Peter...

692
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:26,682
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

693
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,759
Not him.

694
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,948
You promised. You promised.

695
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,328
Oh, daughter...

696
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,283
...you expect too much from him.

697
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,462
She's asked, hasn't she?

698
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,417
Do it.

699
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,179
Do it!

700
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,354
I told you to go right.

701
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,279
I love you more than anything.

702
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,901
I love you too.

703
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,253
I like him.

704
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,915
Still no word from Vision?

705
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,660
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

706
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:21,209
On a stolen Quinjet with four
of the world's most wanted criminals.

707
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,181
You know they're only
criminals because...

708
00:54:23,186 --> 00:54:25,237
...you've chosen 
to call them that, right, sir?

709
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:28,737
My God, Rhodes.
Your talent for horseshit...

710
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,790
...rivals my own.

711
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:32,496
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

712
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,229
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

713
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,789
That's right.

714
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,567
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

715
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,943
You have second thoughts?

716
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,820
Not anymore.

717
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,244
Mr. Secretary.

718
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,455
You got some nerve.

719
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,745
I'll give you that.

720
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,664
You could use
some of that right now.

721
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,750
The world's on fire...

722
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,636
...and you think all is forgiven?

723
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,090
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

724
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,300
And I'm way past
asking permission.

725
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,308
Earth just lost her best defender.

726
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,022
So we're here to fight.

727
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,521
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

728
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,441
...we'll fight you too.

729
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,049
Arrest them.

730
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,411
All over it.

731
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,867
That's a court-martial.

732
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,647
It's great to see you, Cap.

733
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,207
You too, Rhodey.

734
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,295
Hey.

735
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,924
Wow. You guys...

736
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,756
...really look like crap.

737
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,516
Must've been a rough couple years.

738
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,348
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

739
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,976
I think you look great.

740
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,110
Yeah, I'm back.

741
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,974
Hi, Bruce.

742
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,343
Nat.

743
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,290
This is awkward.

744
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,686
So we got to assume
they're coming back, right?

745
00:56:28,728 --> 00:56:29,921
And they can clearly find us.

746
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:32,052
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

747
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,422
After the whole Accords situation,
he and Scott took a deal.

748
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:37,315
It was too tough on their families.
They're on house arrest.

749
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:38,555
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

750
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,185
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

751
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,141
Okay, look...

752
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,220
...Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

753
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,648
...and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

754
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,940
- ...Vision's stone.
- Then we have to protect it.

755
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,734
No, we have to destroy it.

756
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,440
I've been giving a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.

757
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,100
About its... nature.

758
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,663
But also its composition.

759
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,828
I think if it were exposed...

760
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,755
...to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

761
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,759
...something very similar
to its own signature, perhaps...

762
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,509
...its molecular integrity could fail.

763
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,299
Yeah, and you with it.

764
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,380
We're not having
this conversation.

765
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,470
Eliminating the stone
is the only way...

766
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,472
...to be certain
that Thanos can't get it.

767
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,232
That's too high a price.

768
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,107
Only you have the power to pay it.

769
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,409
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

770
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,119
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

771
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,704
But it should.

772
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,579
We don't trade lives, Vision.

773
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,714
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

774
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,670
...to save how many
millions of people?

775
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,881
Tell me, why is this any different?

776
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,342
Because you might have a choice.

777
00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,973
Your mind is made up...

778
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,560
...of a complex construct
of overlays.

779
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,188
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

780
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,000
All of them mixed together,
all of them learning from one another.

781
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,811
You're saying Vision
isn't just the stone?

782
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:15,072
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

783
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,738
...there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

784
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,459
Perhaps the best parts.

785
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,868
Can we do that?

786
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,615
Not me, not here.

787
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,412
Well, you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

788
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,251
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys
have your old rooms back.

789
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,881
I know somewhere.

790
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,145
The Kingsguard and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

791
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,854
And the Border Tribe?

792
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,902
Those that are left.

793
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,313
Send word to the Jabari as well.

794
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,573
M'Baku likes a good fight.

795
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,578
And what of this one?

796
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,322
This one may be tired of war.

797
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,705
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

798
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,941
Where's the fight?

799
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,273
On its way.

800
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,256
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

801
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,127
...I have never failed him.

802
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,310
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

803
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,062
...with the Time Stone
still attached...

804
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,310
...to your vaguely
irritating person...

805
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:15,067
...there would be judgment.

806
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:25,198
Give me...

807
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,472
...the stone.

808
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,055
Wow, you're a seriously
loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

809
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,216
Yeah, speaking of loyalty...

810
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:48,801
What the... Stop.

811
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,871
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

812
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,088
- I was gonna go home...
- I don't wanna hear it.

813
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,097
...but it was such a long way
down and I just thought...

814
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,431
- ...about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

815
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:55,753
...and kinda stuck
to the side of the ship.

816
01:00:55,795 --> 01:00:58,469
And this suit is
ridiculously intuitive...

817
01:00:58,511 --> 01:00:58,965
- ...by the way, so...
- Goddamn it.

818
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,860
...if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

819
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,595
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

820
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,821
And now, I'm here in space.

821
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,407
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

822
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,663
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

823
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,073
This is a one-way ticket.

824
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,704
You hear me? Don't pretend...

825
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:14,067
- ...you thought this through.
- No, I did think this through.

826
01:01:14,109 --> 01:01:15,495
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

827
01:01:15,498 --> 01:01:17,266
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

828
01:01:17,482 --> 01:01:18,922
...if there's no neighborhood.

829
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,863
Okay, that didn't really make sense,
but you know what I'm trying to say.

830
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,632
Come on. We got a situation.

831
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,719
See him down there?
He's in trouble. What's your plan?

832
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,974
Go.

833
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,059
Okay, okay...

834
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,567
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?

835
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,364
Painful, aren't they?

836
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,118
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

837
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,870
And any one of them...

838
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,169
...could end your friend's life
in an instant.

839
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:00,438
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.

840
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,212
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.

841
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,754
You've saved nothing.

842
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,932
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

843
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,969
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

844
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,322
Yes! Wait. What are those?

845
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,677
Hey, we haven't officially met.

846
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,054
Cool.

847
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,515
We gotta turn this ship around.

848
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,681
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

849
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,219
No, I want to protect the stone.

850
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,604
And I want you to thank me.

851
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,181
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

852
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,067
For what? Nearly blasting me
into space?

853
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,478
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

854
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:07,317
I seriously don't know how you fit
your head into that helmet.

855
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,541
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

856
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:11,154
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

857
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,558
Unlike everyone else in your life,
I don't work for you.

858
01:03:13,558 --> 01:03:16,247
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut...

859
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,323
...billions of miles
from Earth with no backup.

860
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,127
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

861
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,558
The adults are talking.

862
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,089
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

863
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,875
What is he, your ward?

864
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,156
No.

865
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,420
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

866
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,304
Oh, you're using
our made-up names.

867
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,473
I'm Spider-Man, then.

868
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,000
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

869
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:38,895
- Thing's on autopilot.
- Can we control it?

870
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,976
Fly us home?

871
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:44,977
- Stark?
- Yeah.

872
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,395
Can you get us home?

873
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,813
Yeah, I heard you.

874
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,575
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

875
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:56,367
Under no circumstances can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

876
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,782
I don't think you quite understand
what's at stake here.

877
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,420
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

878
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,205
...that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years...

879
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,587
...since he sent an army
to New York and now he's back.

880
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,672
I don't know what to do.

881
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,057
So I'm not so sure...

882
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:13,054
...if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

883
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:16,676
...but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

884
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,060
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

885
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,972
So I say we take the fight to him.

886
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,337
Doctor...

887
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,522
...do you concur?

888
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,573
All right, Stark. We go to him.

889
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,697
But you have to understand...

890
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,532
...if it comes to saving you...

891
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,120
...or the kid or the Time Stone...

892
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,083
...I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

893
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:46,585
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

894
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,042
Nice. Good, moral compass.

895
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,836
We're straight.

896
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,463
All right, kid.

897
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,803
You're an Avenger now.

898
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,676
I thought you might be hungry.

899
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,356
I always hated that chair.

900
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,609
So I've been told.

901
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:57,197
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit
in it one day.

902
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,444
I hated this room.

903
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,659
This ship.

904
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,619
I hated my life.

905
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,288
You told me that too.

906
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,835
Every day...

907
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,597
...for almost 20 years.

908
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,557
I was a child when you took me.

909
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,726
I saved you.

910
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,408
No.

911
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,273
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

912
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,608
Going to bed hungry...

913
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,822
...scrounging for scraps.

914
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,905
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

915
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,036
I'm the one who stopped that.

916
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,375
Do you know what's
happened since then?

917
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,161
The children born...

918
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,165
...have known nothing
but full bellies and clear skies.

919
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,583
It's a paradise.

920
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,129
Because you murdered
half the planet.

921
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,132
A small price to pay
for salvation.

922
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,652
You're insane.

923
01:07:03,694 --> 01:07:05,477
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

924
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:08,393
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

925
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,942
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

926
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,485
It needs correction.

927
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:15,979
You don't know that!

928
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,566
I'm the only one who knows that.

929
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,575
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

930
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,745
For a time...

931
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:34,040
...you had that same will...

932
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,047
...as you fought by my side...

933
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,965
...daughter.

934
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,551
I'm not your daughter.

935
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,678
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

936
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,934
And, in doing so,

937
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,231
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

938
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,984
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

939
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,869
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

940
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,159
I am disappointed.

941
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,417
But not because
you didn't find it...

942
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,748
...but because you did...

943
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,959
...and you lied.

944
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,185
Nebula...

945
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,785
Don't do this.

946
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,161
Some time ago,

947
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,956
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me...

948
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,116
Please don't do this.

949
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,497
...and very nearly succeeded.

950
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,628
So I brought her here...

951
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,415
...to talk.

952
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,471
Stop. Stop it.

953
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,691
I swear to you on my life...

954
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,482
...I never found the Soul Stone.

955
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:25,200
Accessing memory files.

956
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,701
You know what he's about to do.

957
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,454
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.

958
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,096
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.

959
01:09:31,102 --> 01:09:33,718
- He will!
- He can't, Nebula.

960
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,419
Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...

961
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,377
...and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.

962
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,216
You're strong.

963
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,432
Me.

964
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,436
You're generous.

965
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,021
Me.

966
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:00,189
But I never taught you to lie.

967
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,980
That's why you're so bad at it.

968
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:09,741
Where is the Soul Stone?

969
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,722
Vormir!

970
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:47,866
The stone is on Vormir.

971
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,367
Show me.

972
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,791
I am Groot.

973
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,076
Tinkle in the cup.

974
01:10:58,088 --> 01:10:59,693
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

975
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:01,834
What's a twig? Everybody's seen
a twig before.

976
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,089
I am Groot.

977
01:11:03,103 --> 01:11:06,022
Tree, pour what's in the cup
out into space and go in the cup again.

978
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,385
You speak Groot?

979
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,536
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

980
01:11:09,578 --> 01:11:10,783
I am Groot.

981
01:11:10,825 --> 01:11:12,716
You'll know when we're close.

982
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:16,769
Nidavellir's forge harnesses
the blazing power of a neutron star.

983
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,600
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

984
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,061
It's truly awesome.

985
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,237
Okay, time to be the captain.

986
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,788
So, dead brother, huh?

987
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,295
Yeah, that could be annoying.

988
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,665
Well, he's been dead before.

989
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,672
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

990
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,470
And you said
your sister and your dad...

991
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:52,927
Both dead.

992
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,220
But still got a mom, though?

993
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,968
Killed by a dark elf.

994
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,369
A best friend?

995
01:11:58,411 --> 01:11:59,603
Stabbed through the heart.

996
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,148
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

997
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,863
Absolutely.

998
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,680
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

999
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,286
...they're all tremendous motivators.

1000
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:18,157
They really clear the mind.
So I'm good to go.

1001
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,997
Yeah, but... I mean this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

1002
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,749
...he's the toughest there is.

1003
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,960
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

1004
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,669
He's never fought me twice.

1005
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,043
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1006
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:32,462
It better be some hammer.

1007
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,969
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1008
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,684
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that...

1009
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,890
...and every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1010
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:45,070
but none succeeded.

1011
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,483
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

1012
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:51,793
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1013
01:12:51,795 --> 01:12:53,761
...and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1014
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:55,447
Fate wills it so.

1015
01:12:56,765 --> 01:12:58,597
And what if you're wrong?

1016
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,872
If I'm wrong, then...

1017
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,708
...what more could I lose?

1018
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:21,886
I could lose a lot.

1019
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:24,097
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

1020
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,993
Okay.

1021
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,650
Well...

1022
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,073
...if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

1023
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,225
...you're gonna need
more than one stupid eyeball.

1024
01:13:36,267 --> 01:13:38,111
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

1025
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,868
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

1026
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,289
He gave you his eye?

1027
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,575
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1028
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,711
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1029
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:49,873
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1030
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,846
I would've washed that.

1031
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:03,395
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

1032
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:05,855
Hey, we're here!

1033
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,792
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

1034
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,491
It ain't the eye.

1035
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,205
Something's wrong.

1036
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,545
The star's gone out...

1037
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,150
...and the rings are frozen.

1038
01:14:57,118 --> 01:15:00,402
I hope these dwarves are better
at forging than they are cleaning.

1039
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,747
Maybe they realized that they live
in a junk pile in the middle of space.

1040
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,879
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1041
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,793
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

1042
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,132
Yes, why?

1043
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,342
It look anything like that?

1044
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,510
I am Groot.

1045
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,178
Go back to the pod.

1046
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,228
Eitri, wait!

1047
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,336
Stop!

1048
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:36,259
Stop.

1049
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,140
Thor?

1050
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,568
What happened here?

1051
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,284
You were supposed to protect us!

1052
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,825
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1053
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,210
Asgard is destroyed.

1054
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:57,300
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

1055
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,058
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1056
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,358
I thought if I did
what he asked, they'd be safe.

1057
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,323
I made what he wanted.

1058
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:27,372
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1059
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,360
Then he...

1060
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,504
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1061
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,378
All except me.

1062
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,336
"Your life is yours," he said.

1063
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,599
"But your hands...
Your hands are mine alone."

1064
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,552
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1065
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,769
Every weapon you've ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword...

1066
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,150
...it's all inside your head.

1067
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,940
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1068
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:00,651
Trust me, I know.

1069
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:05,827
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

1070
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,615
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1071
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,996
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1072
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:58,663
Hey, what's going on?

1073
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,047
I think we're here.

1074
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,675
I don't think this rig
has a self-park function.

1075
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,047
Get your hand inside
the steering gimbal.

1076
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:07,091
Close those around it.

1077
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,802
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1078
01:18:09,808 --> 01:18:11,324
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta...

1079
01:18:11,327 --> 01:18:13,329
- ...move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

1080
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,649
We might wanna turn.

1081
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,059
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1082
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:51,507
You all right?

1083
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,268
That was close.

1084
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,888
I owe you one.

1085
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,481
Let me just say, if aliens...

1086
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,705
...wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

1087
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:03,873
- ...and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I do not want another...

1088
01:19:03,915 --> 01:19:05,754
...single pop culture 
reference out of you...

1089
01:19:05,796 --> 01:19:06,825
...for the rest of the trip. 
You understand?

1090
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,590
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1091
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,832
Thanos!

1092
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,639
Please don't put your eggs in me!

1093
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,609
Stay down, clown.

1094
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,908
Die, blanket of death!

1095
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,747
Everybody stay where you are.
Chill the eff out.

1096
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,954
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1097
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:04,956
Where is Gamora?

1098
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,626
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

1099
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:10,716
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

1100
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,800
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you...

1101
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,309
...I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

1102
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,143
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1103
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,313
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1104
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,473
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1105
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,824
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me
where she is? That's fine.

1106
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,820
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1107
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:28,980
Starting with you.

1108
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,155
Wait, what, Thanos?

1109
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,324
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1110
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,489
What master do you serve?

1111
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,454
What master do I serve?
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1112
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,543
You're from Earth.

1113
01:20:39,545 --> 01:20:40,625
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1114
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,164
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?

1115
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,087
So you're not with Thanos?

1116
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,381
With Thanos?

1117
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,551
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1118
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,553
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1119
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,097
We're the Avengers, man.

1120
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,471
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1121
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,805
You know Thor?

1122
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,060
Yeah.

1123
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:02,605
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1124
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:04,436
Where is he now?

1125
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,397
This is the plan?
We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1126
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:22,749
It's a mold.

1127
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,998
A king's weapon.

1128
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,796
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1129
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,292
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1130
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,926
Did it have a name?

1131
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,342
Storm breaker.

1132
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:36,923
That's a bit much.

1133
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,058
So how do we make it?

1134
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,104
You'll have to restart the forge.

1135
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,274
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1136
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,522
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1137
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,160
The hell happened to this planet?

1138
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,116
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1139
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:02,414
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1140
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,540
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1141
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:10,123
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1142
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,814
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1143
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:14,504
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

1144
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:17,300
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.
We just want the gauntlet.

1145
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:19,870
Are you yawning?

1146
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,514
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?

1147
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:23,883
Did you hear what I said?

1148
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,722
I stopped listening after you said,
"We need a plan."

1149
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,323
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1150
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:30,985
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1151
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:32,645
What exactly is it that they do?

1152
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:35,815
- Kick names, take ass.
- Yeah, that's right.

1153
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,142
All right, just get
over here, please.

1154
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,204
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1155
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,540
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1156
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,544
We gotta coalesce.

1157
01:22:52,548 --> 01:22:54,525
'Cause if all we come out at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1158
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:56,798
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1159
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,133
We don't know what it means.

1160
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,140
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan.

1161
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,768
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1162
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,848
...and that way
it might be really good.

1163
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:08,095
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1164
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,496
- What dance-off?
- It's not a... It's not a dance-off.

1165
01:23:10,498 --> 01:23:12,978
- Like in Footloose, the movie?
- Exactly like Footloose.

1166
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,534
Is it still the greatest
movie in history?

1167
01:23:15,538 --> 01:23:16,586
It never was.

1168
01:23:16,588 --> 01:23:17,528
Don't encourage this, all right?

1169
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:18,945
- Okay.
- We're getting no help...

1170
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,712
- ...from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1171
01:23:20,754 --> 01:23:22,386
By the way, that's a compliment.

1172
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,618
Don't forget, I'm half human.
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1173
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,029
...that's 100% you.

1174
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:30,624
- Your math is blowing my mind.
- Excuse me...

1175
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:35,045
...but does your friend
often do that?

1176
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,757
Strange, we all right?

1177
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,101
You're back. You're all right.

1178
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,978
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

1179
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:56,150
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1180
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:00,491
To see all the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.

1181
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:02,576
How many did you see?

1182
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,987
14,000,605.

1183
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,078
How many did we win?

1184
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:14,000
One.

1185
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,896
The stone had better be up there.

1186
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,821
For your sister's sake.

1187
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:08,469
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1188
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:13,807
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1189
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:15,145
You know us?

1190
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:19,859
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1191
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,026
Where is the Soul Stone?

1192
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,404
You should know...

1193
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:28,196
...it extracts a terrible price.

1194
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,123
I am prepared.

1195
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:35,999
We all think that at first.

1196
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,839
We are all wrong.

1197
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,773
How is it you know
this place so well?

1198
01:25:56,943 --> 01:26:01,278
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1199
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,448
I even held one in my hand.

1200
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:08,657
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1201
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:12,869
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1202
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,506
What you seek lies in front of you.

1203
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,588
As does what you fear.

1204
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,446
What's this?

1205
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,846
The price.

1206
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:36,639
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1207
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:41,736
You might say
it has a certain... wisdom.

1208
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,947
Tell me what it needs.

1209
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,655
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1210
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,366
...understands its power...

1211
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:56,075
...the stone demands a sacrifice.

1212
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,889
Of what?

1213
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,170
In order to take the stone,

1214
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,669
you must lose
that which you love.

1215
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:06,881
A soul...

1216
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:08,796
...for a soul.

1217
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:27,080
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

1218
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,191
...a moment...

1219
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:32,619
...when you got what you deserved.

1220
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,120
And I was always so disappointed.

1221
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:42,170
But now...

1222
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:49,219
You kill and torture...

1223
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,174
...and you call it mercy.

1224
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,354
The universe has judged you.

1225
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:05,402
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1226
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,438
You failed.

1227
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:11,692
And do you wanna know why?

1228
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,494
Because you love nothing.

1229
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,823
No one.

1230
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,625
No.

1231
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,355
Really?

1232
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,386
Tears?

1233
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:34,139
They're not for him.

1234
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:49,612
No.

1235
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,528
This isn't love.

1236
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:56,073
I ignored my destiny once.

1237
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,704
I cannot do that again.

1238
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:04,579
Even... for you.

1239
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,147
I'm sorry, little one.

1240
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,235
No!

1241
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:16,676
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1242
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:18,086
I hope you're right about this.

1243
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:21,131
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

1244
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:39,707
When you said we were going to open Wakanda
to the rest of the world...

1245
01:31:39,749 --> 01:31:41,784
...this is not what I imagined.

1246
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,912
And what did you imagine?

1247
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:45,197
The Olympics.

1248
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,116
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1249
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:04,132
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.

1250
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,468
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1251
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,763
What are you doing?

1252
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,849
We don't do that here.

1253
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,268
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1254
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:17,438
Sir... Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1255
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:18,605
How we looking?

1256
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,657
You will have my Kingsguard,

1257
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:23,702
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

1258
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:27,577
A semi-stable
100-year-old man.

1259
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:31,623
How you been, Buck?

1260
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,914
Not bad, for the end of the world.

1261
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:50,186
The structure is polymorphic.

1262
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,515
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1263
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:57,978
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses to work collectively?

1264
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:02,317
Because we... didn't think of it?

1265
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,030
I'm sure you did your best.

1266
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:05,410
Can you do it?

1267
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:09,619
Yes, but there are more
than two trillion neurons here.

1268
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:12,956
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1269
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:14,419
It will take time, brother.

1270
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:18,664
- How long?
- As long as you can give me.

1271
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,346
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1272
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,487
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1273
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:55,835
God, I love this place.

1274
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:57,621
Yeah, don't start
celebrating yet, guys.

1275
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,626
We got more incoming
outside the dome.

1276
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:19,943
It's too late.

1277
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,800
We need to destroy the stone now.

1278
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,440
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

1279
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:25,948
We will hold them off.

1280
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:29,532
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1281
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:30,972
...you blow it to hell.

1282
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:32,205
I will.

1283
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:35,163
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...

1284
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,376
...and get this man a shield.

1285
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:50,090
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.

1286
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,980
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...

1287
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:55,431
...you're gonna need something
a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

1288
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:57,602
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1289
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:00,893
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1290
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,880
Fire the engines!

1291
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,551
More power, rabbit!

1292
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,792
Well done, boy.

1293
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,504
That's Nidavellir.

1294
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:28,639
Damn it.

1295
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:30,528
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1296
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:32,113
The mechanism is crippled.

1297
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:33,614
- What?
- With the iris closed...

1298
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:34,820
...I can't heat the metal.

1299
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,513
How long will it take to heat it?

1300
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:39,033
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1301
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,370
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.

1302
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,960
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1303
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:56,803
How we looking, Bruce?

1304
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:58,639
Yeah, I think I'm getting
the hang of it.

1305
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:04,023
Wow! This is amazing, man!

1306
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,021
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...

1307
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:12,073
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1308
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:15,889
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through the tree line.

1309
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,315
Thank you for standing with us.

1310
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:47,998
Of course, brother.

1311
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:09,915
Where's your other friend?

1312
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:13,043
You will pay for his life with yours.

1313
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,217
Thanos will have that stone.

1314
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:18,472
That's not gonna happen.

1315
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,930
You are in Wakanda now.

1316
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:24,563
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1317
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,000
We...

1318
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,685
...have blood to spare.

1319
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:42,660
They surrender?

1320
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:44,510
Not exactly.

1321
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:12,898
What the hell?

1322
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,483
Looks like we pissed her off.

1323
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:29,790
They're killing themselves.

1324
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:07,624
You see the teeth
on those things?

1325
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:08,700
All right, back up, Sam.

1326
01:40:08,708 --> 01:40:10,302
You're gonna get
your wings singed.

1327
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:25,108
Cap, if these things circle the perimeter
and get in behind us...

1328
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:26,932
...there's nothing
between them and Vision.

1329
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:28,929
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.

1330
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:30,479
How do we do that?

1331
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,476
We open the barrier.

1332
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:40,858
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.

1333
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:44,823
Requesting confirmation, My King.
You said open the barrier?

1334
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:46,203
On my signal.

1335
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,323
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1336
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:53,082
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

1337
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,517
Wakanda forever!

1338
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,300
Now!

1339
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,683
How much longer, Shuri?

1340
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,393
I've barely begun, brother.

1341
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:56,399
You might want to pick up the pace.

1342
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,317
Allfathers, give me strength.

1343
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:07,280
You understand, boy...

1344
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:10,447
...you're about to take
the full force of a star?

1345
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:12,828
It'll kill you.

1346
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:15,709
Only if I die.

1347
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,080
Yes.

1348
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:20,248
That's what... killing you means.

1349
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:50,156
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1350
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:42,588
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1351
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:44,849
Thor, you okay?

1352
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:51,468
I think he's dying.

1353
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:53,599
He needs the axe!

1354
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,393
Where's the handle?

1355
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:01,774
Tree, help me find the handle!

1356
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,120
There's too many of 'em!

1357
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:42,667
You guys are so screwed now!

1358
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:48,039
Bring me Thanos!

1359
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,281
Oh, yeah.

1360
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:27,412
You're much more of a Thanos.

1361
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:31,920
I take it the Maw is dead.

1362
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,679
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1363
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,554
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1364
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,510
You may regret that.

1365
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:46,226
He brought you face-to-face
with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1366
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,861
And where do you think
he brought you?

1367
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:55,656
Let me guess. Your home?

1368
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:01,325
It was.

1369
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:05,495
And it was beautiful.

1370
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,588
Titan was like most planets.

1371
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:13,625
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1372
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:17,045
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1373
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:19,263
Genocide.

1374
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:24,060
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1375
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:27,559
They called me a madman.

1376
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,516
And what I predicted came to pass.

1377
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:35,229
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1378
01:47:35,824 --> 01:47:37,030
I'm a survivor.

1379
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,408
Who wants to murder trillions.

1380
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:43,287
With all six stones,
I could simply snap my fingers.

1381
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:48,542
They would all cease to exist.
I call that... mercy.

1382
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:52,121
And then what?

1383
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:54,957
I'd finally rest...

1384
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,879
...and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1385
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:03,595
The hardest choices
require the strongest wills.

1386
01:48:04,436 --> 01:48:09,146
I think you'll find
our will equal... to yours.

1387
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:11,657
Our?

1388
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,069
Piece of cake, Quill.

1389
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,484
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.

1390
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:00,864
Boom!

1391
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:03,826
Don't let him close his fist.

1392
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:09,090
Magic.

1393
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:10,815
More magic.

1394
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:12,641
Magic with a kick.

1395
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:14,194
Magic with a...

1396
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:16,752
Insect!

1397
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:56,670
- Well, well.
- You should've killed me.

1398
01:49:56,673 --> 01:49:58,880
It would've been a waste of parts!

1399
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:05,329
Where's Gamora?

1400
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:47,812
Is he under? Don't let up.

1401
01:50:47,854 --> 01:50:50,657
Be quick. He is very strong.

1402
01:50:50,699 --> 01:50:52,514
Parker, help! Get over here.

1403
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:55,020
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.

1404
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,813
We gotta open his fingers
to get it off.

1405
01:51:01,816 --> 01:51:04,523
I thought you'd be hard to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1406
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:07,116
You're not so strong now, huh?

1407
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:09,360
Where is Gamora?

1408
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:13,619
- My Gamora.
- No, bullshit!

1409
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,203
Where is she?

1410
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:17,581
He is in anguish.

1411
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:19,500
Good.

1412
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:22,714
He... He mourns.

1413
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:26,878
What does this monster
have to mourn?

1414
01:51:27,598 --> 01:51:28,679
Gamora.

1415
01:51:32,561 --> 01:51:33,620
What?

1416
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:35,469
He took her to Vormir.

1417
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:38,063
He came back with the Soul Stone.

1418
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:40,349
But she didn't.

1419
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:45,442
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1420
01:51:46,325 --> 01:51:49,784
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1421
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:52,228
Tell me she's lying.

1422
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:57,287
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1423
01:51:58,754 --> 01:52:02,167
I had to.

1424
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:05,300
No, you didn't. No, you didn't.

1425
01:52:08,925 --> 01:52:09,925
No!

1426
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:11,388
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1427
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,344
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1428
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:15,242
Hey, stop! Stop!

1429
01:52:15,287 --> 01:52:17,546
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
I got it, I got it!

1430
01:52:20,526 --> 01:52:21,641
Oh, God.

1431
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:23,210
Come and get some, space dogs!

1432
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:29,133
Come on! Get some!
Get some! Get some!

1433
01:53:29,303 --> 01:53:31,214
Come on! Get some!

1434
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:33,508
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1435
01:53:34,141 --> 01:53:36,007
Okay. How much for the arm?

1436
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:39,885
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1437
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:49,970
New haircut?

1438
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:51,443
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1439
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:55,818
By the way, this is a friend
of mine, Tree.

1440
01:53:56,747 --> 01:53:58,658
I am Groot.

1441
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,122
I am Steve Rogers.

1442
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:23,350
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1443
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:34,490
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.

1444
01:54:35,077 --> 01:54:36,392
I'm doing it.

1445
01:55:00,102 --> 01:55:01,718
Why was she up there
all this time?

1446
01:55:02,687 --> 01:55:05,554
She's on the field. Take it.

1447
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:39,296
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1448
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:43,625
Somebody get to Vision!

1449
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:45,973
- I got him!
- On my way.

1450
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:54,194
He'll die alone. As will you.

1451
01:55:54,364 --> 01:55:55,850
She's not alone.

1452
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:23,599
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

1453
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:25,224
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

1454
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,800
This suit's already
kicked the crap outta the Hulk.

1455
01:56:27,856 --> 01:56:28,959
What? No! No!

1456
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:35,319
Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1457
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:38,906
Hulk? Hulk...

1458
01:56:38,909 --> 01:56:41,073
...I know you like making
your entrance at the last second.

1459
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:43,848
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1460
01:56:48,168 --> 01:56:49,704
Hulk! Hulk!

1461
01:56:50,975 --> 01:56:52,021
Hulk!

1462
01:56:52,756 --> 01:56:54,918
No!

1463
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:57,833
Oh, screw you, you big,
green asshole!

1464
01:56:58,011 --> 01:56:59,217
I'll do it myself!

1465
01:57:00,138 --> 01:57:01,970
Come on! Yeah!

1466
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:15,901
See ya!

1467
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,949
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1468
01:57:41,012 --> 01:57:42,878
I thought you were
formidable, machine.

1469
01:57:43,848 --> 01:57:46,385
But you're dying, like any man.

1470
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:56,225
Get outta here!

1471
01:57:59,656 --> 01:58:00,691
Go!

1472
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:21,087
That was really gross.

1473
01:58:48,246 --> 01:58:49,327
I thought I told you to go.

1474
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:52,581
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1475
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:06,174
I got you! I got you!

1476
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:08,422
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1477
01:59:53,687 --> 01:59:55,177
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1478
01:59:57,273 --> 02:00:00,186
Yet you never once
used your greatest weapon.

1479
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:04,753
A fake.

1480
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:16,039
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1481
02:00:16,209 --> 02:00:18,625
- Stark.
- You know me?

1482
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:20,369
I do.

1483
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:24,040
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1484
02:00:24,968 --> 02:00:26,299
My only curse is you.

1485
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:30,195
Come on!

1486
02:00:57,834 --> 02:00:59,791
All that for a drop of blood.

1487
02:01:43,838 --> 02:01:45,624
You have my respect, Stark.

1488
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:50,509
When I'm done, half of humanity
will still be alive.

1489
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:58,099
I hope they remember you.

1490
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:09,019
Stop.

1491
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:16,759
Spare his life...

1492
02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:19,863
...and I will give you the stone.

1493
02:02:23,419 --> 02:02:24,705
No tricks.

1494
02:02:29,509 --> 02:02:30,659
Don't.

1495
02:03:21,936 --> 02:03:23,643
One to go.

1496
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:34,942
Where is he?

1497
02:03:43,917 --> 02:03:45,282
Did we just lose?

1498
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:51,124
Why would you do that?

1499
02:03:54,469 --> 02:03:56,710
We're in the endgame now.

1500
02:04:22,700 --> 02:04:24,220
Are you okay?

1501
02:04:26,084 --> 02:04:27,791
What? What is it?

1502
02:04:29,963 --> 02:04:31,078
He's here.

1503
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:45,138
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

1504
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:49,854
What the hell?

1505
02:05:15,605 --> 02:05:16,662
Cap...

1506
02:05:17,135 --> 02:05:18,591
...that's him.

1507
02:05:20,638 --> 02:05:23,221
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1508
02:05:47,707 --> 02:05:48,788
Wanda...

1509
02:05:49,834 --> 02:05:51,120
...it's time.

1510
02:05:51,294 --> 02:05:52,384
No.

1511
02:05:52,462 --> 02:05:54,669
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

1512
02:05:54,839 --> 02:05:56,250
Look at me.

1513
02:05:56,257 --> 02:05:57,558
You have the power to destroy...

1514
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:58,335
- ...the stone.
- Don't.

1515
02:05:58,398 --> 02:05:59,875
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1516
02:06:01,888 --> 02:06:04,471
We are out of time.

1517
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:07,970
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1518
02:06:08,644 --> 02:06:09,884
You can.

1519
02:06:11,397 --> 02:06:13,684
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1520
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:17,559
It's not fair.

1521
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,362
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1522
02:06:22,325 --> 02:06:23,781
It's all right.

1523
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:26,910
You could never hurt me.

1524
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:37,749
I just feel you.

1525
02:08:00,882 --> 02:08:01,997
It's all right.

1526
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:13,265
It's all right.

1527
02:08:17,607 --> 02:08:18,688
I love you.

1528
02:08:48,012 --> 02:08:50,128
I understand, my child.

1529
02:08:51,682 --> 02:08:53,298
Better than anyone.

1530
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:56,888
You could never.

1531
02:09:01,734 --> 02:09:04,726
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1532
02:09:06,530 --> 02:09:09,147
But now is no time to mourn.

1533
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:12,584
Now...

1534
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:15,404
...is no time at all.

1535
02:09:38,729 --> 02:09:39,819
No!

1536
02:10:37,705 --> 02:10:39,161
I told you...

1537
02:10:40,541 --> 02:10:42,373
...you'd die for that.

1538
02:10:56,724 --> 02:10:58,465
You should have...

1539
02:11:01,103 --> 02:11:02,559
You should...

1540
02:11:05,066 --> 02:11:08,309
You should have gone for the head.

1541
02:11:10,237 --> 02:11:11,332
No!

1542
02:11:44,647 --> 02:11:45,853
Daughter?

1543
02:11:53,489 --> 02:11:54,954
Did you do it?

1544
02:11:56,784 --> 02:11:57,939
Yes.

1545
02:12:06,210 --> 02:12:07,892
What did it cost?

1546
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:12,997
Everything.

1547
02:12:23,269 --> 02:12:24,905
What did you do?

1548
02:12:26,063 --> 02:12:27,653
What'd you do?

1549
02:12:41,203 --> 02:12:42,668
Where'd he go?

1550
02:12:45,499 --> 02:12:46,580
Thor...

1551
02:12:49,879 --> 02:12:51,495
...where'd he go?

1552
02:12:51,672 --> 02:12:52,912
Steve?

1553
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:30,037
Up, General! Up!

1554
02:13:30,628 --> 02:13:32,039
This is no place to die.

1555
02:13:47,102 --> 02:13:48,684
I am Groot.

1556
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:53,272
No, no, no, no!

1557
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:56,942
Groot! No.

1558
02:14:10,376 --> 02:14:11,537
Sam!

1559
02:14:15,589 --> 02:14:17,330
Sam, where you at?

1560
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:28,766
Something's happening.

1561
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:42,167
Quill?

1562
02:14:49,456 --> 02:14:51,910
- Steady, Quill.
- Oh, man.

1563
02:14:56,088 --> 02:14:57,194
Tony...

1564
02:15:00,634 --> 02:15:03,092
...there was no other way.

1565
02:15:08,767 --> 02:15:10,026
Mr. Stark?

1566
02:15:14,231 --> 02:15:15,562
I don't feel so good.

1567
02:15:17,651 --> 02:15:18,687
You're all right.

1568
02:15:18,691 --> 02:15:19,862
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.

1569
02:15:19,903 --> 02:15:21,439
I don't know...

1570
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:24,279
I don't want to go.

1571
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,073
I don't want to go, sir. Please.

1572
02:15:26,243 --> 02:15:28,951
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1573
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:34,990
I'm sorry.

1574
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:51,306
He did it.

1575
02:16:16,085 --> 02:16:19,294
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

1576
02:16:36,188 --> 02:16:37,929
Oh, God.

1577
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:36,962
- Still no word from Stark?
- No, not yet.

1578
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:40,382
We're watching every satellite
on both hemispheres, but still nothing.

1579
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,434
What is it?

1580
02:27:42,604 --> 02:27:44,936
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1581
02:27:45,106 --> 02:27:47,017
Same energy signature
as New York?

1582
02:27:47,192 --> 02:27:48,523
Ten times bigger.

1583
02:27:50,028 --> 02:27:52,270
- Tell Klein we'll meet him at...
- Nick! Nick!

1584
02:28:05,919 --> 02:28:07,205
They okay?

1585
02:28:08,213 --> 02:28:10,000
There's no one here.

1586
02:28:19,516 --> 02:28:21,006
Call Control.

1587
02:28:21,768 --> 02:28:23,054
Code red.

1588
02:28:23,728 --> 02:28:24,844
Nick.

1589
02:28:26,398 --> 02:28:27,539
Hill?

1590
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:43,491
Oh, no.

1591
02:28:45,125 --> 02:28:46,304
Motherfu...
