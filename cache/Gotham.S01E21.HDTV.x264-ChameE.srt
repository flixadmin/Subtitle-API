<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:05,303
You need to leave
Ms. Kringle alone.

3
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,239
I get it now.

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,507
You got a thing
for my girl.

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,242
Oh!

6
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:13,411
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,315
Who sent you?

8
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,684
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,686
No!

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,656
I'm Bruce Wayne.

11
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,724
Sid Bunderslaw.

12
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:29,861
<i>The people of Gotham
deserve to know</i>

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,230
that there's a serial killer
in their midst.

14
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,331
I'm coming after you.

15
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,534
<i>He murders the loved ones</i>

16
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,636
<i>of any cop
who investigates him.</i>

17
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,539
Care to dance?

18
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:02,527
Morning.
How'd you sleep?

19
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,030
The hour we slept?

20
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,531
Great.

21
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,934
You hungry?
I have quiche.

22
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,702
No, thanks.

23
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,937
At least have some coffee.

24
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,872
Let me tell you about the day

25
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,340
I have planned for us.

26
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,342
I think I'm just gonna
get out of here.

27
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,644
Just wait.

28
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,182
We had fun last night, right?

29
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,221
Stay.

30
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,459
Listen, you don't
have to do this.

31
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,927
Do what?

32
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,196
Last night
at the ball,

33
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,598
you talked a good game.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,933
But let's not pretend
this is more than what it is.

35
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,270
Barbara, I'm not
pretending with you.

36
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,671
I want you

37
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,574
to stay with me.

38
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,176
I don't think so.

39
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,345
Just... wait,
wait, wait.

40
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,647
Let go.

41
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,249
Look...

42
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:02,287
I was pretending
with you.

43
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,724
But not in the
way you think.

44
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,167
The night we met....

45
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,337
...I was going to kill you.

46
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,943
That's not funny.
But then...

47
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:29,047
I saw something in you,

48
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,549
Barbara, I saw...

49
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,985
the real you.

50
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:41,893
You are the woman
that I have been searching for.

51
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:48,233
You're lying.

52
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:54,506
I'm gonna let you go now,

53
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:59,411
and you're going to sit down
and have breakfast with me.

54
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,324
Come on.

55
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:17,095
No!

56
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,465
So I do it
the hard way.

58
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,043
Hey. How are you doing?

59
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,611
Been better. You seen Harvey?

60
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,646
No.

61
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,548
Any word on Barbara?

62
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,450
They haven't found her body yet,

63
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,618
so there's a chance
she's still alive.

64
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,954
When's the last
time you slept?

65
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,055
I don't know.

66
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,957
Last time you ate?
I don't know.

67
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,259
I know better than to
try to get you to sleep,

68
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,561
but you really
should eat something.

69
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,729
I'm not hungry.

70
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,831
Jim...

71
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,466
it's not your fault.

72
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,571
I did this. I pressed Loeb,
he sent the Ogre after me,

73
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,439
and I didn't stop.

74
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,742
It was bad enough
I knowingly put you in danger.

75
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,276
I didn't even think of Barbara.

76
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,846
You were doing your job.

77
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,814
But I should've known.
How?

78
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,349
Y-You weren't together.

79
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,517
Do you blame yourself

80
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,519
for falling out of love?

81
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,887
Lee, it's my responsibility.

82
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,189
There's nothing you can say
that changes that.

83
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,691
Whatever happens to Barbara,

84
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,860
it's on me.

85
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:22,927
I understand.

86
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,362
Jimbo!

87
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,664
Meet Jake the JV pimp.

88
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,366
He's been bragging
on the streets that

89
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,201
he knows who the Ogre is.
I keep telling you,

90
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,036
man, you been lied to;
I don't know nothing.

91
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,038
Yeah?

92
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,106
We'll see about that.

93
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,514
Okeydoke.

94
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,584
No body, no crime.
No body, no crime.

95
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,889
Nope. Never seen him before.

96
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,627
We think this is a serial killer
called the Ogre.

97
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,596
He's kidnapped a woman,

98
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,898
and he's gonna kill her
unless we find him first.

99
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,400
Bummer.

100
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,968
Just so you understand,

101
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,671
the lady in question
is a real good

102
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,872
friend of ours.

103
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,675
Supposing,
for the sake of argument,

104
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,277
I did see him before.

105
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,745
What's she worth?

106
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,349
What's she worth?

107
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,351
Yeah, you know,

108
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,120
if you had to assign
a dollar amount.

109
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,025
Harvey, I'm about
to violate departmental policy

110
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,596
on interrogation techniques.

111
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:08,032
Think I saw some donuts outside
with my name all over them.

112
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,803
Hey, now. C-Calm yourself.

113
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,085
There's no need
to get carried...

114
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,876
Jake worked as a
barman at a brothel

115
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,177
called the Foxglove.

116
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,813
Said the Ogre was a regular.
Can't give us a location.

117
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,982
Yeah, 'cause they never
use the same place twice.

118
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,984
What, you know it?
Not personally.

119
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:29,287
The Foxglove is very
high-class, very extreme.

120
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,055
You got to know someone
who knows someone.

121
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,991
Uh, I might know someone.

122
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,626
Oh. You talking
Penguin?

123
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,161
If you get any deeper with
that clown, he will own you.

124
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,130
I don't have a choice;
the Ogre has Barbara.

125
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,465
Let me shake
a few trees.

126
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,833
Take the time,
grab some "Z" s.

127
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,501
You're burnt!

128
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,838
First one was the hardest.

129
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,740
But it wasn't her fault.

130
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,775
She just wasn't the one.

131
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,144
I also couldn't let her go.

132
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,380
Still, it strengthened
my resolve

133
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,749
to never stop
till I found my soul mate...

134
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,184
Person I could
share everything with.

135
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:06,524
I think that person is you,
Barbara, but I need your help.

136
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,793
So...

137
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,729
let's begin again, shall we?

138
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:29,310
This just, uh...

139
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:31,946
came for you by messenger,
Master Bruce.

140
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,118
Thank you.

141
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:42,023
Right, well, I'll...

142
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:44,025
I'll just be off.

143
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:45,526
Do you want company?

144
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,730
To identify Reggie?

145
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:51,332
No, I don't think so.
Best done alone.

146
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:54,469
I'm sorry, Alfred.

147
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,471
I know he was your friend.

148
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:58,273
Just doesn't
make any sense.

149
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:01,109
Reggie topping himself
like that.

150
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,944
You said he fell
out of a window.

151
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:04,666
He might've been drinking,
lost his balance.

152
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:08,650
No, Reggie, he was a legend.

153
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:11,986
He could be blind drunk
and walk a tightrope.

154
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:16,758
Doesn't matter
what he was like in the end.

155
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,360
I want to see he gets
a proper send-off.

156
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:24,866
I'll see you this evening, sir.

157
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:53,528
<i>What, your boss
doesn't trust his partners?</i>

158
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,363
It's called
due diligence.

159
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,599
He just wants me
to look the place over.

160
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:59,033
So look.

161
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:02,704
I got a gravy going...
Special party today.

162
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,472
Don't let me keep you.

163
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,541
Piece of work.

164
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,288
<i>I'll put the pistol
under the bar,</i>

165
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,357
<i>machine gun behind the juke.</i>

166
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,793
All Connor and
his guy got to do

167
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:27,595
is get to them.

168
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:29,597
The day is finally here.

169
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,500
Maroni...

170
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:34,402
Jim.

171
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,905
So lovely to see you.

172
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:40,742
To what do I owe this
wonderful surprise?

173
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,443
I need to know
where the Foxglove is.

174
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:44,846
And I need
an invitation.

175
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,750
Well, someone's in a mood.

176
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:51,119
Can you help me out?
Yes or no.

177
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:56,124
Jim, I do so love
our give-and-take relationship.

178
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:58,927
But it's starting to feel
a bit one-sided.

179
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,562
Fine.

180
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,497
I'll owe you a favor.

181
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:03,998
You already do.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,001
Then I'll owe you
another.

183
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:10,271
Cards on the table.

184
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:12,040
The Foxglove makes
a lot of money

185
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,942
for some
important f...

186
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:20,615
You think you know who I am.

187
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:22,884
What I'm capable of.

188
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:24,852
You have no idea.

189
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,454
Today is an important day
for me...

190
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,459
...so I will accommodate
your request.

191
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:35,296
But, Detective, mark my words.

192
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:38,099
You owe me a big favor.

193
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:47,141
<i>Here we have the Physical
Operations department.</i>

194
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,744
The Physical
Operations department

195
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:51,846
handles logistics
for the corporation,

196
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,781
management of our
properties, offices...

197
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:56,184
Excuse me, I need
to use the restroom.

198
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:58,753
Of course, Mr. Wayne.
It's right here.

199
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:00,421
Thank you.

200
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:16,537
The Foxglove is in the old
Klondike Building on Mayflower.

201
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,439
You score a ticket?
Yep.

202
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:19,507
But only one.

203
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,976
I figure you go in,
pose as a john,

204
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:23,544
find something to bust them on,

205
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:26,147
then we squeeze them
till they talk.

206
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:27,949
Smart move sending me, hmm?

207
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:30,418
You couldn't look more like a
cop if you wore a blue uniform.

208
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,220
You got something to wear?

209
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:34,422
You, uh, are gonna need
to fit in.
Don't worry.

210
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,424
Alvarez busted some guys
smuggling Italian suits

211
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:38,960
last week, and a couple
fell in my locker

212
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:41,429
on their way to
the evidence room.

213
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,433
I'm sorry
I left you alone,

214
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:49,070
but you needed
time to think,

215
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:51,773
to accept that this was real.

216
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:54,175
This apartment is soundproofed,
by the way,

217
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,244
so save your lungs.

218
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:13,961
Look at me.
My hands are shaking.

219
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:15,763
That's never happened before

220
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,932
with any of the other women
that I've had here.

221
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,268
You know
why that is?

222
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:25,073
Do you know why

223
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:27,041
that is?

224
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:29,544
You're a psycho.

225
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:31,612
I don't know
what you're thinking.

226
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:38,920
It's because
I always somehow knew

227
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:43,124
that deep down,
the others weren't the one.

228
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:45,126
They weren't the one.

229
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:51,599
I want this to work, Barbara.

230
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,640
You're scared.

231
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,076
It's okay.

232
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:06,347
Jim will find...

233
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,055
The only way you're going
to make me angry is

234
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:16,457
if you mention his name.

235
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:29,904
Drink this.

236
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:32,607
It's water.
You're dehydrated.

237
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,886
Barbara, come here.
I want you to see something.

238
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,159
Barbara, I love you.

239
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,728
I love you
like no one has ever loved you.

240
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,764
But if you try to escape,

241
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:57,866
I will chain you
to the ceiling and gut you.

242
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:00,902
Now come... here.

243
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,787
Are those...

244
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:21,389
When you're
looking for love,

245
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,124
you have to
kiss a lot of frogs.

246
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:26,861
Still, I-I should be thankful.

247
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:28,563
They led me to you.

248
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:33,334
All those women...

249
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:38,406
...they died here?

250
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:40,942
You killed them...

251
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:43,211
here?

252
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,213
Yes.

253
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:53,488
Don't worry.

254
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,590
I'm gonna set you free.

255
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:58,326
You're the one,
Barbara.

256
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,395
You're the one.

257
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:53,981
Hello, Bruce.

258
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:56,617
I've been expecting you.

259
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:08,561
Ever since your friend
borrowed my key,

260
00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:10,496
I've been expecting you.

261
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:12,164
Even canceled my trip.

262
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,532
Cookie?

263
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:17,169
When I was a boy,

264
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:19,939
I'd always take a cookie
when I had the chance.

265
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:25,077
You hired a man
to kill Alfred.

266
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,246
I hired your
guardian's comrade

267
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:28,647
to find out what you knew.

268
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,717
I never intended harm
to come to anyone.

269
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:37,089
I told the board
you were a special case,

270
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:38,824
that you need the talk

271
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:40,092
early.

272
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,294
The talk?

273
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:45,464
Bruce, when members of the Wayne
family reach a certain age,

274
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,200
some facts of life and business
are explained...

275
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:50,870
Wayne Enterprises
is committing serious crimes.

276
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,972
Oh, my, yes.

277
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:55,508
This is
a multinational corporation

278
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,943
operating in hundreds
of jurisdictions.

279
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:01,347
We do our best to subvert
all of them if it means profits.

280
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:05,317
So... you admit it?

281
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,952
Just like
your father.

282
00:17:06,954 --> 00:17:10,789
He came in with his secret
files, demanding justice.

283
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,124
At first.

284
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:14,293
Then he changed
his mind.

285
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:15,628
You're lying.

286
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,962
Your father

287
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:20,065
came to understand
the reality of this business.

288
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,600
As did his father.

289
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:22,602
And as will you.

290
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:24,770
My father was a good man.

291
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:29,275
You have an opportunity
to live a blessed life,

292
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,443
the life your father and mother

293
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:33,879
wanted for you.

294
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:37,149
I beg you to reconsider.

295
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,286
Pardon me.

296
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:41,620
Lucius, come in.

297
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:43,889
Bruce Wayne,

298
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:46,992
meet one of our
junior executives, Lucius Fox.

299
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,327
There's a public relations
person out there

300
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:50,329
desperately searching
for this young man.

301
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:52,731
Then you'd best reunite them.

302
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,867
Bruce,

303
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,369
don't forget your cookie.

304
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:12,685
Now...

305
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:14,987
I'm going to tell you something,
and I'd appreciate

306
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,389
if you kept your face
perfectly still.

307
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:18,724
There's cameras everywhere.

308
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:20,326
I know because I put them there.

309
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:23,596
What I'm about to say
must be a deep secret

310
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:25,731
between you and me.

311
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:28,100
I knew your father well.

312
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:30,035
He was a good man.

313
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:32,438
He wasn't the man
the company thought he was.

314
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,608
I don't understand you.

315
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,942
Bruce,

316
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:40,079
your father was a true Stoic.

317
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:43,515
He kept his best self
hidden.

318
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:46,318
That's all I'll say.

319
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:54,793
Good luck.

320
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,274
Mr. Nygma?

321
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:10,743
Ms. Kri...

322
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:12,011
Ms. Kringle?

323
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:14,046
Would you open the door, please?

324
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:16,382
Um, I'm...

325
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,150
One sec!

326
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:31,463
I need the Hendricks
case files.

327
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:32,931
Um, yes. Hendricks.

328
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,066
Wait right here.

329
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:38,370
Hendricks.
Hendricks.

330
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:41,707
Hendricks, Hendricks,
Hendricks, Hendricks.

331
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,575
Hendricks,
Hendricks, Hendricks.

332
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:45,944
Oh, my goodness.

333
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:48,914
What happened to him?
Um...

334
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,884
axe... uh, a-accidental death.

335
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,652
Oh.
At a sheet
metal factory.

336
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:55,421
Industrial saw. Just...

337
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:59,158
Poor man.

338
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,728
I... I don't know
how you do this job.

339
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,563
Death all around you.

340
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:05,798
Yes.

341
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,333
One must have a sense of humor.

342
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,903
The-the file?

343
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,204
Yes.

344
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,211
Um, Mr. Nygma,

345
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:22,748
you haven't, by chance, seen,
uh, Tom... Officer Dougherty?

346
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,251
We were... supposed
to have dinner last night.

347
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:27,386
He didn't show... no surprise...

348
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:28,921
Um, but I haven't
seen him today.

349
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,123
Me neither.

350
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,859
Oh.

351
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,928
Excuse me. I really need
to get back to work.

352
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,029
Oh, uh...

353
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:38,230
Uh...
Now.

354
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:40,299
Okay. Um...

355
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:45,404
Oh, dear.

356
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,541
You're sure...

357
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,276
the guns are there?

358
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:53,879
Butch placed
them himself.

359
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:56,682
Do you remember what to say to
Maroni before you do the deed?

360
00:20:56,684 --> 00:21:00,152
I never saw the point
in telling a man something

361
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:03,021
right before
you're gonna whack him,

362
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:06,425
but you're not the first
to ask for it.

363
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:10,295
I appreciate you humoring me.

364
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:12,898
So how do you know
Maroni's gonna be in this bar

365
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,733
on this exact day?

366
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:16,802
I follow current events.

367
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:33,552
There he is.

368
00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:35,154
Tommy freakin' Bones.

369
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:38,223
Nine years
up the river,

370
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,259
and you get better-looking,
you big animal.

371
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:42,261
Took care of myself.

372
00:21:42,263 --> 00:21:44,530
I was hoping you'd remember.

373
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:46,865
Come over here. Huh?

374
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:50,335
Listen, you leave the joint,
you come to Lidia's for dinner.

375
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:51,770
That's tradition.

376
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:53,472
Welcome home. Lidia!

377
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:54,773
Look who's here.

378
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:57,609
Ah...

379
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:11,723
Welcome to the Foxglove.

380
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:12,825
The evening's entertainment

381
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,493
is about to begin.

382
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,895
Then I guess I'm
just in time.

383
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:11,383
Ladies and gentlemen,

384
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:14,119
your attention, please.

385
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:18,590
I know you have been
eagerly awaiting tonight's

386
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:19,858
main attraction.

387
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,794
So, please, let's give
a big Foxglove welcome

388
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:25,097
to Ingrid and Gareth.

389
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:37,809
Oh, no.

390
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:39,278
Hell no.

391
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:42,214
GCPD!

392
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:44,216
Nobody move!

393
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:46,418
Especially you two!

394
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:01,398
Barbara?

395
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,802
Wake up, Barbara.

396
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:07,704
Wake up.

397
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:14,844
Shh, shh, shh. Come here.

398
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:18,915
Don't cry.

399
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,251
Shh, shh, shh...

400
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,619
Hey.

401
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:26,556
There's no need to cry.

402
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,024
Okay?

403
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:33,129
You're gonna kill me.

404
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:34,497
Do you want me to?

405
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:35,598
No!

406
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,602
Then tell me who to kill.

407
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:43,273
Wh-What?

408
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:47,110
You still don't believe
I love you.

409
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,278
You think I'm crazy.

410
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,613
That's fine.

411
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,883
I see the truth.

412
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:56,052
I see<i> your</i> truth.

413
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:58,421
I see that you've spent
your whole life

414
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:00,857
trying to kill it,
but you can't...

415
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,559
It's too strong.

416
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:05,595
You revealed it to me
the other night.

417
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:08,798
I want to set that free.
I want to set you free.

418
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,768
You think that me
making you murder someone

419
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,870
will make me like you?

420
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:16,206
That's insane.

421
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,341
You say that

422
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:21,878
because you don't know
what it is to live without fear.

423
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,147
But you'll learn.

424
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:27,884
Now, tell me...

425
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:30,487
who you want me to kill,

426
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,255
or, though it breaks my heart,

427
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:36,559
I will take your life right now.

428
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,063
I can't.

429
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,833
I... I can't.

430
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:47,037
I... I can't.

431
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,106
Tell me...

432
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:53,376
who... to kill.

433
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:08,324
You run this place?

434
00:26:08,326 --> 00:26:10,527
I'm looking for this man.

435
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,296
Arrest me if you want to;
I don't talk about my clients.

436
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:19,202
One call to the<i> Gazette,</i> they'll
send a reporter down here.

437
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,438
I'll perp-walk each and
every one of your clients

438
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,839
in front of
the cameras.

439
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,175
How's that sound?

440
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,211
Talk to Sally.

441
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:33,550
Do you know him?

442
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,185
You sure?

443
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:37,754
I'm sure.

444
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:50,100
He said his
name was Jason.

445
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:52,435
He was sweet.

446
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:56,272
As soon as I got into his car,
he pulled a hood over my head

447
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:57,574
and tied my wrists.

448
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:59,476
He took me back
to his apartment.

449
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:01,711
That's where he did this.

450
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:04,214
I don't know why he let me go.

451
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:06,049
When was this?

452
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:07,884
Almost nine years ago.
About a year before

453
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:10,153
the first murder...
He was working his way up.

454
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:11,654
Why didn't you go
to the police?

455
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:12,956
I did.

456
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,758
I was a hooker;
he was a rich man with no name.

457
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,827
Anything else you can tell us?

458
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:20,130
Anything about his apartment?
The smallest detail

459
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:22,031
might help.

460
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:26,503
The elevator opened
right into the apartment.

461
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:28,505
You can see out into the city.

462
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:30,006
We were in midtown.

463
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:32,475
And there was
a big neon sign

464
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:34,978
on the building
across the street.

465
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,080
I could only read
the last four letters.

466
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:39,182
O-Y-A-L.

467
00:27:39,184 --> 00:27:40,850
O-Y-A-L.

468
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:42,852
Hmm. Loyal, royal...

469
00:27:42,854 --> 00:27:44,120
Royal.

470
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,655
Gotham Royal Hotel.

471
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:47,323
That's in midtown.
10th and Gainsly.

472
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:48,658
Thank you, Sally.

473
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,260
Promise me, when
you find him,

474
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:52,829
don't arrest him.

475
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:54,230
Kill him.

476
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:57,500
You got it.

477
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:02,172
Whoa, fellas, private party.

478
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:04,040
Just here to pay respects.

479
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,576
Connor from
the wild northeast.

480
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:10,046
What's that old man Falcone
want now?

481
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:12,048
Don Falcone sends me
with his respects,

482
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,883
and a small gift for you

483
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:15,718
and Tommy Bones
on this happy day.

484
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,953
Cheech.

485
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:20,823
Forgive my
suspicious nature.

486
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,927
Of course.
Can't be too careful.

487
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:27,163
Come here.
Let me see this.

488
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,701
Madre di Dios.

489
00:28:31,703 --> 00:28:33,603
My favorite.

490
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:36,873
You tell Falcone I
appreciate the gesture.

491
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,575
Don Falcone knew
it was a special occasion.

492
00:28:38,577 --> 00:28:40,243
We got time for
a drink. Lidia!

493
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:41,778
Clean glasses, please.

494
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,780
The gift comes with a message.

495
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:44,881
Oh, yeah?

496
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:46,783
What's that?

497
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:48,585
He wants you to know
that it wasn't easy

498
00:28:48,587 --> 00:28:50,353
for him to decide to kill you.

499
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,124
Son of a bitch.

500
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:58,061
But business is business.

501
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,137
You believe it?

502
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:10,139
You both jammed.

503
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:12,175
If that ain't a sign from God,
I don't know what.

504
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,409
Please...
Shut your mouth!

505
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:14,444
Ow!
You're gonna take

506
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:15,812
Don Falcone a
message from me.

507
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:17,847
You're gonna let him know
that you messed up...

508
00:29:19,317 --> 00:29:21,818
...and you're gonna let him know
that I'm coming for him.

509
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,722
Of course, you don't need
to be alive to tell him that.

510
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:26,856
Tommy, do the honors.

511
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:28,258
Wait...

512
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,733
♪ All you punks
and all you teds ♪

513
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:40,270

514
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:43,539
♪ Mods, rockers, hippies
and skinheads... ♪

515
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:46,809
Connor blew it.

516
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:48,944
Maroni's still alive.

517
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:51,013
This is flat.

518
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:54,183
Did you not hear me?

519
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:56,018
Maroni is still alive.

520
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,686
You got to get out of town.

521
00:29:57,688 --> 00:29:59,922
And miss all the fun?

522
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:03,025
You knew.

523
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:05,394
You set him up.

524
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:08,597
I took the firing pins out
of the guns before you hid them.

525
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,133
A spin on a trick
I learned from Maroni.

526
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:16,071
But you could have
had Maroni dead.

527
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:19,575
True, but I still would've been
under Falcone's thumb,

528
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:23,445
and that...
has grown intolerable.

529
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,081
No, I'd much rather
Maroni be alive,

530
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,217
and out for blood.

531
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,795
Alas, Officer Dougherty, she's
gonna wonder where you went.

532
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:43,999
Perhaps a letter.

533
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:47,803
You could say good-bye,
give her some advice.

534
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,805
Something that might lead her

535
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,841
to make better choices
in the future, hmm?

536
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,415
Jim?

537
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,186
Place is empty.

538
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:40,088
But there's something
you should see.

539
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:48,363
You see anything
that connects to Barbara?

540
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,100
Maybe she was never here.

541
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:53,802
No, she was here.

542
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:55,804
I can still smell
her perfume.

543
00:31:55,806 --> 00:31:59,841
Hey, we're gonna find this guy,

544
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:02,211
but you need to
prepare yourself...

545
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:06,515
...that we might not be
in time to save her.

546
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:07,683
That is not an option.

547
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:09,651
It's the most likely option.

548
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:25,334
Hello.

549
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:27,302
Detective Gordon,

550
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:29,404
I assume you are the one
who triggered the alarm.

551
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,139
You son of a bitch.
Where's Barbara?

552
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:34,443
With me, of course.

553
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:35,844
If you've hurt her...

554
00:32:35,846 --> 00:32:37,713
She's as safe as milk.

555
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:40,215
Safer than she ever was
when she was with you.

556
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:43,452
What the hell does that mean?

557
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:45,721
She doesn't need
your protection, Jim.

558
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:47,956
Fact is, she never did.

559
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:49,558
I'll see you around.

560
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,627
Wait.

561
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:54,730
He was driving.

562
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:56,498
To Tahiti if he's smart.

563
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,066
Yeah, there was
a noise, right?

564
00:32:58,068 --> 00:33:01,870
A thumping, like he was
going over a bridge.

565
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:04,740
You know, I heard, uh, a
horn, like a train horn.

566
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:06,742
Okay, so, which bridge
has a train?

567
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:08,577
Um...

568
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:12,247
Damn. Um... Whitecross,
but that's the upstate train.

569
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,916
Upstate.

570
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:16,985
<i>It's where her parents live.</i>

571
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:25,927
Barbara, please.

572
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,929
What's happening?

573
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:31,466
What's happening is your
daughter is finally waking up.

574
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,172
Please.

575
00:33:37,174 --> 00:33:39,675
Barbara, we're doing this
for you.

576
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:44,170
Jim?

577
00:34:45,138 --> 00:34:47,440
Barbara.

578
00:34:47,442 --> 00:34:49,809
What are you doing here?

579
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:12,698
You're not supposed to be here.

580
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,335
Where is he?

581
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:53,072
Drop it.

582
00:35:53,074 --> 00:35:55,141
Drop the knife,
or I'll shoot.

583
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:58,778
Just an ounce of pressure,
and she'll split right open.

584
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,780
I don't want that.
Do you want that?

585
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:03,116
It's gonna be all right,
Barbara.

586
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:04,717
It's gonna be all right.

587
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,753
If you cared about this woman,

588
00:36:06,755 --> 00:36:09,355
you never would have
come after me.

589
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:11,390
I love her more than
you ever did.

590
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,959
Drop the knife.

591
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:16,462
Won't be me
that slits her throat.

592
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:18,898
Detective, that's gonna be you.

593
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,433
- Drop it.
- Jim,

594
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:22,368
please.

595
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,837
Just leave us alone.

596
00:36:26,507 --> 00:36:29,475
Hey, jerk-o!

597
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:39,352
Barbara?

598
00:36:39,354 --> 00:36:41,087
Barbara?

599
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,559
He's dead?

600
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:48,261
Yeah. He's dead.

601
00:36:48,263 --> 00:36:49,996
It's gonna be okay.

602
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:53,199
Look at me. Barbara?

603
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:56,803
It's gonna be okay.

604
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:12,552
Alfred, I never asked you.

605
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:15,388
How was it yesterday,
seeing Reggie?

606
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,757
Not really, uh, an experience

607
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:19,926
I'd care to repeat,
Master Bruce.

608
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:24,764
But then again, the Reggie
I knew died years ago.

609
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:29,802
Alfred, I haven't

610
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:31,904
been honest
with you.

611
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:36,742
After you were hurt,

612
00:37:36,744 --> 00:37:38,945
Selina and I went looking
for Reggie.

613
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:43,082
We found him.

614
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:47,053
Did you, now?

615
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:49,155
He didn't jump

616
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:51,991
or fall.

617
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:54,060
Selina pushed him.

618
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:57,663
And why did she do that?

619
00:37:57,665 --> 00:38:01,534
Reggie was sent here
by a man named Sid Bunderslaw.

620
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:03,803
Bunderslaw works for
Wayne Enterprises.

621
00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:05,838
Reggie gave
us the name,

622
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,775
but said he was gonna tell
Bunderslaw what we were doing.

623
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:12,879
I see.

624
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:15,081
And the rest?

625
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:18,050
The charity ball...

626
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:20,386
Presumably to have access
to Mr. Bunderslaw.

627
00:38:20,388 --> 00:38:24,323
Selina stole the key
to his office safe.

628
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:27,059
I went there today.
It was empty.

629
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:30,563
But Bunderslaw was
waiting for me.

630
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:31,731
What did he do?
Nothing.

631
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:32,733
What did he do?!

632
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:33,966
Nothing!

633
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:38,638
But he said that my father
and grandfather

634
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,307
knew about the illegal things
that the company was doing,

635
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:43,142
and chose...

636
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:45,678
They chose to stay quiet.

637
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:54,787
Your father was a good man.

638
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:57,823
I know.

639
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:01,994
But even good men have secrets.

640
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:09,702
There he is.

641
00:39:11,572 --> 00:39:13,473
- That guy right there.
- Yeah, nice work.

642
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:14,640
Yeah, nice work.

643
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:16,209
Congratulations. You're a hero.

644
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:17,810
Yeah, it won't last.

645
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:19,679
Tomorrow, they'll go
back to hating me.

646
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:21,214
Well, then I'll remind them.

647
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:25,051
Yesterday,
you were trying to help.

648
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:26,953
I couldn't hear it. I'm sorry.

649
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:30,189
I would never try
to change you, Jim.

650
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:32,792
Your sense of mission... it's
part of what I love about you.

651
00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:35,528
I thought it was
my devastating good looks.

652
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,829
That's a joke.

653
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,368
I was scared.

654
00:39:44,138 --> 00:39:46,272
Scared that Barbara
would get hurt

655
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:49,041
and you would blame yourself
for protecting me first,

656
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:51,878
and then
whatever we had would die.

657
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,314
It wasn't heroic.
It was selfish.

658
00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:02,054
Lee, I love you.

659
00:40:02,056 --> 00:40:04,223
Not her.

660
00:40:04,225 --> 00:40:08,327
If I had to do it again,
I'd still protect you first.

661
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:16,302
What did you do?

662
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:19,505
Uh, grabbed a...
knife by the blade.

663
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:21,974
Of course you did.

664
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:23,342
Let me see.

665
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:32,251
Miss Kringle?

666
00:40:32,253 --> 00:40:34,520
Are you okay?

667
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,825
I got a letter
from Officer Dougherty.

668
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:41,093
He left town.

669
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:46,499
"Don't wait around for me.
Go have some fun,

670
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:48,301
and maybe I'll give you a call
when I get back."

671
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:49,468
Blah, blah, blah.

672
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,505
Couldn't even tell me
to my face.

673
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:55,474
I mean, why do I keep
picking creeps?

674
00:40:57,044 --> 00:41:00,079
Sometimes with men, you need
to read between the lines.

675
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:02,915
Sometimes with men,
you need a drink.

676
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,385
Good day, Mr. Nygma.

677
00:41:11,925 --> 00:41:13,993
Read between the lines.

678
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:38,311
Everybody listen up!

679
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:42,315
Just got wind
of three separate attacks

680
00:42:42,317 --> 00:42:44,417
on Falcone businesses
in different parts of town.

681
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:46,986
Word is it's Maroni.

682
00:42:46,988 --> 00:42:50,923
As of right now,
all leaves are canceled,

683
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:53,993
and all units are called
in for active duty.

684
00:42:53,995 --> 00:42:55,728
We're in a shooting war, people.

685
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:26,546
