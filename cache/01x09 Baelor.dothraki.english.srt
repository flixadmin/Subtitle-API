1
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,110
My lord...

2
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,740
My sun and stars...

3
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,960
My horse...

4
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,920
Blood of my blood...

5
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,930
No, I must ride.

6
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,430
He fell from his horse.

7
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,140
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

8
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,350
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

9
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,690
We've ridden far enough today.
We'll camp here.

10
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,030
This is no place to camp.

11
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,320
A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.

12
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,410
We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

13
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,080
You do not command me, Khaleesi.

14
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,330
Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.

15
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,040
The witch?
I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

16
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,920
Bring her to me unharmed
or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.

17
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,160
You did this, witch.

18
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,080
Stop it!

19
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,750
I don't want her hurt.

20
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:19,040
No? No?
You don't want her hurt?

21
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:27,010
Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

22
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,760
Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.

23
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,680
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

24
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,610
When he dies, she is nothing.

25
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,740
I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.

26
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:00,250
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

27
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,700
This must not be.

28
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,330
This must be.

29
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,660
Witch.

30
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,630
No, you can't.

31
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,470
No further, horselord.
