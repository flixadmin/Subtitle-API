1
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,761
So, you're not a fed?

2
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,972
Do you hear that? That's the old bill.

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,307
So unless you want to explain

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,810
why you've got America's favourite
invisible wanker dead on the floor,

5
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:19,854
give us a fucking hand, will you?

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,234
Shit.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,837
All right, listen, I have worked for the feds.

8
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,341
I've worked for loads of people.

9
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:52,303
I'm what you might call an independent contractor.

10
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,848
You got a problem, you call me,
I solve the problem.

11
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,110
What is that?

12
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,530
That's a problem.

13
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,076
Oh, thank fuck, he's alive.

14
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:19,956
- Yes, yes, he's alive! Okay, pull over.
- No, no, no, Hughie, you don't fucking get it.

15
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,583
- Pull the car over.
- This is a fuck-sight worse.

16
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,418
He's seen our faces.

17
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:32,969
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no. I can't do this.

18
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,762
I can't do this. Let me out.

19
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,724
Let me out. Pull over!

20
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:42,770
Hughie, you walk away now,
and you will never get payback for Robin.

21
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,107
You'll spend the rest of your life
sitting on your ass with fucking regret.

22
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,858
Now, is that what you want?

23
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,617
I know a bloke. Top man.

24
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,161
He'll know what to do.

25
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,259
Morning, luv.

26
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,844
Frenchie about?

27
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,989
You'll love this guy.

28
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,417
Frenchie.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,836
Oi, Frenchie.

30
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,008
Monsieur Charcuter.

31
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,262
This is a surprise.

32
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:00,973
Good to see you.

33
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,683
Good to see you, too, mate.

34
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,105
Means you brought that 40,000 you owe me?

35
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,901
I mean, why else would you
show your face around here?

36
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:16,280
Because I've got something even better for you.

37
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,534
How would you like to double your money?

38
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,421
The double of zero is zero.

39
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:33,798
Who is he?

40
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,341
This guy?

41
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,967
Oh, this here is Hughie Campbell.

42
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:40,304
We're, uh, working a little job together.

43
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,726
And he's still alive?

44
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,398
You and I worked together,
and you're still in one piece.

45
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,274
Am I?

46
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,696
Look, do you want to know
what the fucking job is or not?

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,993
Open it.

48
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,912
Who is in there?

49
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,544
Where's your sense of adventure, Frenchie?

50
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,468
You dumb fucks are fucking dead!

51
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,346
Have you any...?

52
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,850
That's Translucent.

53
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,768
You got Translucent in your trunk, huh?

54
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,812
Nothing gets past you, mate.

55
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,316
- Go away. Get him out of here.
- All right, all right, easy.

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,612
He's chipped. The Supes can be on their way.
Homelander can be on his way right now.

57
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:39,530
Wait, he's chipped?

58
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,825
You bring this to my doorstep?
This is not my problem, huh?

59
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,287
Well, it is now. He knows what you look like.

60
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,957
Look, Frenchie, I need your help, mate,

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,920
and I ain't leaving until I get it,
or until the Seven show up.

62
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:05,723
Here comes the A-Train!

63
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,433
My man, how you doing?

64
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,393
Look, I brought you something.

65
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,606
- Thanks?
- Yeah.

66
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:18,235
I'm sorry, I asked for Translucent.

67
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,698
Right, but Translucent is on a secret,
undercover mission right now.

68
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,825
But you got the A-Train, baby.

69
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:30,956
But... my wish was to meet Translucent.

70
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,044
That was my only wish. He's my hero.

71
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:39,215
Yeah. Well, you know,

72
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,761
maybe he can swing by next week or some...

73
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,806
Something...

74
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:53,312
Fuck. You know what?

75
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:58,108
Maybe I can't turn invisible,
but I am the world's fastest man.

76
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,861
Like, I can outrun anybody or anything.

77
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,404
That's something, right?

78
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:08,744
Look, I'll tell you what, you get better,
and I'll teach you to run as fast as me.

79
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,038
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,832
You'll teach me to outrun cancer?

81
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,464
Yeah.

82
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,677
Oh, my God, turn that off.

83
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,513
How many times do I have to tell you
A-Train needs to be scripted?

84
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,807
- Right.
- When he doesn't have a script, this happens.

85
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,016
I'm on it. I'm so sorry.

86
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,726
- It will not happen again.
- All right.

87
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,978
And where is Translucent?

88
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,398
We know he's not in the building.
He hasn't triggered any of the motion sensors.

89
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,817
He's probably out on another one
of his fucking benders.

90
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,570
- Doesn't he have a team-up tomorrow night?
- Yeah, with the Deep.

91
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:43,737
- Get a backup.
- I'm on it.

92
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,947
Okay, go.

93
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,032
Okay.

94
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,117
Hello?

95
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,291
Black Noir.

96
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,961
We haven't properly met yet. I'm Starlight.

97
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,137
Well...

98
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,140
I look forward to working with you.

99
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,100
There she is.

100
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,519
Hi. How you settling in?

101
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,856
Well, it's an adjustment.

102
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,982
That's for sure.

103
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,943
- This is Trevor from Crime Analytics.
- Hi.

104
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,696
So, we have exciting news for you.

105
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,574
We are sending you on your first patrol.

106
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,410
It's a team-up tomorrow night.

107
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,703
Oh, that's great.

108
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,997
That's great news. Thank you.

109
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,624
Hi. Big fan. There you go.

110
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,916
A crime itinerary?

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,044
Yep. Where and when to find the bad guys.

112
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,964
That's what my department does.
We vet leads, crunch satellite data, COMP-STAT.

113
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,299
Better intel than the police.

114
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,468
You know, thanks, but I'm good.

115
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,803
I like to do my own investigating.

116
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,598
And that is why we love you,
but it's not coming from us.

117
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,516
It's corporate. To protect you.

118
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,187
What if you nab the wrong person?
There's liability to consider.

119
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,065
The Deep is coming?

120
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,691
Yeah, it's a water-adjacent crime.

121
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,903
Then he should do it himself.
He doesn't need me.

122
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,946
It was gonna be Deep and Translucent,

123
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,201
but everyone on 82 is so excited
to get you out there.

124
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:16,747
Yeah, it's just, you know,
back in Des Moines, I always patrolled alone.

125
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,749
And that is why we love you.

126
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,836
But we see at least a 23 percent uptick
in social media mentions and hero hashtags

127
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,296
when there's a team-up.

128
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,506
People love a team-up.

129
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,633
Love a team-up.

130
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,586
That stuff really blocks the chip's signal?

131
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,214
Yeah. It's just R.F. Shielding Foil.
You can get it at Fry's.

132
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,425
You're in tech intelligence?

133
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,302
Sales and installation.

134
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:17,891
Oh, what the fuck?

135
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:18,976
Where am I?

136
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,603
Oi. Morning, sunshine.

137
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,689
- You know who I am?
- Not sure.

138
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,316
I know so many invisible assholes.

139
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,152
You fucking amateurs!

140
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,574
Fuck! What the fuck?!

141
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,075
Mind them bars, son.

142
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,661
You'll only bollocks yourself again.

143
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,329
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

144
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,790
Okay, what do you guys want? Money?

145
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,501
We don't want your fucking money.

146
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,300
What do you think, Frenchie?

147
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,762
You just dropped the Moby fucking Dick
of problems on my plate.

148
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,054
That's what I think.

149
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,183
Okay?

150
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,603
He can re-order his carbon
on his skin into metamaterial.

151
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:06,774
It's hard as diamonds.
It's nearly impossible to penetrate.

152
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,359
All right, how about we suffocate him?

153
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,946
Some Dominicans already tried this,
way back, '07.

154
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,573
And what happened?

155
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,160
They're all fucking dead.
That's what happened.

156
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,538
All right, then, fuck it, electrocution.
We'll just increase the amps.

157
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,833
You already hit him with enough
to drop a water buffalo, and look.

158
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,586
Might knock him out.
Doesn't seem to kill him, huh? No.

159
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,379
We need to pierce the skin somehow.

160
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,924
Well, how the hell are we gonna do that?

161
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,926
I don't know.

162
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,385
You're gonna kill him?

163
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,433
We didn't bring him here for a fucking Happy Meal.

164
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,020
I don't... I thought we'd
question him or something.

165
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,439
I don't know,
you get a hold of someone this big...

166
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:51,735
At Gitmo, we had to water board
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times

167
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,364
over six months to get him to talk just once.

168
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,907
Now, we ain't got six months.

169
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,369
I doubt we've even got six hours.

170
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,915
There are so many crazy things
about what you just said,

171
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,876
but right now,
you're talking about randomly killing

172
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,505
one of the most famous men on the planet.

173
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,382
A goddamn national treasure.

174
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:17,761
I mean... people tend to
notice that kind of thing.

175
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:23,141
And if we let him go...
what do you think the Seven will do to us?

176
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,940
You can't get A-Train
if you're a greasy smear on the pavement.

177
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,111
I'm not a murderer.

178
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,407
That's all right.

179
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,576
I am.

180
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,497
The race is coming up quickly. How you feeling?

181
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:49,376
Look, A-Train is a fierce competitor,
but no one can be the world's fastest man forever.

182
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,794
Let's just say I like my chan...

183
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,379
I'll always protect you.

184
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,383
Your little hero will never be afraid
with the Junior Homelander Cuddle...

185
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,220
I regret to inform you
that I've located the mayor's Gulfstream.

186
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:03,265
It's about two miles down
at the bottom of Hudson Canyon.

187
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,394
There are no survivors,
and I've yet to locate the flight recorder.

188
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,647
Though the jet was fragmented,
there was one engine fully intact,

189
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,399
and it appears to be engine failure.

190
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,860
So I'd like to offer...

191
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,868
- Still going strong, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,246
Yeah. I've just been pumping for 30 minutes,
and I got a quarter of an ounce.

193
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,415
Hey, hey, go easy on yourself.

194
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,292
Come on, now.

195
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:37,382
Personally, I think it's amazing
that a woman your age can have a baby, period.

196
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,718
That is so sweet of you to say.

197
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,847
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you found Translucent yet?

198
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,892
You heard about that?

199
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,560
No, not yet.

200
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,397
Well, you know, I could search for him.
Personally.

201
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,650
That's not necessary.

202
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,026
Right.

203
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,031
Hey, did you hear about the mayor of Baltimore?

204
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,453
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,998
Heard his plane went down.
Some sort of engine trouble.

206
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,625
Yeah, it's awful.

207
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,668
I saw him on Tuesday.

208
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,336
I had a meeting with him right here.

209
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,674
Well, hug your kids, right?

210
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,134
Because you never know
what might happen.

211
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,219
So true.

212
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,638
You know what's interesting?

213
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,599
The Deep told me, and only me,

214
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:32,896
that there were scorch marks
on the mayor's engine.

215
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,693
Almost as if from two small,
high-intensity beams,

216
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,820
roughly the width of human eyes.

217
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,449
Say what you mean to say.

218
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,997
Your brand is hope...

219
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,709
baseball, America, sunshine.

220
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,420
You don't do vengeance.

221
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,634
Madelyn, I heard him through the wall of this...

222
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,136
He was blackmailing you.

223
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,346
I am the last person you need to save.

224
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,806
Yeah, but I did it for you.

225
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,184
I know, but did the timing occur to you?

226
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:15,439
I have half the Senate Appropriations Committee
coming tonight.

227
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,956
How did he even know about Compound V?

228
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,000
We are not going to talk about that.

229
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,501
Oh, come on, Madelyn.

230
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,171
You do not need to hide things from me.

231
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:43,258
I love Vought as much as you do,
and I can do more.

232
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,384
You can do more?

233
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,637
You've already grossed $12.3 billion for us.

234
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,265
Right. So the pricks on 82
can take all the fucking credit?

235
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,560
Empty fucking suits with Cornell degrees?
Come on.

236
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,772
I'm the one who's out there. Not them.

237
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:02,360
I'm the one who knows the audience.

238
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,780
Who knows what's good for this company.

239
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,115
I know. I hear you. I do.

240
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,076
But what I need right now,

241
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,080
is I need you to charm the shit
out of those congressmen.

242
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,833
Right.

243
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,045
Because that's all I'm good for, huh?

244
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,048
Smile, look pretty, say my lines.

245
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,550
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

246
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,220
No. No.

247
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,850
You just need to let me protect you.

248
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,020
Oh, you're gonna protect me?

249
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,611
Gods are pure...

250
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,198
and they're perfect...

251
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,575
and they're above it all.

252
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,120
And they need to stay that way.

253
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,469
You're leaking.

254
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,223
Thank you.

255
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,967
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

256
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,345
Hughie, where have you been?
I've been calling hospitals.

257
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,263
I'm fine.

258
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,891
But the police are saying
some wacko drove into Gary's store,

259
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,851
right through the window, and then took off.

260
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,061
I thought maybe you've been hurt,
or kidnapped.

261
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,147
I saw this Dateline on human trafficking...

262
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,399
Dad, I haven't been human trafficked, okay?

263
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,611
I closed up early.
It must have happened after I left.

264
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,112
But where'd you go?

265
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,157
Just been drinking at Anthony's.

266
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,202
- Blowing off steam.
- No. Now, I called Anthony, all right?

267
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,579
I called everybody.
No one's seen you. Don't lie to me.

268
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,207
Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain.

269
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,751
Hey, Dad, listen, I got to, I got to go.

270
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,795
Just, listen, I know you've been taking
Robin's accident real hard.

271
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,633
- It wasn't an accident.
- All right, all right. My point is, you're a good boy.

272
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,177
You're a sensitive boy. Come home.

273
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,889
Okay? Before you do something stupid,
come home, Hughie.

274
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,516
- I got to go.
- No, wait, Hugh...

275
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,729
Well, I heard we had a meeting.
So, I'll just leave you to it.

276
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:29,109
Well, we're having a meeting right now,
aren't we, Deep?

277
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,152
You and me.

278
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,781
- Come on in.
- Yeah. Sure.

279
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,969
So, what...?

280
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,806
Or is there... Is there anything I can...
I can do for you, Homelander?

281
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,518
Well, yeah. I guess...

282
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,357
Well, you can help me understand something,
Deep, because...

283
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:14,279
I don't know, maybe I'm stupid.
Am I stupid, Deep?

284
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,323
What? No.

285
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,868
No. You're not stupid.

286
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,038
You're smart. Very smart, right?

287
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,664
Yeah. Okay.

288
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:29,294
So, what possible reason...

289
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:33,840
what razor-sharp fish instinct...

290
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,801
made you run to Stillwell

291
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,262
and tell her what you thought
you saw down there?

292
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,932
All right, look, I thought...
I thought I... I was...

293
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,186
I don't even know... I don't know what I saw
down there, as a matter of fact.

294
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,313
It was, it was really dark and muddy...

295
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,023
The water was really muddy.

296
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,068
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

297
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,945
I didn't...

298
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,574
I didn't really see anything down there,
as a matter of fact.

299
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,702
That's what I thought.

300
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,871
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

301
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:17,342
And I trust we never have
to have this conversation again.

302
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:21,346
No. Of course not. Just this once.

303
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,191
Now go fuck Shamu in the blowhole.

304
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,529
Yeah.

305
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:26,494
Rounds coated in the same carbon
metamaterial as his skin.

306
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,462
Will it work?

307
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,838
Je ne sais pas.

308
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,057
Guys?

309
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,977
What are you doing?
Wait! No, no, no! Wait, wait!

310
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,988
You stupid, fucking asshole.

311
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,781
I'm invincible.

312
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,534
You stupid motherfuckers.

313
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:10,747
I'm fucking Translucent.

314
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,415
I'm indestructible.

315
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:17,003
It's only a matter of time before
they come for me. You're fucking dead!

316
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,384
Well, that was great, guys.

317
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,762
That was awesome.

318
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,433
Frenchie, back later.

319
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,768
Where are you going?

320
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:37,148
Got an idea. Long shot, might help.

321
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,651
- Now?
- Yeah, well, it's all under control here, isn't it?

322
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,444
Try not to bugger each other.

323
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,957
Fuck me.

324
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,876
Fuck.

325
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,598
Sorry, Ms. Stillwell.

326
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,312
- Are you Anika?
- Ms. Stillwell, I didn't know that you were...

327
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,189
You look really nice.

328
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,983
Thank you. Could you please show me?

329
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,653
Yeah. We haven't been able to ping
Translucent's chip until about five minutes ago.

330
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,029
Well, where is he?

331
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,364
Jersey City.

332
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,199
What the hell is he doing in Jersey City?

333
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,827
Well, he's somewhere in this ten-block area.

334
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,997
- That is the best you can do?
- It's possible the chip's glitching,

335
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,499
- or there's some kind of interference...
- Okay.

336
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,836
Tell security to search the area,
door-to-door if necessary.

337
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,671
But tell them to be discreet.

338
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,758
- He is invisible, so it shouldn't be that hard.
- Okay.

339
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,265
Oh, wow. What a surprise.

340
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,017
A water crime.

341
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,605
Fuck me running. I swear to God,
they only call me when there's trouble at a dock.

342
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:03,568
Or a river or a lake, canal...

343
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:04,694
jetty.

344
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,698
Fucking idiots.
I could be doing so much more.

345
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,201
But no, Vought just wants me
to make my big pretty dives into the water

346
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,662
and flash my fucking biceps for Instagram.

347
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:19,250
I mean, sure, four million hits a day.
Still, it's fucking demeaning.

348
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,671
What's your problem?

349
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,674
You've had that pissy look
on your face all night.

350
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,097
What...?

351
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,141
Is this about the other night again?

352
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,937
Jesus Christ.

353
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,065
Cry me a fucking river, all right?

354
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,151
I took my share of shit
when I first got here, okay?

355
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,112
Besides, you had a crush on me, remember?

356
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:53,201
That gives you no right, zero right,
to do what you did, you pathetic asshole.

357
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,870
- Hey. You shut your fucking mouth.
- Or what?

358
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,289
You'll sic a grouper on me?

359
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,500
I'll tell everyone you're a psycho.

360
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,211
- I'll go to Homelander.
- No, you won't.

361
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:06,631
See, I asked around,
you're not number two around here.

362
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,342
You're just the fish guy.

363
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,260
Everyone thinks you're a joke.

364
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,596
Me, most of all.

365
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,684
I cannot believe I fell for your crap.

366
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:22,522
- You stuck-up little...
- You ever touch me again...

367
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,982
I will burn your eyes out.

368
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,987
Understand me?

369
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,498
We'll finish this later.

370
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,918
You take them from the front,
I'll come in from behind.

371
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,480
I'll always...

372
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,111
Hey.

373
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,079
Hey, boys.

374
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:31,716
Hurry up. Move faster. You're amazing.
That was so great. That was really good.

375
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,010
- What? What the hell is this?
- Smile for the cameras.

376
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,680
- Yeah, stand over him and say "This is lit."
- Oh, hey, Jimmy.

377
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,184
Catch my dive in the water?
It was fucking cherry.

378
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,477
Nice.

379
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:48,107
Smile at the camera, Starlight.

380
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,911
Congrats on your promotion, Susan.

381
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,705
Jesus Christ. Butcher.

382
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,792
Madam Deputy Director, eh?

383
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,921
Wow. Andrew and the kids
must be chuffed for you.

384
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:13,007
Keep your voice down,
and don't talk about my family.

385
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,383
It makes my skin crawl.

386
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,010
What are you doing here?

387
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,056
Just need a quick dekko at some of your files.

388
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,351
- My files? What files?
- A couple of Supes.

389
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:27,021
Big Game, Shout Out. Translucent, if you got him.

390
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,399
- Why Translucent?
- Nothing special, just ticking a few boxes.

391
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,986
So you just broke into my goddamn house
in the middle of the night?

392
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,446
All right.

393
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,784
I'm trying to find a way to do the job on the cunt,
and if it's anywhere, it'll be in Mallory's files.

394
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,994
- Now would you like me to keep talking?
- No.

395
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:46,207
No. Christ. Just don't fucking say another word.

396
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,751
The Mallory files are dead and buried.

397
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,587
You're the deputy director of CIA Operations.

398
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,297
- Dig them up.
- No.

399
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,341
- Why not?
- Because of you.

400
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,093
- Me?
- Yes, you.

401
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,888
The director will shitcan anyone
who even goes near those files.

402
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:04,684
You made it suicide to go after the Supes.

403
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:08,771
What are you even doing back involved in this?

404
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:12,984
I mean, you have a death wish,
or are you a glutton for punishment?

405
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,071
Yeah. A bit of both, I suppose.

406
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:25,705
Come on... Susan.

407
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,791
Five minutes alone with a piece of paper.

408
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,335
For old time's sakes. No one will know.

409
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,298
You... You're really trying to sell this shit?

410
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,465
Why, you buying it?

411
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:41,679
You think I look back fondly
at the times we fucked in bar bathrooms?

412
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,764
Oh, come on. We had a few laughs.

413
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,851
Like the time you sent me the Edible Arrangement.

414
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:52,857
And what we had was you trying to use me, for a
Get Out of Jail Free card at a time like this.

415
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,067
Well, if that's all it was, then,

416
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,153
what's got you so hot and bothered

417
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,780
when a simple "fuck you" would suffice?

418
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,159
Fuck you.

419
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,496
Now get out of my house.

420
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,676
Did I mention this is life or death?

421
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,013
I'll send an Edible Arrangement to your funeral.

422
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,535
Hi.

423
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,999
I... I thought you might be thirsty, so...

424
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,473
- Well, if you don't want it, I can always...
- No, I want it.

425
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,229
Cheers.

426
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:23,781
So, listen,
I need to ask you some questions about A-Train.

427
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:30,079
When he burst through that woman
the other day,

428
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,456
Robin Ward...

429
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,000
I... I need to know why.

430
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,168
Where was he going? What was he doing?

431
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,462
Why? Was she your sister?

432
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,006
Girlfriend?

433
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,675
Girlfriend.

434
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,512
That's what all this is about? Christ.

435
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,514
What makes you think I know
anything about it?

436
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,057
I know you and A-Train were tight.

437
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:53,602
- You guys came up together.
- What are you, a fucking fan?

438
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:58,149
Listen, those two guys in there,
they want to kill you, okay?

439
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:01,402
- So you give me something, maybe I can...
- What? Hold them off?

440
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,488
Because they hang on your every word.
You're the big man around here.

441
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,699
Okay, you don't want to talk, don't talk. I tried.

442
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,783
Good luck.

443
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,953
Buddy, my superpower ain't invisibility.

444
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,622
You know that, right?

445
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:19,837
It's reading people.
Watching them when they think they're alone.

446
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,018
I see people for who they really are.

447
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,520
I see you, too, pal.

448
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:37,730
Right.

449
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,940
Because you know me so well, right?

450
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:44,445
Yeah. I know you're trying your damnedest
to be tough, it's a little adorable...

451
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:48,991
but the truth is... you're terrified.

452
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,994
Shitting in your tighty-whities

453
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:56,248
because you're "in over your head fucked",
and you know it.

454
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,400
Hughie, I even kind of feel for you.

455
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:27,738
Your girl died, and we do crazy shit
when we got broken hearts,

456
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:31,033
but now every instinct is screaming at you
to head for the hills,

457
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,661
and you should listen to that instinct.

458
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,164
Unless we kill you first.

459
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:38,666
How?

460
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,585
I got invulnerable skin.

461
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:45,589
I'm a fucking superhero, guy.

462
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,926
We fight gangs and terrorists.

463
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,429
We save the world daily.

464
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,933
I've stood in front of
thousands of screaming fans,

465
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,978
all of them creaming their jeans.

466
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,897
Who are you?

467
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:06,193
A water balloon filled...

468
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,989
with blood and meat.

469
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:16,370
Homelander's gonna find me, and when he does,
he's gonna burst you wide open.

470
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,372
I'm gonna make it home in time for cocktails.

471
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,250
Because that's who you are,
and that's who I am.

472
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,712
You're not the hero of this story.

473
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:31,385
And I'm not the one who's trapped.

474
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,059
Well, good luck.

475
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,061
I tried.

476
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,356
Great chat.

477
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,110
Run for the hills, Hughie.

478
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,413
It looks like we're losing him.
The signal's going in and out.

479
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,712
Keep searching,
about another 50 feet down on the right.

480
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:44,500
Because, thanks to Samaritan's Embrace,
Asim has a bed,

481
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,378
a ventilated cooking area, and a laptop.

482
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,046
But our work is not done.

483
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,883
There are millions more children just like Asim,
who need your help.

484
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,718
For just $9.99 a month,

485
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:58,305
- that is only 33 cents a day,
- Hi, John. Thanks for your support.

486
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:00,057
You can give many...

487
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,351
It's what makes this republic so great.

488
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,895
Bill. How are the kids?

489
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,563
Hey.

490
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:10,859
Give to Samaritan's Embrace today,
and give a child just like Asim...

491
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,444
Could I get a club soda?

492
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,488
Ms. Stillwell.

493
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,533
Senator, what can I get you?

494
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,786
- Jack, rocks.
- You know, we have Macallan 25.

495
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,539
You'd be wasting it. Whisky's whisky to me.

496
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:29,169
Boy, they're blowing
so much smoke up Maeve's ass,

497
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:31,630
it's a miracle she doesn't die of lung cancer.

498
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,926
But you know it's just that, right? Smoke.

499
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,219
I'm sorry?

500
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:40,472
Everyone loves to bask in their glow,

501
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:45,436
but tomorrow morning
no one's putting Supes into national defence.

502
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,480
It won't get out of committee,
much less hit the floor.

503
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:51,525
Because God forbid we could have an advantage
in an armed conflict.

504
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,988
You send a Supe over the 38th parallel,
Pyongyang's gonna answer with a nuke.

505
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,449
Then one of my guys will catch it.

506
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,493
You see Robertson over there?

507
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,747
He's got Lockheed in his state and in his pocket.

508
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,876
McCrea? He's got Fort Bragg
and its couple thousand voters.

509
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:13,839
No one wants to outsource to you.

510
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,091
America runs on weapons.

511
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,510
Hell, it's one of the only
damn things we still make.

512
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,679
But you are the chairman.

513
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:21,680
Where do you stand?

514
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,682
Me? I'm just an old leatherneck.

515
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:27,895
And if I was on the line, scare the shit out of me
to have Homelander there.

516
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:31,106
My heroes are the most loyal, patriotic...

517
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,358
That's just it.

518
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:36,445
They're your heroes, aren't they?

519
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,950
Get him a Macallan 25.

520
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,207
Why have average
when you can have extraordinary?

521
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,508
Thank you.

522
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:00,719
Guys, we should get back to the party.

523
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,805
- What?
- Elena just ordered more booze.

524
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,431
- Come on, let's go back.
- No, no.

525
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,101
It'll be more fun at the party.
Please... Okay, don't touch me.

526
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,602
No, please, please.

527
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,562
Oh, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, no!

528
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:11,814
Please, no, no, no, no!

529
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,650
- The girl said no.
- Help.

530
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,776
We're all friends here.

531
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,530
Yeah, it's all good. It's fine.

532
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:29,748
Miss, do me a favour and shut your eyes.

533
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,293
Fucking bitch.

534
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,022
Fucking diamond skin.

535
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,943
- Fuck.
- Merde!

536
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,326
Here.

537
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,579
Here, take it.

538
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,081
What is that?

539
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,333
It will help with your anxiety.

540
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:17,713
It's LSD and MDMA. This is a candy flip.
It'll smooth you right out. Take it.

541
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:22,801
Thank you, but I don't think
now is the time for a major hallucinogen.

542
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,388
Fais-toi plaisir.

543
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,691
What are you exactly?

544
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:41,361
Chemist? Engineer? What?

545
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:45,657
No. I know a little about a lot of things.

546
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:51,079
I'm a gunrunner by trade, but,
as you can see, I've developed a certain niche.

547
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,664
Killing superheroes?

548
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:53,749
No.

549
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,295
You can count on one hand
the number of dead superheroes.

550
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,173
Sometimes you can incapacitate them.

551
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,762
Truly, they are magnificent creatures.

552
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:12,768
Each one with a unique power
that requires a unique solution.

553
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,438
It's... it's never the same twice.

554
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,148
Who pays you to do that?

555
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,067
Whoever can pay.

556
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:26,114
And when you do kill a Supe,

557
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,450
...or, you know, anyone,

558
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,538
what's it like?

559
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,089
You know...

560
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:47,219
I saw this woman once,
in a midtown elevator, 2008.

561
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,889
No more for ten seconds, I see her, huh?

562
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,933
Stunning.

563
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,518
Five-nine.

564
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,273
Hair so black it absorbed the light, you know?

565
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,859
Tom Ford pencil skirt, Louboutin stilettos.

566
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,444
C'est magnifique.

567
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,449
But she had... she had...

568
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,452
I never forget this, you see.

569
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:16,540
She had dirt under her fingernails
and callouses on her hands,

570
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:20,836
and I see this and I say,
"Oh, strange for such a refined woman like this."

571
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,130
What, you... You a gardener?

572
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,133
You know, are you a sculptor?
What is this, huh?

573
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,760
And I think about this...

574
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,804
Yeah. I...

575
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:36,226
I think about her all the time.

576
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,689
She was the first person I ever killed.

577
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,153
I carry...

578
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,655
I carry them all with me.

579
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:53,368
It's like scars in a way, you know?

580
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,210
Okay, senator, you ready?

581
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,963
Oh, yeah.

582
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:08,842
Oh, darling.

583
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,136
You know I like to watch.

584
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,764
No. Can't always be in control.

585
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:16,558
Sir.

586
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,519
Then I guess I'll just have
to feel my way through it.

587
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,230
Oh, you'll feel good indeed, baby.

588
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,739
- You ready?
- Oh, I was born ready.

589
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,075
Feels like butter, baby.

590
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,619
Get ready, sir.

591
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:39,206
You're going in.

592
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,791
Giddyup, gal. Come on.

593
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:41,917
Oh, God.

594
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,544
That... That feels different.

595
00:41:58,975 --> 00:41:59,976
Hey...

596
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,853
Homelander.

597
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:03,605
Starlight.

598
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,274
How are you?

599
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,071
I'm good.

600
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,656
Good.

601
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,494
Hey, is that your secret identity?

602
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,455
Charming.

603
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:21,540
Thanks.

604
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:25,085
Yeah, I gave up on mine...

605
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,672
a long time ago now.

606
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,800
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

607
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,220
Good night.

608
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:51,153
No. No, I did not go through eight rounds of IVF

609
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,905
and bleeding nipples to quit now.

610
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,033
I am doing this. Yes.

611
00:42:57,117 --> 00:43:01,455
That little kid is gonna drink my goddamn milk
if it's the last thing I do.

612
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:28,565
While scientists
now believe the shell evolved

613
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,985
to help turtles burrow underground...

614
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,751
What are you doing?

615
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,920
Shocking our invisible friend.

616
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,422
I need him unconscious.

617
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:54,883
Why?

618
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,093
Because I got it.

619
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,680
Now what the fuck do you want?

620
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,770
What the fuck, Starlight?!

621
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,438
What?

622
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,904
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

623
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,030
Oh, shit.

624
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:21,243
And so glad you did it in plain clothes,
so you could blow your secret identity.

625
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:25,622
Here. "OMG. I recognise Starlight,
that's Annie January!

626
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:30,168
I went to Hoover High with her.
Hashtag 'SheWasBulimic."'

627
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,340
One, this was stupid.

628
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:39,636
Two, it was really stupid to do it on camera.

629
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,346
Always look for cameras.

630
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,765
- They were about to rape a girl.
- What girl?

631
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:46,852
- There's no girl in that video. You get a name?
- No, she ran off.

632
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,603
Oh, great. She ran off. Great.

633
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:51,189
Always get a fucking name, Starlight. Always!

634
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:53,400
Well... They said...

635
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,861
They said she was a friend.

636
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,404
It was date rape, I think.

637
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,074
Great. Well, she hasn't come forward
and, statistically, she's not likely to.

638
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,577
So all we really have is two Delta Betas

639
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,996
who insist they were just
getting drunk in an alley

640
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,582
until you beat them unconscious.

641
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,375
They're lying! I...

642
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,169
Aren't I innocent until proven guilty?

643
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:16,047
When you're in the big leagues, you flip it.

644
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:23,430
I don't know what you were planning
on doing today, with your little, cute day,

645
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,265
but you have to cancel everything, okay?

646
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:28,351
You're gonna have meetings with
Risk Assessment, with Crisis Management,

647
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:30,145
with Legal.

648
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,147
Jerry is gonna lose his shit!

649
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,690
Fuck.

650
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,692
Am...

651
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:38,904
Are they gonna fire me?

652
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:42,240
Just be in Stillwell's office at 10:00.

653
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:43,950
But...

654
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,077
Am I fired?

655
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:49,331
Senator, I very much appreciate
you coming bright and early.

656
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:53,919
I realise how busy you were last night.

657
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,720
These... are fake.

658
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:06,431
I think we both know they're not.

659
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:10,852
Look. I was with a young woman, all right?

660
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:12,187
Of legal age.

661
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,563
Her name was Rhonda.

662
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:16,107
So this isn't possible.

663
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,568
They've obviously
been doctored or something.

664
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,320
I'm sorry, they are authentic.

665
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,656
I should know. I was there.

666
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,449
You what?

667
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,750
You shiver when you orgasm, sir.

668
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,418
Oh, Jesus.

669
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,506
That will be all, Doppelganger.

670
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:41,633
Who the fuck is he?

671
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:46,054
Anyway, I would love to continue
our conversation from last night.

672
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:50,058
This is some dirty fucking pool, Madelyn.

673
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,686
You're really gonna clutch your pearls, senator?

674
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:56,398
I don't think either one of us is that naive.

675
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,817
Yeah. It's not...

676
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,903
it's not fatal to be homosexual these days.

677
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:04,030
It is in Oklahoma, sir.

678
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:06,074
Where your voters live.

679
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:13,081
Even if I get the bill out of committee,
nobody's gonna vote for it on the floor.

680
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,751
No one wants your fucking Supes in the Army.

681
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,379
We'll see.

682
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,968
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

683
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,474
Homelander.

684
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:34,853
Welcome to Crime Analytics.

685
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,689
- Can... Would you like a Red Bull?
- Have you found Translucent yet?

686
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,608
No. But Security's on it.

687
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:44,279
He's been missing over 24 hours.

688
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,740
Is he in danger?

689
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,783
Do... you even know?

690
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,495
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

691
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:56,166
- What's his last known position, please?
- Why don't I just call Ms. Stillwell?

692
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:57,500
- And I...
- No.

693
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:00,128
No, no, no, no, no. You're talking to me.

694
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:04,090
Well, I'm not sure I'm
supposed to be talking to...

695
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,384
What's your name?

696
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,762
- Anika.
- Anika.

697
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,805
- Sir.
- It's a beautiful name.

698
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,808
Listen, Anika.

699
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,019
I'm the Homelander.

700
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,730
And I can do whatever the fuck I want.

701
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,149
Okay?

702
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,026
Now...

703
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,863
Translucent's last known position.

704
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,741
Please.

705
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,043
What the...?

706
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,378
- Something doesn't feel right.
- Oh, I'll bet.

707
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:46,174
I'm not ashamed to admit I have outdone myself.

708
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,057
Now, the problem is the skin, no?
It's hard like diamonds.

709
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,894
But then I realised,
it is just your shell that is hard, huh?

710
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,854
Like a turtle.

711
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,898
But your insides...

712
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,317
they're like the rest of ours...

713
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,527
soft.

714
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,905
So, how do you get to the... squishy insides?

715
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,031
Through the mouth? Non.

716
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,243
The stomach acid, the gag reflex.

717
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:16,955
If I stick something down your throat,
you may vomit it up.

718
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:20,583
There's truly only one way...

719
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,961
The fuck did you do to me?

720
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:26,756
He stuck a lump of plastique up your bum, son.

721
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,800
Ass bomb.

722
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,595
Oh, my God.

723
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,725
Now...

724
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:41,521
you stick a little finger up there
and try and fish it out...

725
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,148
bang.

726
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,695
I trigger this, also bang. Savvy?

727
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:51,656
Oh, please don't kill me.

728
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,324
I'll do anything.

729
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:57,370
I'll tell you about A-Train.

730
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,747
That's what the kid wants, right?

731
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:03,209
I don't know where A-Train was going
that night he killed the girl, okay?

732
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:05,670
- But I know where he was coming from.
- What? Where?

733
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,338
Popclaw's.

734
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:11,301
He fucking... loves her.
He doesn't think anyone else knows, but I know.

735
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:12,760
I know a lot of things.

736
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:14,345
He's there every night.

737
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,681
Maybe... now, even.

738
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,976
Popclaw? That's the hero with the sharp things
coming out of her arms.

739
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,477
Yeah. Real D-lister.

740
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:23,938
Anyone knows what A-Train was doing,
it's Popclaw.

741
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:26,232
But that's all I know about
that, I swear to Christ.

742
00:50:26,316 --> 00:50:28,735
But I'll tell you anything else you want.

743
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,403
Just ask.

744
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,871
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just... ask anything.

745
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:44,000
Now, normally,
that would be just what the doctor ordered.

746
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,837
But unfortunately, for you...

747
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:49,172
we're out of time.

748
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,924
No.

749
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,133
No!

750
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,344
Please! Listen, I know shit.

751
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,429
Dark shit! All the way to the top!

752
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,598
Wait, wait! No, no, no! Please, wait, wait, wait.

753
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,392
Listen, I can help you. I'm fucking invisible!
We can be a team.

754
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,478
- Butcher!
- No, please, please, please!

755
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,855
- Please, I can...
- A moment, s'il vous plait.

756
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:11,194
Here.

757
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,112
What is that?

758
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,282
Homelander.

759
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:18,576
That's Homelander?

760
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,620
Homelander's here? Oh, shit.

761
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,372
Oh, shit!

762
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:28,086
He can see us. He's got X-ray vision.
He can see through the fucking roof.

763
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,129
And super fucking hearing.

764
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:32,924
You pull that detonator, he will hear.

765
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,849
Homelander.

766
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,143
We got to throw him off the scent.

767
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:45,186
But how?

768
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,563
Pittsburgh.

769
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,440
Oh, you cannot be serious, huh?

770
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,692
Deadly.

771
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,279
You know how much this will cost me?

772
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,571
Put it on the tab.

773
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,124
Guys?!

774
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:15,133
Where is it?

775
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,051
Back door panel.

776
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:27,729
Look, the mall shooting's a tragedy.

777
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:31,733
I'm just saying, if more people were armed,
maybe I wouldn't have to save the day every time.

778
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,443
- So, in a situation...
- Hello?

779
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:35,069
Cherie. It's a burn.

780
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:36,738
You're joking.

781
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:37,864
Now?

782
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,157
No joke, I'm afraid.

783
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:44,245
Fine.

784
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:46,914
I'll be ready in three.

785
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:50,710
Come on.

786
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:54,547
- Frenchie, I'm getting shit reception here.
- Well, figure it the fuck out, huh?

787
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,093
Come on.

788
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,293
Evening.

789
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:36,631
Holy shit. You're the Homelander.

790
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,049
I am talking to the Homelander.

791
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,802
Sir, I need to see some ID.

792
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:44,764
Get the fuck back in that cage.

793
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,141
Just take it easy. Okay?

794
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,768
What you doing out here?

795
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,728
This is my place.

796
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,065
We... I'm... I'm opening a Fogo de Chão.

797
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,150
You know what a churrascaria is?

798
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,069
Yeah. It's a Brazilian steakhouse.

799
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,655
Sir, I need to see in the back of the van.

800
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,492
No offence, you got a... warrant or something?

801
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:09,831
Well, if you got nothing back there,
then you got nothing to worry about, right?

802
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:16,879
Please get back in the cage.

803
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:21,634
I'm not getting back in that cage, man.
I do, I am dead.

804
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,929
Yeah, well, if you don't... you're dead.

805
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:56,669
Just think.
You kill me, they'll never stop looking for you.

806
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:00,298
You'll be glancing over your shoulder
your whole life

807
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:04,385
until they find you, which they will.

808
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:18,107
Everything all right, sir?

809
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:42,256
Look, you let me go...

810
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,385
you'll be the hero that saved Translucent.

811
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:49,180
It's not too late.

812
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,599
You can still go home.

813
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,769
Back to your life.

814
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:02,818
Attaboy.
