1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:07,132
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,802
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,972
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,392
Then an accident made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,771
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,567
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,157
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,660
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,954
We trapped Reverse-Flash
in the force field.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,872
The containment shouldn't have failed.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,458
- I'm having these dreams.
- What happens in the dream?

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,711
Wells is the Reverse-Flash,
and he kills me.

14
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,591
If this is Dr. Wells, then who have we been
working for this whole time?

15
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,802
A completely different person.

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,846
- Oh, my God.
- What the frak?

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,144
"Flash missing, vanishes in crisis."

18
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,231
"After an epic street battle
with the Reverse-Flash...

19
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:10,571
our city's very own Scarlet Speedster
disappeared in an explosion of light."

20
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,905
Barry, look at the date.

21
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,368
"April 25th, 2024."

22
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,914
Guys, when I fought the Reverse-Flash
at Christmas...

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,458
he said that we'd be fighting
for centuries.

24
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:29,631
Wait, you can't really think
that this is from... the future.

25
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,927
That would mean Dr. Wells,
whoever he is, is also...

26
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,846
From the future.

27
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,558
I have to say, I'm really digging
the brighter red suit.

28
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,477
And the white on the symbol, that's dope.

29
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,814
Wait a second. Suppose we now
change the color on your suit.

30
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,817
Will it be because we got the idea
from this picture?

31
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,862
That would mean we're living
in a causal nexus.

32
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,866
Wow, this is so trippy.
Like "Marty and the Polaroid" trippy.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,578
Not as trippy as the name on the byline.

34
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,874
"Iris West-Allen"?

35
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,002
Mazel tov?

36
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,880
Hebrew,
ancient language of the Jewish people.

37
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,507
Uh-uh. What the hell was that?

38
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,635
Is someone here?

39
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,887
Hello?

40
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,181
Good evening, Barry Allen.

41
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,309
Uh...

42
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,977
Hi. You...?

43
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,521
- You know who I am?
- Of course.

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,275
Barry Allen. Director of
Central City Police. CSI Division.

45
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,278
- Director?
- I guess you get a promotion.

46
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,156
Also known as the Flash.
Founding member of...

47
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,241
- What are you?
- I'm Gideon...

48
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,327
an interactive artificial consciousness.

49
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,581
Al. Sick.

50
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,586
- You know Dr. Wells?
- Yes.

51
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,466
Do you know who he really is?

52
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,343
I don't understand the question.

53
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,556
I mean, what is he doing here?
Why did he come here?

54
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,102
To kill you.

55
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,237
- Wells is in the building.
- How do you know that?

56
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,988
I put a tracker on his wheelchair.

57
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,700
Which, if we're wrong about him
and he is paralyzed...

58
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,702
I'm going to hell for that one.

59
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,666
He's in the Cortex. Ask questions fast.

60
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,584
Why did he kill Nora Allen?

61
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,962
- Because he was angry.
- About what?

62
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,171
That you escaped.

63
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:39,094
- He's on B level. He's coming this way.
- What does he want from me?

64
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,971
- For you to be the Flash.
- What?

65
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,057
Well, maybe that's why Wells
let the particle accelerator explode.

66
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,768
So that you could become the Flash.

67
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,645
Why? I mean, for what reason?

68
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,939
- Guys, we gotta go. He's almost here.
- Hurry.

69
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,692
- All right.
- Wait a second. Wait.

70
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,695
What if HAL over there tells Wells
that we were in here?

71
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,071
That would be bad.

72
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,033
If I can get into its operating system,
maybe I can disable its memory core.

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,872
Uh, Gideon, can you show us
where your operating system is?

74
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,623
Certainly.

75
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,963
Yeah. Nope, that's not gonna happen.

76
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,423
Guys, he's in the corridor.

77
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,969
Uh, Gideon, could you just, like,
not tell him that we were here?

78
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,889
Of course. I will accept any command
given to me by you.

79
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,766
- Barry.
- We gotta get out of here.

80
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,311
Wait, wait.
Why would you accept my commands?

81
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,354
Because you created me.

82
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,422
- Good evening, Gideon.
- Good evening, Dr. Wells.

83
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,965
Is everything all right?

84
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,551
Everything is fine.

85
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,519
Hey.

86
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,771
What's the emergency?

87
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,731
Oh, no emergency.

88
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,443
- I just wanted to talk to you.
- Thanks.

89
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,404
Without Iris around. Or Barry around.

90
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,699
Or Cisco around. Or Caitlin around.

91
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,912
So in other words,
you want to talk to me alone.

92
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,541
- What is it?
- Right.

93
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,876
Um, so listen.

94
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:39,256
With everything going on, investigating
Wells and finding out about Barry...

95
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,092
Eddie, you cannot tell Iris about Barry.

96
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,219
This isn't about Barry.

97
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:50,809
I know the timing might seem off,
you know, with everything that's going on.

98
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,896
But I wanna propose to Iris.

99
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,357
And I'd like your blessing.

100
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,492
No.

101
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,621
- Come again?
- No.

102
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,582
You do not have my blessing.

103
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,420
That's Barry. We gotta go.

104
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,756
Joe, I only asked as a courtesy.
Out of respect.

105
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,467
I don't need your permission.

106
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,929
Really? For three very smart people,
that was really stupid.

107
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,849
What if Wells had caught you in that...?

108
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,100
- Time vault.
- Thank you.

109
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,604
Okay, I know we've seen a lot
this past year, but time travel?

110
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,897
I did it.

111
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,317
- I will do it, I mean.
- Excuse me?

112
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:45,363
One of the two speedsters in Barry's house
the night his mother died was Barry.

113
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,532
I mean, the Flash. He was there.

114
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,622
Which means that one day in the future,
Barry will travel back in time to that night.

115
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:59,252
- Okay.
- Actually, I wasn't talking about that.

116
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,882
I kind of already time-traveled.

117
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,425
- By accident.
- What?

118
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,304
I was running to try and stop a tsunami
from hitting the city...

119
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,389
- When was that?
- A few weeks ago.

120
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,392
Right before you started
getting those dreams.

121
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,229
Oh. You mean the ones
where Wells uses his super-speeding hand...

122
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,734
- to shred apart my heart? Those?
- Yes, right. So...

123
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,487
- What if they're not dreams?
- What else could they be?

124
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,614
- Memories.
- I'm not following.

125
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:33,328
What if that day, Cisco found out that Wells
is Reverse-Flash, and then Wells killed him...

126
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,790
but when I ran back a day, I changed
the timeline so that never happened?

127
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,417
If it never happened,
how can Cisco remember it?

128
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,795
I don't know. I don't know.

129
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,173
I think the important thing is he does.

130
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,885
Guys...

131
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,889
I think I've got a really bad idea.

132
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,574
Dad, it's been three weeks.
You barely eat or sleep.

133
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,285
- You should go home at some point.
- Hey, baby.

134
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,747
I'll go home when Barry does.

135
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,545
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

136
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,171
Help, my son's coding!

137
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,507
They said he was stable. Barry.

138
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,886
- Oh, my God.
- I need the room. Let's go. I need the room.

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,058
How can he be seizing?
He has no heart rhythm.

140
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,770
- Starting compressions.
- Epi, push. Epi.

141
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,778
They can't save him.

142
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,406
But I can.

143
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,784
I know who you are.

144
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,748
You're that scientist that Barry's obsessed
with. The one who blew a hole in the city.

145
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:04,044
Harrison Wells. Interestingly enough, my
facility is the very place I'd like to take him.

146
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,670
You're out of your mind.

147
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:10,008
Not gonna try and convince you with
promises, but, detective, give me a chance.

148
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,428
We know what you're capable of.
You hurt a lot of people that night.

149
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,473
So those doctors in there,
they're good enough?

150
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,975
Best in the city? Best in the country?

151
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,729
Look at them. They have no clue
what's going on. They're baffled.

152
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,523
The reason is
what's happening inside Barry is a mystery.

153
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,484
They don't have the tools to solve it.

154
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,943
- But you do?
- That's right.

155
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,990
Millions of people used to look at my lab,
and what did they see?

156
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:38,036
They saw the future. Well, let me take that
technology, let me take that know-how...

157
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,623
into ensuring that your son
actually does have a future.

158
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,209
Detective.

159
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,463
Let me save him.

160
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,889
Then save him.

161
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,728
Charge, 200, paddles.

162
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,688
Joe.

163
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,358
- Joe, are you listening?
- Yeah.

164
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,818
We...

165
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,403
We have to access
Cisco's memories somehow.

166
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,572
Somewhere in his subconscious is the key.

167
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,117
- The key to what, now?
- Getting my dad out of prison.

168
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,452
And how are we going to do that?

169
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,624
We're gonna get Wells to confess
to killing my mom.

170
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:35,426
So this will allow Cisco
to see into his dream?

171
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,429
I got the idea from a journal article
on lucid-dream therapy.

172
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,641
It can be used to help people suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

173
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,937
Heh. Traumatized, stressed,
check and check.

174
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:50,733
The theory is it will allow people
to enter their dreams and face their fears.

175
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,027
Still working on the talking part.

176
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,614
And you're sure this thing isn't gonna,
you know, mess with my brain?

177
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:01,995
Oh. The amount of electricity required to
trigger lucid dreaming is harmless. Probably.

178
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,788
Who's gonna be lucid dreaming?

179
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,748
Um...

180
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:11,838
With all of the metahumans in Central City,
people have been seeing strange things.

181
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,840
Things that they don't understand.

182
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,677
And it's really just a matter of time
before psychological issues develop.

183
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,848
And lucid dreaming will help the doctors
better understand their fears. Intriguing.

184
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,894
Of course, you still need to guide
the patient from the outside, right?

185
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,354
Direct them to specific aspects
of that dream.

186
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,066
We're still working
on a communications interface.

187
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,696
When we dream, the middle brain lights up
with electrical activity...

188
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,408
whereas the higher brain
remains dormant.

189
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,328
Once we find a way
to make both parts of the brain active...

190
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,540
it's just a matter of finding the frequency
that will stimulate the language center.

191
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,250
Then the dreamer could speak.

192
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,377
- He could describe his dream.
- Exactly.

193
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,131
- Or her dream. It could be used for anyone.
- Right, it's not gender-specific.

194
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:59,469
I would try a frequency
of 45 hertz to start.

195
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,929
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

196
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,641
Well, you never cease
to impress me, Caitlin.

197
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,855
- Allen.
- Hey.

198
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,317
The Owens case. I'm waiting on
the fiber evidence and ballistics report.

199
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,644
- Are you on vacation or something?
- No, I'm so sorry.

200
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,144
I've been distracted by another case,
which is no excuse.

201
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,492
Okay, uh,
just get me the reports when you can.

202
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,535
- There's no rush.
- All right.

203
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,164
Uh, captain, is everything okay?

204
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,795
Ahh. Yeah, since Rob and I have been
planning the, you know, wedding...

205
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,090
between the florists and the hundreds
of kinds of cake filling...

206
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,092
and who could sit next to who...

207
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,306
- Never get married, Allen.
- Right.

208
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,687
- Iris, hey.
- Oh! Barry.

209
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,355
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, yes.

210
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:57,485
That was just really weird.
Captain Singh was nice to me.

211
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,446
Oh, well, he's in a good mood.
He's about to get married.

212
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,658
Lucky him. Yeah, I know, it's...

213
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:08,413
Oh, hey, um, can I talk to you in private?
It's kind of work-related.

214
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,873
Okay, yeah, now's not a great time.
I'm sorry, I...

215
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,126
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hi.

216
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,504
- Barry, can I grab you for a second?
- Absolutely, yeah.

217
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,424
Can you call me when you're done?
It's really important.

218
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,301
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,097
What's up?

220
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,562
Oh. Uh...

221
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,274
Okay, what did she say? Wait, you still
have it, so, duh, you haven't asked her yet.

222
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,359
Or you did ask her and she said...?

223
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,403
- I was gonna propose tonight.
- All right.

224
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,406
But I went to Joe to ask for his blessing.
He said no.

225
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,575
- He did?
- Repeatedly.

226
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,703
- Weird.
- I need you to talk to him, find out why.

227
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,914
- Eddie, I...
- Look, I know me asking you like this...

228
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,833
- it's a little awkward.
- Yeah.

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,546
But you know how heartbroken she's gonna be
if she finds out that Joe's not on board.

230
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,882
Yeah, yeah, all right.
Yeah, I'll talk to him.

231
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,593
- Thanks. I appreciate it so much.
- Yeah.

232
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,220
And so will the future Mrs. Thawne.

233
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,932
Iris Thawne. Sounds pretty good, huh?

234
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,145
I have a feeling
she's gonna want to hyphenate.

235
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,566
Okay, can we go over this one more time?

236
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,152
Yes. You put the glasses on, fall asleep
and start dreaming.

237
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,197
- Not that hard.
- Except I'm pretty sure I die in this dream.

238
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,784
If I go back into it, will I die in real
life? What are we talking about?

239
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,952
- Inception or Dreamscape?
- Here, drink this.

240
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,454
What, am I 57 -Just drink it.

241
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,207
- Okay, I'll drink it.
- You're gonna be fine, Cisco.

242
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,292
Mm. Ah. Wuh.

243
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,002
Okay.

244
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,092
The glasses are emitting a low-level delta
wave, which should help you fall asleep.

245
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:51,307
Okay. I gotta warn you, though,
usually it takes me a long time.

246
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:57,814
I mean, I'm not saying I'm like
an insomniac or anything...

247
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,190
Ah.

248
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,150
So that's how you get him to shut up.

249
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,861
He's entering REM. It's working.

250
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,616
Cisco, can you hear me?

251
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,411
You're dreaming, bud.

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,089
Okay, I will take Dr. Wells to Jitters
so you can do whatever it is you wanna do.

253
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,345
Whoa.

254
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,140
Guys.

255
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,934
This is mad freaky.

256
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,604
Okay, well, um, where are you?

257
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,148
Um...

258
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,984
In the Cortex.

259
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:47,405
I mean, I know I'm just dreaming
that I'm in the Cortex...

260
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,242
but it feels so real.

261
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,162
What is dream-you doing?

262
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,331
Caitlin just left.

263
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,043
I asked her to take Wells to Jitters.

264
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,088
Why do you want Wells out of the lab?

265
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:08,384
I think he might have tampered
with my work.

266
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,760
I need to check.

267
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,680
Okay.

268
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,351
Okay, I'm walking to the bunker.

269
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,650
Oh, man. I love this shirt.

270
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,819
- I thought the dryer ate it.
- Ha, ha.

271
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,613
- Focus, Cisco.
- Okay, okay.

272
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,241
All right.

273
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,913
Now I'm running tests
on the containment system.

274
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,040
This data...

275
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,958
doesn't make any sense.

276
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:47,006
All the super-capacitors,
they were all still fully charged.

277
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,262
There's absolutely no reason
that the man in yellow should have escaped.

278
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,064
Oh, my God.

279
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,108
It was just a hologram.

280
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,196
He tricked us.

281
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,283
Hello, Cisco.

282
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,372
Oh, God. Wells is here.

283
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,083
Cisco, it's just a
dream. He can't hurt you.

284
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,709
You better be right about that.

285
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,922
My name is Eobard Thawne.

286
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,716
Eobard Thawne.

287
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,760
Thawne, like Eddie Thawne?

288
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,887
You killed Nora Allen.

289
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,225
It was never my intention.

290
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,352
Wait, Nora. What about my mom?

291
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,272
- He's confessing.
- Cisco.

292
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,400
He... He didn't wanna kill her.

293
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,737
It was you, Barry. He
was trying to kill you.

294
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,616
His blood pressure's 200,
and his heart rate is 147.

295
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,451
He's losing higher brain function.

296
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,058
You're gonna be okay.
It's just a dream. You're gonna be okay.

297
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,498
I have grown quite fond of you, Cisco.

298
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,960
His hand, it's vibrating.
He's gonna kill me.

299
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,045
- He's gonna have a stroke.
- Get him out.

300
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,631
In many ways...

301
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,425
you've shown me what it's like...

302
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,052
- Help me. Help me, please.
- Cait.

303
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,512
- -To have a son.
- Help me!

304
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,473
No!

305
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,729
You're okay. It was just
a dream. You're okay.

306
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,527
Oh, God.

307
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,322
It felt so real.

308
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,577
- Barry?
- My mom.

309
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,287
This was my fault.

310
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,545
- Hello.
- Where are you?

311
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,971
Barry. Barry, are you there?

312
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:04,143
Dr. Wells. Yeah, sorry, yeah,
it's a bad connection right now.

313
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,022
- Where have you been?
- Why? What's going on?

314
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,983
A fire. A huge fire just erupted.

315
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,778
- A fire, where?
- New Brighton.

316
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,404
Bradford Tower High-Rise.

317
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,908
I know that building.
That's where Captain Singh's fiancé works.

318
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,117
On my way.

319
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:37,093
We need to lock down this entire area.
Now move it, go!

320
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,178
Get those hoses up. Move.

321
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,889
Tell Dispatch we need as many tankers
as this city has.

322
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,599
- What floor?
- Twenty-first.

323
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,434
My God, that's where Rob works.

324
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,191
Please, hurry.

325
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,450
Dr. Wells, the sprinklers,
they're not working.

326
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,453
I see that.
Just get everyone out of there, Barry.

327
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,499
No, I can't. I can't save them all.

328
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,209
Dr. Wells, please, what do I do?

329
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,795
You create a vacuum.

330
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,590
Rotate your arms at super-speed.
That will create a wind funnel...

331
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,719
that will suck the air
right out of the room.

332
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,434
- It's making it worse.
- Barry, listen to me.

333
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,686
You need to move your arms faster.

334
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,814
I believe in you, Barry.

335
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:33,838
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

336
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,681
Rob.

337
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,727
I'm okay. It's okay.

338
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,062
I thought I lost you.

339
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,357
Medic!

340
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,955
Mr. Allen.

341
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,336
Tonight at the fire...

342
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:41,383
I saw hesitation, I saw you
doubting yourself. Why is that?

343
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,720
I don't know. Uh...

344
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,641
I guess I was afraid
I couldn't save everyone.

345
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:53,145
Right, but if there is anything...

346
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,732
that I have learned
in our time together, Barry, it is that...

347
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,318
the only thing standing in the way...

348
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:04,949
of you achieving every goal
that you set for yourself is you.

349
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,328
There is no limit to
how strong you will get...

350
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,165
or how fast you will go.

351
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,210
Everything that you need...

352
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,796
you already have.

353
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,426
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.
- Yeah.

354
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,140
You know...

355
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:35,020
I couldn't have done any of this
without you.

356
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,648
I feel the same way about you.

357
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,452
It's so strange.

358
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,956
I mean, I look at him now
and I know that he killed my mom...

359
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,333
and he sent my dad to jail...

360
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,339
but sometimes he's just so kind
that, in the moment, I actually like him.

361
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,550
But you never did.

362
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,510
- No.
- No.

363
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,179
Well, at least now we know how to trap him.

364
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,725
In Cisco's dream,
he confessed to everything.

365
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,061
If we can just re-create those conditions,
he'll do it again.

366
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,022
Man, Barr.

367
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,359
Taking down bad guys,
pulling confessions...

368
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,570
I'm the cop. I'm supposed to be doing this.

369
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,616
If we're gonna get him to confess, it has
to be with someone that he truly trusts.

370
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,035
Someone he'll genuinely
let his guard down with.

371
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,163
He thinks of Cisco as a son.

372
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,834
Well, then we need to do a better job
protecting him than I did protecting you.

373
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,087
I'm not sure what that means.

374
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,382
- Barry, this is all because of me.
- No...

375
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,887
I never should've let Wells take you from
that hospital. None of this would've happened.

376
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,015
If you hadn't let him take me,
I would be dead for sure.

377
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,476
But even then,
I knew something wasn't right.

378
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:58,896
Everything in my gut was telling me
not to trust him, but I did...

379
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,440
because I was so desperate
to see you okay.

380
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,942
Joe, this isn't your fault.

381
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,735
It's not your fault.

382
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:09,406
Look, every bad thing
that has happened to us, all of it...

383
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,700
it was him.

384
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,161
And now he's gonna pay for it.

385
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:24,630
So Wells set up a fake showdown with
a fake opponent who was never really there?

386
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,968
He figured if we saw both of them together,
it would prove he wasn't the man in yellow.

387
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,720
This all just keeps getting crazier
and crazier.

388
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,684
I just talked to Dr. Wells.

389
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,853
He's attending a lecture downtown,
won't be back until 5.

390
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,983
Cisco, when he gets here, work on the trap
so he sees you set off the hologram.

391
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:48,362
Hold on, isn't that in your dream
when everything went all...?

392
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,949
"Kali Ma," Temple of Doom, yeah.
That definitely happened.

393
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,785
But this time, I'm ready for him.

394
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,998
I originally designed the force field
to keep a speedster from getting out.

395
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:03,919
But I've reversed it.
Now it won't let one in.

396
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,467
Back up.

397
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,065
Barry, are you okay?

398
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,403
It works.

399
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,157
Okay. As long as I'm inside,
Wells won't be able to get near me.

400
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,244
And I will be in the Cortex watching
and recording everything that happens.

401
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:41,290
As soon as we get the confession
we need to free my dad, I'm moving in.

402
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,543
- So, what do I do?
- Wells also threatened Iris.

403
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,505
So if something goes wrong here, keep
an eye on her until Wells is neutralized.

404
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,216
I'll always keep Iris safe, Joe.

405
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,222
- What?
- Come here.

406
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:02,603
So, um, Eddie told me what happened...

407
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,397
that you kiboshed his proposal.

408
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,443
- That was between him and me.
- I1 so agree with that.

409
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,279
And I know that we have a lot
going on right now.

410
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,948
And I should be the last person
pleading Eddie's case.

411
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,618
But I don't get it, Joe.
Why did you say no?

412
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,455
Because if Eddie proposes to Iris,
she's gonna get caught up in the moment...

413
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,083
and the romance,
and she's gonna say yes.

414
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,795
What's wrong with that?
Again, I don't know why I'm saying this.

415
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,839
One day she'll wake up
and realize she married the wrong guy.

416
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,926
But she'll stay anyway
because she made a promise.

417
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,638
I don't want that kind
of life for her. Or him.

418
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,265
She's got feelings for you, Barry.

419
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:45,312
She may not know how to deal with
those feelings right now, but I know her.

420
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,648
They're there. Always have been.

421
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,234
You know that too.

422
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,073
Speaking of, Iris just sent me a 911 text.

423
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,700
I'll be right back.

424
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,246
Like I said.

425
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,669
- Hey, what's going on?
- Look, Barry, I know it's not a good time.

426
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:13,340
Lately it never seems to be a good time,
but I need you to listen to me right now.

427
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,676
Like, really listen to me.

428
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,971
Of course, yeah.

429
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,223
Whatever you need
to tell me, I'm listening.

430
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,269
Okay, I mean, I know this
is gonna sound really crazy at first.

431
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:31,316
But everything strange
that's been going on in Central City...

432
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,028
it all goes back to the night
that the particle accelerator exploded.

433
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:39,366
I've gone through every bit of information
that I've collected since I started my blog...

434
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,952
every tip, every rumor,
every strange sighting.

435
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,079
Nothing predates the explosion.

436
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,583
Whatever was released
into the atmosphere that night...

437
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,086
I think it changed people,
caused them to have powers.

438
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,590
And I think that
S.T.A.R. Labs knew about it.

439
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,758
I think the burning man worked there.

440
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,054
And I think that that's how
the Flash got his powers too.

441
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,893
- Uh...
- So, what do you think?

442
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,939
I don't know. I mean, it's interesting.

443
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:15,360
Yeah, it's interesting.
There's just a big hole in your theory.

444
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:22,451
Um, you know, I was affected by
whatever was released by the explosion...

445
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,871
and I don't have any powers.

446
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,748
- Obviously.
- Right, yeah.

447
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,542
Look, I mean,
I know that it's really mind-blowing.

448
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:35,088
- I haven't even talked to Eddie about it yet...
- Yeah, you and Eddie. How are, um...?

449
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,382
Everything's okay with you and Eddie?

450
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,761
Uh... Sure, yeah, we're great. Why?

451
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,764
Oh...

452
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:48,435
Yeah, okay, look, I'm gonna...
Let me read over all of this stuff...

453
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,563
and we'll definitely talk
about it later, I promise.

454
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,399
Just... I mean, this is crazy.

455
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,445
Yeah, okay, let me just go through it,
and we'll talk later, all right?

456
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,031
Okay.

457
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,629
Hey.

458
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,632
Barry, it's Iris.

459
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:23,637
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I hope you can, because...

460
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,516
I really, really need you to wake up.

461
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,981
Like the other day...

462
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:39,945
Detective Pretty-Boy came into Jitters and
he asked me out, and I actually said yes.

463
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,326
See, I do dumb things like that
when you're not around.

464
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,503
And the house is really quiet
without you there.

465
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:05,178
I know that the reason
that you came to live with us was awful...

466
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,515
but, Barry...

467
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,476
you made it a home again.

468
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:15,355
You made us a family again.

469
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,692
We need you.

470
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,696
I need you.

471
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,502
Hello, Dr. Wells. How was your lecture?

472
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,214
Oh. Boring, tedious.

473
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,133
Platitudinous?

474
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,801
Couldn't have said it better myself.

475
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,638
Um, where...? Where's Cisco?

476
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,516
He is in the bunker.

477
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,312
He thinks he finally figured out
what went wrong at Christmas.

478
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,982
You know, when we were trying
to catch the Reverse-Flash?

479
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:03,779
Yes, I remember that night.
Well, did he say what he's found?

480
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,655
Nope, just that it was important.

481
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,324
Hmm.

482
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,826
Good for Cisco.

483
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,828
Um...

484
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:16,666
Okay. Well, maybe I'll wheel on down there,
see what he's got.

485
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,335
Okay.

486
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,175
Here he comes.

487
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,870
Hello, Cisco.

488
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,425
You've been busy.

489
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,597
You really are incredibly clever, Cisco.

490
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,891
I've always said it.

491
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,563
You're him.

492
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,189
The Reverse-Flash.

493
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,901
Joe was right this whole time, wasn't he?

494
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,820
Good old Joe.

495
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,783
Joe West had his doubts all along.

496
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,828
Even from that first
night in the hospital...

497
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:38,623
Joe knew something wasn't right. Cops.

498
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,668
As inconvenient now
as they will be in a hundred years.

499
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,171
Come on, Cisco, we need a confession.

500
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,507
You killed Barry's mother.

501
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,342
I want to know why.

502
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,595
It was never my intention to kill Nora.

503
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,932
But from my perspective,
she was already dead.

504
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,644
Just happened sooner
than it was supposed to.

505
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,230
No, that's not an admission.

506
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,609
Oops.

507
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,864
You're not gonna get away with this.

508
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,744
I'm not gonna get away with it?

509
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,295
Oh, you're smart.

510
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,465
You're smart, Cisco.

511
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,970
But you're not that smart.

512
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,973
Cisco!

513
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,644
No!

514
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,748
He didn't confess.

515
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,584
Cisco, are you okay?

516
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:09,381
Yeah. I'm never ever gonna sleep
ever again, but, yeah, I'm okay.

517
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,720
- He's dead.
- He didn't confess.

518
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:20,016
Joe, this was it.
My dad's gonna be in prison forever.

519
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,226
Barry, I'm sorry.

520
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,019
Hey. Uh...

521
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,730
Whoa!

522
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,066
What the hell?

523
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,777
I told you this before.

524
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:35,699
I am always one step ahead, Flash.

525
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,120
Allow me to reintroduce to you
Mr. Hannibal Bates...

526
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:46,543
and his incredible ability
to transform into any person he touches.

527
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,753
I knew that ability would come in handy.

528
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:52,340
I did not expect it
to come in handy this soon.

529
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,385
You used him. Like you used all of us!

530
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,137
He served a purpose.

531
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:02,225
Didn't take much convincing,
just the simple promise of his freedom.

532
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,811
You ruined my life. All of our lives.

533
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:08,273
We stood by you
after everything that happened.

534
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,820
I can see how this must be difficult
for you to understand, but trust me...

535
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:19,117
your lives now are so much better
because of what I have done for you.

536
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,661
You don't have to hide.
We know you're not Wells.

537
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:26,166
- Just tell us who you are.
- A confession will get you nowhere.

538
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,085
You've seen who I am.

539
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,337
You know what I can do.

540
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,673
You wanna kill me, go ahead.
I'm not gonna fight you.

541
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:37,802
But just tell the police what you did.
Get my dad out of prison.

542
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,472
I don't want to kill
you, Barry. I need you.

543
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,140
And...

544
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,106
I also did not anticipate, as difficult as
the past 15 years have been for me...

545
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,068
how much I would come to love
working with you.

546
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,236
With all of you.

547
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:59,074
And yet that does not change
what needs to happen.

548
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,076
Then face me now.

549
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:05,038
Oh, we will face each other again.

550
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,666
I promise you. Soon.

551
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,461
Very, very soon.

552
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,674
- He's in the time vault.
- Barry!

553
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,900
It was all a setup.

554
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,488
We thought we set a trap for him,
but he set a trap for us.

555
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,620
Oh, my God.

556
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,414
Iris.

557
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,213
- We have to find Iris.
- Why?

558
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,758
Wells has been watching all of us.
He has surveillance set up everywhere.

559
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,261
Our homes, my lab at the police station...

560
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,929
Central City Picture News.

561
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,349
Cisco, call me when you have a location.

562
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,773
I am very much enjoying this stroll.

563
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,568
- We needed a good stroll.
- Yeah.

564
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,698
Actually, though, would you mind
if we park here for a second?

565
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,743
Um...

566
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,038
- Oh, it's my dad.
- Could you call him back later?

567
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,332
Sure.

568
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,710
What's going on?

569
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:40,341
Iris, this week,
when I was arrested and it looked bad...

570
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,387
you never wavered,
you never lost faith in me.

571
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,805
Impossible.

572
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:50,643
And even though we've been
through some rough times...

573
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,981
I've never lost faith in us.

574
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,611
Iris West...

575
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,323
Eddie?

576
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,745
Eddie!

577
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,292
Bad timing, detective.

578
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,836
Stop. Leave him alone.

579
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,838
Iris, no.

580
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,426
I know who you are.

581
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,803
You killed Barry's mom.

582
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,639
But you don't have to hurt anyone else.

583
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,355
Hey, Iris. It's me, it's me.

584
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,024
He took him. The man in yellow.
He took Eddie.

585
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,027
- I promise I will find him, okay?
- What is happening?

586
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:45,198
Listen to me. You go home,
you don't say anything to anyone.

587
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,826
I swear to you,
I will bring him back, all right?

588
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,202
Wait...

589
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,374
Barry.

590
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,475
You might as well take that mask off.

591
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,729
I know it's you, Wells,
or whoever you really are.

592
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,651
Well, allow me to introduce myself.

593
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,114
My name is Eobard.

594
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,616
Eobard Thawne.

595
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,537
I don't understand.

596
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,873
Why do you have my name?

597
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,041
Why?

598
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,378
Well, because we're family, Eddie.

599
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,633
Funny, I haven't seen you
at any reunions or weddings.

600
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,846
That is funny,
and the reason for that is because...

601
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,099
as far as those guest lists
are concerned...

602
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,518
I haven't been born yet.

603
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,814
So that's why you didn't kill me
that night at S.T.A.R. Labs.

604
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,320
This whole thing...

605
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,240
- it's been about me?
- Not a chance.

606
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,118
You, my friend...

607
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,955
are simply my insurance.

608
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,172
You look so young.

609
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,137
And I could kill you...

610
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,598
right now...

611
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,309
SO easy.

612
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,025
What I wouldn't have given...

613
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,988
all those times before
to have had you like this.

614
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,993
So helpless.

615
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,329
But fate...

616
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,375
Fate's tricky, isn't it?

617
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,586
I come here to destroy you...

618
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,968
and then to get home,
I have to be the one who creates you.

619
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,559
But I will say...

620
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,896
it's been an education...

621
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:29,487
watching you grow up all these years.
Science fairs and soccer games.

622
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,536
No hint, no sign, no trace
of the man you will be one day.

623
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,415
For whom I have nothing but hate.

624
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,126
And to be clear...

625
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,588
nothing is forgiven.

626
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,508
There will be a reckoning.

627
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,886
I promise you, Barry Allen.

628
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,057
And you will die.

629
00:41:58,081 --> 00:42:06,081
