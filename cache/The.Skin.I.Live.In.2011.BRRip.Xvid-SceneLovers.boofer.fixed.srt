1
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:26,786
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:35,705
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,026
Open it.

4
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:43,307
Take this.

5
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:08,906
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,707
Yes.

7
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:16,625
Send up more sackcloth
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:19,785
I can't get it until tomorrow.

9
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:21,906
OK.

10
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:28,106
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

11
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,467
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:32,986
Yeah.

13
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,866
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,225
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough.

15
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:20,586
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:21,904
A face with features...

17
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:24,627
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,186
I have participated in

19
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,666
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:32,146
 carried out in the world...

21
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:35,546
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:38,866
Good...

23
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,426
For a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression...

24
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:44,986
we have to mold the muscles...

25
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:50,946
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,705
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:32,385
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,905
OPERATING THEATER

29
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,026
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,988
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,667
Don't talk rubbish.

32
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,746
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,505
Your skin is softer than I thought.

34
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,905
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:24,185
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:26,346
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

37
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,426
In any case...

38
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:32,666
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,226
Here it is...

40
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:44,946
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,506
Thank you.

42
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:53,505
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:57,545
You said that a year ago.

44
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:00,225
I was hasty.

45
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,986
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:10,745
No.

47
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,786
And now?

48
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,947
No.

49
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,506
Now!

50
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:22,105
I have given the name "Gal"...

51
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,424
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

52
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:25,504
in recent years.

53
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,186
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

54
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,425
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

55
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,786
No.

56
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,906
...which means a natural barrier to

57
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:38,224
...malaria, for example.

58
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:42,226
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control...

59
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:45,066
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

60
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:46,105
specifically, in athymic mice...

61
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,105
and the results...

62
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:52,786
...have been spectacular.

63
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,626
This leads me to suppose

64
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,625
they would be equally positive...

65
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,424
in human mammals.

66
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:03,785
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

67
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:05,426
That was my wife's name.

68
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,666
She was burned to death in a car crash.

69
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:10,465
In you presentation you stated...

70
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:15,344
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

71
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:17,104
What makes you think that?

72
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:20,586
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

73
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,266
and it smells different.

74
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:23,945
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

75
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:26,505
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

76
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:29,065
Gal smells different and repels it.

77
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,065
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

78
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:32,705
That isn't enough.

79
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,745
How did you toughen the skin?

80
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,745
Excuse me.

81
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,865
Let's go somewhere quieter.

82
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:45,305
There's only one way to toughen skin.

83
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,105
By mutating it.

84
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,306
Yes, that's what I did.

85
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:50,986
Transgenesis.

86
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:55,305
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

87
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:58,826
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

88
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,544
A pig's cell?

89
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,345
It's much stronger than ours.

90
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:03,865
You're insane!

91
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:07,185
You know the application
of transgenetic therapy...

92
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:08,785
in humans is completely forbidden!

93
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:09,945
Yes, I do.

94
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:13,585
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

95
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:16,625
We intervene in everything around us...

96
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:19,866
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

97
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:23,584
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

98
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,985
You know how many diseases...

99
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:26,985
we could cure with transgenesis?

100
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:29,345
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

101
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,785
Don't go on!

102
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:32,906
I know the list by heart...

103
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,746
and I think of it every day.

104
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:37,946
But even so...

105
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:41,265
I must forbid you from
investigating further...

106
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:43,305
or I'll be forced to report you...

107
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:44,906
to the scientific community.

108
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,866
Over and above what you or I may think...

109
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:50,786
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

110
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:55,945
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

111
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:58,425
I did it in memory of my wife...

112
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:01,105
and solely to extend my knowledge.

113
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:02,105
I remember...

114
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:04,984
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

115
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:07,266
It seemed like a dream then.

116
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,105
And it still is.

117
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:12,465
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

118
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:14,745
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

119
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:18,545
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

120
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,186
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

121
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:25,944
Your patients will be delighted.

122
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,546
I don't know.

123
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:31,586
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

124
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:34,345
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

125
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:26,306
Do you like what you see?

126
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:29,704
What do you mean?

127
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:34,225
Is there anything you want to improve?

128
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:36,944
No.

129
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:39,784
I don't want to improve anything.

130
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:43,665
Can I take it I'm finished?

131
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,264
Yes...

132
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,825
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

133
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:57,825
And now what?

134
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:00,905
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

135
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:02,785
and smoke it.

136
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,985
I mean us.

137
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,345
Me.

138
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:10,425
What are you going to do with me?

139
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,586
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

140
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:14,746
When?

141
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:17,265
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

142
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,744
Couldn't we just live?

143
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:24,224
Live together.

144
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:26,504
Live together?

145
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:29,745
- How?
- Like everyone.

146
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:33,825
You and I aren't like everyone.

147
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,905
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

148
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:39,306
Living together as equals.

149
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,104
That's it!

150
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,906
Here.

151
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,905
I could set fire
to the house with this.

152
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:01,545
I'm yours.

153
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:04,743
I'm made to measure for you.

154
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:08,025
And you've just told me
that you like me.

155
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,184
Did I say that?

156
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,824
I know you look at me.

157
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,064
Since you brought me here,

158
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:20,745
we practically live in the same room.

159
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:28,264
In this pocket.

160
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:09,945
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.

161
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,784
You shouldn't have used her face.

162
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:22,225
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.

163
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,745
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

164
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,824
The resemblance is too strong.

165
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,584
Have you thought
what to do with her?

166
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,946
No.

167
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:35,065
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

168
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:38,985
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

169
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:42,185
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

170
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:44,584
Stories repeat themselves.

171
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:47,464
No! Not this one!

172
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:51,385
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

173
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:53,626
You're sick.

174
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:55,225
If you don't get rid of her...

175
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:58,345
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

176
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:01,665
When you realize, it'll be too late.

177
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:06,625
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

178
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:10,784
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

179
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:13,545
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

180
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,505
What do you want?

181
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:54,424
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.

182
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,705
If she was a servant...

183
00:22:55,745 --> 00:22:58,024
they've just left and won't be back.

184
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:01,824
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.

185
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,504
<i>My mother is prettier.

186
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:05,465
Go away or I'll call the police.

187
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,225
Zeca!

188
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,504
I'm your son, Zeca.

189
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,304
How dare you come here!

190
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:27,784
Open the door!

191
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:33,384
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

192
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:38,025
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

193
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,705
Little tiger!

194
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:45,105
I just want to see you for a minute.

195
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:47,905
Very well, but then you leave.

196
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:49,826
Whatever you say.

197
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:54,344
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

198
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:19,744
How did you find us?

199
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:23,785
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

200
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:25,624
He was giving a...

201
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:28,906
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

202
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:30,825
I went there
and then followed him here.

203
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:31,905
Can't I come in?

204
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:35,145
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

205
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,224
It smells good.
I'm hungary.

206
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,504
Brute!

207
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:52,385
<i>The main new items today...

208
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:55,105
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...

209
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:58,265
<i>and the daring robbery committed
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...

210
00:24:58,305 --> 00:25:00,225
<i>in the heart of Madrid.

211
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:01,586
<i>It happened last night...

212
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:04,064
<i>and today we have the first images
recorded by one...

213
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:10,065
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.

214
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:13,503
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...

215
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,945
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...

216
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:20,865
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.

217
00:25:21,304 --> 00:25:24,104
As if they were going to find him!

218
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,224
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

219
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:29,545
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

220
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:32,104
He'll be rotting in hell now.

221
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,984
And the police are looking for you.

222
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,825
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

223
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:40,105
You can hide me here for a few days.

224
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:41,585
Hide you here?

225
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,705
Not a chance.

226
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:45,544
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

227
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,545
I know how to hide.

228
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:51,064
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

229
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:52,825
Robert?

230
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:54,864
When he gets you on the table...

231
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,903
he'll give you a lethal injection!

232
00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:00,424
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

233
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:01,825
after what you did?

234
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:03,945
I'll have to blackmail him.

235
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:09,705
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

236
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:12,985
You're raving mad.

237
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:15,705
I'm just a servant.

238
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:18,745
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

239
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:21,544
Even better.

240
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,105
I'll stay here till he comes back.

241
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:29,144
Where are you going?

242
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:31,585
- What do you want
- A drink.

243
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:37,305
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

244
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:03,664
What's this?

245
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:05,264
It's a film!

246
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,064
Go away!

247
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:33,425
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

248
00:27:34,106 --> 00:27:35,624
Get out or I'll shoot.

249
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,224
Mom...

250
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:41,624
you wouldn't do that to your son.

251
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:46,064
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

252
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,105
- It's her.
- It's not her!

253
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:50,664
How could it be her?

254
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:52,664
Get out of here!

255
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:54,145
Keep away!

256
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:02,865
Marilia?

257
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:05,985
I heard a noise, like a shot.

258
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:07,945
Is anything wrong?

259
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:09,904
<i>I heard voices too.

260
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:12,505
<i>Marilia?

261
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,264
Marilia!

262
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,544
There.

263
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,264
Who is it?

264
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,265
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

265
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:07,105
I can't.

266
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:10,024
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

267
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:11,785
Does Marilia have it?

268
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:14,225
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?

269
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:38,464
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

270
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,464
Where's the key to upstairs?

271
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,465
In the drawer at the corner.

272
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:53,704
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

273
00:30:53,744 --> 00:30:55,383
No, where is it?

274
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:59,625
In that drawer, in an envelope.

275
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:08,024
- It's not here!
- At the back!

276
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:15,104
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

277
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:19,024
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

278
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:28,624
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

279
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:31,105
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

280
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,504
Open your mouth!

281
00:31:34,106 --> 00:31:37,904
Open it wider, mom!

282
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,463
It all fit before.

283
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,824
Did Robert send you?

284
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,024
No.

285
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:33,543
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

286
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:40,064
He saved me.

287
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,544
Get me out of here!

288
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:45,584
I'll go anywhere with you!

289
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:48,744
You're saying that...

290
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:50,504
because I'm on top of you.

291
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,624
No!

292
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:56,704
Ask me for anything!

293
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:59,623
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

294
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:02,225
I don't know. Lots of things!

295
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:04,183
I'll do whatever you want.

296
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,343
You could help me with Robert.

297
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:10,184
How do you get on with him now?

298
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:12,544
Great.

299
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:15,625
- Great?
- Yes.

300
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:19,304
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

301
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:20,784
Yes.

302
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:24,703
I'll take you with me.

303
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:26,704
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

304
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:31,945
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

305
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:36,025
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

306
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,064
Listen...

307
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:43,704
What?

308
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:45,986
Lets fuck in the garden, please!

309
00:33:46,064 --> 00:33:49,825
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

310
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,905
This tiger wants a bed.

311
00:33:58,345 --> 00:33:59,984
Don't you like it?

312
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:01,703
You're hurting me.

313
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:03,864
It's very big.

314
00:34:03,986 --> 00:34:06,625
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

315
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:08,065
Yes...

316
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:10,623
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

317
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:15,265
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

318
00:35:25,944 --> 00:35:27,544
Kill her!

319
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:30,104
Kill them both!

320
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:01,624
As children,
they played at killing each other.

321
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:06,025
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

322
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:10,064
The tiger and Robert?

323
00:36:10,664 --> 00:36:12,025
Yes.

324
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,223
They're brothers...

325
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:17,223
but they don't know it.

326
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,184
At least I've never told them.

327
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,663
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

328
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:31,304
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

329
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:36,544
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

330
00:36:38,744 --> 00:36:40,864
It's my fault.

331
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:50,224
I've got insanity in my entrails.

332
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:53,304
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

333
00:36:53,425 --> 00:36:55,624
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

334
00:36:56,184 --> 00:37:00,585
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

335
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:05,024
and said she'd given birth to him.

336
00:37:06,984 --> 00:37:10,504
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

337
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:15,304
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

338
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:19,464
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

339
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:25,024
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

340
00:37:27,224 --> 00:37:30,745
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

341
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:34,743
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

342
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:43,984
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

343
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:47,823
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

344
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:51,424
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

345
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:55,225
she took a fancy to him...

346
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:57,745
and they ended up
running away together.

347
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,304
Their car crashed,

348
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:05,023
Zeca survived and ran away.

349
00:38:06,704 --> 00:38:08,544
But she...

350
00:38:11,384 --> 00:38:17,464
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

351
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:24,625
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

352
00:38:26,824 --> 00:38:32,223
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

353
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:34,143
He didn't sleep.

354
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:40,584
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

355
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:43,023
covered with gauzes.

356
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:47,623
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

357
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:51,824
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

358
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,664
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

359
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,303
To everyone's surprise...

360
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:04,305
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

361
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:09,343
The things that a madman's love can do!

362
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:16,022
One day...

363
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:20,703
when she could finally stand unaided...

364
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:25,744
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

365
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:29,984
singing a song that she had taught her.

366
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:34,784
And she got emotional.

367
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:41,464
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

368
00:39:42,664 --> 00:39:44,104
And it was...

369
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:48,065
like feeling she was alive again.

370
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:26,023
When she opened the window...

371
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:31,384
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

372
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:41,784
She didn't look human.

373
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:44,665
She was a cinder.

374
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:50,783
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

375
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:53,023
and threw herself out the window.

376
00:41:05,104 --> 00:41:07,984
Years later, little Norma...

377
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:11,904
went in search of her mother...

378
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,863
along the same road
her mother had taken.

379
00:41:19,664 --> 00:41:21,744
Through the window.

380
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,864
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

381
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:04,423
Did you pray?

382
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:07,622
Yes.
Everything you told me.

383
00:42:12,623 --> 00:42:14,424
Shall we go inside?

384
00:42:51,464 --> 00:42:54,144
Do you mind if we
leave it

385
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:55,784
for tomorrow?

386
00:42:57,183 --> 00:43:00,062
The tiger really messed me up.

387
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:02,623
As you wish.

388
00:43:06,343 --> 00:43:07,903
But hold me!

389
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:17,024
Don't worry, I'll wait.

390
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:20,624
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

391
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:22,544
Thank you!

392
00:43:37,424 --> 00:43:39,704
I'm falling asleep.

393
00:43:46,903 --> 00:43:48,863
Sleep, my love.

394
00:44:08,504 --> 00:44:10,183
SIX YEARS EARLIER

395
00:44:41,103 --> 00:44:43,384
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

396
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:45,984
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

397
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:50,824
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

398
00:44:50,942 --> 00:44:53,263
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

399
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:02,503
Your daughter is getting on well
with my nieces.

400
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:04,864
She seems much better...

401
00:45:05,024 --> 00:45:07,624
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

402
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:11,184
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

403
00:45:11,263 --> 00:45:14,463
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

404
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:29,263
To you!

405
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,063
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

406
00:46:21,103 --> 00:46:22,663
Enjoy him, darling.

407
00:46:34,703 --> 00:46:36,063
Excuse me.

408
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:41,823
Norma!

409
00:48:41,943 --> 00:48:43,424
Norma!

410
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:45,504
Norma!

411
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:47,263
Norma!

412
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,943
Norma!

413
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:52,463
Sweetheart, it's me!

414
00:48:57,183 --> 00:48:59,583
There, there!

415
00:50:04,944 --> 00:50:06,104
What about this one?

416
00:50:06,182 --> 00:50:07,344
Yes, but...

417
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:08,545
no.

418
00:50:08,663 --> 00:50:09,744
And it looks a bit old.

419
00:50:09,822 --> 00:50:11,943
It's not old, it's vintage.

420
00:50:12,024 --> 00:50:14,383
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

421
00:50:14,462 --> 00:50:16,863
No flowers.
Something like this?

422
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:18,424
Not stripes either.

423
00:50:18,543 --> 00:50:19,864
No stripes.

424
00:50:30,624 --> 00:50:32,103
Something graphic?

425
00:50:32,223 --> 00:50:34,744
Graphic?
Like this?

426
00:50:34,784 --> 00:50:36,664
I'll come back another day.

427
00:50:36,744 --> 00:50:39,744
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

428
00:50:43,463 --> 00:50:44,583
Cristina...

429
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,463
Here. On the house.

430
00:50:47,542 --> 00:50:49,383
Put it on and we'll go partying.

431
00:50:49,503 --> 00:50:50,984
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

432
00:50:51,144 --> 00:50:53,623
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

433
00:50:55,183 --> 00:50:57,182
It'll look great on you.

434
00:50:57,302 --> 00:50:59,223
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

435
00:51:00,303 --> 00:51:01,943
You're so mistaken!

436
00:51:02,022 --> 00:51:03,863
Because I don't like men?

437
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:06,143
Because you don't like me.

438
00:51:06,783 --> 00:51:08,303
In any case...

439
00:51:08,742 --> 00:51:11,982
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

440
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:14,063
You shouldn't take that shit.

441
00:51:17,104 --> 00:51:19,103
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

442
00:51:19,863 --> 00:51:21,342
I'm off.

443
00:51:21,782 --> 00:51:23,103
Where to?

444
00:51:23,222 --> 00:51:24,543
Home, to get changed.

445
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,823
How come?

446
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,383
I'm meeting my pals.

447
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:29,903
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

448
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:31,103
Were you invited?

449
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:33,183
Jorge knows one of the nieces.

450
00:51:33,263 --> 00:51:34,943
We're just going to the dance.

451
00:51:35,783 --> 00:51:38,102
Well? Are you coming?

452
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:40,423
Leave her alone, you pain.

453
00:51:42,263 --> 00:51:43,544
Good afternoon.

454
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:45,103
Hello.

455
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:48,423
My wife has left us...

456
00:51:48,504 --> 00:51:50,943
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

457
00:51:51,743 --> 00:51:53,862
- Josefina?
- Yes.

458
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:56,664
Well...

459
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,983
we don't have anything for fat women...

460
00:52:00,463 --> 00:52:04,944
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

461
00:52:05,023 --> 00:52:06,625
They're very nice.

462
00:52:06,943 --> 00:52:08,864
We'll look at them and let you know.

463
00:52:08,983 --> 00:52:12,423
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

464
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,383
Yes.
It's heavy.

465
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,823
It certainly is.

466
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:16,224
But...

467
00:52:16,622 --> 00:52:18,822
did she leave or has she disappeared?

468
00:52:19,023 --> 00:52:20,904
Both things.
To be honest...

469
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:23,863
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

470
00:52:23,942 --> 00:52:25,582
So the next time she does it...

471
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:28,622
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

472
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,384
I'll show you the garden.

473
00:53:15,464 --> 00:53:18,104
What a party!

474
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:19,623
Fresh air!

475
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:24,222
You're all stoners!

476
00:53:27,263 --> 00:53:28,902
I'm Vicente.

477
00:53:29,743 --> 00:53:31,263
I'm Norma.

478
00:53:35,223 --> 00:53:36,943
Your friends have gone.

479
00:53:38,103 --> 00:53:40,303
All the better, right?

480
00:53:52,943 --> 00:53:54,383
Are you stoned?

481
00:53:55,063 --> 00:53:56,423
Stoned?

482
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:58,782
Have you taken any pills?

483
00:53:59,462 --> 00:54:01,183
Yes.

484
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:03,702
Cipralex 20...

485
00:54:04,623 --> 00:54:07,344
100 mg of Deprax...

486
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:10,585
2 g of Trankimazin.

487
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,264
I don't take Rohipnol now.

488
00:54:12,622 --> 00:54:14,982
And Lyrica, of course.

489
00:54:15,102 --> 00:54:16,344
Shit!

490
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:18,342
I'm high as hell too.

491
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,743
High?

492
00:54:20,184 --> 00:54:21,542
Yes.

493
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:28,182
You're not from here, are you?

494
00:54:28,303 --> 00:54:30,303
No. Are you?

495
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,103
Yes, but I want to get away...

496
00:54:51,384 --> 00:54:54,062
I'm sick of these high heels!

497
00:54:59,743 --> 00:55:01,262
And this jacket!

498
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:06,464
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

499
00:55:06,862 --> 00:55:10,503
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

500
00:55:12,663 --> 00:55:13,903
Wait.

501
00:55:14,864 --> 00:55:16,503
I'll leave you naked.

502
00:55:55,182 --> 00:55:56,864
You're so pretty...

503
00:55:58,663 --> 00:56:00,144
and different.

504
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:03,863
I'm different too.

505
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:06,222
Are you in treatment too?

506
00:56:07,943 --> 00:56:08,983
No.

507
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:11,022
Do you think I should be?

508
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,462
I don't know.

509
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,503
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

510
00:56:16,663 --> 00:56:17,942
"I Need To Love".

511
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:19,903
This is also for the bride...

512
00:56:20,022 --> 00:56:21,703
with all my affection.

513
00:57:18,823 --> 00:57:23,903
No!

514
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,543
Shut up!

515
00:57:32,902 --> 00:57:34,983
Stop!

516
00:59:05,502 --> 00:59:06,982
Cristina...

517
00:59:07,103 --> 00:59:10,223
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

518
00:59:10,503 --> 00:59:11,822
Yes...

519
00:59:11,903 --> 00:59:13,622
but where are you going?

520
00:59:13,702 --> 00:59:16,542
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

521
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:18,223
That's because of all the stuff you take.

522
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,703
I haven't taken anything in a week.

523
00:59:19,783 --> 00:59:21,342
Then it's because of that.

524
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,102
So should I take it or not?

525
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:25,622
It's best not to.

526
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,943
I'm going out.

527
00:59:29,382 --> 00:59:31,223
Now? Without finishing it?

528
00:59:31,262 --> 00:59:32,182
Yes.

529
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:37,263
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

530
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,942
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

531
00:59:39,982 --> 00:59:42,902
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

532
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:46,063
Are you leaving that mess?

533
00:59:46,103 --> 00:59:48,462
I'll finish it tomorrow.

534
01:00:40,662 --> 01:00:43,742
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

535
01:01:23,022 --> 01:01:24,582
Son of a bitch!

536
01:01:25,463 --> 01:01:27,782
Bastard!

537
01:01:35,622 --> 01:01:37,103
Are you crazy?

538
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:40,382
Don't shoot!

539
01:03:31,783 --> 01:03:33,822
Help!

540
01:03:37,824 --> 01:03:39,263
<i>Help!

541
01:03:51,102 --> 01:03:52,464
Come in.

542
01:03:54,342 --> 01:03:55,623
Sit down, please.

543
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:58,863
Thank you.

544
01:04:00,822 --> 01:04:02,742
I was told there's news.

545
01:04:03,863 --> 01:04:08,102
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

546
01:04:09,702 --> 01:04:11,222
And the body?

547
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:12,903
Nothing.

548
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,463
It must have been washed out to sea.

549
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:21,582
We're very sorry, ma'am.

550
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:24,382
My son is alive.

551
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:29,022
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

552
01:04:29,063 --> 01:04:30,623
but my son?

553
01:04:32,063 --> 01:04:34,462
He could have been kidnapped.

554
01:04:37,022 --> 01:04:40,262
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

555
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,222
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

556
01:04:42,302 --> 01:04:46,183
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

557
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:48,741
If he is, he's far away.

558
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:53,903
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

559
01:04:53,982 --> 01:04:57,062
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

560
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:58,782
But he said he'd be home for supper.

561
01:04:58,821 --> 01:05:00,103
Cristina heard him.

562
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:03,583
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

563
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,062
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

564
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:39,662
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

565
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:44,581
Norma...

566
01:05:46,382 --> 01:05:47,381
Sweetheart...

567
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:48,623
Sweetheart...

568
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:51,541
I won't touch you.

569
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:55,262
Where are you going?

570
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:03,543
Where are you going?

571
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:13,181
Norma, love.

572
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:18,543
Everything OK?

573
01:06:18,582 --> 01:06:20,902
Yes.

574
01:06:25,342 --> 01:06:27,023
It's me, Norma.

575
01:06:27,102 --> 01:06:29,342
You can come out,
the men have gone.

576
01:06:29,462 --> 01:06:33,342
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

577
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:34,862
We tried...

578
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:38,382
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

579
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,062
She rips it off.

580
01:06:41,783 --> 01:06:45,702
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

581
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:49,942
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

582
01:06:50,102 --> 01:06:52,104
And she gets worse when she sees you.

583
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:55,104
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

584
01:06:55,222 --> 01:06:56,542
I just found her lying there!

585
01:06:56,622 --> 01:06:58,902
Why can't you get that into her head?

586
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:01,622
She identifies you with the rapist.

587
01:07:02,662 --> 01:07:03,902
Maybe...

588
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:06,743
we let her out too soon.

589
01:07:06,903 --> 01:07:09,422
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

590
01:07:09,462 --> 01:07:11,983
She was getting over her social phobia.

591
01:07:12,102 --> 01:07:13,102
How could I know...

592
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:15,982
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

593
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:43,223
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

594
01:08:43,302 --> 01:08:46,102
Help!
Get me out of here!

595
01:08:47,221 --> 01:08:50,663
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

596
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:52,782
You'll eat and drink now.

597
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:55,861
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

598
01:08:55,982 --> 01:08:58,942
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

599
01:08:59,862 --> 01:09:02,543
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

600
01:09:13,502 --> 01:09:14,821
Turn around!

601
01:09:44,543 --> 01:09:46,983
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

602
01:09:47,102 --> 01:09:50,262
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

603
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:53,262
You'll be more comfortable there.

604
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:30,462
Eat.

605
01:10:31,823 --> 01:10:33,182
Thank you!

606
01:10:38,942 --> 01:10:41,103
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

607
01:10:41,902 --> 01:10:44,263
I've been alone for so long.

608
01:10:47,022 --> 01:10:50,102
Wait, please! Don't go!

609
01:10:53,982 --> 01:10:56,063
Please, don't go!

610
01:10:56,221 --> 01:10:58,182
We have to talk.

611
01:11:25,022 --> 01:11:26,422
My condolences.

612
01:11:29,781 --> 01:11:31,703
We did what we could.

613
01:11:31,982 --> 01:11:34,382
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

614
01:11:34,501 --> 01:11:36,301
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

615
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:37,942
for homicidal negligence.

616
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:40,622
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

617
01:11:44,182 --> 01:11:45,941
You really want to work today?

618
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:47,142
Yes.

619
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:50,262
You should rest and try to forget.

620
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:53,303
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

621
01:11:53,382 --> 01:11:55,782
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

622
01:12:13,182 --> 01:12:15,101
My mother will be very worried.

623
01:12:15,823 --> 01:12:18,222
I never stay away without calling her.

624
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,741
You have a daughter, haven't you?

625
01:12:35,582 --> 01:12:37,262
Why do you say that?

626
01:12:38,782 --> 01:12:40,621
The toys...

627
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,383
My daughter is dead.

628
01:12:44,102 --> 01:12:46,581
We buried her today.

629
01:12:49,061 --> 01:12:50,902
I'm sorry.

630
01:12:59,621 --> 01:13:02,182
And now, some aftershave.

631
01:13:04,782 --> 01:13:06,743
Why did you shave me?

632
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:09,102
That's a good question.

633
01:14:00,383 --> 01:14:01,343
Yes?

634
01:14:01,381 --> 01:14:02,701
<i>It's us.

635
01:14:02,822 --> 01:14:04,183
I'll let you in.

636
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,062
If he says we're late,

637
01:14:24,102 --> 01:14:26,262
say there were two
accidents on the road

638
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,302
You know how he is about punctuality.

639
01:14:31,622 --> 01:14:33,182
Good evening.

640
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:34,542
You're late.

641
01:14:34,702 --> 01:14:36,463
There were two accidents on the road.

642
01:14:36,862 --> 01:14:39,421
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

643
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:41,742
When you're ready, we'll start.

644
01:14:42,222 --> 01:14:45,941
Two accidents, one near that town...

645
01:15:25,102 --> 01:15:28,462
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

646
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:30,862
He isn't.

647
01:15:31,582 --> 01:15:34,621
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

648
01:15:34,741 --> 01:15:37,622
It's a particularly confidential case.

649
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:13,582
What's happened?

650
01:16:18,023 --> 01:16:19,900
What did you do to me?

651
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:22,703
A vaginoplasty

652
01:16:31,621 --> 01:16:33,421
No...

653
01:17:18,422 --> 01:17:20,942
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

654
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:22,582
It's very important.

655
01:17:24,822 --> 01:17:28,023
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

656
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:32,781
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together.

657
01:17:32,863 --> 01:17:35,902
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

658
01:17:36,142 --> 01:17:37,380
You...

659
01:17:38,622 --> 01:17:41,342
You have to keep the new orifice open...

660
01:17:41,422 --> 01:17:44,663
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

661
01:17:45,742 --> 01:17:50,182
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

662
01:17:50,262 --> 01:17:52,542
that you breathe through it.

663
01:17:54,181 --> 01:17:55,501
In this case...

664
01:17:57,022 --> 01:18:00,101
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

665
01:18:02,501 --> 01:18:06,701
Start by inserting the smallest one.

666
01:18:08,941 --> 01:18:11,102
It will hurt at first...

667
01:18:11,902 --> 01:18:14,341
but in a few months...

668
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:17,422
the largest one will fit without any effort...

669
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:19,181
and the skin...

670
01:18:19,342 --> 01:18:23,262
will be perfectly healed.

671
01:18:31,381 --> 01:18:34,860
This is very good.

672
01:18:36,582 --> 01:18:38,941
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

673
01:18:39,022 --> 01:18:40,621
Four weeks.

674
01:18:40,942 --> 01:18:42,422
Can I go now?

675
01:18:42,821 --> 01:18:45,301
- Go where?
- Home.

676
01:18:45,782 --> 01:18:47,661
But we've just started.

677
01:19:01,981 --> 01:19:03,862
What else are you going to do?

678
01:19:05,822 --> 01:19:08,341
You'll see, when the time comes.

679
01:19:10,422 --> 01:19:12,622
Why are you doing this?

680
01:19:20,182 --> 01:19:22,622
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

681
01:19:23,741 --> 01:19:26,183
In that spectacular house?

682
01:19:27,502 --> 01:19:31,582
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

683
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,061
I don't think I actually raped her.

684
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:39,262
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

685
01:19:40,181 --> 01:19:44,860
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

686
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:49,260
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

687
01:19:49,342 --> 01:19:51,061
What are you going to do now?

688
01:20:11,261 --> 01:20:14,902
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

689
01:20:18,581 --> 01:20:21,901
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

690
01:20:21,982 --> 01:20:26,021
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

691
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:37,261
The marks on your skin will disappear.

692
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:40,221
There's still work to do.

693
01:20:41,261 --> 01:20:45,540
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

694
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:52,740
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

695
01:20:52,822 --> 01:20:56,022
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

696
01:20:56,662 --> 01:21:00,782
Get used to wearing it all the time...

697
01:21:02,022 --> 01:21:03,461
like a second skin.

698
01:21:04,821 --> 01:21:06,301
Put it on.

699
01:21:49,981 --> 01:21:52,181
Will you zip me up, please?

700
01:22:11,821 --> 01:22:13,102
Bitch!

701
01:22:59,782 --> 01:23:01,101
Stop!

702
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:04,741
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

703
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,422
Stay where you are!

704
01:23:23,661 --> 01:23:25,422
I'll slit my throat...

705
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:27,461
and then you'll have no toy!

706
01:23:28,582 --> 01:23:30,262
You wouldn't dare.

707
01:24:03,861 --> 01:24:05,582
We were lucky.

708
01:24:07,262 --> 01:24:08,981
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

709
01:24:51,143 --> 01:24:53,820
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

710
01:24:56,701 --> 01:25:00,861
From today, your name is Vera.

711
01:26:43,703 --> 01:26:46,021
I don't know if you're there.

712
01:26:46,102 --> 01:26:48,420
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

713
01:26:48,502 --> 01:26:50,100
Do what you want with them.

714
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:14,461
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...

715
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:17,261
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.

716
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:40,102
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...

717
01:27:40,541 --> 01:27:43,222
<i>a place inside you...

718
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,021
<i>a place to which...

719
01:27:45,101 --> 01:27:47,340
<i>no one else has access...

720
01:27:47,381 --> 01:27:49,941
<i>a place that no one can destroy.

721
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,662
<i>To access that place there is yoga...

722
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:55,702
<i>an ancient technique.

723
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:59,901
<i>It's a place where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...

724
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,501
<i>freedom.

725
01:28:01,621 --> 01:28:03,261
<i>But you must practice it...

726
01:28:03,341 --> 01:28:05,861
<i>continuously, intensely...

727
01:28:05,941 --> 01:28:10,101
<i>and then you'll achieve it.

728
01:28:10,541 --> 01:28:12,461
YOGA BOOKS

729
01:29:11,342 --> 01:29:13,181
My Cigarral!

730
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,822
I missed it so much!

731
01:29:17,301 --> 01:29:19,901
These four years seemed eternal!

732
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:23,580
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

733
01:29:24,101 --> 01:29:26,661
I thought you'd forgotten me.

734
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:29,101
I thought that...

735
01:29:29,261 --> 01:29:32,381
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

736
01:29:32,902 --> 01:29:34,980
My poor child.

737
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:37,222
To throw herself out the window!

738
01:29:37,342 --> 01:29:39,661
I'd rather not talk about it.

739
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,101
As you wish.

740
01:29:43,061 --> 01:29:45,382
But I'm going to miss her so much!

741
01:29:47,141 --> 01:29:49,021
Let's go to the kitchen.

742
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,782
I'm parched.

743
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,541
Don't look at the surfaces.

744
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,501
Everything has to be cleaned.

745
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:04,101
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

746
01:30:04,421 --> 01:30:06,701
You've installed more televisions.

747
01:30:06,822 --> 01:30:10,941
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

748
01:30:11,061 --> 01:30:12,780
I'll explain.

749
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:16,021
From now on, you'll look after her.

750
01:30:16,101 --> 01:30:19,860
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

751
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:25,620
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

752
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,181
You've put on your uniform.

753
01:30:47,861 --> 01:30:50,220
You don't have to wear it.

754
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:51,741
I like the uniform...

755
01:30:51,861 --> 01:30:54,381
because it means we're together again.

756
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:03,421
Who is she?

757
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:06,660
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

758
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,100
What's she doing?

759
01:31:09,941 --> 01:31:11,580
She's writing on the wall.

760
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,900
I can see that.

761
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:17,340
It smells of croquettes.

762
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:21,781
She called me on the intercom...

763
01:31:21,901 --> 01:31:24,581
and asked who I was and what day it was.

764
01:31:24,941 --> 01:31:27,781
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

765
01:31:29,381 --> 01:31:32,221
I don't want her
to take liberties with you.

766
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:36,982
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

767
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,982
She reminds me of someone.

768
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:43,621
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

769
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:47,781
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

770
01:31:58,541 --> 01:32:01,861
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

771
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,301
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

772
01:32:28,741 --> 01:32:30,901
BACK TO THE PRESENT

773
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:38,021
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

774
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,741
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

775
01:32:42,861 --> 01:32:44,580
I don't trust you.

776
01:32:44,901 --> 01:32:47,980
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

777
01:32:49,222 --> 01:32:50,701
Pass me the tray.

778
01:32:50,781 --> 01:32:53,701
No. I'll take it up.

779
01:32:58,021 --> 01:33:00,420
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

780
01:33:01,741 --> 01:33:03,181
Thank you.

781
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,900
Good morning.

782
01:34:10,462 --> 01:34:12,101
Breakfast.

783
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,181
Thank you.

784
01:34:26,701 --> 01:34:28,501
Where's Marilia?

785
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:30,621
In the kitchen, grumbling.

786
01:34:31,621 --> 01:34:34,821
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

787
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,500
Last night...

788
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,101
before we went to bed...

789
01:34:49,221 --> 01:34:52,020
we talked a lot and we made a promise.

790
01:34:53,501 --> 01:34:56,661
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

791
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:01,540
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

792
01:35:02,302 --> 01:35:04,821
that I could see all the TV channels...

793
01:35:05,941 --> 01:35:07,981
that I was free.

794
01:35:10,021 --> 01:35:12,940
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

795
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:16,021
Don't let me down.

796
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,941
It's all I have, Robert.

797
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:21,700
Your promise and mine.

798
01:35:30,701 --> 01:35:33,340
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

799
01:35:34,421 --> 01:35:37,740
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

800
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,501
She promised not to.

801
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:42,701
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

802
01:35:43,222 --> 01:35:46,901
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

803
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:48,461
That's enough!

804
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:53,541
I'm sorry I took so long.

805
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:57,300
I've put on high heels to practice.

806
01:35:57,741 --> 01:36:01,060
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

807
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:02,741
Thank you.

808
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,700
Come along, child!

809
01:36:25,901 --> 01:36:27,861
Have you a problem with me?

810
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:31,540
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

811
01:36:33,219 --> 01:36:36,460
I want to talk about the clinic.

812
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,580
I told you on the phone.

813
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:40,981
After talking to the president...

814
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:44,421
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

815
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:48,899
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

816
01:36:48,981 --> 01:36:50,541
It's not just that.

817
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:54,460
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

818
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:59,542
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

819
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:02,340
I'm speaking for all the team.

820
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:05,181
Our main patients love the isolation here.

821
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:08,580
I said no, Fulgencio.

822
01:37:12,261 --> 01:37:14,700
And now I'd like to be alone.

823
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:18,820
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

824
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,660
Are you still here?

825
01:37:53,981 --> 01:37:55,180
I'm leaving now...

826
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:58,821
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

827
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,580
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

828
01:38:04,701 --> 01:38:06,779
We gave him a sex change.

829
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,980
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

830
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,261
as you can see.

831
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:13,862
And?

832
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:16,861
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

833
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:18,820
without hormones.

834
01:38:18,941 --> 01:38:20,861
He only wanted a cunt.

835
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:24,620
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

836
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:28,100
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

837
01:38:32,301 --> 01:38:35,781
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

838
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:37,940
Don't go there.

839
01:38:38,061 --> 01:38:40,380
Those documents you
gave us were all false.

840
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:41,700
It wouldn't be the first time...

841
01:38:41,781 --> 01:38:44,421
we accepted false documents.

842
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:47,060
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

843
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,900
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

844
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:54,421
I think you kidnapped him...

845
01:38:54,501 --> 01:38:56,661
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

846
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:58,021
You told us...

847
01:38:58,101 --> 01:39:00,621
you'd tested your new skin
on athymic mice.

848
01:39:00,699 --> 01:39:02,421
Knowing you as I do...

849
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:05,700
I think you'd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being.

850
01:39:05,781 --> 01:39:07,581
On Vicente, for example.

851
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:11,661
Do you know what would happen to you...

852
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:13,620
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

853
01:39:13,701 --> 01:39:15,659
on someone you'd kidnapped?

854
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,220
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

855
01:39:20,459 --> 01:39:22,900
You don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:39:26,061 --> 01:39:28,821
Get the hell out of here!

857
01:39:30,219 --> 01:39:33,861
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

858
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,019
And...

859
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,980
what's that transgenesis?

860
01:39:41,301 --> 01:39:42,981
A cream?

861
01:39:45,141 --> 01:39:47,699
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

862
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:52,620
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

863
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:54,501
Vera Cruz!

864
01:39:55,859 --> 01:39:58,301
And I was always a woman!

865
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:21,020
Give me a cigarette.

866
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,979
Thank you.

867
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,941
No, I thank you.

868
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:02,459
Does it still hurt?

869
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:04,102
Yes.

870
01:41:06,099 --> 01:41:08,020
Shall we do it from behind?

871
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:11,379
Wouldn't that hurt more?

872
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:13,820
- Wait...
- What?

873
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,980
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

874
01:41:16,019 --> 01:41:18,461
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

875
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,941
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

876
01:41:35,061 --> 01:41:36,180
but I can't find it.

877
01:41:36,261 --> 01:41:38,740
You must have left it downstairs.

878
01:41:38,902 --> 01:41:41,901
I'll go and get it.

879
01:42:14,181 --> 01:42:17,302
Vera!
Hurry up!

880
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,941
At last!
I thought you'd gone.

881
01:42:34,341 --> 01:42:35,781
Not yet.

882
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:42,779
Come on...

883
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:46,100
What are you doing?

884
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:50,380
I'm going to kill you.

885
01:42:50,819 --> 01:42:52,420
This is a joke, right?

886
01:42:53,261 --> 01:42:54,941
Call it what you want.

887
01:42:56,381 --> 01:42:58,260
But you promised!

888
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,180
I lied.

889
01:43:37,979 --> 01:43:39,380
Robert?

890
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:42,660
Robert?

891
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:44,260
He's asleep.

892
01:43:45,501 --> 01:43:47,181
I heard a noise.

893
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:48,901
Yes, so did I.

894
01:43:49,259 --> 01:43:51,940
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

895
01:43:58,340 --> 01:43:59,859
Robert!

896
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:02,340
My son!

897
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:16,100
Come out of there! Bitch!

898
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:19,701
Where are you?

899
01:44:34,259 --> 01:44:36,221
I knew it.

900
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:32,181
Hello.

901
01:46:41,579 --> 01:46:43,500
You see to her.

902
01:46:45,621 --> 01:46:47,140
Good morning.

903
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,220
What did you want?

904
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:04,981
Is anything wrong?

905
01:47:06,021 --> 01:47:08,020
Are you all right?

906
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:14,339
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

907
01:47:16,341 --> 01:47:18,221
Do you know me?

908
01:47:19,019 --> 01:47:22,699
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

909
01:47:23,698 --> 01:47:27,059
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

910
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:32,339
I had to kill two people to get away.

911
01:47:34,301 --> 01:47:36,381
You have to help me.

912
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,740
Look.

913
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:45,380
Do you remember this dress?

914
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:51,500
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

915
01:47:51,819 --> 01:47:53,861
I said I'd give it to you...

916
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:56,699
just to see how it looked.

917
01:47:56,780 --> 01:48:00,979
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

918
01:48:02,939 --> 01:48:07,580
At that moment we were alone, remember?

919
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:16,539
Is anything wrong?

920
01:48:18,621 --> 01:48:20,979
Come here a moment, ma'am.

921
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:36,300
Why are you crying?

922
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:49,300
I'm Vicente.
