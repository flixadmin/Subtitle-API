1
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:47,306
Help me! Help me. Help me.

2
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,781
My cake is ready.

3
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:37,113
Time for the show. Everybody on stage.

4
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:39,601
Ruby?

5
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:42,520
Is that you?

6
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,643
Goddamn it.

7
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:00,192
Ruby?

8
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,091
Ruby?

9
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:18,694
Ruby?

10
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,158
Ruby?

11
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:57,131
If that's you,Jupiter,
I got some buckshot for you.

12
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:59,091
Ya hear me?

13
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:15,255
I told you, it's over!

14
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,742
I'm out! Ya hear me?

15
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,203
You're on your own now!

16
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,984
I-

17
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:28,020
I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.

18
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,771
Oh.

19
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:32,209
Huh?

20
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:36,208
Hello.!

21
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,173
Hey!

22
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:49,101
- Ah! It's hot out here.
- Honey,you ought to stay
in the car out of the wind.

23
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:53,684
- Well, honey, I have to stretch my legs.
- Where the hell is everybody?

24
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:56,787
- Hello?
- Hey.

25
00:08:56,891 --> 00:09:00,208
- Get up,jackass.
- Bobby!

26
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,701
Oh. Hey.

27
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:09,108
- Fill her up and check the fluids, my friend.
- Oh, yeah. Right away, sir.

28
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,933
Hey!

29
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:16,157
- Beauty, Beast, stop it!
- Ah! Ah! Damn it!

30
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:19,617
You okay?

31
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:23,677
Tell me again why we couldn't fly
like normal people? Oh, that's right.

32
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,973
- They wouldn't let your dad drive the plane.
- Doug, relax, please.

33
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,786
It's their silver anniversary,
and they're so happy you came.

34
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:34,631
- Your parents can't stand me.
- Nope, you're wrong. They love you.

35
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:36,584
I could have taken them
on a cruise.

36
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,293
Hey, you know what?
Stop. I never ask you for anything, okay?

37
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:45,701
Just think how happy you'll be when
Catherine comes along on our 25th, huh?

38
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:48,139
Huh?

39
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:56,013
Aw, it's okay.

40
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,698
It's not gonna be
in a fucking trailer home.

41
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:02,413
Don't see too many travelers around here.
Where y'all headed?

42
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:05,580
- San Diego.
- California?

43
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,367
- Uh-huh.
- Sure didn't take the fastest road.

44
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,508
Oh, no. We absolutely
had to see the desert.

45
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,882
- Didn't we, Bob?
- Absolutely.

46
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,599
There ain't nothin'
to see in the desert.

47
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:17,559
Really?
Did you hear that, honey?

48
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:20,044
Yeah.

49
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,967
Don't you know it's illegal
to smoke around a gas pump?

50
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:26,677
Yeah.

51
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:30,007
- Come here. Come on.
He's a good little piggy.

52
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:33,720
Little baby piggy.
Little baby piggy.

53
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:36,722
Hey, Bobby, come over here.
Look at this.

54
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,309
Oh, my God.
That's so random.

55
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,487
You two make a perfect pair.

56
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,664
- Hey.

57
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,840
You're sweet.

58
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,498
Yeah.

59
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:55,197
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't pee there.

60
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:58,016
What the hell do you care?
Just turn around for a second.

61
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,859
Uh, hello.
Don't you see that?

62
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:05,883
Geez.

63
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:10,084
[ Older Woman ] She's so uncomfortable
in this heat. I told you to use cloth diapers.

64
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:14,047
- Mom, the doctor said these were fine.
- Look at those little cheeks.

65
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:18,117
- I know, sweetheart.
- Yes, she is. It's okay.

66
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,090
I think she's getting hungry again.

67
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,099
Uh, excuse me. Do you have a phone I can use?
I can't get a signal out here.

68
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:34,414
No, I don't.

69
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:37,196
Hey, Bukowski.
Give the cell phone a rest.

70
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,152
Sorry, Bob. Duty calls.

71
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:42,600
Honey,you've been on the phone
since we left, really.

72
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,977
Well, sweetheart,
I've been gone two days.

73
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,694
I have to make sure that
my store's not burning to the ground.

74
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:49,969
Oh, God.

75
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,982
What the hell, Brenda?

76
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,947
Damn it!

77
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:10,260
Damn it!
Got it all over my hand.

78
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,186
How far are we from I-88?

79
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:14,108
- Freaking perv.
- What?

80
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:17,175
- You're at least five or six hours.
- You hungry, sweetie?

81
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,799
- Why couldn't we
have gone through Santa Fe?
- It's nasty out here.

82
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:24,128
- Honey, could you put a cork in it for a minute?
- Well, if I do say so myself...

83
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:27,096
ma'am, your husband here's
quite right.

84
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:30,465
This is the only southbound road
going to I-88. From there...

85
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:33,912
you can take the 40 to California,
but it's a long, old drive.

86
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,738
That doesn't bother me a bit.
I like to drive at night.

87
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:39,172
I used to work the night patrol
for 1 5 years.

88
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,126
Is that right? You a cop?

89
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:43,906
- Well, detective.
- Not anymore, thank God.

90
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:47,586
- I'm starting my own, uh, security firm.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,445
You a cop too, mister?

92
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:52,447
No. I'm in telecommunications.
I sell cell phones.

93
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:56,867
- You won't find any customers around here.
- Yeah, no kidding.

94
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:59,755
Everything's fine. Oil's okay.

95
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:02,636
Beauty, come back here.!

96
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:06,151
Hey, buddy.
What do I owe you?

97
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,427
Uh, $46 even.

98
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:11,725
Oh, hey, Bob, here.
Let me take care of that.

99
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,444
I can still afford the gas, Bukowski.
Keep the change, my friend.

100
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:16,335
That's not what I meant.

101
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:19,849
Beauty?

102
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:22,860
Beauty?

103
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,421
Beauty?

104
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,768
Beauty? Come on, girl.

105
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:36,281
Beauty?

106
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,956
Beauty? Come on, girl.

107
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:45,881
Hello?

108
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:50,933
Is anyone there?

109
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:54,585
Beauty!

110
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:09,696
- Can I help you, miss?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:13,659
It's just our dog. She just-
She got out, and she won't stay put.

112
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:16,548
- Lynn, we're leaving.!
- Come on, girl. Let's go.

113
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:27,422
Bobby, she keeps getting out.

114
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,530
- It's all right. I got her.
- Okay.

115
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:35,143
Oh, honey? Honey?
Could you, uh, tell him to take it easy?

116
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:37,668
- The heat's making me nauseous.
- Let's go!

117
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:39,629
Do you need something?

118
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:43,108
No, thanks.

119
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:46,185
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.!

120
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,112
Honey, we're on vacation.

121
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,116
Yeah?

122
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,587
You know, uh...

123
00:14:57,684 --> 00:15:00,979
it's not on the map,
but if you...

124
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:05,171
take a left at the dirt road,
couple miles from here...

125
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,053
- Uh-huh.
- it'll lead you through the hills.

126
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:11,152
Probably save you
a couple ofhours.

127
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:14,705
Can't miss it.
Uh, there's an old fence right in front.

128
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,048
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

129
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:19,187
Old fence, dirt road,
two miles.

130
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,163
Mm-hmm.
You have a safe trip.

131
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,156
Thank you.

132
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:30,418
Dad, I hate your singing.

133
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:35,216
Guys, no.

134
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,441
- Stop.!
- Imagine the first people
to cross this desert.

135
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:41,365
They didn't know
where they were.

136
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:44,497
- Yeah, I can, because neither do we.
- Brenda, the road is here.

137
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:48,016
It exists.
It's got to go somewhere.

138
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:51,254
Besides, look how beautiful it is.
Look at the light on the rocks.

139
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,177
It's gorgeous.

140
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:55,763
- This is so fucked!
- Excuse me?

141
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:58,868
Watch your language, young lady.

142
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,884
I would like
a little backup here.

143
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,839
- This is such bullshit.
- Hey, watch your fucking mouth!

144
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:08,310
Can we just calm down here?
We're all a little tired, okay?

145
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:12,096
Yeah, Mom. Didn't you grow up in the '60s?
Why are you so uptight?

146
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:14,713
Your mom didn't
used to be uptight.

147
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,016
- She was a little hippie chick.
- No.

148
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:20,482
You should have seen her when she was
your age. She was a little hottie.

149
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,810
- Dad.
- Stop that.

150
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:32,383
Driving through the New Mexico desert
in the middle of summer...

151
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:35,107
with a broken air conditioner.

152
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,032
Great vacation.

153
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:41,953
I'm glad you came because
I would have been so fucking bored otherwise.

154
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,745
Yeah. So bored.

155
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:49,677
Oh. Give up on that, man.

156
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:52,708
I tried for an hour and a half.
Thing's ancient.

157
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:54,636
Wiring's medieval.
Needs to be replaced.

158
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,290
There.

159
00:17:57,393 --> 00:18:01,356
There.
It's just the, uh, thermostat.

160
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,280
It's disconnected.

161
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,445
Anyway, at least
we can breathe now.

162
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:14,031
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

163
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,299
- Does my sister know?
- Hey, man.

164
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:19,473
Fuck your sister.

165
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:24,280
You know, uh, Big Bob'd
get pretty pissed off...

166
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:27,378
if he found out you were smoking
in his newly renovated '88 Airstream.

167
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,305
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:31,347
Well, fuck Big Bob too.

169
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:34,769
Here. Want one?
Go ahead.

170
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:38,897
Uh-uh.

171
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:41,374
Your sister would cut my nuts off
if you start smoking.

172
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:43,927
I think she did that
a long time ago.

173
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:45,920
I think you're right.

174
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:53,595
I think we're somewhere
on this blue road.

175
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,382
Mom, we're not on the blue road
or any other road.

176
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:58,491
The guy said it wasn't
on the map, remember?

177
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,419
Oh, my God.!

178
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,780
Jesus.! Hang on.!

179
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,656
Watch the baby!

180
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,515
Honey? Where's the baby?

181
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,470
- She's right here.
- Is she okay?

182
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,454
- She's fine. She's fine.
- What the hell happened?

183
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,968
- The heat must have caused a blowout.
- Are you okay?

184
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,790
Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just a little scared.

185
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:39,688
Where's Bobby? Bobby.
Are you all right, honey? Are you okay?

186
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:42,610
He's all right.

187
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:44,847
I knew this wasn't going
to be safe for the baby.

188
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:47,252
- You okay?
- Yeah, we're okay. We're fine.

189
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:50,580
Son of a bitch!

190
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,940
- Okay, okay, we're all right.
- Oh, my God. The whole trailer.

191
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,015
Come here, guys.
Come here.

192
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:58,674
Beauty.!

193
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,631
Beast.!

194
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:10,748
We are so fucked.

195
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,832
- Did you find a signal?
- No. Nothing.

196
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,673
Ninety-seven percent nationwide coverage,
and we find ourselves in that three percent.

197
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,160
- Yeah.
- Well, your dad wanted to see the desert.

198
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,177
I hope he's enjoying himself.

199
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:32,546
Doug, don't start.

200
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:35,197
- Maybe somebody will need
a rent-a-cop around here.
- Doug!

201
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,091
- What?
- Come on.

202
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:40,804
Every chance the guy gets, he takes me
down a peg. Can't snap back at him?

203
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:44,319
- Yeah, well, don't stoop to his level.
- It's my fault?

204
00:20:44,424 --> 00:20:47,078
200 degrees out here!
It's everybody's fault.

205
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,480
- Don't listen to him.
- Get off my back.

206
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:52,132
General, what's the damage?

207
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:56,971
The axle is broken,
and it's... totaled.

208
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,434
Can we fix it?

209
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:02,152
What?

210
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:06,473
No, the frame is twisted to hell.
We can't-

211
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,966
- With what? I mean-
- There she is.

212
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,376
Give me your damn cell phone.
I'm gonna call a tow truck.

213
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:13,449
No signal. I tried.

214
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:17,329
- Well, we can use the C.B.
- You can try it, but I doubt
you're gonna get anybody.

215
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:21,291
The freeway's way the hell on the other side
of those hills. You won't get a signal.

216
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:23,404
So, what are we gonna do?

217
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:28,302
Excuse me.

218
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:38,517
Bob? What are we doing?

219
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,180
We walk.

220
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:46,904
- We walk?
- Yep. You and me.

221
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,271
We're in the middle of the desert.
We're miles from anywhere.

222
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:57,054
It's either that, or we sit here
and wait for somebody to drive by.

223
00:21:57,153 --> 00:21:59,707
Have you seen anybody drive by
since we got off the freeway?

224
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:02,625
I haven't seen anyone drive by since
you decided to take the shortcut.

225
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:06,269
- Honey. Honey, let's go for a walk. Okay?
- Okay.

226
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:09,241
There's nothing there,
you shitheads.

227
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:21,283
There you go. Ah, good boy.

228
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:28,229
I'm sure this desert is full of rattlesnakes.
Is that locked?

229
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,307
- Bobby, come here.
- I think that's locked.

230
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,801
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,627
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.

232
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:39,687
- You know, I saw- Mom?
- What?

233
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,404
- Safety's on, boy.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:46,353
- I saw a documentary on desert snakes-
- Uh-huh.

235
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,036
On the Discovery Channel-
And there's some species...

236
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:51,758
if you get bit, you can die
within like 25 minutes.

237
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:55,057
Really? I'd like to see
how they stack up against this one.

238
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:57,491
I thought those were gonna
stay locked up, honey.

239
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:00,721
- I thought you weren't talking to me, honey.
- You're right.

240
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:03,573
Relax, honey. I'm a licensed professional.

241
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:05,875
Besides, I'd take my bullets
over your prayers any day.

242
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:07,799
Well, some things never change.

243
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:11,245
So, what about, like, uh, scorpions
and coyotes and stuff?

244
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:14,770
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

245
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:19,634
Hey, Doug. You wanna try?

246
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:22,424
- Hey, don't point that at me!
- Don't worry, man. The safety's on.

247
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:24,597
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

248
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,894
Leave Doug alone. He's a Democrat.
He doesn't believe in guns.

249
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:33,182
Oh. Come on, Dougy.
Come here.Just one shot.

250
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:35,617
It makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

251
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,583
I don't think so, Bobby.
I'd probably just shoot my foot off.

252
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:40,862
You know, he's right.

253
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:44,193
He'd probably shoot his foot off.

254
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,467
- Hey, ""B.''
- Hey.

255
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:01,156
How you holding up?

256
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,496
I am thrilled.

257
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:07,426
Yeah. This is a total drag.

258
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:10,630
Yeah, well, you know,
I really don't care what they say.

259
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:13,996
Next year, I am going
to Cancun with my friends.

260
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:16,396
Not going on any more
of these little family trips.

261
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:19,628
Well, we're not gonna have
many more of them, you know?

262
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:24,074
And if you want to go to Cancun,
you know you're gonna have to get a job.

263
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,448
Oh, yeah. What, you mean
like your job?

264
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:30,929
Brenda, I help Doug out
at the store, okay?

265
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:33,333
Oh, yeah.

266
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:35,828
Honey? Can you bring me myjacket?

267
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:40,406
I'll be right there, honey.

268
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:05,521
Bobby!

269
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:07,321
Fucker!

270
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:09,561
- Could you get me a Twinkie?
- No!

271
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:12,761
Aw.

272
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:31,558
-Just keep walking this direction.
- Yeah, fine.

273
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,590
You find out where the road leads,
and I'll head back the way we came.

274
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:37,117
- Stay away from me.
- All right.

275
00:25:37,223 --> 00:25:39,875
It's gotta lead somewhere.
Maybe back to the freeway.

276
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:42,247
- Are you taking a gun too?
- No, honey, I'm not.

277
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:45,314
I don't need a gun
to find help.

278
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,809
- I don't want this.
- You need the hat.

279
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,185
- It gives me hat head. I don't like it.
- Who cares?

280
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:52,550
- It's not about fashion.
- All right. Thank you.

281
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,648
Hey, listen. Uh, if you don't find help
within five or six miles,just come back.

282
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,986
All right?

283
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:01,640
- Here, honey.
- I'm gonna go to the gas station.

284
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:04,909
You're just never gonna make it back
by sunset is the only problem.

285
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:08,173
Honey, it's only about eight miles.
I'll borrow the old man's car.

286
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:11,374
Use his phone, if he's got one. I'll be back
with a tow truck before nightfall.

287
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:13,386
- Can I go with Doug?
- No. Nope.

288
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:16,908
You stay here with your mother
and your sisters. Now, hey, uh, Brenda?

289
00:26:17,013 --> 00:26:19,381
Listen up. Your brother is
in charge, all right?

290
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,740
- So don't tease him.
- I think we should pray before you go.

291
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:26,614
- Oh, Mom!
- Brenda, is it really so much to ask?

292
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,851
- Yes.
- Come on.

293
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:30,774
Damn it.

294
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:33,721
We're waiting.

295
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:35,793
Thank God no one's watching us.

296
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:38,907
- Bobby.
- Stop it, Bobby.

297
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:41,427
- Stop.
- Thanks.

298
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,534
Please bless us at this time...

299
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,908
and send your guardian angels...

300
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:50,970
to help us to walk through
this valley in our faith...

301
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:53,309
this, yeah, with the help
of thy dear Lord.

302
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,265
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

303
00:26:55,362 --> 00:26:57,751
- Okay.
- Bye, Doug. Be careful.

304
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:00,760
- See you later.
- See you guys in a few hours.

305
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:04,644
Honey? Keep the hat on, okay?

306
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:07,197
- Am I wearing it?
- Don't give me that look.

307
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:09,475
- Do you see it on my head?
- I love you.

308
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,649
I love you too. Bye.

309
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,314
Hi.

310
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:26,121
Hi, sweetness. Hello.

311
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:29,221
Who doesn't want
to sleep anymore?

312
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,181
Are you hungry?

313
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,988
Please take your feet
off the table. Honestly.

314
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,674
Just because we're camping
doesn't mean you get to act like a pig.

315
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:41,005
You know, honey, really...

316
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:43,723
you shouldn't go
from the breast to the bottle.

317
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:46,577
At her age, she should
get used to one or the other.

318
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:50,419
Mom, thanks for the advice,
but she's my baby.

319
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:57,834
I can't believe that we're stranded
in the middle of nowhere on your anniversary.

320
00:27:57,941 --> 00:28:00,813
- Hmm.
- You know, if we just stayed on the main road...

321
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,896
we'd be in California right now.

322
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:06,710
What I'd give for a hot shower
and a cold margarita.

323
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,039
- The beach.
- A massage.

324
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,409
- I'll take a real bed.
- Yeah.

325
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:14,648
- The chronic.
- The what?

326
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:16,919
Brenda.!

327
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,411
What?

328
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,342
The chronic.
It's pot, Mom.

329
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,156
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who smokes pot?
- Yes, exactly.

330
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:28,447
- Who smokes pot?
- Hey, has anybody seen my red sweatshirt?

331
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:32,155
You know, the hoodie thing
in the backseat? Brenda?

332
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:36,383
- Weren't you sleeping on it?
- I haven't touched your smelly sweatshirt, okay?

333
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:38,787
Why are the dogs so excited?

334
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,852
- There's probably some
rattlesnakes somewhere around.
- Ew.

335
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:45,376
You know how Freud would have interpreted
your obsession with rattlesnakes, Mom?

336
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,518
Bobby!

337
00:28:47,623 --> 00:28:49,599
So bad.

338
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:52,095
- Bobby Carter.! Stop that.!
- That's gross!

339
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:55,649
- That's so wrong.
- That was a little gross. I'm sorry.

340
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:58,406
- I apologize to the entire table.
- Well, thank you.

341
00:28:58,507 --> 00:29:02,501
I'm really glad that
we all came on this trip together.

342
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:05,921
Ah, well, that makes one of us.

343
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:09,740
- Where is the, uh, fruit?
- Does anyone need anything?

344
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:13,517
No.

345
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:16,170
- Hey. Hey. Brenda!
- Wonderful.

346
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:18,281
- Are you kidding me? Do you know how long-
- Bobby.

347
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:20,241
- Bobby?
- Sorry.

348
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:23,188
Bobby, it's dinnertime.

349
00:29:23,284 --> 00:29:25,227
- I'll get him, Mom. Bobby!
- This always happens.

350
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:29,076
Bobby, I don't want you going
away from the trailer right now.

351
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:32,276
Beauty!

352
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:43,161
Beauty!

353
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:09,849
Beauty!

354
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:49,713
Beauty!

355
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,835
Fuck!

356
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,329
What the hell?

357
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:57,570
Look at that. Huh.

358
00:36:26,305 --> 00:36:28,279
Hello?

359
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:32,867
Hello?

360
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:36,132
Hey, buddy.

361
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:51,529
Hello?

362
00:36:58,027 --> 00:37:00,613
Hello!

363
00:37:11,568 --> 00:37:15,344
Hey, uh, I had a bit of a wreck
out on your, uh, shortcut.

364
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,954
Yo!

365
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,165
I grabbed some water, all right?

366
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:31,725
Uh-

367
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:38,193
It's dead. Damn it.

368
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:41,396
Yo, my friend! Hey!

369
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:43,736
You here?

370
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:45,843
You home?

371
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,776
Hello?

372
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:23,398
Hello?

373
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,807
Weird son of a bitch.

374
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:47,650
Yeah.

375
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:54,940
Jupiter!

376
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,388
I got buckshot, ya hear?

377
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,878
Hey, mister.

378
00:40:05,674 --> 00:40:08,993
You don't understand
what's going on here.

379
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:10,986
Hey!

380
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:15,141
The kids...

381
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:19,337
grew up in the mines
like wild animals.

382
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:21,327
Open the door, slowly!

383
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:27,661
What kind of place
is that for children?

384
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:31,635
What kind of a place is that?

385
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:36,402
Okay. Put the weapon down.
Put it down, easy. Put it down.

386
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:42,100
I did the best I could.
I'm sorry.

387
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:44,816
Hey!

388
00:40:46,648 --> 00:40:49,747
Daddy.

389
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:52,696
Daddy.

390
00:40:54,906 --> 00:40:56,794
Daddy.

391
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:01,202
Daddy. Daddy.

392
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:04,507
Daddy. Oh, Daddy.

393
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:06,909
Daddy. Daddy.

394
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,429
Daddy. Daddy.

395
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:11,424
Daddy. Daddy.

396
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:20,733
Daddy.

397
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:44,420
Would you give me that gun, Pluto.!

398
00:41:44,524 --> 00:41:46,498
- Give me the gosh darn gun.!
- Get on over here.!

399
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,473
That's right. Come on.
You oughtn't have a gun.

400
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:08,145
Brenda?

401
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:16,432
Brenda.!

402
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,731
Hey, I'm here!
I'll be back in a minute!

403
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,989
Bobby!

404
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:26,229
Bobby!

405
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:31,355
Bobby.!

406
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,390
Bobby.!

407
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:58,269
Bobby.!

408
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:06,398
Okay, let me just-
Oh, honey, the hair.

409
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,510
It's just-

410
00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:11,367
You know, you really are so lucky
that Brenda found you.

411
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:15,907
I mean, what if you'd had to spend
the whole night out there in the cold?

412
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:22,184
Hey, Bobby. Don't worry. Beauty will
come back when she's hungry, okay?

413
00:43:24,941 --> 00:43:28,007
- Did you- Did you try the radio?
- It doesn't work.

414
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:32,300
But we heard something.
Some sort of breathing.

415
00:43:32,398 --> 00:43:35,084
What breathing?

416
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:37,356
It was weird.
Right, Mom? I-

417
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,629
I'm sure it was just static.

418
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,489
Mom! It sounded like
a perverted call.

419
00:43:44,596 --> 00:43:48,305
Only Mom would get
an obscene phone call out here.

420
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:52,149
Bobby! What-

421
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:55,858
- Honey?
- No, no, no, no! I want you guys to stay here.

422
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,708
What is wrong with him?

423
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:12,888
What's he doing?

424
00:44:24,737 --> 00:44:26,624
Shit.

425
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:32,674
Beast.! Beast.!

426
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,594
- Hey, Bobby.
-Jesus Christ!

427
00:44:34,693 --> 00:44:38,817
Hey! Whoa, whoa!
Stop pointing the gun at me! Please!

428
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:42,214
-Jesus, Bobby!
- Doug, I'm sorry, man.

429
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,661
It's me! You okay?

430
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:49,250
- Yeah.
- God!

431
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,459
- Didn't mean to startle you, man.
- Yeah, I know. I just-

432
00:44:51,562 --> 00:44:55,557
Look, I found this place out here.
You wouldn't believe it. It's like the Twilight Zone.

433
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,482
- Hey.
- Is that Bob?

434
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,402
- It's Doug. It's okay.
- Ta-da!

435
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:03,691
Honey! Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay.
I was so worried about you.

436
00:45:03,788 --> 00:45:07,141
- No, I'm fine.Just exhausted. Look.
- Yeah.

437
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:09,070
Look at all this stuff
I found.

438
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,438
There's a huge crater out there.

439
00:45:11,535 --> 00:45:15,216
People must use it as a dump site.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

440
00:45:15,315 --> 00:45:17,137
- What are-
- Look at this stuff. It's brand new.

441
00:45:17,235 --> 00:45:19,277
What are we gonna do with
a fishing pole in the desert?

442
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,959
- I thought you went to go find somebody.
- Road dead-ends in five miles.

443
00:45:23,061 --> 00:45:25,515
That's where the crater is.
It's not a shortcut. It's just desert.

444
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,445
- It dead-ends?
- Dead end.

445
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,259
- I knew that old man was full of shit.
- Hope your dad did better.

446
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:32,182
Maybe wejust missed a turn.

447
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,128
- Honey, did you guys cook
any dinner? I'm starving.
- Yeah. Come on inside.

448
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:38,159
- Great. Thanks. Brenda?
- Yeah?

449
00:45:38,264 --> 00:45:40,154
Do you have that lip balm?
My lips are really dry.

450
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,187
Are you serious? That's gross.
I'm not letting you use my lip balm.

451
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:46,010
Do you use it
without telling me?

452
00:46:05,923 --> 00:46:08,826
Wait. Bobby. Don't close that door.
We're leaving in a second.

453
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,801
- What?
- Get some rest for Daddy.

454
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:13,732
You guys aren't gonna wait
till Dad gets back?

455
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:17,574
No, Bobby, I'm exhausted.
I need to get some sleep.

456
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:20,519
No, no, no. It's fine.
You'll be more comfortable here.

457
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:23,267
I'll sleep on the floor, and Mom and Brenda
are gonna be up front.

458
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:26,567
And you and Lynn can take the back.
We got extra sleeping bags.

459
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,221
Bobby, you got six people sleeping
in a three-person trailer.

460
00:46:29,322 --> 00:46:33,480
It's not comfortable.
It's a little bit weird. Okay?

461
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:36,615
- Honey, you gonna bring the water?
- Yeah.

462
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,766
- Hey, hey, hey. Doug, Doug. Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

463
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,905
- Baby, you coming?
- I'm almost ready.

464
00:46:45,008 --> 00:46:47,311
- See, uh-
- What's going on?

465
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:51,338
- Uh, when I-
- Bobby.

466
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,646
- No, no, no, no. It's-
- Bobby, hey.

467
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:56,432
I'm sure your dad's gonna
be back soon. Okay?

468
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:59,980
I mean, come on.
He's Big Bob, all right?

469
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:03,981
I'm sure it's gonna take more than snakes
and scorpions in the night to stop him.

470
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,323
- Okay?
- Excuse me.

471
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,595
- Sorry.
- Did you get pillows?

472
00:47:09,848 --> 00:47:12,053
They're in the S.U.V.

473
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:15,673
Hey, hey, listen.

474
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,033
If he's not back by midnight,
we'll both go looking for him. Deal?

475
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,238
- Yeah. Deal.
- Okay.

476
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:23,544
- Get some rest, man.
- Good night, Bobby.

477
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:26,198
Good night.

478
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:29,304
What are you doing?
There's no mosquitoes in the desert.

479
00:47:29,407 --> 00:47:31,414
Honey, there's
mosquitoes everywhere.

480
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,321
Hi.

481
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:44,623
Beast.

482
00:48:47,577 --> 00:48:49,464
Beast?

483
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:09,088
Beast?

484
00:49:12,256 --> 00:49:14,494
Beast?

485
00:49:14,593 --> 00:49:16,481
Beast?

486
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:22,021
Beast?

487
00:49:43,435 --> 00:49:45,323
Beast?

488
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:48,941
Beast?

489
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:51,723
Beast? Come here, boy.

490
00:50:01,235 --> 00:50:03,601
Beast?

491
00:50:27,354 --> 00:50:29,014
Hey. Guys! Guys!

492
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:31,482
- Oh, good God. What-
- Jesus!

493
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:34,201
- Bobby.
- What is it, Bobby?

494
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:38,198
- Guys, something- something
is going on around here, okay?
- What is it?

495
00:50:38,303 --> 00:50:40,823
There-There are, like, people
or something living in those hills.

496
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:43,230
- People? Bobby.
- No, no, no, no. Doug.

497
00:50:43,328 --> 00:50:45,883
- Doug. Doug. Please.
- Bobby. Bobby, listen to me!

498
00:50:45,985 --> 00:50:49,980
We're in the middle of nowhere, okay?
Nobody lives in those hills.

499
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:52,221
- Beauty's dead.
- What?

500
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:56,283
I found her,
and, uh, she was, like-

501
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,772
- It looked like somebody cut her open, you know?
- Cut her open?

502
00:50:59,878 --> 00:51:02,561
Yeah, and I-I didn't want
to say anything...

503
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:06,438
because I didn't want to scare everyone
and I didn't want to get Mom upset.

504
00:51:06,535 --> 00:51:11,688
But I'm telling you, there is something
going on, okay? And Dad's not even back yet.

505
00:51:11,785 --> 00:51:15,680
Okay. All right. Stay right there.
I'll come check this out.

506
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,973
- We're not alone.
- All right, Lynn.

507
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:22,409
You stay here,
you lock the car, okay?

508
00:51:22,506 --> 00:51:26,056
Calm down, man. We're gonna check this out.
Now where did you see this?

509
00:51:26,157 --> 00:51:28,941
Now!

510
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,679
It's Bob.

511
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:40,299
- Wait. We don't know what that is.
- It's Bob!

512
00:51:40,403 --> 00:51:42,673
- We don't know what that is!
- Bob!

513
00:51:42,773 --> 00:51:45,904
Dad? Dad!

514
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:48,079
Brenda. Watch the baby!

515
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,567
No!

516
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,767
Hey, little birdie.
Hey, little birdie.

517
00:53:07,696 --> 00:53:11,407
Get off!. Get your mother out of here!
Get your mother out of here!

1
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:14,934
Doug.! Do something.!

2
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:27,419
Move! You gotta be
a man to do that!

3
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,536
I told you to move!
So, move!

4
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:43,456
Now, get! Get!

5
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:51,546
Whoo!

6
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:57,502
What you got under there?
That's it. Give it to me. Whoo.! Whoo.!

7
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,578
Fuck off!.

8
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:02,018
Come on. Yeah!

9
00:54:46,118 --> 00:54:48,355
Whoo!

10
00:54:48,454 --> 00:54:50,342
Whoo.

11
00:54:56,198 --> 00:54:58,687
It's not my Bob.!
It's not my Bob.!

12
00:54:58,792 --> 00:55:02,053
Come on, Mom. No! Let's go.
No,just come on.

13
00:55:02,152 --> 00:55:05,087
It's not my Bob.

14
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:07,679
What was that?

15
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:10,785
Mom,just stay here, okay?

16
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:17,858
Help.! Help.! Help.!

17
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:25,665
Oh, you fat.

18
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:28,257
Oh. Big, fat...

19
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:30,663
and juicy.

20
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,602
No. No, please!

21
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:09,156
Bobby!
Bobby, where you going?

22
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:11,148
Fucking kill those motherfuckers!

23
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:14,627
Get back here.! Don't do something stupid.!

24
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:24,107
No. No.

25
00:57:10,641 --> 00:57:13,097
Get back to the trailer!

26
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:37,065
Come on.!
Get out the door.!

27
00:57:37,171 --> 00:57:39,309
Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!

28
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,963
- Brenda!
- Bobby!

29
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:45,067
Come on, now.
Look at me. Look at me.

30
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:48,237
That's it. Look at me.

31
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,234
Shit! I'll come back for ya.

32
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:54,640
Brenda!

33
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:57,747
Bitch stuck me like a pig!

34
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:15,214
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

35
00:58:33,271 --> 00:58:35,245
No.

36
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:42,416
Oh, God!

37
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:44,940
Don't move! Don't move, honey. Don't move.

38
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:47,382
Okay. Okay. All right.
You're gonna be okay.

39
00:58:47,479 --> 00:58:50,861
You're gonna be okay. S-Sweetheart?

40
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:53,171
Okay.

41
00:58:53,272 --> 00:58:56,470
Honey? Sweetheart?

42
00:58:57,562 --> 00:59:00,179
Lynn, come on!

43
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:02,965
Lynn!

44
00:59:04,282 --> 00:59:06,834
Come on!

45
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,279
Oh!

46
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,628
Hmm.

47
01:00:10,175 --> 01:00:13,077
Okay.

48
01:00:13,181 --> 01:00:14,815
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

49
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:15,829
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

50
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:18,455
What are we gonna do
if they come back, Doug?

51
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:28,700
This trailer is so small.
I clean and clean.

52
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,620
- It's still a mess.
- Shh.

53
01:00:30,718 --> 01:00:32,695
It's a mess.

54
01:00:34,784 --> 01:00:38,810
- Is Big Bob home?
- Not yet.

55
01:00:40,863 --> 01:00:44,759
Every- Everybody went to bed?

56
01:00:44,864 --> 01:00:46,687
- Yes?
- Yeah.

57
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:49,883
Brenda's right here,
and Bobby's in the back.

58
01:00:51,423 --> 01:00:53,693
Is Lynny sleeping? Hmm?

59
01:00:58,146 --> 01:01:00,447
You need anything?

60
01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:02,618
- A blanket.
- Okay.

61
01:01:02,722 --> 01:01:04,545
- It's cold.
- Okay.

62
01:01:04,642 --> 01:01:09,018
- It's cold.
- Shh. Shh. Nice and warm, huh? Nice and warm.

63
01:01:18,787 --> 01:01:21,121
You're so sweet, Doug.

64
01:01:22,531 --> 01:01:27,266
I understand why Lynny
loves you so much.

65
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:29,370
So-

66
01:01:40,452 --> 01:01:42,307
I'm not gonna take this shit.

67
01:01:42,403 --> 01:01:45,884
- Hey, we're not going anywhere!
You wanna die too?
- I don't fucking care!

68
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:48,858
You wanna die, huh?
Look what they did to your mother!

69
01:01:48,965 --> 01:01:51,420
Look what they did to your sister!
Huh? You stop and think!

70
01:01:51,525 --> 01:01:54,493
You're not a fucking child anymore!
You won't make it three feet out there.

71
01:01:54,598 --> 01:01:57,631
We need a plan.
We need to think.

72
01:01:57,734 --> 01:01:59,622
- We need-We need to think.
- Think about what?

73
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,540
Think about what, Doug?
They have Catherine!

74
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:04,388
They have your daughter.
And you're just gonna sit here and do nothing?

75
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:06,625
That's 'cause you're a fucking pussy
just like my dad said!

76
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:09,891
- Shut the fuck up! You shut up! Shut your mouth!
- Fuck you.

77
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:16,541
No.! Turn the lights on.

78
01:02:16,647 --> 01:02:19,015
Turn the lights on.
Turn the lights on.

79
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:23,105
- He said he's coming back.!
- Shh! Quiet!

80
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:25,728
He said he's coming back
for me. Please.

81
01:02:28,807 --> 01:02:31,775
It's them! It's them!
It's them!

82
01:02:38,312 --> 01:02:41,247
Goggle? Goggle?

83
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,905
Goggle? You copy, Goggle?

84
01:03:30,861 --> 01:03:33,675
Where's Goggle?

85
01:03:33,772 --> 01:03:37,220
He stayed back there.
He's keeping an eye on them.

86
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:41,547
- I told you.
- What?

87
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:46,632
I told you,
you've gotta kill them all.!

88
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,374
Beast! Beast! You're alive!

89
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:11,334
Oh, good boy.
Good boy. Good boy.

90
01:04:11,439 --> 01:04:14,309
- Good boy.
- Oh, my God.

91
01:04:14,415 --> 01:04:17,897
Jupiter's going to finish them off.

92
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,975
Why are you doing this to us?

93
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,074
Why are you doing this?
You hear me?

94
01:04:24,176 --> 01:04:25,998
Give me back my baby!

95
01:04:29,104 --> 01:04:31,755
What the fuck
do you want from us?

96
01:04:31,857 --> 01:04:35,206
What do you want?

97
01:04:35,313 --> 01:04:37,418
You give me back my little girl.
You hear me?

98
01:04:52,049 --> 01:04:56,077
- Bobby?
- Hmm?

99
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,002
How many bullets
do you have left?

100
01:04:58,099 --> 01:05:00,401
A clip and a half.

101
01:05:01,747 --> 01:05:03,689
What are we doing?

102
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:21,297
Which way, Beast? Which way?
Come on. Follow the trail.

103
01:06:04,281 --> 01:06:06,361
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

104
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:08,052
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

105
01:06:45,275 --> 01:06:47,163
Where are they, boy?

106
01:07:53,984 --> 01:07:55,807
Which way, Beast?

107
01:08:05,824 --> 01:08:07,712
Good boy.

108
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,402
Bobby?

109
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:49,979
Bobby, I followed the blood trail.

110
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:55,006
It leads to a town or something
out here. Bobby?

111
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,927
Who knows?
Maybe someone heard our calls.

112
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:56,643
Nobody's gonna hear
the fucking calls, Brenda!

113
01:09:56,745 --> 01:09:59,078
Nobody's gonna see the goddamn smoke
in this goddamn desert!

114
01:09:59,176 --> 01:10:02,407
We're in the middle of freakin'-
Ah, shit!

115
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:05,702
God.!

116
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:15,145
I'm sorry.

117
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:25,634
I'm so scared.

118
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:27,747
Who are these people?

119
01:13:45,496 --> 01:13:47,734
Good dog. Stay.

120
01:14:47,743 --> 01:14:50,109
- Did you push her?
- Yes

121
01:14:50,207 --> 01:14:52,149
- Did you destroy the furniture?
- No.

122
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:55,102
Did you call her
trailer park trash?

123
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,301
- So, now,you're saying you still-
- I'm still in love with her.

124
01:15:05,408 --> 01:15:07,644
Okay, but-So,you said
you treasured the marriage...

125
01:15:07,743 --> 01:15:10,842
and you wanted to end it
two weeks after you got into it?

126
01:15:10,943 --> 01:15:12,832
I wanted to end it
because I have-

127
01:15:12,928 --> 01:15:15,317
I had a feeling that things
weren't gonna work together.

128
01:15:15,424 --> 01:15:18,872
She wasn't working as a team player
with me, and I tried coaching her-

129
01:15:18,976 --> 01:15:20,983
- What were you doing coaching her?
- Well, I tried to show-

130
01:15:21,088 --> 01:15:23,424
- Is she your child?
- No, she's not my child, but she-

131
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,822
Shh, shh, shh.

132
01:15:27,937 --> 01:15:29,879
She wanted me
to eat dinner-spaghetti-

133
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,188
and I wanted to do it
before it got cold.

134
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,262
Watch her head, Bobby.

135
01:16:45,445 --> 01:16:47,270
Come on.

136
01:20:15,063 --> 01:20:18,128
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

137
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:21,297
Answer me.!

138
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:24,627
I don't know where she is.

139
01:20:24,726 --> 01:20:28,817
I never leave this place.

140
01:20:31,575 --> 01:20:35,831
Your people asked our families...

141
01:20:35,927 --> 01:20:37,902
to leave their town...

142
01:20:38,008 --> 01:20:42,448
and you destroyed our homes.

143
01:20:42,552 --> 01:20:47,125
We went into the mines.

144
01:20:47,225 --> 01:20:51,568
You set off your bombs...

145
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:54,323
and turned everything to ashes.

146
01:20:55,834 --> 01:21:00,623
You made us what we've become.

147
01:21:02,266 --> 01:21:06,095
Boom. Boom. Boom.!

148
01:21:06,265 --> 01:21:08,568
Where's my baby?

149
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:11,514
What's so funny?

150
01:21:13,466 --> 01:21:16,150
It's breakfast time!

151
01:25:11,628 --> 01:25:13,483
Please don't kill me.

152
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:16,841
"Please don't kill me."

153
01:25:16,939 --> 01:25:20,803
- Please don't kill me.
- "Please don't kill me. "

154
01:26:48,051 --> 01:26:51,312
Lizard.

155
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:53,300
Kill the baby.

156
01:27:47,223 --> 01:27:51,151
Baby. Baby.

157
01:28:09,753 --> 01:28:12,687
Get out of the way, Ruby.

158
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:16,536
I said get. Now, get!

159
01:28:28,314 --> 01:28:31,762
Mister, would you play with us?

160
01:28:53,405 --> 01:28:55,925
Ruby!

161
01:29:04,445 --> 01:29:06,900
Catherine!

162
01:29:11,485 --> 01:29:13,689
It's okay.

163
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:23,772
It's okay.
We'll be all right.

164
01:29:26,334 --> 01:29:28,756
It's okay.

165
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:37,717
No. No.

166
01:29:37,823 --> 01:29:39,864
- Come on. Come on.
- No!

167
01:29:39,968 --> 01:29:41,975
- Come on, Brenda.
- Bobby!

168
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,382
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

169
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:49,118
Come on. Come on.
It's gonna be all right.

170
01:29:49,216 --> 01:29:51,421
It'll be all right.

171
01:29:53,952 --> 01:29:56,920
Careful. Please? Please?

172
01:30:06,754 --> 01:30:08,609
Oh, shit.

173
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:17,949
Come on out,
you motherfucker.

174
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:26,590
Look. Look. It's just a tumbleweed.
Come on.

175
01:30:26,691 --> 01:30:30,487
Come on. Let's go back
to the trailer. Come on.

176
01:30:30,595 --> 01:30:33,911
Come on. Come on.

177
01:30:41,828 --> 01:30:44,698
Oh, my God!

178
01:30:44,804 --> 01:30:46,747
- Oh, my God!
- She's gone.

179
01:30:46,852 --> 01:30:50,048
She's fucking gone! She's gone!
Brenda! Brenda! Go get the trailer ready.

180
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:51,971
- Brenda, go get the-
- Where's Mom?

181
01:30:52,069 --> 01:30:55,298
- Go get the trailer ready. Okay?
- Where's Mom?

182
01:30:55,396 --> 01:30:58,626
- Where's Mom?
- Listen to me. I need you to go get the trailer.

183
01:30:58,725 --> 01:31:00,830
Just go in,
do what we talked about.

184
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:19,872
Let's go! Get the window!
Get the window!

185
01:32:21,515 --> 01:32:25,793
It's stuck.!

186
01:32:25,899 --> 01:32:29,063
Bob! Help me! Bob!

187
01:32:50,286 --> 01:32:52,839
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get out!

188
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:21,001
Here.

189
01:35:05,527 --> 01:35:08,210
Ruby.!

190
01:35:08,311 --> 01:35:10,384
Ruby.!

191
01:35:16,535 --> 01:35:18,445
Ruby.!

192
01:35:20,952 --> 01:35:24,401
Ruby.! Come back here.!

193
01:35:24,505 --> 01:35:27,320
You little bitch.!

194
01:35:40,538 --> 01:35:42,959
Give me that baby!

195
01:38:39,815 --> 01:38:42,018
Fuck!

196
01:38:54,823 --> 01:38:57,891
Come on. Let's get out of here.

197
01:39:03,401 --> 01:39:05,856
Oh, my God.
Look! Bobby!

196
01:40:00,186 --> 01:40:24,607
THE END
