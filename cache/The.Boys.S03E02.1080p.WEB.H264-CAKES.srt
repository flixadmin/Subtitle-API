00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,801
<i>This Thursday
on VTV: Television for Women...</i>

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,219
I guess I'm just searching for

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,638
a more purposeful life,
Mr. Adana.

4
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:14,765
The Church of the Collective

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,436
can offer you so much more.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,273
<i>We can offer you a family.</i>

7
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,736
<i> Mr. Adana,</i>
<i>tell me the truth.</i>

8
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,447
<i>Are you having me followed?</i>

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,906
I had to find out

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,409
<i>if you were putting</i>
<i>the Church first,</i>

11
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,578
<i>before your career.</i>

12
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,496
<i>Before everything.</i>

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,956
You branded me
with your initials!

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,999
It's enough.

15
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,669
I am afraid that you have become

16
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:46,464
a toxic personality, Deep.

17
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,134
Then you've left me no choice
but to run.

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,643
Not Without
My Dolphin.

19

28
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,884
<i>Goddamn the pusher man,
am I right?</i>

29
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,011
<i>You really gonna shoot
that shit in your veins?</i>

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,139
You know, I think I just might.

31

<i>Odds are you'll die screaming.</i>

32
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,353
Well,
I've gambled more for less.

33

<i>I don't think
you're gonna do it.</i>

<i>Turn yourself into a Supe?</i>

35
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,818
<i>That's a new low, even for you.</i>

36
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,152
Oh, I can go lower.

37
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:51,695
I can go straight to hell.

38

<i>Butcher, you have to stop.</i>

39
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:03,999
<i>Please. For Becca.
This would break her heart.</i>

40
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,752
Becca don't care what I do.

41
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,841
She's dead.

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,611
Hello, love.
A bit early, isn't it?

43
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,865
<i>You said I could call you
after 8:00. It's 8:03.</i>

44
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:39,326
Ah, yeah. Right you are.

45
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,371
<i>Are you okay?</i>

46
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,165
Yeah. Hunky-dory. Why?

47
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,667
<i>You look tired.</i>

48
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,753
Ah, just, uh,
had a naff night, that's all.

49
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,171
No sleep.

50
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,840
<i>Did you watch the video I made?</i>

51
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,091
Uh, no, no.

52
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,719
I, uh... I ain't had
a chance yet.

53
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,387
<i>I think
you should watch it.</i>

54
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,682
<i>It kind of helps me
when I don't sleep so good.</i>

55
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,059
Yeah, look, I told you
I'll watch it later.

56
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,061
<i>Are you mad at me?</i>

57
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,274
No, uh...

58
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,775
of course not.

59
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,404
Look, you're your mother's son.

60
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,241
And I'll always watch out
for you.

61
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,455
Just how I promised.

62
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,875
All right?

63
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,930
Hey there, sleepyhead.

64
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,015
Rise and shine. Big day.

65
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,853
Anything a little extra special
about today? Hmm?

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,361
It's my birthday, silly.

67
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,656
Hmm?

68
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,037
Okay, just blink if you want to
wish me a happy birthday, hmm?

69
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,052
Okay.

70
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,775
Okay,
so Red River is a group home

71
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,778
owned by a Vought subsidiary,
of course.

72
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,530
I guess that's where
Vicky grew up.

73
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,074
You mean Nadia?

74
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,702
God, I'm a fucking idiot.
I should have seen it.

75
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,829
- How could you have seen this?
- I don't know.

76
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,332
Maybe when she killed Rayner
or when she blew up Congress.

77
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,334
Goddamn it.

78
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,796
Maybe we leak it
to <i>The Times.</i>

79
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,799
No, she could head-pop everybody
in the office, me included.

80
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,426
Wait, wait, you're going in?

81
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,636
- Call in sick.
- We...

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,887
We have an all-hands at 3:00.

83
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,348
I've never missed one before.

84
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,852
What if we tell Butcher?

85
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,605
We tell Butcher I've been
a Supe's sidekick for a year?

86
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,066
Oh, Christ, he's never gonna
not torture me for this, is he?

87
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,818
Well, maybe he won't.

88
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,698
No. No, no, no. Look, we can...
handle this ourselves.

89
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,907
All right?

90
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,577
Just don't do anything.

91
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,079
- What, crazy, stupid?
- No.

92
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,582
Don't do anything
until I get back.

93
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,500
- Okay?
- You're leaving?

94
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,711
Yeah, it's the sound check

95
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,047
for Homelander's stupid
birthday special.

96
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,259
Wait for me.

97
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,054
Yeah. Okay.

98
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,181
Sure.

99
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,607
♪ <i>Got your license</i>
<i>to drive me...</i>

100
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,983
And pop, pop.

101
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,110
Head slide.

102
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,653
- I'll slide tonight. Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

103
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,031
Whew! Still got it.

104
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,408
Looks like you're back on
the "Sweet As I Wanna Be" tour.

105
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,244
Oh, wow.
No, this is humiliating.

106
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,205
That song was gross
when I was 18.

107
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,414
I sing it now, they're gonna

108
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,416
make me keep
a thousand feet from schools.

109
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,793
Then don't sing it.

110
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,002
That's easy for you to say.

111
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,253
You're already in The Seven.

112
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,214
I-I don't want to make waves.

113
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,717
Trust me... make waves.

114
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:28,263
Hey, Jay, um, could we run
my segment now, actually?

115
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,723
'Cause I only have a few lines.

116
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,058
Of course. Yeah.

117
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,352
Where's the fire, Starlight?

118
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,313
What,
are you on a break?

119
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,315
- Sir, happy birthday. I'm...
- Supersonic, right?

120
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,358
Yeah, that's right.

121
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,609
- Great to meet you.
- You, too.

122
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,944
Yeah.

123
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,113
You're a real, uh,
contender on <i>American Hero.</i>

124
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,989
Keep it up.
We could be teammates.

125
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,324
Oh, wow, I hope so, sir.

126
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,700
Of course, it doesn't hurt
that the show's judge

127
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,703
used to get come-drunk
on your <i>chorizo picante.</i>

128
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,291
Homelander,
sir, we're loading

129
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,544
- the prompter with Starlight's revisions.
- Sure.

130
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,087
- Revisions?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,713
I had Bruce make
a couple of tweaks,

132
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,423
- gave you some more juicy stuff.
- No.

133
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,175
After all, you are cocaptain.

134
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,718
Need you front and center.

135
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,971
- Roger, cue these up.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,264
Thank you.

137
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,891
You know,

138
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,309
I got to admit,

139
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,187
I was a little unsure
about this.

140
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,564
But now,

141
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,567
honestly, I am just so excited
about what's coming.

142
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,610
Partner.

143
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,028
Ready
for rehearsal.

144
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,579
All right, mate?

145
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,040
Bloody hell, Janine.
You shot up.

146
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,126
You remember your Uncle Billy,
don't you?

147
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,460
Here.

148
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,212
I got this for you.

149
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,173
You and your dad
can build it together.

150
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,551
523 pieces of family fun.

151
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,305
Okay, one,
you don't just pop up here.

152
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,598
You call first.

153
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,017
And, two, eff Soldier Boy.

154
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,187
I don't give a mothereffin'
doo-doo how he checked out.

155
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,063
Ah, bollocks.

156
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,648
He didn't die like no hero.

157
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,942
I'll wager he went out
on his knees,

158
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,235
begging like a right cunt.

159
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,154
What the f...

160
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,698
Sorry, love.

161
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,867

320
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,445
I have an idea.

321
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,197
Why don't you lighten
the fuck up?

322
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,408
Come on, you're gonna sing
the shit out of this song.

323
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,618
- Ready? Let's hit it.
- If Starlight

324
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,288
doesn't want to sing,
she doesn't sing.

325
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,165
Stan. What a surprise.

326
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,420
Our testing shows
that 76% of likely viewers

327
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,381
will make every effort to watch
tonight for Starlight.

328
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:37,218
As for you, 53% might DVR.

329
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,762
I think that that means
that she can

330
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,973
call her own shots. Don't you?

331
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,100
So how about I just walk, Stan?
How would that rate?

332
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,978
After the PR hole you dug
for yourself this past year,

333
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,522
I'd say you're lucky we're
putting on this farce at all.

334
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:53,318
But hey, it's your party.
You can cry if you want to.

335
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,088
- Damn, Annie.
- Hmm.

336
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,049
What happened to you
in New York?

337
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,842
I started making waves.

338
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,596
<i>Thank you so much
for coming in.</i>

339
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,431
Have you met
my new development exec?

340
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,934
Hi. I'm also Ashley.

341
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,810
Uh-huh.

342
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,396
We are super curious to hear
what you have for us today.

343
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,815
- Mm-hmm. So curious.
- I've been thinking a lot

344
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,693
about all the ways that I can
contribute around here.

345
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,612
Maybe I can't run
as fast as I used to,

346
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,156
but I've never just been
the world's fastest man.

347
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,075
Like, there's a lot
of layers to the A-Train

348
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,493
that people haven't seen yet.

349
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,244
Such as?

350
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,706
Well, I'm also a-a strong,
very proud Black man.

351
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,625
Right, Seth?

352
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,671
Seth, come on, man.

353
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,255
Tell them.

354
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,300
Right. Um...

355
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,886
The Seven have been dipping
in the African American demo.

356
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,305
Our numbers for <i>Dawn of</i>
<i>The Seven</i> have been soft.

357
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,100
People of color don't tend
to react well to Nazis.

358
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,477
- Facts.
- We thought a rebranding of A-Train

359
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,646
maybe could change that.

360
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,691
If done tastefully.

361
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,110
- A rebranding.
- So, listen,

362
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:21,072
we start with a docuseries
on Vought Soul.

363
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,367
<i>A-Train to Africa.</i>

364
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,953
- Boom.
- The art's, uh,

365
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,162
just a mock-up.

366
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,664
It'll trace his family's journey

367
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,001
from the plains of Africa
all the way to Vought Tower.

368
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah, like, I want to get back
in touch with my roots.

369
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,172
Like in <i>Roots.</i>

370
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,758
And for the Gen Z's,

371
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:43,886
a state-of-the-art interactive
learning experience.

372
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,231
Is that a video game
about the slave trade?

373
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,276
It's some powerful stuff.

374
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,902
It's really something.

375
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,696
I even had LJ redesign the suit.

376
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,240
You know, for the culture.

377
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,284
- I want to introduce it tonight.
- Oh, yeah, no,

378
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:10,246
let's have a beat on that
and think about that.

379
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,165
- Okay. Wow.
- Okay.

380
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,959
Thank you so much
for that pitch.

381
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,296
That was so well told.

382
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,630
Mm-hmm. So well told.

383
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,632
All right. Yeah.

384
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,677
We're gonna discuss
with the team

385
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,304
and-and get back to you.

386
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,639
Cool. Yeah. Thanks.

387
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:29,932
See you tonight.

388
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,688
I'm kind of surprised that
they didn't buy it in the room.

389
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,106
She hated it.

390
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,858
What? No.

391
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,401
Man, she said it was
"well told."

392
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,403
Yeah, that's code
for she fucking hated it.

393
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,864
Look, man, she didn't buy it
because it's total bullshit.

394
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,783
You couldn't care less
about your African roots.

395
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,702
You know it, and she knows it,
and frankly, Africa knows it.

396
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,246
Yeah?

397
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,956
You don't have a fucking dick.

398
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,634
So, uh, where at Vought
do you work?

399
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,387
Um, uh, the Tower,
social media, up on 47th.

400
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,014
Um, I'm sorry,
you said you don't get

401
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,766
many potential parents?

402
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,143
Well, you know what kind
of a home we are, right?

403
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,145
Yeah, no, of course,
it's a group home...

404
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,566
...for the s-super-abled.

405
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,736
Mason, please get down
from there.

406
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,780
Yeah, uh,
so many tragic stories,

407
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,865
but, uh, with
the right attention,

408
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:30,076
uh, they can bounce back
so quickly.

409
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,287
Yeah, they're little treasures.

410
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,415
Geez.

411
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,794
Teddy Still well,
we don't teleport.

412
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,713
- Can I play with my toys?
- Yeah.

413
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,967
So, their-their parents,
they're, uh...

414
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,510
Well, uh,
some of the kids,

415
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,637
they discovered their gifts
quite early,

416
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,222
before they were able
to control them.

417
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,891
But listen, I-I'm sure
you'd be perfectly safe.

418
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,978
Hey, can you...

419
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,772
Can you, uh... can you show me
the rest of the place?

420
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,607
- Uh, what did you want to see?
- Anything.

421
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,734
- Whatever you got.
- Oh.

422
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,403
Sorry, what, uh...
what is it, Teddy?

423
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,826
Hey, wait a minute. I know you.

424
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,744
You're Starlight's boyfriend?

425
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,455
- Uh...
- And you work at the bureau.

426
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,207
- Uh... No, no, I can...
- This is highly irregular.

427
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,084
Hey, hey, I-I can explain.

428
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,670
Um, okay, the-the truth is...

429
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,798
Starlight is-is the one
that sent me here.

430
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,426
I'm completely sterile.
Doctor says my sperm are bad.

431
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,303
Like, really, really bad,

432
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,014
like a bunch
of fat, dead tadpoles.

433
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:37,018
But we-we want a kid, and, um,
she wanted to keep it quiet,

434
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,895
so she sent me here
to cover for her.

435
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,396
I-I was never here, by the way.

436
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,066
We just want to keep it
about love and not publicity.

437
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,359
You know?

438
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,281
This is fantastic.
With a superhuman mother,

439
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,283
there is far less chance
of parental fatality.

440
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,493
Oh, yeah. That's great...

441
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,703
That's great news.

442
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,079
So, I have
a few standouts

443
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,748
that I think you'll be
pretty thrilled with.

444
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,876
You mind if I, uh,
just kind of flip around a bit?

445
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,337
Oh.

446
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,797
Thank you. Thank you. Sorry.
Move this over.

447
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,216
Sorry.

448
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,342
Is there
anything in particular

449
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,718
that you're looking for?

450
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,428
Um, boy, girl?

451
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,722
No, you know, we don't really
see gender that way.

452
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,059
- Well, Samir is South Asian.
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,686
That is
very hot right now.

454
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,480
No, that sounds great.
Wh... Uh, Samir...

455
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,690
- Right here? Okay.
- South Asian.

456
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,042
<i>Nadia, do you
know why you're here today?</i>

457
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,794
<i>Did I do something wrong?</i>

458
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,797
<i>Not at all.
You've made so much progress.</i>

459
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,715
<i>That's why you're here.</i>

460
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,884
<i>You're getting
what you've always wanted.</i>

461
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,972
<i>You're-you're adopting me?</i>

462
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,849
<i>No, I can't adopt you,
sport, not technically.</i>

463
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:02,144
<i>It's more complicated
than you need to worry about.</i>

464
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,356
<i>But you are a very rare
and exceptional girl,</i>

465
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,149
<i>and you're coming with me.</i>

466
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,859
<i>I'm gonna take care of you now.</i>

467
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,236
<i>Is that all right?</i>

468
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,947
<i>"It has been
a terrible, horrible,</i>

469
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,907
<i>no good, very bad day.</i>

470
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,078
My mom says
some days are like that.

471
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,580
Even in Australia."

472
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,333
You want me to read it again?

473
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:27,128
- Actually too old for that.
- Oh, you smart-ass.

474
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,922
Scoot. Let me talk to your mom.

475
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,804
Bad days do happen.

476
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,931
Maybe I need
to read this to you.

477
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,851
You have. About a million times
before bed.

478
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,482
- Anything in the news?
- Still nothing.

479
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,321
Good.

480
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,663
Tony was a friend of yours.

481
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,123
I understand why you'd be upset.

482
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,500
Somebody at Vought
dropped the ball.

483
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:10,087
I can't have people showing up
at my work calling me Nadia.

484
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,839
A cleaning crew
sterilized the site

485
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,091
within 15 minutes
of the incident.

486
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,177
No witnesses have come forward.

487
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,347
And if they do,
we'll deal with them.

488
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,349
The same way
you dealt with Tony.

489
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,060
Come on, sport.

490
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,854
Haven't I always
taken care of you?

491
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,574
Welcome. Next.

492
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,409
Ah, ah.

493
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,662
Oh. Sorry, mate.

494
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,289
Here you go.

495
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,708
Nice piece. Welcome.

496
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,627
Next.

497
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,213
Come through.

498
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,603
♪ <i>And cheer for the freedoms</i>
<i>that it gave to you...</i>

499
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,814
<i>And I'll tell you
something,</i>

500
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,733
if "Dakota" Bob Singer
gets elected president,

501
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,361
well, you say hello
to left-wing socialism.

502
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,904
'Cause I'll tell you this
right now,

503
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,406
he is gonna follow
the George Soros

504
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,033
globalist playbook to a T.

505
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:25,287
Step one, oppress the citizens
and confiscate their firearms.

506
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,206
Step two,

507
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,667
have it all gleefully reported
by the so-called news media.

508
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,752
- Fake news!
- And step three,

509
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,504
in every classroom
around the country,

510
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,089
they're gonna teach
your kids to hate America,

511
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,049
the Constitution
and the Second Amendment.

512
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,136
Good for us,
the silent majority,

513
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,887
and the Vought
Rifle Association,

514
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,180
let me tell you something,

515
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,141
we are armed and we're ready
to fight back.

516
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,934
Thank you for coming, ladies and gentlemen.

517
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,353
Don't forget, two-for-one
on hollow-points on the way out.

518
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:50,980
Use the promo code "Gunpowder."

519
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,774
God bless y'all.

520
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,992
Excuse me, Mr. Powder.
I'm your number one fan.

521
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,244
I've bought all your rifles.
Every one of them.

522
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,621
That Vought VR-15. Ooh.

523
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,082
That is a hell of a gun.

524
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,084
Smooth trigger pull.

525
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,378
Smooth.

526
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:18,924
I'd shake your hand,
but, uh, well, you know.

527
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,469
Well, I appreciate that.

528
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,652
Yeah, I followed you
since your Payback days.

529
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,780
I mean, 14 years old,

530
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,574
picked to be
Soldier Boy's sidekick.

531
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,576
He was a great man.

532
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,704
Well, it's nice
meeting you, buddy.

533
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,623
You must've been chuffed, eh?

534
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,249
Helping him on his missions,

535
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,251
letting him watch you
on the bog,

536
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,920
stick his finger
up your bum a bit,

537
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,922
give him a sloppy little nosh.

538
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,424
All in a day's work
for a young ward, innit?

539
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,009
Like I haven't heard
that sidekick pedo shit

540
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,511
a thousand times before.

541
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:06,722
Why don't you do me a big
favor, buddy, and fuck off.

542
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,516
You're right. I'm sorry.

543
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,018
That's a filthy,
unsubstantiated rumor.

544
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,686
Goddamn right it is.

545
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,022
Till now.

546
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,191
This is a complaint
you filed to Vought,

547
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,360
begging to be taken off Payback

548
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:23,531
on account of, and I quote,
"Soldier Boy's habitual abuse."

549
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:27,284
Of course they buried it,
Vought being the cunts they are.

550
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:28,702
That right there is a fake.

551
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,871
- Course it is.
- I'm sorry, who are you?

552
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:34,375
I told you. Biggest fan.

553
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,752
And I want to help you.

554
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,837
Keep shtum.

555
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,383
Be a crying shame if your
red-meat faithful out there

556
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,261
found out you were Soldier Boy's
underage nob-gobbler.

557
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,598
Now, all I want to know

558
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:53,477
is what happened to him,
and you're gonna tell me.

559
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,563
Or maybe I put a bullet
in your head.

560
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,776
You do that,

561
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,279
and it'll be all over
the Interweb within an hour.

562
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,489
See, buddy, I don't give a shit.

563
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,949
'Cause that never happened.

564
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,619
Soldier Boy never
touched me like that.

565
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:04,673
Fuck.

566
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,643
Oh, my God! Don't jump!

567
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,689
Hi, Chelsea.

568
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,108
It's your lucky day.

569
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,609
Well, considering.

570
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,945
You're-you're my annual
birthday save.

571
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,948
- Don't come any closer.
- Life is a precious gift.

572
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,617
To throw yours away would be
a real slap in the Lord's face,

573
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,119
don't you think?

574
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,080
You don't want to go to hell
for all eternity, do you?

575
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,834
I'm Jewish. I...

576
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,545
All right, well, regardless,

577
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,464
just step back
from the ledge, please?

578
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,965
Okay, that's good.

579
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,383
Just don't be afraid
of the zoom.

580
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,385
You're not Roger Deakins.

581
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,137
Mike, frame up. He could
be flying down any second.

582
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,181
Yep. You got it.

583
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,435
Oh, fuck.

584
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,187
Come on, look. I'm here now.

585
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,606
If you jump, I'm just gonna
fly down and save you anyway.

586
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,941
It's all futile and...

587
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,246
Sh-She wouldn't...

588
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,708
It's my... It's my birthday.

589
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,418
She...

590
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,382
She...

591
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,194
You probably don't know this
because, you know, Jew,

592
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,531
but Jesus wasn't born
on the 25th of December.

593
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,575
That was piggybacked off a
pagan festival, and guess what.

594
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:21,703
Today is not
my birthday, either.

595
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,330
Nope.

596
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:27,376
Don't know when it is,
but sure as hell ain't today.

597
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:32,005
This was just chosen for me
by a marketing department.

598
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,758
I mean, I can't even
have a birthday at all.

599
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:37,177
I wasn't born.

600
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,596
I was just poured
out of a fucking test tube.

601
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,225
Immaculate conception.

602
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,646
I know exactly
how he must have felt.

603
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,940
Jesus.

604
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,859
You give
and you give...

605
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:56,238
You give
your whole fucking life,

606
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,906
and what happens?

607
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,158
People just tear you down.

608
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,495
Why do people
destroy their gods?

609
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,998
H-How is it fair
that you get saved,

610
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:10,669
while a beautiful,
perfect god gets killed?

611
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,761
You know what, Chelsea?

612
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,932
I think you should jump.

613
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,184
I-I don't think I want to.

614
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,895
You don't want to?

615
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,397
Why don't you show a little
follow-through, Chelsea?

616
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,317
- Jump.
- Please, I... I just want to get down.

617
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,528
I'm not suggesting anymore.

618
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:37,738
Jump.

619
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,907
No. No, please.

620
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,992
Oh, God, oh, God.

621
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,161
No, no, no.

622
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,913
No God.

623
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:52,085
The only man in the sky is me.

624
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,463
How the fuck did she bite off
her own tongue?

625
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,089
Storm front <i>Million Dollar</i>
<i>Babied</i> herself.

626
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,466
- That's horrible.
- Oh, so...

627
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,241
Daddy? It smells smoky.

628
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,622
It's okay, baby, I got it.

629
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,966
Fucking piece of shit.

630
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,467
Shut the fuck up!

631
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,312
I'm sorry.

632
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,315
Baby, I'm sorry.

633
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,666
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

635
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,435
- Hughie.
- Hi.

636
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,937
- Hey, where you been?
- Uh...

637
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,480
You know, just, um,

638
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,649
- working from home.
- Oh, my God, your hand.

639
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,403
Yeah. Yeah, no, that's...
It's nothing.

640
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,405
- I'm fine.
- So, who's Nadia?

641
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,157
Nadia?

642
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,993
Yeah, Scotty said some guy came
in yesterday, asking for Nadia.

643
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,412
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, there was, there was a guy,

644
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,998
um, and he... he was
looking at your picture,

645
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,625
he said your name was Nadia,
said he knew you...

646
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,002
from, like, way back when.

647
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,295
You weren't gonna tell me?

648
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,671
Uh, no, I mean,
it was just some guy

649
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,131
off his meds, seemed like, yeah.

650
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:06,053
I'm sorry, I-I mean,
you're missing work, your hand.

651
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,971
- Lot going on.
- Hmm.

652
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,182
Is there something
I should know?

653
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,978
He was with me.
I'm sorry for stealing him

654
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,855
away from you, but...

655
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:20,067
we had some things
that we needed to discuss.

656
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,652
Very loudly, actually.

657
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,154
We made quite the scene
at Panera.

658
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:27,032
- Oh.
- I mean, it's a miracle nobody recognized me.

659
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,826
Yeah, sorry, I was, I was trying
to preserve just a tiny,

660
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,122
little shred of my dignity,
but, uh, we had a fight.

661
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,832
We didn't leave things
in the greatest place,

662
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,126
- so I thought I would come by and...
- Check up on me?

663
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,378
- Well, I was worried about you.
- Yeah, well, you know I can

664
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,963
handle some things
by myself, right?

665
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,758
- Okay, I'm just trying to help.
- I don't always need your help.

666
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,885
- I mean, you don't have to treat me like I'm a kid.
- Here I was thinking that I was

667
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,261
- treating you like my boyfriend.
- Well, you...

668
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,596
You know, this is actually
none of my business,

669
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,014
so I'm just, I'm gonna go.

670
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,974
Good-good luck with all of that.

671
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,727
- Oh, and Hughie?
- Yeah.

672
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,437
Cut her some slack.

673
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,357
You shouldn't be afraid
of a powerful woman.

674
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,156
Oh...

675
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,866
my God.

676
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,703
Uh, thanks for the save,
by the way.

677
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,791
What are you doing here?

678
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,543
What am I doing here?

679
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,337
Well, uh, Alex said
that you were acting weird,

680
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,798
and I've been calling you
literally every five minutes.

681
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,758
- So...
- Right.

682
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,927
Shit. Sorry, I left
my phone off at Red River.

683
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,388
I thought we were gonna
handle that together.

684
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,014
I know.

685
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,433
I'm sorry.

686
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,896
- And you're bleeding.
- I know, because I can't open a fucking jar,

687
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,524
- because I can't do anything fucking right.
- Hughie.

688
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,694
What's going on?

689
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,613
Vicky was my friend.

690
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,073
I know her daughter.

691
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:54,077
She-she-she surprised me
in the office on my birthday.

692
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:55,495
We used to roll
through that office

693
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,497
like we were
the fucking Untouchables.

694
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:01,209
I thought things were finally,
finally going my way.

695
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,338
God, what a goddam joke I am.

696
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:08,633
Hey, that's not true, Hughie.

697
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,185
Oh, um...

698
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,062
I may have signed us up
to adopt a child.

699
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,285
Hey, look at that.

700
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,163
- There you go.
- Seven Tower.

701
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,414
- Amazing.
- Bye, Dad.

702
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,457
I love you,
baby.

703
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,459
- I love you, too.
- Mm.

704
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,377
All right.

705
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,587
Is Monique here?

706
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,340
Uh, Monique, Marvin's here.

707
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,425
Hey, you gonna stay for
Homelander's birthday special?

708
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,094
I got some brats on the grill.

709
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,472
Think I'll pass, but thanks.

710
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,850
Oh.

711
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,859
You know
I've been trying, Monique.

712
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,947
Been trying to stay away
from all of it.

713
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,949
The Supes.

714
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,951
Butcher.

715
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,452
For Janine.

716
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,915
- And for you.
- I know.

717
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,125
But this...

718
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:27,295
this Soldier Boy thing came up,

719
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:30,465
and you know
the baggage there, I...

720
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,594
I tried upping my meds, just...

721
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:37,889
You're having
bad thoughts again.

722
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:41,017
And the tics
and the compulsions.

723
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,520
Monique, I lost my shit
in front of Janine.

724
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,232
It's like, Soldier Boy,
he's like this...

725
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,944
this steel sliver
inside of my brain, after he...

726
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,156
I don't know what to do.

727
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,373
You need to go back to Butcher.

728
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,459
That's what.

729
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:11,006
I never wanted to try to turn
you into something you're not.

730
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,758
I-I hate that you're making
yourself sick over it.

731
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,974
Maybe I can't be
with you anymore, Marvin,

732
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,059
and I am so sorry for that.

733
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,025
But you should go do
what you have to do.

734
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,402
Face this shit down.

735
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,159
Please don't tell Janine
about this.

736
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,662
About any of it.
My pops, none of it.

737
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,956
I just want
to leave her out of it.

738
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,252
Janine will be
right here, waiting.

739
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:53,298
Just... stay safe for her.

740
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,928
<i>Storm front
was right!</i>

741
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,432
<i>Storm front was right!
Storm front was right!</i>

742
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,934
<i>The Storm chasers
marched in Portland today,</i>

743
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,978
<i>mourning their fallen idol Storm front...</i>

744
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,356
<i>...when violence
broke out between...</i>

745
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,316
<i>Mon coeur.</i> Look.

746
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,610
Look at this.

747
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,740
Six Flags in Queens bury.
We go tomorrow,

748
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,160
we ride the Greezed Lightnin'
and, uh, Steamin' Demon

749
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,288
until we vomit
the doughnut hamburgers, huh?

750
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,669
It was never about
the roller coaster.

751
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,174
I know.

752
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:41,930
Kenji and I didn't have
a childhood.

753
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,438
I just did the same thing
to that little girl

754
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:53,024
- and her brother.
- Little girl.

755
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,695
- No...
- How can they ever be children again?

756
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:00,240
<i>Mon coeur,</i> no.

757
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:05,537
That wasn't your fault.

758
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:14,087
I'll never be a normal girl
who likes roller coasters.

759
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:19,175
I'm broken
and can never be fixed.

760
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:26,099
Because of this poison,
this curse in my veins.

761
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,843
<i>Hi, buddy.
I'm sorry I'm running late.</i>

762
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:06,556
<i>I thought I'd have time
to sneak in a haircut.</i>

763
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,516
<i>It always takes longer
than I think it will.</i>

764
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,728
<i>There's some Double Stufs
in the pantry,</i>

765
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,647
<i>but only two, mister.</i>

766
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,900
<i>More than two,
and I will know.</i>

767
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:20,153
<i>Okay. I'm hanging up now.</i>

768
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,489
<i>Just wanted to tell you that I
love you and I'll see you soon.</i>

769
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,825
<i>So, I love you,
and I'll see you soon.</i>

770
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,014
Butcher?

771
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,642
You all right, mate?

772
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,310
<i>Hey, um...</i>

773
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,312
Frenchie told me
about Crimson Countess.

774
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,730
What the hell happened?

775
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,816
<i>We was chasing down
something, but...</i>

776
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,860
<i>I-I'm gonna knock it
on the head.</i>

777
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,738
Y-You was right the other day.

778
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,535
Things are good.

779
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,912
Ryan's good.

780
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,248
<i>I should leave it
well enough alone,</i>

781
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,333
<i>before I go and fuck it all up.</i>

782
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,421
You there?

783
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,677
Neuman's a Supe.

784
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,178
She's the head popper.

785
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:33,142
- Yeah, what?
- <i>Yeah, she's pretty much Stan Edgar's daughter, too.</i>

786
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,311
Past year of my life
has been a waste.

787
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:37,605
I thought we could fight Vought
the right way, but we can't.

788
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:38,815
It's all rigged.

789
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,234
<i>If we're gonna take them down,</i>

790
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,820
we have to do whatever it takes.

791
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,530
We have to do it your way.

792
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,618
<i>Butcher, you there?</i>

793
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,033
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

794
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,285
Get your ass off of my car.

795
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,496
Why you protecting Soldier Boy?

796
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,374
If he'd have slipped me
a length, I wouldn't hesitate.

797
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,293
I'd throw him
to the fucking dogs.

798
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,515
Oh, shit.

799
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,947
Okay, okay.

800
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,034
Please.

801
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:57,161
Soldier Boy used to slap me
around a little bit, all right?

802
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:59,455
It was just hazing
that went too far, all right?

803
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:01,457
- That's it.
- What fucking happened to him?

804
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:04,502
He didn't die in an accident,
all right?

805
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,755
The whole nuclear meltdown
thing, it was just bullshit.

806
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,007
I fucking know that.
What killed him?

807
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,843
I don't know.

808
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,554
I-I don't know!
I don't fucking know!

809
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,640
All right? We were in Nicaragua,

810
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:20,143
in fucking '84,
but I didn't see it happen.

811
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,895
- Well, you must have seen something.
- I didn't see shit.

812
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,022
Fuck, I was just a kid.

813
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:28,401
Ask the others.
Ask the fucking CIA.

814
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,194
- CIA?
- Yeah.

815
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:34,407
Yeah. We were
working with the CIA.

816
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,159
Who was the case officer?

817
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,911
Grace.

818
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:40,997
Grace... Grace Mallory.

819
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,374
All right? Fuck.

820
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:50,089
Look, please.

821
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,716
Please, look...

822
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,885
Look, I told you
everything I know.

823
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,179
All right? Please, just-just...

824
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,890
I know you did.

825
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,726
But it don't change
what you are.

826
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,023
Yeah.

827
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,401
- What the fuck is he wearing?
<i>- Yeah!</i>

828
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,862
What the fuck is he wearing?

829
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:38,823
Yeah, all right. Let's hear it
for Supersonic, everybody.

830
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,157
Get me fucking wardrobe.

831
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,578
Get me fucking wardrobe
so I can fucking choke them out!

832
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:47,331
All right, so now, I would like
to bring out our cocaptains.

833
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:49,208
So let's give it up
for Starlight

834
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:53,004
and the man of the hour
himself, Homelander!

835
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,510
- Happy birthday, Homelander.
- Hey, thank you.

836
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:03,180
- Yeah.
- I can see your girdle, you disgusting fat fuck.

837
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,892
Get off
the fucking stage.

838
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:15,151
Wow, I'm so honored
to be with you guys tonight

839
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:20,364
to celebrate my dear friend
and mentor Homelander.

840
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:23,576
I'm here to do more than wish
you a happy birthday, though.

841
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,078
I'm thrilled to be announcing

842
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:29,832
a project that is near
and dear to my heart.

843
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,543
The Starlight House
is a nonprofit foundation

844
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:36,172
dedicated to helping
homeless and at-risk youth.

845
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,758
Hey, Homelander! Your Nazi died!

846
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,677
Did he just say his Nazi died?

847
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,845
Let's go.

848
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,480
Homelander...

849
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:55,816
He's just, he's a human.

850
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,568
He's just like the rest of us.

851
00:53:57,652 --> 00:54:00,821
And we all make mistakes, right?

852
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:04,742
But we all deserve
second chances.

853
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:09,080
In that spirit,
Homelander has agreed

854
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:13,584
to donate $10 million...

855
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:16,671
- to the Starlight House, which is, I mean...
- No.

856
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,214
- Give... Come on. Give it up.
- No.

857
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,966
- Give it up for this guy.
- No. No. -

858
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:21,425
No.

859
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:26,222
Starlight lied to you just now.
She did.

860
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,890
I don't make mistakes.

861
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:30,393
I'm not "just like
the rest of you."

862
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,270
I'm stronger. I'm smarter.

863
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:36,482
I'm better. I am better.

864
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,776
I'm not some weak-kneed
fucking crybaby

865
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,237
that goes around fucking
apologizing all the time.

866
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,239
And why the fuck
would you want me to be?

867
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,992
Go to fucking commercial, Roger.
Go to fucking commercial.

868
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:48,327
Don't you dare
stop rolling, Roger!

869
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,748
All my life, people
have tried to control me.

870
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,500
<i>My whole life.</i>

871
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,919
<i>Rich people, powerful people</i>

872
00:54:57,003 --> 00:54:59,255
<i>have tried to muzzle me,
cancel me,</i>

873
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:03,300
<i>keep me impotent and obedient,
like I'm a fucking puppet.</i>

874
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,885
<i>You know what? It worked.</i>

875
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,179
<i>Because I allowed it to work.</i>

876
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,849
<i>And guess what.
If they can control me,</i>

877
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,934
then you can bet your ass
they can control you.

878
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:14,228
They already do.
You just don't realize it.

879
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,690
I'm done.

880
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,734
I am done apologizing.

881
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,653
I am done being persecuted
for my strength.

882
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:25,740
You people should be
thanking Christ

883
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:29,702
that I am who and what I am,
because you need me.

884
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:32,163
You need me to save you.

885
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,248
You do.

886
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,546
I am the only one
who possibly can.

887
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,675
You're not the real heroes.

888
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,679
I'm the real hero.

889
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,227
I'm the real hero.

890
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,156
