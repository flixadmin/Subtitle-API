00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,302
Uh, sales and installation.

[Translucent groans] Oh, what the fuck?

162
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:18,976
Where am I?

163
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,603
Oi. Morning, sunshine.

164
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,689
- You know who I am?
- Not sure.

165
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,316
I know so many invisible assholes.

Ooh, mind them bars, son.

170
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,661
You'll only bollocks yourself again.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Uh, okay, what do you guys want? Money?

173
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,501
We don't want your fucking money.

174
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,300
What do you think, Frenchie?

175
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,762
You just dropped the Moby fucking Dick
of problems on my plate.

176
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,054
That's what I think.

177
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,183
Okay?

178
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,603
He can re-order his carbon
on his skin into metamaterial.

It's nearly impossible to penetrate.

BUTCHER:
All right, how about we suffocate him?

181
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,946
FRENCHIE: Some Dominicans already tried this,
way back, '07.

182
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,573
BUTCHER:
And what happened?

183
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,160
FRENCHIE: They're all fucking dead.
That's what happened.

184
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,538
BUTCHER: All right, then, fuck it, electrocution.
We'll just increase the amps.

185
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,833
FRENCHIE: You already hit him with enough
to drop a water buffalo, and look.

186
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,586
Might knock him out.
Doesn't seem to kill him, huh? No.

187
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,379
We need to pierce the skin somehow.

188
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,924
BUTCHER:
Well, how the hell are we gonna do that?

189
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,926
FRENCHIE:
I don't know.

190
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,385
You're gonna kill him?

191
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,347
[Butcher scoffs]

192
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,433
We didn't bring him here for a fucking Happy Meal.

193
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,020
I don't... I thought we'd
question him or something.

194
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,439
I don't know,
you get a hold of someone this big...

195
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:51,735
At Gitmo, we had to water board
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times

196
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,364
over six months to get him to talk just once.

197
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,907
Now, we ain't got six months.

198
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,369
I doubt we've even got six hours.

199
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,915
There are so many crazy things
about what you just said,

200
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,876
but right now,
you're talking about randomly killing

201
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,505
one of the most famous men on the planet.

202
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,382
A goddamn national treasure.

203
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:17,761
I mean... people tend to notice that kind of thing.

204
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:23,141
And if we let him go...
what do you think the Seven will do to us?

205
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,727
- Hmm?
- [sighs]

- Oh, yeah.

Yeah. I've just been pumping for 30 minutes,

Come on, now.

230
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:37,382
Personally, I think it's amazing
that a woman your age can have a baby, period.

231
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,718
That is so sweet of you to say.

232
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,847
Oh, no problem.
Hey, you found Translucent yet?

233
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,892
- You heard about that?
- Mm-hmm.

No, not yet.

235
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,397
Well, you know, I could search for him.
Personally.

236
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,650
That's not necessary.

237
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,026
Right.

00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,031
Hey, did you hear about the mayor of Baltimore?

239
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,453
Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,998
Heard his plane went down.
Some sort of engine trouble.

241
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,625
Yeah, it's awful.

242
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,668
I saw him on Tuesday.

243
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,336
I had a meeting with him right here.

244
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,629
Wow.

00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,674
Well, hug your kids, right?

246
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,134
Because you never know
what might happen.

00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,219
- So true.
- Mm.

You know what's interesting?

249
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,599
The Deep told me, and only me,

250
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:32,896
that there were, uh, scorch marks
on the mayor's engine.

251
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,693
Almost as if from two small,
high-intensity beams,

252
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,820
roughly the width of human eyes.

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,634
Madelyn, I heard him through the wall of this...

258
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,136
He was blackmailing you.

259
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,346
I am the last person you need to save.

260
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,806
Yeah, but I did it for you.

261
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,184
I know, but did the timing occur to you?

262
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:15,439
I have half the Senate Appropriations Committee
coming tonight.

How did he even know about Compound V?

265
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,000
We are not going to talk about that.

266
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,501
Oh, come on, Madelyn.

267
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,171
You do not need to hide things from me.

268
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:43,258
I love Vought as much as you do,
and I can do more.

269
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,384
You can do more?

270
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,637
You've already grossed $12.3 billion for us.

271
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,265
Right. So the pricks on 82
can take all the fucking credit?

272
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,560
Empty fucking suits with Cornell degrees?
Come on.

Who knows what's good for this company.

276
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,115
I know. I hear you. I do.

277
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,076
But what I need right now,

278
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,080
is I need you to charm the shit
out of those congressmen.

279
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,833
Right.

280
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,045
Because that's all I'm good for, huh?

281

No. No.

284
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,850
You just need to let me protect you.

285
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,230
- Oh, you're gonna protect me?
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,611
Gods are pure...

287
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,198
and they're perfect...

288
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,575
and they're above it all.

289
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,120
And they need to stay that way.

290
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,590
Huh...

291
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,469
You're leaking.

- Hi, Dad.

299
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,345
Hughie, where have you been?
I've been calling hospitals.

300
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,263
I'm fine.

301
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,891

some wacko drove into Gary's store,</i>

<i>I thought maybe you've been hurt,
or kidnapped.</i>

304
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,147
I saw this <i>Dateline</i> on human trafficking...

Dad, I haven't been human trafficked, okay?

306
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,611
I closed up early.
It must have happened after I left.

<i>But where'd you go?</i>

308
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,157
Just been drinking at Anthony's.

309
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,202
- Blowing off steam.
- No. Now, I called Anthony, all right?

310
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,579
I called everybody.
No one's seen you. Don't lie to me.

311
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,207
Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain.

Hey, Dad, listen, I got to, I got to go.

313

Just, listen, I know you've been taking
Robin's accident real hard.

So, um, I'll just leave you to it.

323
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:29,109
Well, we're having a meeting right now,
aren't we, Deep?

324
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,152
You and me.

325
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,781
- Come on in.
- Yeah. Sure.

326
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,969
So, uh, what, uh...?

327
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,806
Or is there... Is there anything I can...
I can do for you, Homelander?

328
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,518
Well, yeah. I guess, uh...

[sighs]

330
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,357
Well, you can help me
understand something, Deep, because, uh...

331
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:14,279
[chuckles] I don't know, maybe I'm stupid.
Am I stupid, Deep?

332
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,323
What? No. [scoffs]

333
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,868
No. You're not stupid. [chuckles]

334
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,038
You're smart. Very smart, right?

335
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,664
Yeah. Okay.

336
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:29,294
So, what possible reason...

337
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:33,840
what, uh, razor-sharp fish instinct...

338

made you run to Stillwell

339
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,262
and tell her what you thought
you saw down there?

340
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,932
All right, look, I thought... I thought I... I was, uh...

341
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,186
I don't even know... I don't know what I saw
down there, as a matter of fact.

342
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,313
It was, it was really dark and, uh, muddy...

343
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,023
The water was really muddy.

344
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,068
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

345
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,945
I didn't...

346
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,574
I didn't really see anything down there,

And I trust we never have
to have this conversation again.

353
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:21,346
No. Of course not. Just this once.

- or there's some kind of interference...
