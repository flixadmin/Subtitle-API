1
00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:07,365
You've both met bad men before.
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

2
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:08,925
Michael Gray.

3
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:12,045
You lost all your cousin's money
in America playing the fool.

4
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:17,125
And poor old Arthur Shelby
is afraid his wife will never return.

5
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:24,445
There's a bullet,
and on it is carved the name McCavern.

6
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:29,005
It's war you want,

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,965
it's war you shall have.

8
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,685
I've been talking to the Friends.

9
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,485
One of the Friends is a man.

10
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:37,085
He would die without his eyes.

11
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:39,885
These hands belong to the devil!

12
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,725
By the time
that baby draws its first breath,

13
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,085
you and I will be done.

14
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:46,405
You will be king.

15
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:14,965
Happy or sad, Tommy?

16
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:42,285
Mr Shelby.

17
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:48,565
My bullets ache
to get inside your tinker head.

18
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,525
♪ Up to our knees in Fenian blood

19
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:56,125
♪ Surrender or you'll die

20
00:01:56,245 --> 00:02:00,205
♪ We are the Brigton Derry Billy Boys. ♪

21
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:37,165
You know, it's a pity.

22
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:38,965
I was looking forward to killing you.

23
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:43,245
You're at the back of a long queue.

24
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,925
My white flag is a flag of truce.

25
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,045
Yours is more a flag of surrender.

26
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,485
Whatever you say, Mr McCavern,
the colour is the same.

27
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:55,765
The outcome is the same.

28
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:59,125
I believe we've friends in common.

29
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,685
We should postpone our war.

30
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,205
Your brother left me a hand grenade.

31
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:04,645
He sends his apologies.

32
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,725
You left me land mines.

33
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,645
For which I too apologise.

34
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:12,685
Then peace it is.

35
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:16,165
Your message said you wanted
to seal our truce with some business.

36
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:21,005
Since we're men of similar interests
and distribution networks,

37
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,685
I thought we might use
our temporary settlement

38
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,805
for our mutual benefit.

39
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:28,885
You stand in a yard full of scrap metal
and stolen goods,

40
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:30,445
and you talk like a politician.

41
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:33,965
No, nothing here is stolen, Mr McCavern.

42
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:36,485
Charlie simply finds things
before they're lost.

43
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:42,205
The nature of the deal
is explained in my proposal.

44
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:45,925
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

45
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:49,165
If you need anything in this city,
just mention my name.

46
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,165
So you want to impress me, Mr Shelby?

47
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:54,765
Isiah.

48
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:02,645
Also in the envelope is a cheque
for £500.

49
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:06,485
For your wife.
She can use it to buy a black dress,

50
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:09,445
rent a black horse with black feathers

51
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,565
to pull a black carriage
with your body in it,

52
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,565
should you break the terms
of the white flag.

53
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:20,925
Now, please, enjoy the city
it's my honour to represent.

54
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,605
This week I've managed
to get to the people

55
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:49,685
at York and Lincoln City.
I mean, they're the teams that are losing.

56
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:50,805
I got to them.

57
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,245
Right, go on. Go on, take your time.

58
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,365
Mm.

59
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,565
I got to the goalkeepers,
they all said £5 is enough.

60
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:00,685
I, erm...

61
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:06,925
I've written to the people
at Tranmere Rovers

62
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:09,765
because the phone you put
into my... into my house stopped working.

63
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:11,605
So I'm gonna need
another one of those.

64
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:12,885
OK.

65
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:17,205
Once we've got that fixed,
hey, then we'll have all the names

66
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:21,965
and numbers
of the First Division referees.

67
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:23,125
The First?

68
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:24,285
Yeah.

69
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:27,565
Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit.

70
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:29,365
Come on, come on. Come on.

71
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:32,245
Listen, listen to me. Come on now.

72
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,005
No need for that. Hm?

73
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,285
Yeah.

74
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,925
We need you to find out
what they like.

75
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:40,085
You know, what gets them going.

76
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:44,565
Cos a lot of them are comfortable.
A fiver's nothing to them.

77
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:46,925
We need you to find out
what they really like playing.

78
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,245
Yes.

79
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,445
See, cos we can offer them that.

80
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:52,165
Oh, yeah. Shelby Company Limited,

81
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:56,325
we can offer them
all the lovely things people like.

82
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:57,525
Hm?

83
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:03,845
We can also offer 'em protection
from the things they don't like.

84
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,605
You ever touch my family...

85
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:09,085
...ever...

86
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,325
York.

87
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:15,645
Lincoln.

88
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,045
- Lincoln?
- Hm.

89
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:21,325
Tranmere Rovers.

90
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:22,765
Hm?

91
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:24,365
Mm-hm.

92
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,445
- Bye, Finn.
- Goodbye, brother.

93
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:32,165
Shit.

94
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:54,005
It's all right, Mrs Connors.
You can carry on. It's just my brother.

95
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:59,205
So tell me how it happened?

96
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,445
They were sleeping downstairs.

97
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:05,165
And then my husband came home...

98
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:08,165
...drunk from the Marquis,
even though he just lost his job.

99
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:09,605
We don't have any money.

100
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,805
Anyway, he came to bed.

101
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,885
But downstairs,
they must have heard a noise.

102
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,045
They woke up.

103
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:20,005
They started, er, calling out.

104
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:22,845
They woke my husband up, and...

105
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,285
...when he's drunk, you don't wake him up.

106
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:29,925
What happened then, Mrs Connors?

107
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,045
He, erm...

108
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:34,885
He...

109
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,405
He went downstairs.

110
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:39,965
He killed them.

111
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,565
Strangled them. All three of them.

112
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:52,885
And you've, erm... You've... you've brought
their bodies here today with you.

113
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,045
Proof, Mr Shelby.

114
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:12,005
Their singing was the only pretty thing
in my life.

115
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:16,565
I don't care my husband beats me...

116
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,525
...but not this.

117
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:23,165
Mrs Connors.

118
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:24,365
We have your address.

119
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:27,845
We will speak to your husband.

120
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,765
My brother here

121
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,925
will go to the Bull Ring market today,

122
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,485
and buy you three new goldfinches,

123
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:36,685
and have them delivered
to your door.

124
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,245
The same colours
and, you know, feathers.

125
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:43,445
The new ones I will call
Thomas, Arthur and Finn.

126
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:46,485
That'll make him pause,

127
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:48,325
even when he's drunk.

128
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:50,805
Good day, Mr Shelby.

129
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:53,405
You take care, Mrs Connors.

130
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,645
Bye.

131
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,525
I don't know how you do this, Tom.
I really don't!

132
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:04,765
You learn things, Arthur.

133
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:09,725
That woman
has only two rooms downstairs.

134
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:13,565
Her husband has lost his job
and he beats her.

135
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:16,045
And yet, the thing that brings her

136
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:20,005
to see her Member of Parliament
is songbirds.

137
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:23,965
Now, that's politics, Arthur.

138
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,805
It's not for me.

139
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:27,005
Anyway, look.

140
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,565
That list of losers.

141
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,405
How much have we made
on the football?

142
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:33,965
Ten grand this week.
Finn showing promise, Tom.

143
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:35,765
Maybe we should put him
on the tracks.

144
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:37,885
Just a thought.

145
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,245
- Finn.
- Yeah.

146
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:44,325
- Your lunchtime delivery.
- Bring her in.

147
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:54,685
Tommy, the next fella
wants to see both of you.

148
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:59,045
- Do you know his face?
- No. He's Chinese.

149
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:02,205
Chinese in our pub?

150
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,005
Tom...

151
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:09,525
All right.

152
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,445
Slowly, Micky, let him in.

153
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:21,445
Three little birds, eh,
Tommy, Finn and Arthur.

154
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:28,845
Mr Thomas.

155
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,525
Mr Arthur.

156
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,965
My name is Brilliant Chang.

157
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,245
Brilliant Chang is dead.

158
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:50,685
Perhaps.

159
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,845
Sometimes I wonder,

160
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:56,085
"Is this heaven?"

161
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,565
Doesn't smell like heaven...

162
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:04,325
...so I would say I have survived.

163
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,685
- What happened to Maggie?
- You don't like me?

164
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:14,125
I like everything.

165
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:21,445
I like fucking everything.

166
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:31,085
You should answer the phone, Mr Shelby.

167
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:36,565
Micky, bring that phone here now.

168
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,245
Hello?

169
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,165
<i>Arthur! Arthur!</i>

170
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:48,045
I sent a woman with a gun
to your youngest brother's office.

171
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,645
All right, Finn.

172
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:50,965
<i>Right, right.</i>

173
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55,405
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

174
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,925
Do you want to die again, Chang? Huh?

175
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:05,205
Good.

176
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,205
The guns are pointed.

177
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,765
Now we are all concentrating.

178
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,685
The moment is now pure.

179
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,045
Purity is not necessary.

180
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:16,765
Displays are not necessary.

181
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:22,405
They said, "Tommy Shelby.
That door will need some kicking down."

182
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:26,965
When you walked through that door,
it was open.

183
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:30,845
You don't need to do anything
to get my attention.

184
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:33,725
Now, what exactly do you want?

185
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:41,845
Do you have a match, Mr Shelby?

186
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:49,165
Anything happens to my brother, Chang...

187
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,925
...you die.

188
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:08,485
If you die here today,
we'll bury you face down with no hands.

189
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:12,645
- You'll go straight to hell.
- I don't care about rituals.

190
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,805
I am a rationalist, Mr Shelby.

191
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,125
Well, tell your friend on the phone

192
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:21,325
to put her gun down
and we can all have a talk.

193
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:29,805
Hold your fire, brother!

194
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,645
Hold your fire!

195
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:36,965
I'm all right.

196
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,645
She fired into the ceiling.

197
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:40,645
Finn's all right.

198
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:42,045
Finn's OK.

199
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:52,285
Give me your order! Mm.

200
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:53,925
Give me your order, Tommy!

201
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:55,085
Yes or no.

202
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:56,365
At ease.

203
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,885
I said at ease.

204
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:20,045
May I take something
from my pocket, Mr Shelby?

205
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,285
And it's the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

206
00:14:57,405 --> 00:15:01,205
No salt, no flour, no lies.

207
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,525
Pure truth.

208
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,965
Came off a ship called the <i>Capital,</i>

209
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,725
out of Shanghai.

210
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,685
Docked at Poplar a week ago.

211
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,765
The stevedores
were held at gunpoint,

212
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:17,885
Chinese unloaded the cargo
by the light of lanterns.

213
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:24,125
A foreman at the dock estimated there was
seven tonnes of the stuff.

214
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:27,245
I made a note at the time.

215
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:32,725
I spoke to that particular foreman

216
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,085
and I worked out that

217
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:39,005
seven tonnes of pure opium crystals
would be worth...

218
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:46,485
...approximately, £1,190,000

219
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:48,325
on international markets.

220
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,965
The big crash. Hm?

221
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,085
Wall Street.

222
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:00,925
Now we all keep our ears open
for opportunities.

223
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:09,165
- What the fuck is going on?
- What are you playing at?

224
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:13,365
Finn, we are conducting
a piece of business.

225
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,365
She had a gun to my fucking head!

226
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:18,485
But your trousers are dry.

227
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:19,765
You didn't piss yourself.

228
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:21,925
- He didn't piss himself, Arthur.
- Well done, Finn.

229
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:25,485
You had a dispute with a lady
and you didn't piss yourself.

230
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:28,205
And Arthur here tells me
we should put you on the tracks.

231
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:30,365
Gonna be a good day for you after all,
Finn.

232
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:31,765
Give me that!

233
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:33,045
Hey!

234
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:36,725
Always have your whores
searched at the door.

235
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:39,165
If I see that bitch on the street,
I'll fucking cut her.

236
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:41,485
Yeah, all right. All right, come on.

237
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:49,365
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

238
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,405
A gesture of goodwill.

239
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:05,645
I'll throw it in the canal.

240
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:11,885
Canals are the idea. Right, Chang?

241
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:41,781
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here,
but the location is part of the deal.

242
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:44,165
What fucking deal?

243
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:47,565
How does it feel
to be barefoot in the mud again, Pol?

244
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:50,805
It makes me feel young.
What fucking deal?

245
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,005
Four boats.

246
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,045
Four days.

247
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:56,565
Up the Grand Union from Poplar to here.

248
00:17:56,685 --> 00:18:01,325
Half the cargo is coal
and underneath the coal,

249
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:02,805
pure opium crystal.

250
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:05,005
Opium.

251
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,285
I vote against it.

252
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:08,805
They can't use trucks

253
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:11,485
because the Chinese drivers
get stopped by the police.

254
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:12,925
They need to get it out of London

255
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:15,445
because all the warehouses
are being searched by Customs.

256
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:18,885
The seven tonnes
is bound for San Francisco,

257
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,965
but the outward ship doesn't sail
for seven days from Liverpool.

258
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:23,645
They need somewhere safe to store it.

259
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:27,725
All we have to do is take it up the canal
and keep it here for a week.

260
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:31,325
We don't fuck with the Chinese, though,
Tom. Dad always said it.

261
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:35,085
Ask yourself, would he turn down £250,000

262
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:37,525
to drive four boats up the canal

263
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:39,565
with no prospect of inspection?

264
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,285
I vote against it, Tom. Hm.

265
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,365
- Mm-mm.
- Polly?

266
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:48,005
£250,000.

267
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,725
That's half of what Michael lost
in Chicago.

268
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:54,885
I will ask him to take charge
of this business.

269
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,565
Michael's position will be reinstated
in the company?

270
00:18:57,685 --> 00:19:00,485
His period of quarantine would be over.

271
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,325
Think about it, brother.

272
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,845
Four boats sailing up the cut,

273
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:12,325
smelling of wood smoke and bacon.

274
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:16,605
And which one
of Charlie's Gypsy didicoy friends

275
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:21,245
do you trust, Tom, eh,
with a cargo worth £1 million?

276
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:23,605
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.

277
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:24,725
Let's vote.

278
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:27,565
Those in favour.

279
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:42,605
Motion carried.
Arthur, tell Charlie we need four boats

280
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,365
and four tonnes of coal
before it gets dark.

281
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,925
They sail south tonight.

282
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:52,925
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring
and get them three songbirds, Arthur.

283
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:54,205
Yes, Tommy.

284
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,485
Fuck!

285
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:12,645
What have you heard, Pol?

286
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:17,165
The man you cut went to the police...

287
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,405
...but we dealt with it.

288
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,805
Is she with him?

289
00:20:26,445 --> 00:20:29,485
If she was, it would be your fault,
Arthur.

290
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:33,285
But they say his face is so badly cut
he's hard to look at.

291
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:35,765
So I would say not.

292
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:42,125
I would also say
it is time to give up on Linda,

293
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:47,925
find someone else
who might be able to put your fires out.

294
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,725
I can't, though, Pol.

295
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,045
I fucking can't!

296
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,205
And that's it.

297
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:13,725
That's it.

298
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:30,685
Whiskey?

299
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,045
Thank you, no.

300
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:46,885
For reasons I can't divulge,
I need to keep Jimmy McCavern alive.

301
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,925
I've already got a time and a place
for the killing.

302
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:52,205
You see?

303
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:56,965
A little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.

304
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:00,325
A girl called Karen who hates him,
who will give him up.

305
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:05,205
I have the sound of cranes and winches
to cover the gunshot.

306
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,925
I've got a Bentley to get me away.

307
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:09,885
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.

308
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:13,285
We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.

309
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:16,245
When that business is done,
he's all yours.

310
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:20,845
You can avenge the death of your son
in any way you see fit.

311
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,965
You mean when <i>you</i> say.

312
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:25,085
When you check
that little stopwatch you've got

313
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,165
that controls the turning of the Earth.

314
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:30,245
Yeah.

315
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:33,365
And then you will marry
and you will settle.

316
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,725
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?

317
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:40,365
Just let me understand you.

318
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,565
Do you mean
that Polly is part of this deal?

319
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,605
Yeah.

320
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:54,125
Well, Holy Lord God,
Tommy Shelby OBE,

321
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:56,565
does your vanity have no limits?

322
00:22:56,685 --> 00:22:58,845
I believe it is called the ego these days.

323
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:00,165
I read books.

324
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:03,805
You sit on your throne
and you instruct Polly Gray,

325
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,525
who is of far richer blood than you,

326
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:08,445
as to when she can
and when she can't marry.

327
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:10,845
Oh, no, she instructs herself.

328
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:13,005
She has her own strategies.

329
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,525
And we are of the same blood.

330
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:19,405
She will marry you, but only if you agree
to postpone any attack on McCavern

331
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,125
until this business is done.

332
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:25,725
So she is some young Gypsy bride
that's yours to give away.

333
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:29,685
Young she is,
when she's barefoot on the cobbles.

334
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:32,885
What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?
If it's gonna be done in the old way,

335
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:36,285
well, you know, you throw in
a few coloured ponies or...

336
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:38,485
I'm having an event at my house.

337
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:40,125
You are invited.

338
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:42,165
Polly will be there.

339
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:45,725
There will be candles and violins

340
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:47,165
and dancing.

341
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:50,525
Polly wants you to propose
in the proper way,

342
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,965
and then she will give you
her terms of acceptance.

343
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:56,445
Inviting you for this purpose
was Polly's idea.

344
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:05,885
- You can't read?
- I don't read.

345
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,805
- It's <i>Swan Lake.</i>
- Ballet?

346
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:09,125
Yeah.

347
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:11,365
Apparently, it's about love.

348
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:13,645
Polly says that, for now,

349
00:24:13,765 --> 00:24:15,725
love must defeat revenge.

350
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:41,165
...As a result of the greed and the excess

351
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:46,485
of a small number of bankers, financiers
and other feckless gamblers.

352
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:49,365
This comprehensive document,

353
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:53,245
pleading for Government intervention
in all areas of economic life,

354
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:56,445
represents not just socialism,

355
00:24:56,565 --> 00:25:00,405
but a new breed of National Socialism.

356
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:05,645
And I believe... I believe
that the leaders of my own party

357
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,845
have been very foolish to reject it.

358
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:55,525
How on earth did you get a ballet company
to come to your bloody house?

359
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:58,765
It's an independent dance company

360
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:02,205
dedicated to bringing ballet
to the people.

361
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:04,045
We share a philosophy.

362
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,325
I'm a patron.

363
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:09,565
I also gave them a lot of money.

364
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:11,925
Oh.

365
00:26:14,045 --> 00:26:15,685
And this date

366
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:17,645
is your wife's birthday.

367
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:19,965
Yeah.

368
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:23,605
The party is for her.

369
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,245
And she likes ballet, your wife?

370
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:36,605
Why wouldn't she?

371
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:39,445
It's just...

372
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,685
Well, you see,
I did some research into her.

373
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:45,445
Into her past.

374
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:48,645
If you want to buy her a gift,
she likes diamonds.

375
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,245
Now that we are going to be
conquering the world together,

376
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,725
we need to have no secrets.

377
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:01,285
We should know
each other's weaknesses.

378
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:06,045
Your wife has led an interesting life.

379
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:10,965
It may even be possible that,
as a younger man in Birmingham,

380
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:13,045
I came across her.

381
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:18,205
My friends and I would sometimes go
to nightclubs in the south of town.

382
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:23,325
Well, if you recognise her,
maybe you can talk about old times, eh?

383
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:28,525
Maybe, if we have met before,
your wife and I

384
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:30,685
could even renew our acquaintance.

385
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:34,925
I am invited to stay the night, yes?

386
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:40,365
I too have done some research,
Sir Oswald.

387
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,165
Yeah.

388
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:47,885
I researched your wife
and your wife's younger sister

389
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:51,165
and your wife's stepmother, Lady Curzon,

390
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:54,005
all of whom you are fucking.

391
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,885
If such things were to take place
on a narrow boat,

392
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:58,765
the Church would get involved.

393
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,005
But...

394
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:04,645
...it's not happening on a narrow boat.

395
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:11,365
No. It's taking place in your apartment,
in your country house,

396
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:16,805
sometimes even in your office
here in the House of Commons.

397
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:20,245
So no secrets. And, yes,

398
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,485
yes, you are invited to stay the night

399
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:26,205
with whichever member of your family
finds favour.

400
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:29,045
Now, if you don't mind,
I was about to leave,

401
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,485
I need to lock up my office.

402
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:43,765
Actually, I will come alone.

403
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:48,165
In society, you are judged
by your hospitality.

404
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:50,085
I will expect adventure.

405
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,885
Such rogues we are, aren't we?

406
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:07,045
Sing like songbirds in the House.

407
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:08,965
And then, afterwards,

408
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:12,325
relieve ourselves in the bodies
of whomever we choose.

409
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:18,845
Two men for whom forbidding is forbidden.

410
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:21,805
It should be quite the party.

411
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:07,125
You have to listen to the voices
that you hear.

412
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:08,845
Do what they tell you to do.

413
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,805
You don't even have to rub the lamp
any more to summon the genie.

414
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:18,925
It wasn't the blue stone, Tommy.

415
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:21,525
It was you.

416
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,125
It was you.

417
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:41,525
Who is it?

418
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,285
It's Tommy's car outside.

419
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:45,125
It's him. I'll get it.

420
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,445
What's happened?

421
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:56,765
Nothing's happened. I'm all right.

422
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:57,885
Come in.

423
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,445
Do you want a drink?

424
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:04,605
- No.
- No?

425
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:07,365
No. I have some information
for the intelligence officer...

426
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:10,925
...on conversations with Mosley.

427
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:14,485
He's planning to put forward proposals
for building works.

428
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:16,645
He, erm...

429
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:19,725
He wants the Communists to consider
his new party as fraternal,

430
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:23,325
which means his activities
are now part of your official remit? Yeah?

431
00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:26,285
Mr Shelby, it's 2am.
You can make your report any time.

432
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,965
- Why don't you stay tonight?
- No.

433
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:34,765
I'll leave you two to...

434
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:36,485
Yes, good night.

435
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:54,045
I stood on a bridge tonight, Ada.

436
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:56,325
And I looked down.

437
00:32:58,365 --> 00:32:59,925
And Grace was there...

438
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,685
...but she was still alive.

439
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:04,645
Tom, have you still been taking laudanum?

440
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:06,845
The fucking name of the barge
was the <i>January.</i>

441
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:10,685
Our dad's boat.

442
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:13,445
The boat I was born on.
We've never got nothing.

443
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:15,845
We've never got nothing.
And we never fucking will.

444
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:22,605
Dr Brooke said that you never arrived
for your appointment, Tom.

445
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:24,165
No.

446
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:26,965
There's nothing in his books
of any use to a man like me.

447
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,365
They talk about guilt.

448
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:29,845
Eh?

449
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:31,885
Guilt! What fucking guilt?

450
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:34,685
- The black barge.
- No. No, that's not it.

451
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,685
That's not it. He had it right.

452
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:40,925
Mosley had it right.
He said, "Forbidding is forbidden to us.

453
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:44,485
"We can do anything.
Nothing can stop us."

454
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,285
But there's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself.

455
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,045
And I keep finding myself there.

456
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:54,965
And only the <i>January</i> can get me away.

457
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:00,725
Will you at least try
the doctors again, Tom?

458
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:07,605
Well, then at least throw away your opium.

459
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:09,245
It's that that causes the visions.

460
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:11,005
Just... throw it away.

461
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,925
While it's there, it's a temptation.

462
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:15,485
How much have you got left?

463
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,045
Seven tonnes.

464
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:21,405
- Seven tonnes?
- Yeah.

465
00:34:26,885 --> 00:34:28,565
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.

466
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:41,525
You do me a favour?

467
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:49,245
When that kid of yours arrives,
keep it away from me.

468
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,885
A fucking ballet.

469
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,725
He wants to impress someone.

470
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:11,485
And I'm invited?

471
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:12,805
You and Gina.

472
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,645
Why?

473
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:20,725
Because he wants to give you
the chance to come back properly.

474
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:33,525
Coal haulage?

475
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:34,885
Yeah.

476
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:39,045
Tommy wants you to reopen those books
and become managing director.

477
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:43,605
So I've come back from Detroit
to become a coal man?

478
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:48,605
The first delivery
is bound for San Francisco,

479
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:50,165
but if it works...

480
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:53,925
...Tommy thinks he can find
distribution for it here.

481
00:35:56,285 --> 00:35:59,165
And this, erm, this coal...

482
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:02,245
- ...is it snow white?
- No.

483
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:04,885
Golden brown.

484
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,565
Fuck.

485
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:14,045
This is your opportunity, Michael.

486
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:17,485
There is more money in this
than there is

487
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:21,685
in all the other parts of our business
put together.

488
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:37,165
Tommy knows
what opium does to people.

489
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:39,765
Tommy knows
what whiskey does to people.

490
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:41,965
He got an OBE for selling it.

491
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:47,045
I'll speak to Gina.

492
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:49,925
You'll what?

493
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:52,525
I will consult my wife.

494
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,845
Your father ran this business
for a bit.

495
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,765
1901.

496
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,645
And he shipped coal. Real coal.

497
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:02,405
Just coal.

498
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:08,765
And his fingernails and his eyelids
and his ears were black with it.

499
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:11,485
And the merchants would offer them
one price

500
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,445
and then only pay half

501
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,365
because they could.

502
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:18,125
And that was wrong, Michael.

503
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:46,285
Run your hands through it,
get it under your skin...

504
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:51,405
...and then see if Gina will let you
lay a finger on her.

505
00:37:59,285 --> 00:38:03,365
I think golden brown
is more to her taste.

506
00:38:05,565 --> 00:38:08,725
Especially when you tell her
how much money you're going to earn.

507
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,965
Now we're in business together,
I should ask,

508
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:36,205
which foot do you kick the ball with,
Mr Shelby?

509
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:37,485
I have no religion.

510
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,245
Some nights I wish I had.

511
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,485
He's kin?

512
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:44,645
Yeah.

513
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,405
And the simple fellow?

514
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:51,165
He's a lot less simple
than you might at first think.

515
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:54,125
Do you trust them?

516
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:02,165
Right. So I take a boatload.

517
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:04,605
No.

518
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:08,445
Ten sacks to start with,
so you can test the market.

519
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:10,645
Then we'll deal in boatloads.

520
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,325
Cash payment on loading.

521
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:14,605
£10,000.

522
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,445
For that amount,
it'll have to be a cheque.

523
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,765
I don't take cheques.

524
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:24,725
It'll be a cheque.

525
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:29,525
I will take a cheque

526
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:31,885
if it's guaranteed
by our mutual friend in London,

527
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:33,005
Mr Mosley.

528
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:48,405
Well, who would've thought
I'd be doing business

529
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:51,405
with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?

530
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:57,005
Yeah, who'd have thought,
eh, Charlie?

531
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,605
Who would have thought it?

532
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:01,045
Aye, but you're OK.

533
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,645
Yeah, I'm only OK
until I'm not OK.

534
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:06,885
Then I'm really not.

535
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:11,485
Delivery in seven days.

536
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:15,005
Cheque guaranteed.

537
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:18,405
Won't your Chinese friends
expect the seven tonnes that leaves London

538
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:20,845
to still be seven tonnes
when it reaches Liverpool?

539
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:23,685
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.

540
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:27,525
Oh, you mean you're bold enough
to skim the Chinese?

541
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:33,125
You have some kind of death wish,
Mr Shelby?

542
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:54,125
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.

543
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:59,725
When you've unpacked,
there should be a girl laid on for you.

544
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:02,485
Mr Shelby is a socialist

545
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:05,005
and believes in equality of service
for all classes.

546
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:19,965
According to the invitation,
there'll be an interval at nine o'clock.

547
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:22,085
Say that you're feeling tired
and we'll leave.

548
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:27,725
Well, if you see a duke,
introduce me.

549
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:29,845
My God, at last!

550
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,885
Something you like about England.

551
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:37,725
Gina, I've been made an offer.

552
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,565
To come back into the company.

553
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:43,965
Michael, we agreed,

554
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,925
the baby will be born in New York.
Remember?

555
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:48,245
The job is haulage.

556
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:50,965
Supply. Transport.

557
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:53,965
Opium.

558
00:41:58,405 --> 00:42:00,805
- Tommy has made contact...
- Tommy!

559
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:04,525
Tommy has made contact
with Chinese suppliers

560
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:06,445
who have plantations in the Afghan hills.

561
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:09,165
Pure grade.

562
00:42:11,205 --> 00:42:14,205
We will take delivery
and ship it all over Europe.

563
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:16,965
You mean heroin?

564
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:20,045
Yes.

565
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:24,605
And how much would you make?

566
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:29,845
Conservative estimate,
three shipments a year from Shanghai,

567
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,485
seven tonnes each,

568
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:34,165
stand to make approximately
£1 million.

569
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,285
Per annum.

570
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:38,925
The company will make three.

571
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:45,525
We could go to New York
whenever we wanted.

572
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:48,085
On our own fucking plane.

573
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,565
- We always have to come back, right?
- Yes.

574
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:56,645
For £1 million a year, we do.

575
00:42:59,685 --> 00:43:02,245
What happens if you get caught?

576
00:43:02,365 --> 00:43:03,445
Tommy has friends.

577
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:08,405
If the ship gets stopped,
it'll be the Chinese who hang.

578
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:12,245
Think about it, Gina.

579
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,365
When we move into our house...

580
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:21,365
...our room for entertaining
will be twice this size.

581
00:43:25,325 --> 00:43:26,325
Will it now?

582
00:43:29,725 --> 00:43:31,845
The magazines say that

583
00:43:31,965 --> 00:43:35,165
it's all straight lines and simplicity
in the 1930s.

584
00:43:36,765 --> 00:43:37,805
Deco is dead.

585
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:44,165
We'll be able to afford
dukes and duchesses.

586
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,765
And maybe...

587
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:49,485
...maybe a princess or two.

588
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:53,925
And the painting on the wall
will be of you.

589
00:43:55,565 --> 00:43:58,245
Because Tommy Shelby will be gone

590
00:43:58,365 --> 00:44:01,125
and it will be Michael Gray
arranging the ballet.

591
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:04,725
Where will Tommy be?

592
00:44:06,965 --> 00:44:08,525
Where he wants to go to most.

593
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,965
Ah.

594
00:44:14,605 --> 00:44:15,605
There.

595
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:18,845
A lord.

596
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:22,005
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.

597
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:30,045
Where the fuck is Tommy anyway?

598
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:47,085
Tommy...

599
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:49,565
My house.

600
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:52,005
My wife.

601
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,285
Let 'em wait.

602
00:44:58,125 --> 00:44:59,125
Sir Oswald.

603
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:04,245
Do I not get announced?

604
00:45:04,365 --> 00:45:05,805
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you

605
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:09,085
that he's busy
with the catering preparations

606
00:45:09,205 --> 00:45:11,045
and will be joining you shortly.

607
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:15,045
In the meantime,
and while you're waiting,

608
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:18,285
we have opium, cocaine and brandy.

609
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:23,445
I don't use opium or cocaine,

610
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:26,205
and brandy is for after dinner,
not before.

611
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:31,445
I also have a list of options
for the end of the evening.

612
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:35,045
You'll notice that
the maids wear name tags.

613
00:45:36,365 --> 00:45:38,005
We hired them specially...

614
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:42,045
...for those guests staying the night.

615
00:45:42,165 --> 00:45:46,445
All things are available
except the ballerinas.

616
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,045
And who, might I ask, are you?

617
00:45:53,165 --> 00:45:55,685
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.

618
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,445
And I too am unavailable.

619
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:10,365
Lizzie.

620
00:46:10,485 --> 00:46:13,765
There's something I didn't tell you
about this evening.

621
00:46:13,885 --> 00:46:15,605
Something about our guest.

622
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:17,125
Mosley.

623
00:46:19,925 --> 00:46:21,685
It's possible that...

624
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:23,605
...that you've met him before.

625
00:46:23,725 --> 00:46:24,725
Before when?

626
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:29,445
Before you became who you are.

627
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:34,405
Would you even remember him?

628
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,325
Would he remember you?

629
00:46:38,605 --> 00:46:41,565
All I remember is,
I drank too much champagne.

630
00:46:41,685 --> 00:46:43,205
I wasn't taking cash.

631
00:46:46,605 --> 00:46:47,605
Lizzie...

632
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,125
There's a pile of bodies...

633
00:46:53,285 --> 00:46:54,485
...floating by.

634
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:56,685
Let 'em go, Lizzie.

635
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,765
Let 'em go.

636
00:47:03,805 --> 00:47:05,725
So that's why you brought me
in here.

637
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:07,525
To lay your claim.

638
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:10,485
Yeah.

639
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:16,365
Well, it's a start, I suppose.

640
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:24,645
He lays a fucking hand on you,
he will be meat for Johnny Dogs.

641
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:30,845
You were indisposed when I arrived.

642
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:43,405
In society, you greet a guest,
you don't leave them hanging...

643
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:45,685
...looking around like a fucking dog.

644
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:49,885
Before we join
the others, I have some business.

645
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:51,285
I need a signature.

646
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:54,845
By the way,
your brandy before dinner thing amuses me,

647
00:47:54,965 --> 00:47:57,605
but none of the maids are of interest.

648
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:59,885
And I despise the use of drugs.

649
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:03,965
Your strategies are very transparent.

650
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:08,365
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern,

651
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,845
your acquaintance from the north.

652
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:13,005
I have no idea who you mean.

653
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:15,445
I don't trust him.
He wants to pay by cheque.

654
00:48:15,565 --> 00:48:18,965
I need your signature
as a guarantor on the transaction

655
00:48:19,085 --> 00:48:20,845
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

656
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,885
The sum is £10,000.

657
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:25,085
And what is it he's buying from you?

658
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:26,285
A gin distillery.

659
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:28,325
He's buying my old one.
I'm buying a new one.

660
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:30,645
Hmm.

661
00:48:34,165 --> 00:48:35,845
So not only is the truce holding,

662
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:38,445
but you two
are actually doing business.

663
00:48:38,565 --> 00:48:41,165
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.

664
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,085
If I sign a cheque guarantee
for this man,

665
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:48,845
it is proof of a connection
between me and him.

666
00:48:48,965 --> 00:48:51,205
Something you could later use
against me.

667
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:55,605
Why would I want to move against you?

668
00:49:12,245 --> 00:49:14,325
You're curious about my weaknesses.

669
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:19,565
And you've learned it's not cocaine,

670
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:21,405
not maids.

671
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:35,525
But now you will learn my weakness
is a tendency to trust people.

672
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:37,045
Do you have a pen?

673
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,125
Mr Shelby.

674
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:58,205
I know you have no classical education,

675
00:49:58,325 --> 00:50:01,405
but just realised you are
the perfect balance between the gods

676
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:03,485
Dionysus and Apollo.

677
00:50:03,605 --> 00:50:07,765
Irrational frenzy
controlled by reason and self reflection.

678
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:13,725
Do you know the work
of Friedrich Nietzsche?

679
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,685
- No.
- Freud?

680
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,125
Yes.

681
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:18,725
Ah.

682
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:24,885
There.

683
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:27,245
Your guarantee of trust.

684
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:32,285
Now perhaps you would introduce me
to your wonderful wife.

685
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:39,085
So, did you know?

686
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:40,885
What?

687
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,245
Oh, that tonight's special guest
might have fucked you

688
00:50:43,365 --> 00:50:45,445
when you were a nightclub hostess?

689
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:46,565
Yeah.

690
00:50:48,365 --> 00:50:51,045
Lizzie, if we were to strike
from our guest lists

691
00:50:51,165 --> 00:50:53,605
every man in Birmingham who you...

692
00:50:56,245 --> 00:50:58,165
- Yes or no?
- Fucking yes.

693
00:50:58,285 --> 00:50:59,285
Shit.

694
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:06,685
Sir Oswald,
this is my wife Elizabeth.

695
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:08,685
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.

696
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:12,685
Since we all appear to know,

697
00:51:12,805 --> 00:51:15,045
and since knowledge is permission,

698
00:51:15,165 --> 00:51:19,245
I'm sure, Mr Shelby, in the spirit
of our honest relationship,

699
00:51:19,365 --> 00:51:21,045
you won't mind me saying

700
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:23,885
it was a bottle of Champagne
and an evening well spent.

701
00:51:26,005 --> 00:51:28,765
Actually, it was an evening wasted.

702
00:51:30,325 --> 00:51:33,005
For the Champagne
and brandy you bought me,

703
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:37,445
as I recall, it was the booze that put you
to sleep a little prematurely.

704
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:42,365
Ladies and gentlemen,
the dance is about to begin.

705
00:51:46,885 --> 00:51:48,805
Mr Mosley!

706
00:51:48,925 --> 00:51:51,125
A toast, if I may.

707
00:51:51,245 --> 00:51:53,765
To the end of our deal,

708
00:51:53,885 --> 00:51:56,285
and the beginning of something more.

709
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,205
Happy Birthday, Lizzie.

710
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:03,725
This way.

711
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:35,125
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen,

712
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,885
will you marry me,

713
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,405
a poor commoner who loves you?

714
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:40,405
Let's fuck before the swan dies.

715
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:13,965
I heard there was a family occasion.

716
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:20,365
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.

717
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,965
That animal inside me,

718
00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:25,645
it comes out and I can't stop it.

719
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,325
Fuck, Linda.

720
00:55:29,445 --> 00:55:31,165
Without you, I c...

721
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:33,285
Come inside, please.

722
00:55:35,245 --> 00:55:37,005
His name was Frederick.

723
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,445
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

724
00:55:39,565 --> 00:55:40,885
He just listened.

725
00:55:42,565 --> 00:55:44,605
And now he has no face.

726
00:55:52,645 --> 00:55:56,125
He's as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

727
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:06,965
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

728
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,605
...in fucking hell.

729
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:23,845
Arthur...
