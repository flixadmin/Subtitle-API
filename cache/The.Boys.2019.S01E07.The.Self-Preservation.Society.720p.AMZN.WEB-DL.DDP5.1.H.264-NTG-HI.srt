- Yeah.
- Your brilliant wife here

it was you up there,

- Bit deceptive, isn't it?

Uh, no, Billy, that's what we do

I-It... you're right.

It's a little dishonest,

it comes to that kind of stuff,

53

- You promised to behave.

00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,733
Your heart is getting bigger,
balls are getting smaller,

164
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,479
your bone density's for shit.

165
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,401
That Compound V shit
is killing you.

166
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,959
Hey. Don't even say it out loud,
all right?

167
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,294
You don't know shit about it,
you understand?

168
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,318
I don't want to know.

169
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,491
And you're done, okay?
No more fucking around.

170
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,531
Did you see my last time
out there?

171
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,405
Sioux City's got a fucking
faster runner than me.

172
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,963
Then no more club openings
and commercial shoots.

173
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,617
Okay? None of that shit.
We train.

174
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,035
Back to the basics.

175
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,963
Nobody gets it back at my age.

176
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,513
I'm gonna be a freak show
like Ben Johnson,

177
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,378
racing against horses.

178
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,595
At least you'll still
be breathing.

179
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,636
(phone chimes)

180
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,229
(sighs):
Shit.

181
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,477
- I got to go.
- Where?

182
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,191
(sighs)

183
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,410
- What's going on?
- I missed you guys.

184
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,908
Just wanted to see
your smiling faces.

185
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,661
- (claps shoulder)
- Take a seat, buddy.

186
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:10,002
And, truth be known,
I felt like we were overdue

187
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,585
a little heart-to-heart.

188
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,841
A rap session,
maybe a little tough love.

189
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,144
(scoffs)
What's that supposed to mean?

190
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,968
(Homelander sighs)

191
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,733
It means that lately,
some of you

192
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,597
have been, eh,
a little out of sorts.

193
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,979
Erratic.

194
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,074
Unreliable.

195
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,030
Downright sloppy.

196
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,032
Not you, Noir.
You've been great.

197
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,584
But the rest of you...

198
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,788
(clicking tongue)

199
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:48,919
It is fair to say
that I am disappointed.

200
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,089
Got to keep your eye
on the ball, guys.

201
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,419
The enemies
are storming the gates.

202
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,684
I mean, we're not even The Seven
anymore, we're down to five.

203
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,178
We're dropping
like fucking flies,

204
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,561
but at least now I know why.

205
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,728
Uh...

206
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,941
Why...

207
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,073
Is this a joke?
Why is Hughie up there?

208
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,700
I don't understand.
Who is this guy?

209
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,156
This guy is Hugh Campbell.

210
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,487
He and Starlight
are going steady.

211
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:26,754
He's also one of the guys
who killed Translucent.

212
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,498
Wait, what?

213
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,000
HOMELANDER:
As well as blackmailing

214
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,961
Mesmer, Ezekiel, Popclaw

215
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,674
- and God knows who else.
- Popclaw?

216
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:39,094
No. No, no, no.
You... That-that is insane.

217
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,684
Starlight, sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

218
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,221
- but words...
- No, sir.

219
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,595
I'm sorry. I wasn't...

220
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,523
It's just, he's not...

221
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,480
I mean, why would he do that?

222
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,193
Good question.
A-Train, over to you.

223
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,204
- What?
- HOMELANDER: Oh, boy.

224
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:03,067
That little egg of yours
is still scrambled, huh?

225
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,623
How about now?

226
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,501
Oh, shit.

227
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,499
I know this guy.

228
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,144
HOMELANDER: You did smash
through his girlfriend,

229
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,538
so I should hope so.

230
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,796
Robin s-something or other.

231
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,759
I-I remember now, I-I've seen
him outside of Popclaw's place.

232
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,012
He was all in my face.

233
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,136
- You're fucking this guy?
- S... Okay, slow down.

234
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,024
I don't know what's going on,

235
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,941
but Hughie is not capable
of anything close to this.

236
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,611
Well, that is true, actually.
That's very true.

237
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,741
He is just a man, and,

238
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,858
(laughs): by the looks of it,
not much of one.

239
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,065
But... but hear me out.

240
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:48,195
W-What if he was helped? Hmm?

241
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,955
Say someone,

242
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,577
I don't know,

243
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,674
got him in to see Ezekiel

244
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,459
and got rid of the Deep.

245
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,804
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

246
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,549
Keep those hands down
by your sides, missy.

247
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,596
Sit down.

248
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,975
Now... I know

249
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,645
that you want to make
this whole Deep thing

250
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,565
an "All the single ladies"
moment.

251
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,373
Power, right?

252
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,197
But really, what you've done

253
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,253
is pulled off
every criminal's wet dream.

254
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,958
I mean, The Seven
is down by two.

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,710
I just can't help noticing
that it all started

256
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,712
when you came along,
which makes me wonder,

257
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,545
which one of us is next, hmm?

258
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,092
You bitch.

259
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,255
- I didn't do anything.
- HOMELANDER: Enough!

260
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,845
We're a different fucking breed.

261
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,480
We shine with the golden light

262
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:56,307
of providence, but you,
you've been helping these

263
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,734
fucking mud people

264
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,982
- to go against us.
- No.

265
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,236
Shut your fucking mouth,
young lady.

266
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,451
If you were in my position...

267
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,500
...what would you do to you?

268
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,078
(crying)

269
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,003
Homelander, that's enough.

270
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,042
You got something to add, Maeve?

271
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,339
She didn't know.

272
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,181
Well, she stinks of adrenaline

273
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,097
and her heart's beating
like a little rabbit.

274
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,347
The only thing she's guilty of
is being fucking stupid.

275
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,599
She obviously fell
for this Hugh Campbell guy

276
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,733
and he's pumping her
for information,

277
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,270
so back off, leave her alone.

278
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,363
Wow.

279
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,525
Starlight,

280
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,794
you must be something special.

281
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,616
Hmm?

282
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:57,252
I can't remember the last time
Maeve gave a shit ab...

283
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,880
Well, gave a shit about anyone,

284
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,917
really.

285
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
And if I say no?

286
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,686
Come on.

287
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,807
(whispering):
I got this.

288
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,574
It's you and me,

289
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,897
remember?

290
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,868
(whispering): Don't say
I never do anything for you.

291
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,616
All right.

292
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,625
You want her, you got her.
She's your responsibility now.

293
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,998
I just hope
you're right about her,

294
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,045
for both your sakes.

295
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,179
Class dismissed.

296
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,435
Look at this.

297
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,531
Oh, no. You don't stir,

298
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,487
you fold. Like this.

299
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,239
Now that's what
makes them spongy.

300
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,582
Here you go.

301
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,947
(door opens)

302
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,498
She wants to know
where you were.

303
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,673
That's a compelling
fucking question.

304
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,715
Hey, can we talk?

305
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,139
That's what we're doing,
innit?

306
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,927
No, I mean...

307
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,970
There ain't no secrets here,
son. Spit it out.

308
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,425
Stop being an asshole,
just talk to the guy.

309
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,266
Hughie doesn't mind.
Do you, Hughie?

310
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,904
Okay, fine. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

311
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,909
- Do what?
- This.

312
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,368
I mean, Vought,
whatever with Kimiko,

313
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,749
it's-it's awful,
and you got to stop it,

314
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,207
- but I can't.
- Right.

315
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,827
You just want to kick back,
drink a few Mai Tais,

316
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,875
and let us do all the work,
is that it?

317
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,549
You know, I managed to go
my whole life

318
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,981
without seeing someone
die horribly,

319
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,665
and now I'm up to about
a half dozen,

320
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,085
- so I think I'm good.
- Please.

321
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,433
You're a fucking killer, Hughie,

322
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,219
just like the rest of us.

323
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,523
Now, why don't you
stop pissing around

324
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,387
and tell everybody what this
is really all about?

325
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,805
- Yeah?
- Fine.

326
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,484
Annie.

327
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,653
- Fuck.
- HUGHIE: Okay?

328
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,570
It's about Annie.

329
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,864
Fucking finally.

330
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,985
He's been sneaking off to
give her one at Lincoln Grand.

331
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,222
- You've been following me?
- Like you gave me a choice.

332
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,916
She doesn't know anything, okay?
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

333
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,100
- All right? We'll just...
- Just what?

334
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,174
Fuck off to Epcot? The Hamptons?

335
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,630
Maybe pump out a few
flying babies?

336
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,420
No. I... I don't know.

337
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,593
No, you don't know
'cause you ain't thinking,

338
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,222
- except with your dick.
- You're wrong about her.

339
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,350
That bitch is fucking
playing you,

340
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,008
and you're too fucking blind
to see it.

341
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,056
Right, so better to be loyal
to a dead woman

342
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,480
who doesn't know
and doesn't care?

343
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,518
How's that working out for you?

344
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,290
(cell phone ringing)

345
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,789
- HUGHIE: Hey, Dad.
- MAN (on phone): Hey, Hughie.

346
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,754
Long time no talk.

347
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,814
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

348
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,088
Who's this?

349
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,721
I thought you would
recognize my voice.

350
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,887
You spend so much time obsessing
about me, am I right?

351
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,806
- Say hi to your baby boy, Dad.
- Oh. H-Hey, hey, hey, Hughie.

352
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,950
Why is he here? He says you're
in some kind of trouble.

353
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,184
Dad, are you okay?

354
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,023
Oh, o-okay.

355
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,561
He's fine.
Remington Steele's almost on.

356
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,516
A-Train, listen to me.

357
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,646
Oh, shit, if he's burned,
then I'm fucked.

358
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,074
HUGHIE:
He's on fucking Medicaid.

359
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,412
He's harmless. Let him go.

360
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,527
My place is burned.
They've got me.

361
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,874
Oh, my God.

362
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,910
Get your ass over here
in 20 minutes,

363
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,123
or I'm gonna burst through him
like a fucking piñata,

364
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,674
do you understand me?
Just like I did your girlfriend.

365
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,038
- Yeah. Got it.
- And, Hughie,

366
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,554
alone. If I catch a whiff,

367
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,007
a whiff of one of your

368
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,837
- little asshole friends...
- I got it.

369
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,180
All my bank accounts are frozen
and flagged. Monique,

370
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,799
listen, when you get this,

371
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,176
leave the house immediately.
Lay low and call me.

372
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,328
- Well, I hope she was fucking worth it.
- It's not Annie.

373
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,829
- She doesn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

374
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,193
- I'm gonna fucking do her in.
- The hell you will!

375
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,520
Hey, hold on a second.
She doesn't know. It wasn't her.

376
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,936
She's never seen me before.

377
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,074
Not once, not ever.
So how did I get burned?

378
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,040
Mesmer. You fucking idiots

379
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,697
had to go to Mesmer.

380
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,365
Fuck me.

381
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,634
Thank you.

382
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,339
That was not smart,
to sleep with her.

383
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,521
- Hughie.
- Dad.

384
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,270
(whispering):
He's acting strange.

385
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,772
You know, real jumpy.

386
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,404
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he...

387
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,151
Right here, sport. (laughs)

388
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,034
Look what I got.

389
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,994
Special 2016 Comic-Con edition?

390
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,995
What, did they make, like,
a few hundred of these?

391
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,497
- Watch out, A-Train's coming.
- (laughing)

392
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,960
You were a fan!

393
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,671
You were a fan, and not,
like, a dabbler, no,

394
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,882
you were super fan 99.

395
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,092
Excuse me, sir.

396
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,693
- W-What is this about?
- Shut the fuck up.

397
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,217
Dad, it's gonna be okay. Hey.

398
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,761
I came alone.

399
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,965
You let him go.

400
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,017
Alone, huh?

401
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,940
- Wow.
- Ah!

402
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,649
You really did come alone.

403
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,042
Next time... there's not gonna be
a next time, but next time...

404
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,606
have at least
a few cards up your sleeve.

405
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,493
Okay. You mean, um,
you mean, like this?

406
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:10,161
- Jonesing for a little jet fuel?
- W-What is that?

407
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,124
I don't know what that shit is.

408
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,785
Oh, you don't?

409
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,593
So you don't mind if I do this.

410
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,587
- No, fuck!
- What?

411
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,958
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

412
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,125
I have a bigger dose.

413
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,734
I have a real dose
hidden somewhere outside.

414
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,298
Let him go, I hand it over,

415
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,682
then you can do whatever
you want with me.

416
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,430
Now tell me what's better,
the rush or knowing that,

417
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,643
as long as you take it,
you'll be the fastest?

418
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,435
If you try anything,

419
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,156
I can catch up to dear old daddy
in a millisecond.

420
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,027
- Dad, time to go.
- Not without you.

421
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,414
I'll be right behind you.

422
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,050
I am not leaving you
with him, all right.

423
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,497
You're just a kid.
You're my kid.

424
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,786
Dad.

425
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,210
I'll be all right.

426
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,169
I got this.

427
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,963
Go.

428
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,835
(door opens, closes)

429
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,096
All right, where is it?

430
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:14,269
You know, this shit
must be pretty good

431
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,900
if it's worth running through
a human being for.

432
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,148
Oh, my God, man,
that was an accident.

433
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,940
- Where the fuck is the V?
- That accident had a name.

434
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,364
And what about Popclaw?

435
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,072
She had a name, too.

436
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,204
Charlotte!

437
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,832
The only good thing
in my life is gone now.

438
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,370
What is this, man? I kill your
girlfriend and you kill mine?

439
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,794
I didn't kill your girlfriend.

440
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,463
You used her.

441
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,381
You put her in danger,

442
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,259
and then you threw her out
like she was fucking garbage.

443
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,549
How does this not all start
with you, Hughie?

444
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,473
The only difference
between you and me

445
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:50,932
is that I made a mistake.

446
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,062
The shit that you did
was on purpose.

447
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,099
So who's worse?

448
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,774
(screaming)

449
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,363
You bitch!

450
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,858
You know, you're right.

451
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,649
It would've been stupid
to come alone.

452
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,863
(grunting)

453
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,243
(groaning)

454
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,781
MOTHER'S MILK: Monique,
it's not safe here anymore.

455
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,025
We got to go.

456
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,576
You swore to me
and to Jesus Christ

457
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,371
that you were done
with Billy Butcher.

458
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,165
I know, I get it.
Everything Butcher touches

459
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,378
- turns to flaming hot shit.
- No, I ain't blaming him.

460
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,169
Last I checked,
you're a grown-ass man.

461
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:27,012
It's my fault, okay?

462
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,219
But we can't do this right now.

463
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,655
- You put us in danger without thinking twice, Marvin.
- Monique, just...

464
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,059
Daddy!

465
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,598
Hey, baby, come here.
Give me a hug. Oh.

466
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,689
- What have you been up to?
- I was drawing you a picture.

467
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,730
You were? Can I see?

468
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,783
Oh, my goodness,
this is beautiful.

469
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,568
Thank you, baby.

470
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,072
Janine, honey, Daddy's gonna
take us on a sleepover.

471
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,834
Can you help Mommy
pack your toys?

472
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,657
- Good girl.
- Baby, we're running late.

473
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,252
We don't have time to pack toys.

474
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,078
We got to go.

475
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,503
I knew you'd vote
your conscience, Senator.

476
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,753
Thank you.

477
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,795
Good-bye.

478
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,762
(sighs) Three votes to go.

479
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,181
(laughs)

480
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,181
And the B.A. guys

481
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,483
said that the Pentagon
is shelling out

482
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,806
$35 billion on the low end.

483
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,982
- That puts us ahead of Lockheed.
- Amazing.

484
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,993
That's incredible.
Edgar must be thrilled.

485
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,857
Ugh, fuck Edgar.

486
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:34,825
We did this, you and me.
This is about us.

487
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,955
Hey, do you remember
that marketing girl?

488
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,287
Ashley?

489
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,173
Um, I'm sorry,
I-I had to fire her, she...

490
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,880
No. No, no, no.
Seven, eight years ago.

491
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:49,883
Becca.

492
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,974
Becca?

493
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,759
- Yes.
- Becca Butcher.

494
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:54,933
That's it.

495
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,061
Mm-hmm. Yeah, her.

496
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,639
What about her?

497
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,146
Well, she's missing.

498
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,358
What do you mean, missing?

499
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,069
I mean missing, as in missing,

500
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,780
presumed dead.

501
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,530
- Wow.
- Yeah.

502
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,411
I looked at her file, and
the cops think it was suicide.

503
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,579
Mm.

504
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,947
Yeah, it seems her husband...

505
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,785
Well, he got pretty riled up.

506
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,831
William Butcher.

507
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,086
Am I supposed to know his name?

508
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,930
No. Not specifically, but...

509
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:37,177
I was just wondering if you knew
what happened to her.

510
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,431
No, I just assumed
that she quit.

511
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,983
Quit?

512
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:44,687
Is there any particular reason

513
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,189
why you are asking
all of these questions?

514
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,981
No, no. I'm just... curious.

515
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,946
It's interesting, right?
I mean, it's...

516
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,867
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely sad.

517
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,986
Yeah. Yes, very.

518
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,543
You know, I was, I was
thinking that maybe, um,

519
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,710
I could get Maria to stay late
with the baby and...

520
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,260
...maybe we could
order in and...

521
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,509
catch up. (giggles)
Just me and you.

522
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,774
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

523
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,942
But you go be a mommy.

524
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,188
(pats leg)

525
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:40,082
I'm telling you,
you're gonna love it here.

526
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,737
You like roller coasters?

527
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,786
I'm more of a water park guy.

528
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,919
Well, Cedar Point's got both.

529
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,956
Mm-hmm.

530
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,175
You first.

531
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,600
(panting):
Huh...?

532
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,889
Oh. Well, most girls
like the suit.

533
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:08,354
Well, I'm not most girls.

534
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,856
Mm. Is it true what they say?

535
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,859
Come on, baby.

536
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,451
I got you here in the flesh.

537
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,857
I gotta see it.

538
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,195
Please?

539
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:24,791
I don't, I don't look
like everyone else.

540
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,249
That's what I'm counting on.

541
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,880
All right.

542
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,214
(belt thuds)

543
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,310
(chuckles):
Oh, look at those gills.

544
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:48,638
(gasps)
Oh, my God, that's so fucked up.

545
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:52,686
Hey, can-can...
Can we just, uh...

546
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,981
Ah... be gentle, be gentle.

547
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,145
Ow, it's tender. Oh, God.

548
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:01,704
Okay. That hurts.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

549
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,094
- Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
- Come on, it's just my pinkie.

550
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,698
No, I said it hurt.

551
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,169
All right, look,
I think maybe you should go.

552
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,919
(scoffs)
I'm not going anywhere,

553
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,422
you little fucking freak.

554
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:20,585
- Lay back.
- (scoffs)

555
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,604
I said, lay back.

556
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,556
Ah. God. Ow!

557
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,677
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.

- Oh, yeah. You like that?
- Ow.

00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,561
Oh, you little fucking freak.

560
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,185
Oh, you like getting
your fucking gills fingered?

561

(grunts)
Ow. Oh, God.

Ow, ow. Oh, God.

567

Having a good growler, are we?

568
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,808
How did you...?

569
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,559
I stuck a little bug on you
back at that shithole of yours.

570
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,573
'Cause, you know, fuck you.

No...

What did you expect me to do?

573
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,991
It was Homelander.

You got to talk to me.

Wait, wait. No. I can help you.

Don't want none, fuck off.

I'm here about your wife.

588
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,487
I believe this was a few days

589
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,832
after you met Homelander
at that Christmas party?

590
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,418
She was alone with him
for three hours.

591
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,821
Not long after that,
Rebecca went missing

592
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,030
and has remained so ever since.

593
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,241
One way or another, Mr. Butcher,

594
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,331
I believe Homelander
was involved.

595
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,737
Homelander?

596
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,830
But he's a fucking superhero.

597
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,837
You wouldn't believe
what they get up to.

598
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,632
Who the fuck are you?

599
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,510
My name is Mallory.

600
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:39,596
I'm the person
who can get you payback.

601
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,685
(ringing)

602
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:56,373
Who's calling?

603
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,120
(sniffles)
Nobody.

604
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:07,844
(sighs)
Listen, if you...

605
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,590
if you want to talk,
I suppose we...

606
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,644
No.

607
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,480
But would it kill you
to make me one of those?

608
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,516
(chuckles)

609
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:29,027
You know, I had someone once.

610
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,907
We were gonna get away,
start a family.

611
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,947
So what happened?

612
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,951
(chuckles)

613
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,794
Well...

614
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,039
Everyone always asks,

615
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,672
what's our special weakness?

616
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,091
Gamma rays?

617
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,549
Iron daggers?

618
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,140
Some ridiculous, stupid thing?

619
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,756
The truth is,

620
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:03,306
our weakness
is the same as anyone's.

621
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,352
It's people.

622
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,396
The people we care about.

623
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:13,401
So I say, cut them loose.

624
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,615
For your good and for theirs.

625
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:20,117
That way
you're really bulletproof.

626
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,686
What's up, man?

627
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,976
How'd you end up here?

628
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,191
Oh, tell me about it.

629
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,652
(sighs)
Me, too.

630
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,777
What's that?

631
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,822
Oh.

632
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:02,036
Wait, you can't get
in your head about that.

633
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,497
It's really not
that big of a deal.

634
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,708
I'm gonna get you out of here.

635
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,958
Just hang tight.

636
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,383
Excuse me, sir.

637
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:18,304
Oh, hey. Can I take one of these
lobsters back with me?

638
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,553
- You got it.
- Thanks.

639
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,774
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no.
Not that one.

640
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:29,812
This one.

641
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,265
Yeah, that's my guy.

642
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:32,515
(chuckles)

643
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,123
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

644
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,871
FRENCHIE:
Larry, please.

645
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,333
I just need a secure place
for a few nights.

646
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,253
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

647
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,292
Putain!

648
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,131
(sighs)

649
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,883
STARLIGHT:
Hi, you've reached Annie.

650
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,652
- I can't come to the phone...
- Oh, damn it.

651
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,546
(cartoon playing on computer)

652
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,556
That's Hughie, baby.

653
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,729
- She looks like you.
- Nah.

654
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,018
She's good-looking, man.

655
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,152
Right, baby? (chuckles)

656
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,079
Mr. Campbell.

657
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,621
Ooh, yeah.

658
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,375
Pleasure to meet you.
Billy Butcher.

659
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,877
Oh, Hugh Campbell.

660
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,760
- You got a hell of a lad there.
- Well, yeah.

661
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,798
He's all mine.

662
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,054
Hello, hello, hello.

663
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:46,385
What have we got here, then, eh?

664
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,181
What's your name, sweetheart?

665
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,015
You can call me Uncle Billy.

666
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,060
He ain't your uncle, honey.

667
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,284
- He ain't nothing to you.
- Monique.

668
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,904
Good to see you.

669
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,253
Hi, you've reached Annie.
I can't come

670
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,289
to the phone right now...

671
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,456
(clears throat)

672
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,302
(whispers):
What's she doing?

673
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:23,009
Uh, okay. It's okay.

674
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,011
It's okay.

675
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,865
Does the Oriental girl not talk?

676
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,429
Uh, Asian.

677
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,644
- Yeah.
- You're right. Asian.

678
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,694
And no, I don't think she does.

679
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,613
Dad, I'm really sorry.

680
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,648
I'm sorry about everything.

681
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,402
No, no, no. Don't say sorry. No.

682
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,865
Look at you,
standing up for yourself.

683
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,406
Jings.

684
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,660
(both chuckle)

685
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,702
(pats knee)

686
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,422
Cold feet, huh?

687
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:56,839
What?

688
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,247
You said Raynor got cold feet.

689
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,915
Yeah, that's what I said.

690
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,473
You know what I think it is?

691
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,757
I think
Raynor's plenty interested,

692
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:08,351
only she didn't bring you
Homelander's head on a plate,

693
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,558
and you blew
the whole fucking thing up.

694
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,059
How am I doing so far?

695
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,230
No, mate. Way off.

696
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,859
Bullshit, Butcher.

697
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,977
You're so hot for Homelander
right now, Butcher,

698
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,315
you're not gonna let anything
get in your way,

699
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,240
even if it's
your own fucking friends, man.

700
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,740
You promised me
things would be different.

701
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,793
Matter of fact, you swore it.

702
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,786
But this is worse, man.

703
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,209
This is gonna be
Mallory's family all over again,

704
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,498
only this time
it's gonna be my family.

705
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,922
And if something happens
to them, Butcher...

706
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,598
I don't know what happened
with you and Raynor

707
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,059
or how that situation
got fucked up,

708
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,440
but just please call her.

709
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,647
Please.

710
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,688
(dogs barking)

711
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,029
(dog whines)

712
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,663
Yeah.

713
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,829
- (whooshing, thud)
- There you go.

714
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,210
Dr. Vogelbaum.

715
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,923
Surprise.

716
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:26,384
Thought I'd drop in on you.

717
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,344
You look well.

718
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,386
How long's it been, John?

719
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,309
(chuckles) Long enough that
no one calls me John anymore.

720
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,440
Mm.

721
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:42,899
So, what are these? Uh... pets?

722
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,901
No, just breeding them.

723
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,613
German retrievers.

724
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,244
I try not to get
too attached to my subjects.

725
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,583
Hmm. Well, that's true.

726
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,076
Seems retirement suits you.

727
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,998
Between this
and 80-hour weeks at the lab,

728
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,634
I'll take the lab. No contest.

729
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,298
So, you ever, uh...

730
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,643
catch up with any
of the old gang from Vought?

731
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,259
(chuckles)

732
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,886
Look, do you mind
if we don't do this?

733
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,892
- Do what?
- This cat and mouse bullshit.

734
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,185
You want to know
about Rebecca Butcher.

735
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,040
You went to Stillwell
about it because you knew

736
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,154
that'd tip over
the first domino.

737
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:26,862
Well, it led to me.

738
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,450
So just ask.

739
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,279
I'll be honest.

740
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,828
Well, that would be a first.

741
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,788
Eight years ago...

742
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,915
Stillwell called me with quite
an interesting challenge.

743
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,719
Rebecca Butcher
had come to her with a...

744
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,680
completely unprecedented
medical condition.

745
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,682
What condition?

746
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,360
VOGELBAUM:
She was pregnant.

747
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,437
With your child.

748
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,659
Pregnant?

749
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,489
Wh...

750
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,787
(stammering):
But I thought I couldn't.

751
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,710
So did I.

752
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,789
Apparently, nature is tenacious.

753
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,764
The fetus was developing
unnaturally fast.

754
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,967
We told her we'd deliver
the baby safely

755
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,507
at a secure location,

756
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,140
but she had to sign an NDA.

757
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,677
Couldn't tell anyone.

758
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,101
Not even her husband.

759
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,850
You can imagine the size
of the potential scandal.

760
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,353
(nurses' voices echoing)

761
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,556
BECCA:
No!

762
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,315
No! Pull it out...
Oh, my...

763
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,528
(screaming)

764
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,028
(wailing)

765
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,869
The birth was difficult.

766
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,539
The baby clawed its way
out of her.

767
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,915
The blood loss...
no one could have survived.

768
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,800
She died on the table.

769
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,048
A-And the baby?

770
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,090
Lived all of ten seconds.

771
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:17,014
Drowned in its mother's blood.

772
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,390
Was it a boy?

773
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:25,024
Does it matter?

774
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,062
Why didn't you tell me?

775
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,066
To protect you.

776
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,528
That's always job one
at Vought, isn't it?

777
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,360
Protect our
most profitable asset?

778
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,698
So why are you telling me now?

779
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,754
You don't understand.

780
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,750
The thing about
cross-breeding dogs,

781
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,752
you get the right genes,

782
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,594
you can get a perfect creation.

783
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,129
But it doesn't matter
how perfect they are.

784
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,434
It's not enough.

785
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,469
When I raise subjects
without their mothers,

786
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,892
they become violent.

787
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,600
Aggressive.

788
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,641
Downright hateful.

789
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,066
You should have been raised

790
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,106
in a home with a family
who loved you.

791
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,780
Not in a cold lab with doctors.

792
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,320
And yet, I turned out great.

793
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:21,025
(scoffs) When I think
what it's done to you,

794
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:24,576
and what you can now do
to everyone else...

795
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,621
(exhales)

796
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,552
I'm sorry.

797
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,672
I don't want
your fucking apology.

798
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,625
All this is my fault.

799
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,385
What do you want?

800
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,888
What?

801
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,062
What do you want... forgiveness?

802
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,102
Now?

803
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,901
After you raised me
like a fucking lab rat?

804
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,987
No.

805
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,994
Too little, too late.

806
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,329
I don't want anything
from you, John.

807
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,629
I'm just an old man,
thinking about his mistakes.

808
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,711
(sighs)

809
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,638
I'm the world's greatest
superhero.

810
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,642
You're my greatest failure.

811
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,725
(line ringing)

812
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,902
STARLIGHT:
Hi. You've reached Annie.

813
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,901
I can't come
to the phone right now, but...

814
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,453
(vehicle approaching)

815
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,486
(tires squealing)

816
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,622
- (tires squealing)
- Merde!

817
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,156
Butcher.

818
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,004
- Yeah, yeah, here's a gun.
- Fucking hell.

819
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,669
Calm down.

820
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,248
- Okay, come on.
- (gun chamber clicking)

821
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,720
All right, easy, lads. Easy.

822
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,262
(radio crackles)

823
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,016
M.M.

824
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:09,927
Deputy Director.

825
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,806
Your family's gonna be okay,
you have my word.

826
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,353
Thank you.

827
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,939
You called?

828
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,526
You are a human after all.

829
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,951
Well, let's not get
too carried away.

830
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,370
Thanks, man.

831
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,408
AGENT:
Come right this way, ma'am.

832
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:34,417
Monique, I'm sorry.

833
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,539
I never want to see you again,
Marvin.

834
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,800
Come here, baby.

835
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,970
Mmm.

836
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,839
Daddy loves you, okay?

837
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,886
You're gonna be safe with Mommy.

838
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,930
All right? All right.

839
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,188
(sighs)

840
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,187
Take care of yourself.

841
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,235
All right. All right.

842
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,788
- No Homelander.
- No Homelander.

843
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,290
We had a deal.
Everyone else is fair game.

844
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,503
Do you want this or not?

845
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,571
(phone buzzing)

846
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,204
Annie, are you okay?

847
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,583
(sniffles)

848
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,620
I have to see you.

849
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,917
I, uh...

850
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,039
I don't know. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

851
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,836
You have to explain, Hughie.

852
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,839
You have
to make this make sense.

853
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,721
Just you and me.

854
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,260
You owe me that much.

855
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,766
MADELYN:
I'm sorry.

856
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,688
I'm afraid I'm not following.

857
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,557
You and your corporation
are fucked.

858
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:22,855
Unequivocally,
unilaterally fucked.

859
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,700
How was that?
Is that clearer for you?

860
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,741
For the last half century,

861
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,953
you have been feeding
the American people the line

862
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:37,245
that your superheroes
are chosen by God.

863
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,510
I mean, I get it.

864
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,298
Jamming illegal drugs
into babies' arms...

865
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,802
I mean, that doesn't quite
have the same ring,

866
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,724
and that's not even the worst.

867
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,524
What did you do
to this one, and why?

868
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,228
I've never seen her
in my entire life.

869
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,899
Uh-huh.

870
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,107
- What do you want?
- For starters,

871
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,978
there are no superheroes
in the U.S. Armed Forces.

872
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,106
The bill's already gone down
to the floor.

873
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,323
They're gonna vote on it
any day now.

874
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:10,914
And you're pulling it.

875
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,488
Retooling the concept
for internal development.

876
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,704
I don't give a shit,
but the deal is dead.

877
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,115
And we're gonna go
back to status quo,

878
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,124
where we're the government
and the military,

879
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:23,666
and you're just assholes
running around in your capes.

880
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,211
- And if we refuse?
- Everything goes public.

881
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,045
Corruption story of the century.

882
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,511
Vought shares go to zero.

883
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,930
The civil suits,
criminal prosecution,

884
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,889
and you go bankrupt,
and your cute

885
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,480
little suit goes to a lovely
shade of orange for 15 to 30.

886
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,604
- (door opens)
- WOMAN: Ms. Raynor?

887
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,730
Thank you, Michaela.

888
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,993
We're done here.

889
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,701
Everything okay, I hope?

890
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,201
(door closes)

891
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,285
Someone tell me
what the hell is going on.

892
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,711
About 12 minutes ago,
Navy SEALs took out Abu Ressam

893
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,420
about 15 miles
outside of Damascus.

894
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,920
Right, as planned.
So what's the problem?

895
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:09,634
Watch.

896
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,634
- (gunfire, woman screams)
- (indistinct shouting)

897
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,176
- MAN: We got two.
- (man yells)

898
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,180
- MAN 2: Nice eye.
- MAN 3: Stop.

899
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,983
That's our guy. Light him up.

900
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,687
Great.

901
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:24,608
The prick behind Flight 37
is dead. What am I missing?

902
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,937
- Just wait.
- (beeps)

903
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,411
- Step inside.
- Watch this.

904
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,487
(woman whimpering,
glass clinking)

905
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,082
(debris clinking)

906
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:38,697
- We got movement!
- Hey! Hey! Get down!

907
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,195
- Hey!
- Get down!

908
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,166
- Get down, motherfucker!
- Don't fucking move!

909
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,576
I said get down!

910
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,085
What the fuck does that say?

911
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,207
"Naqib."

912
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,054
MAN:
Hey!

913
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,839
Freeze, motherfucker!

914
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:54,143
- Kill him!
- (rapid gunfire)

915
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,034
That's not all.

916
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:25,001
How is that son of a bitch
still alive?

917
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,458
"Naqib" means "Captain."

918
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,384
We believe it's his...

919
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,422
Supe name.

920
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,813
Are you telling me

921
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,942
they have a Supe terrorist?

922
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,169
Look, Annie, I-I...

923
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,131
Did you kill Translucent?

924
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,006
It's-it's...
it's not that simple.

925
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:20,388
And you haven't been using me
to get back at A-Train?

926
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,019
(Annie sighs)

927
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,240
Y...

928
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:36,818
You're a murderer.

929
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:38,703
We didn't have a choice.

930
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,079
- There is always a choice.
- Wait.

931
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,787
Aah. What-what are you doing?

932
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,037
- I'm taking you in.
- What... No. Annie, hold on.

933
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,119
To the cops! At least
they'll treat you better

934
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,684
- than The Seven would.
- Just listen to me.

935
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,668
Listen to me, okay?
I know this is so fucked.

936
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,960
You were the only thing, Hughie.

937
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,731
You were the only thing
that I could count on.

938
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,465
I'm still me, Annie.

939
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,887
Please. You know me.

940
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,886
I don't know you.

941
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,598
- Never did.
- If you bring me in,

942
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,309
- I'm dead before sunrise.
- No.

943
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,139
Vought will want to string
you up for a long trial.

944
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,145
Lots of press.
The guy who killed Translucent.

945
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,107
This isn't about Translucent.

946
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:14,358
Okay? This is about Compound V.

947
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,820
(both panting)

948
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,241
Compound V?

949
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,702
It's this drug.

950
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:26,453
It, um...

951
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,865
It gives the Supes their powers.

952
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,174
Vought will do anything
to cover it up.

953
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,049
N... No. What? Wha...?

954
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,087
What are you talking about?

955
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,893
We're born like this.

956
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:44,637
I'm so sorry.

957
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:48,475
Annie. Annie.

958
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,097
- Annie, watch out!
- (screams)

959
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,694
- (people shrieking)
- Fucking run, Hughie.

960
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,229
(groaning)

961
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:00,323
- (screams)
- (panting)

962
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:03,163
- I'm so sorry.
- (panting)

963
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,579
Get the fuck away from her!

964
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,963
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

965
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,538
I didn't ask for your help.

966
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,353
Yeah. Looked like
you had it all under control.

967
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:16,707
- (grunting)
- (sirens blaring)

968
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,174
(groaning)

969
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:20,224
(gasping)
