Amen.

29
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:07,004
I promised my friend
Freddie Thorne

30
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,444
that I'd say a few words
over his grave

31
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,174
if he should pass before me.

32
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:18,124
I made this promise before
he became me brother-in-law -

33
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:21,564
when we were in France,
fighting for the King.

34
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:22,894
Amen.

35
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:27,884
And in the end it wasn't war
that took Freddie.

36
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:31,004
Pestilence took him.

37
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:32,294
Come here.

38
00:03:33,694 --> 00:03:38,524
But Freddie passed on his soul
and his spirit to a new generation

39
00:03:38,574 --> 00:03:40,214
before he was cruelly taken.

40
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:51,204
We thought, now Freddie's gone,

41
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,254
you might come back to Birmingham.

42
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:58,004
God, do you know how funny it is

43
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:00,884
that you've got
chauffeurs in uniform now?

44
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:03,164
It's just for the occasion, Ada.

45
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,644
Do you know how unfair it is

46
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:07,734
that you've got four Bugattis
when half the country's starving?

47
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,134
So now they've made you
ashamed of us, eh?

48
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:16,924
Sometimes when I think how I used
to be, it makes me embarrassed.

49
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:18,684
Karl's with his cousins.

50
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:21,054
I caught 'em trying
to pinch flowers off a grave.

51
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:27,204
Ada, are you coming home?

52
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,614
I'm going home.

53
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,564
It's all right, Poll.
We make Ada embarrassed.

54
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:34,254
That's not what I said.

55
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,524
There's another reason
we want you home.

56
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:41,284
We're planning an expansion.

57
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,044
I'm taking premises in London...

58
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:46,324
~ Tommy, it's a funeral,
business can wait. ~ Polly,

59
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:48,844
if Ada was weeping then I'd stop.

60
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,364
But she's not.

61
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:52,444
The expansion means
it's going to be dangerous

62
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:54,564
to be a Shelby in London
for a while.

63
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:58,134
Yeah, well,
I'm not a Shelby anymore.

64
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:02,254
And I'm not a Thorne now, either.

65
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:05,294
I'm free.

66
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:10,774
I've got to get Karl home.

67
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:22,004
I told you. Let me do it.

68
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:23,684
It's all right.

69
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:27,054
I'll have some men watch her house
till the danger passes.

70
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:34,534
"Till the danger passes"?

71
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:39,534
That'll be the bloody day.

72
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:18,564
It happened at exactly 7am.

73
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:22,294
Nobody saw anything.
Our patrols were not in the area.

74
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:27,894
Mr Shelby, have you got
any idea who might've done it?

75
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:33,054
I'd say it was something
to do with the gas.

76
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,614
It's just been fitted.

77
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:42,644
Madam, the structure's
not yet declared safe.

78
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,654
Madam!

79
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:57,614
This is all over the place.

80
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:04,094
Confetti.

81
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:10,164
You can go.

82
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,254
Right.

83
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:18,374
Who?

84
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:23,494
Who did this to us?

85
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:44,494
Whisky. Irish.

86
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,604
I heard there was a bit of a bang
in your part of town.

87
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:04,204
Gas and electric don't mix.

88
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:06,444
Who'd have thought
they would, eh?

89
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:08,894
How's business otherwise,
Mr Shelby?

90
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:12,374
You know something?

91
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,364
In these times of hunger
and hardship,

92
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,294
business is surprisingly good.

93
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:23,654
Which one of you is
the Peaky Blinder devil?

94
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:31,854

109
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:00,614
Polly.

110
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:03,404
Did he say who did it?

111
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:06,004
He's gone to the Black Lion.

112
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,764
On his own?

113
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:10,324
Tommy does everything on his own.

114
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:13,084
~ Should I go to the Black Lion?
~ What?

115
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:16,004
~ Should I go there and see him? ~ No.

116
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:17,964
Where the fuck is Arthur?

117
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:21,004
Protecting the Garrison's
whisky from the police.

118
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,894
For fuck's sake!

119
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:32,734
Polly, it feels a little bit to me
like things are getting out of hand.

120
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,334
So get 'em in hand.

121
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:39,734
Do you know what Ada said to me
this morning?

122
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:46,814
She said we all look like we work
in a factory under the ground.

123
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:50,294
She said we look like ghosts.

124
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:52,454
She'll be back.

125
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,044
When?

126
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:56,534
When she needs us.

127
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:02,364
And anyway, who the fuck
would blow up our pub?

128
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:05,244
~ Six. ~ Six what?

129
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:08,094
Six questions since
you walked through the door.

130
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:14,254
Soon you're going to have to start
being the man with the answers.

131
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:17,294
Why?

132
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:20,534
Seven.

133
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:26,244
Because when London happens,
you'll have to hold up your end

134
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:28,374
or we'll find somebody else who can.

135
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:46,614
Thomas Shelby.

136
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,014
You blew up my pub.

137
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:53,854
Anger defeats fear, good.

138
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:56,534
You blew up my pub.

139
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:01,444
Tommy has a reputation to uphold.

140
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:04,364
A reputation for not being
scared of anything.

141
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:08,774
In all the world, violent men
are the easiest to deal with.

142
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,374
So tell me, which brand
of rebel are you, eh?

143
00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:17,684
I read somewhere that you Paddies

144
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:20,054
started fighting
amongst yourselves, now.

145
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:25,964
The King offers you a peace treaty
and you start a war about it.

146
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:29,044
That's funny, don't you think?

147
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:30,814
A war about peace.

148
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:38,124
So are you for the treaty
or against the treaty?

149
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,134
Forgive me, I get confused.

150
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,374
You are one decision away
from death, Mr Shelby.

151
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:53,414
So stop fucking smiling.

152
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,884
Your name is Irene O'Donnell.

153
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:02,684
You have a son at the
Cherry Wood Road School in Harborne.

154
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:05,844
He has irons on his legs,
his name is Sean,

155
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:09,694
he comes last
in every race, poor boy.

156
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,924
Poor boy if the race was important.

157
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:17,244
Do you know what I mean,
Irene O'Donnell?

158
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:19,484
There are other ways of
carrying out this mission.

159
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:22,774
Please allow me to put a bullet
in this scum tinker's head.

160
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,534
No.

161
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:34,404
He researches his enemies,

162
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:36,654
that's why he's been chosen.

163
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:39,454
I am chosen?

164
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,334
I'm chosen.

165
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,174
Can the chosen one smoke?

166
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:05,734
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

167
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:10,494
Chosen by whom?

168
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:14,214
By an informed consensus.

169
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:17,374
I have things to do.

170
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:21,724
So perhaps you could tell
the chosen one

171
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:23,894
what he's been chosen for.

172
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:27,444
From now on, Mr Shelby,

173
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:32,414
you shut your fucking Gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

174
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:02,814
Fuck!

175
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:17,884
I need the area round
the co-operative stables

176
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:21,204
clear of coppers between
midnight and four tonight.

177
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:23,134
Right. Could I ask why?

178
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:30,764
Well, whatever it is you're
going to do, don't start any fires.

179
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:33,684
The firemen go out
on strike at midnight.

180
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:35,534
That's all. You can go.

181
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:44,604
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

182
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,134
No charge.

183
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:50,084
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

184
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,124
Just passing through, he says.

185
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:56,084
He's very grand these days.

186
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:58,724
He's head of some
secret department -

187
00:16:58,774 --> 00:17:00,094
the Irish Desk.

188
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:05,694
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us, eh?

189
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:09,334
I'll say good night, Tom.

190
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:21,014
I want to speak to a representative!

191
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:32,764
Father! Father!

192
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:35,524
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

193
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:37,204
Get the fuck off me!

194
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:40,044
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

195
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:43,604
I demand to speak to
a representative
of His Majesty the King!

196
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:44,804
Make your peace with God.

197
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:47,764
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

198
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:50,124
~ Father. ~ Come on.

199
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,694
Where are you going?

200
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:56,964
Does someone here have
business with the King?

201
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:58,564
Major Campbell.

202
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,894
About time.

203
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:05,524
I am a very busy man, Governor.

204
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:07,324
In seven and a half minutes,

205
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,844
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

206
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:13,764
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

207
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,494
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

208
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:19,444
No, Governor,

209
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:21,014
I hear no bells.

210
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,364
Since yesterday morning,

211
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:26,364
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

212
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:28,844
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

213
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:31,764
It's a little late to be coming up
with nonsense like that,

214
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:32,964
don't you think?

215
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:35,044
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

216
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:37,324
there would be a last-minute pardon,

217
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:39,214
which has not materialised.

218
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:43,004
Forgive me, Governor,

219
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,454
but what business is this of mine?

220
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,124
He says the man who hired him

221
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:52,084
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

222
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:53,574
an Ulsterman.

223
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:56,964
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

224
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:59,644
a bullet wound in his right leg.

225
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:01,414
No...

226
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:04,894
Still no bells. Governor...

227
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:10,524
..you have a very clear remit.

228
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:14,204
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

229
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:17,214
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

230
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:22,414
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man...

231
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:25,684
..to the gates of hell.

232
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:26,774
Is that clear?

233
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:33,484
And...if you should ever have
the desire

234
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:36,014
to discuss this matter
with anyone else...

235
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:39,934
..I know where you live.

236
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:57,574
Arthur,
Tommy's called a family meeting.

237
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:00,404
Arthur!

238
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:02,804
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

239
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:05,174
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

240
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:14,734
Arthur!

241
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:20,974
2,000.

242
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:42,374
Come on.

243
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,374
Sit down, Finn.

244
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:08,134
~ Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
~ He's on his way.

245
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:11,934
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

246
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,774
Whisky - left over from
the explosion.

247
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:23,054
It's good stuff, as well.

248
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:39,444
Right...

249
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,644
Before Tommy gets here,

250
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:43,964
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

251
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,524
between the rest of us.

252
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:46,694
YOU think?

253
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:48,894
Yeah.

254
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:51,774
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

255
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:57,134
..when did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

256
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:05,404
If you have anything to say,
you wait for Thomas.

257
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:06,924
Polly's fucking right.

258
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:08,134
I see all the books.

259
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,014
Legal and off track.

260
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:15,174
Sort of stuff you don't see.

261
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,164
And in the past year

262
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:21,684
the Shelby Company Limited

263
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:26,044
has been making £150...

264
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,574
a day.

265
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,924
Right? A fucking day.

266
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:33,844
Sometimes more.

267
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,564
So what I want to know

268
00:22:36,614 --> 00:22:40,524
is why are we changing things?

269
00:22:40,574 --> 00:22:42,974
Polly, look what's happened already.

270
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:45,884
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

271
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:48,044
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

272
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:50,524
~ Who said anything
about cockneys? ~ Who else?

273
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:52,484
Do you know who did it, do you?

274
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:54,654
No, she doesn't know who did it.

275
00:22:56,214 --> 00:22:59,124
I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

276
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:00,974
Everyone's allowed to speak.

277
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:05,094
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

278
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:09,934
I speak for our household.

279
00:23:11,454 --> 00:23:14,444
~ So... ~ John, this company
is a modern enterprise

280
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,044
and believes in
equal rights for women.

281
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,614
On your feet, Esme.

282
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:34,284
I'm not a blood member
of this family

283
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:37,364
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm NOT a member

284
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:39,534
I can see things
in a different light.

285
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:42,204
So I'll get to my point.

286
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,924
That would be nice.

287
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,284
As my husband said,

288
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:48,524
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

289
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,844
But London...

290
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:53,774
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

291
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:57,604
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

292
00:23:57,654 --> 00:24:01,244
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

293
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:04,614
And there are foreigners
of every description...

294
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:08,414
..and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

295
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:13,204
I have a child,

296
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:16,014
blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

297
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:19,654
I want John to see him grow up.

298
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:25,124
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

299
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:27,054
and keep chickens or something.

300
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:32,724
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

301
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:33,894
"Thomas"?

302
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:39,054
That's all I have to say.

303
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:45,374
That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

304
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:50,924
Wash them down with a nice drink.

305
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:52,214
Thank you, Esme.

306
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:58,164
Firstly, the bang in the pub
was nothing to do with London.

307
00:24:58,214 --> 00:24:59,604
Understood?

308
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:02,084
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

309
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,684
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

310
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:07,374
so long as we stick together.

311
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,564
And after the first few weeks,

312
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:13,044
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

313
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,524
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

314
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:17,694
That's right.

315
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:22,404
Now, some of you in this room
have expressed their reservations.

316
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,684
Fair enough.

317
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:26,884
Any of you who want no part
in the future of this company,

318
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,414
walk out the door...

319
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:33,974
..right now.

320
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,094
Go raise your chickens.

321
00:25:39,374 --> 00:25:41,654
For those of you with ambition...

322
00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:45,174
..the expansion process
begins tomorrow.

323
00:25:57,934 --> 00:26:00,124
Tomorrow?

324
00:26:00,174 --> 00:26:03,214
I'm company treasurer,
you should speak to me first.

325
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:08,124
It's Newmarket tomorrow,
third busiest day of the year.

326
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:09,724
We have 18 staff.

327
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:12,124
Who you trust with 200 quid takings?

328
00:26:12,174 --> 00:26:14,134
Oh, I changed the combination.

329
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:21,574
So what's going on, Thomas?

330
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,654
Who'd you meet at the Black Lion?

331
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:28,294
Give me the combination, Polly.

332
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:38,014
Polly, give me the combination!

333
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:47,324
What happened to the pub
is Irish business.

334
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:49,844
We're in a situation where,
for everyone's safety,

335
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:52,134
it's best if some things
remain undisclosed.

336
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:54,534
So why tomorrow?

337
00:26:57,734 --> 00:26:59,564
Like you say,
tomorrow's Newmarket.

338
00:26:59,614 --> 00:27:02,004
All the London bosses
will be at the races.

339
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,404
What, so you just roll up
and take the city?

340
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:07,734
No, we take the opportunity
to show our hand.

341
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:12,844
The Italian gangs
and the Jewish gangs

342
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:14,924
have been at war in London
for six months.

343
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:16,044
It's not our war.

344
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,684
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

345
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:21,004
~ Yeah, but we don't.
~ We need a foothold

346
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:23,124
at the southern end
of the Grand Union.

347
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,134
The Jews control Camden Town.

348
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:35,084
Your mother said,

349
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:37,414
"It's his cleverness
that'll kill him."

350
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:41,564
No-one gets killed, Polly.

351
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:44,964
We go down tomorrow when it's quiet
and we leave our message.

352
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:48,444
If Alfie Solomon
and his Camden boys come to us,

353
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:50,964
we'll negotiate the use
of a secure bonded warehouse

354
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:53,844
and then our legal activities
in London can begin.

355
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:57,494
Now please, open the fucking safe.

356
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:07,094
Do you know, it was a fine speech
you made in there...

357
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:11,734
..about this company believing
in equal rights for women.

358
00:28:12,894 --> 00:28:14,684
But when it comes to it,

359
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,614
you don't listen to a word we say.

360
00:28:18,294 --> 00:28:19,814
Maybe you don't trust us.

361
00:28:22,654 --> 00:28:24,454
She was one woman, Thomas.

362
00:28:31,654 --> 00:28:33,724
Well, maybe it's time
you forgot about her.

363
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:35,484
Forgot about who?

364
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:52,414
You and the boys,
go and get yourselves killed.

365
00:29:43,454 --> 00:29:45,054
Are you going to London now?

366
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:51,254
No, there's something
I have to do first.

367
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:55,084
Oh, I've got a typewriter like that.

368
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:57,244
I got it out of a catalogue.

369
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:59,774
I'm doing a correspondence course.

370
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:05,284
I'm learning to do it
with my eyes shut.

371
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:06,934
It's a test you have to do.

372
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:16,214
Will you come back before you go?

373
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,054
No.

374
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:42,764
I wish, just once,
you wouldn't pay me,

375
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:44,844
as if we were ordinary people.

376
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:45,974
Yeah.

377
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:51,804
Let's begin.

378
00:31:51,854 --> 00:31:53,494
Hands on the table.

379
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,764
Tonight we have two
new pilgrims joining us.

380
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:05,974
So, let's welcome them.

381
00:32:11,214 --> 00:32:13,284
Starting with you.

382
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,484
Who is it that
you're seeking to reach?

383
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,604
My husband.

384
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:22,204
He was taken six months ago
by the influenza.

385
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:25,764
I tried to reach him through
Mrs Breach at Sparkhill

386
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:28,524
but she kept getting
his middle name wrong.

387
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:31,454
Don't talk about Mrs Breach
in this house.

388
00:32:32,974 --> 00:32:35,854
She's an un-sanctified charlatan.

389
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,974
And you?

390
00:32:44,174 --> 00:32:45,494
Who do you seek?

391
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:49,924
Well, the truth...

392
00:32:49,974 --> 00:32:52,684
Sorry, the truth is,
I'm not even sure she's dead.

393
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:54,174
So I came here to find out.

394
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:00,734
Er...

395
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:05,484
You see, my son and my daughter

396
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:08,324
were taken from me
when they were very small -

397
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:09,804
taken by the parish authorities.

398
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,524
And I never knew
what happened to them.

399
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:16,054
But lately...

400
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,374
I've had a feeling.

401
00:33:21,574 --> 00:33:22,814
Like, a feeling...

402
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:28,774
I can't put it into words.

403
00:33:30,814 --> 00:33:33,014
And I keep having a dream.

404
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:40,004
I see a pretty girl,

405
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:41,694
about 18 years old.

406
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,094
And she's standing
across the street...

407
00:33:48,334 --> 00:33:52,484
..and she tells me
she's passed over.

408
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:56,534
Now, my daughter
would have been 18 this year.

409
00:33:57,654 --> 00:33:59,854
On May 15th.

410
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:08,934
And this girl has dark eyes
like mine.

411
00:34:13,494 --> 00:34:17,334
And she shouts...and shouts.

412
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:23,084
And she tells me
she wants to talk to me

413
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:24,854
because I'm her mother.

414
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:34,044
Now, I don't even know
what name they gave her

415
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:36,014
after they stole her from me.

416
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,694
But if she does want
to say goodbye...

417
00:34:42,974 --> 00:34:44,894
I thought this would be the place.

418
00:34:48,814 --> 00:34:51,604
You're wearing the Black Madonna.

419
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:52,774
You're Gypsy?

420
00:34:54,214 --> 00:34:56,814
The part of me that dreams is Gypsy.

421
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,774
My maiden name is Shelby.

422
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:24,694
So...

423
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:28,454
..perhaps you could do me first.

424
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:37,374
No!

425
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,494
No!

426
00:35:45,374 --> 00:35:46,894
NO!

427
00:35:58,414 --> 00:36:00,174
No...

00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,764
All right, Tommy's here.

446
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:24,694
Hang on!

447
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:31,724
John!

448
00:38:31,774 --> 00:38:32,934
I'm coming!

449
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:43,964
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

450
00:38:44,014 --> 00:38:45,884
10 if I'm still sober.

451
00:38:45,934 --> 00:38:48,244
I got it from the doctor -

452
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:51,014
it keeps me nice and calm.

453
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:55,804
Same thing they gave us
in the trenches

454
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:57,364
to stop us fucking wanking.

455
00:38:57,414 --> 00:38:59,244
Polly said it's good for me temper.

456
00:38:59,294 --> 00:39:01,284
~ It slows me down, Tom. ~ Arthur...

457
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:04,324
there are some things
Polly doesn't understand.

458
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:08,004
I need you fast. Not slow, eh?

459
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,004
She wouldn't let go
of my fucking leg.

460
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:12,484
~ I bet that's not all
she wouldn't let go of! ~ Right.

461
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:15,644
You know she's against this, Tom.
She's got opinions.

462
00:39:15,694 --> 00:39:17,284
Nothing wrong with opinions, John.

463
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,934
~ Get in the fucking car. ~ Shut up!

464
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:25,924
Right!

465
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:28,644
The Peaky Blinders are going
on fucking holiday!

466
00:39:28,694 --> 00:39:30,134
Sit down, you mad bastard.

467
00:39:55,534 --> 00:39:58,214
You're against this
the same as me, aren't you?

468
00:40:00,094 --> 00:40:03,044
Look out for anyone putting
big money on Divine Star

469
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:04,654
in the 3:30 at Newmarket.

470
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:07,884
She's one of ours.

471
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,814
Anything over £1, tell me.

472
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:18,934
Polly...

473
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:22,724
I don't wish to pry
into your business

474
00:40:22,774 --> 00:40:25,604
but you should know something.

475
00:40:25,654 --> 00:40:28,364
That woman is a trickster.

476
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:30,124
What woman?

477
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:33,204
Her sister was in
the wash house early,

478
00:40:33,254 --> 00:40:35,934
boasting there'd been
a Shelby at the table.

479
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:40,934
What woman?

480
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:43,734
Gypsies talk to each other.

481
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:47,534
What woman?

482
00:40:50,254 --> 00:40:53,014
You went to see Mrs Price
in the Patch last night.

483
00:40:58,254 --> 00:41:00,084
I'm sorry...

484
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:01,924
So what do you know?

485
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:03,884
I know they push the glass.

486
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:06,404
The man, it's her cousin.
He pushes the glass.

487
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:07,804
It's a trick.

488
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:10,134
They tell you what
you already believe.

489
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:15,444
She set up after the war
because of all the widows.

490
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:19,204
Polly, I just thought
you should know.

491
00:41:19,254 --> 00:41:21,004
And in this fucking wash house,

492
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:22,734
did they tell you why I went there?

493
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,244
You tell a soul in this family,

494
00:41:33,294 --> 00:41:37,254
and I swear I will cut you.

495
00:41:39,134 --> 00:41:43,294
I don't need a knife to stop me
telling secrets given in confidence.

496
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:46,334
It is a matter of honour.

497
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:09,284
Look at this! Look.

498
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:10,924
I love it.

499
00:42:10,974 --> 00:42:13,364
Your Esme was right
about one thing -

500
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:16,484
you can't beat the countryside.

501
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,254
You know, I think I want
to live in the country one day...

502
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:22,804
..and keep chickens.

503
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:25,374
Yeah, we'll see you
in London, Arthur.

504
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:32,534
~ Oh, for fuck's sake! ~ Take these.

505
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:37,444
We need to bury him.

506
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:39,484
Who the fuck is that?

507
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:40,964
It's Irish business.

508
00:42:41,014 --> 00:42:43,604
I thought it best
if I deal with it on my own.

509
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:46,164
Come on, we did a thousand
of these in France.

510
00:42:46,214 --> 00:42:47,964
John, grab his head.

511
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:50,604
So, we're not really
going to London?

512
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,404
Once we bury him,

513
00:42:52,454 --> 00:42:55,214
then the holiday begins.

514
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:21,494
Much obliged.

515
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:33,214
It's a fucking freak show.

516
00:43:52,974 --> 00:43:55,484
What the fuck is that racket?

517
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:58,654
~ This is what they call music
these days, brother. ~ Music?!

518
00:44:16,414 --> 00:44:17,444
Oi!

519
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:19,884
Oi! Put it away.

520
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:21,214
Fuck off!

521
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:28,364
Fucking look at this spot, eh?

522
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:30,214
It's all right, isn't it?

523
00:44:34,974 --> 00:44:38,244
Irish whisky - a bottle.

524
00:44:38,294 --> 00:44:39,534
And hurry up!

525
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,404
Fucking hell,

526
00:44:45,454 --> 00:44:47,374
I recognise a few of these lads.

527
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:52,644
That's Sabini's cousin, over there.

528
00:44:52,694 --> 00:44:55,364
That's right, Arthur,
it's Sabini's club.

529
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:58,764
Jesus Christ,
everybody in here's a fucking face.

530
00:44:58,814 --> 00:45:02,374
Just the lieutenants, John.
No sign of the officers.

531
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,054
Right, let's line them up.

532
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:09,454
Holiday!

533
00:45:11,454 --> 00:45:13,484
Gentlemen, there's been a mistake.

534
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:15,494
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave.

535
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,724
We just bought a fucking bottle.

536
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:21,964
Some of the men here recognise you
from the racetracks in the north.

537
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:24,564
Yeah, we get that a lot.

538
00:45:24,614 --> 00:45:27,764
They say you have no business
coming south of the line

539
00:45:27,814 --> 00:45:29,604
without prior agreement.

540
00:45:29,654 --> 00:45:31,854
And what line would that be,
my friend?

541
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:35,454
They say this is provocation.

542
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:40,174
Right, well, you tell them
we're on holiday.

543
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:43,774
You're breaking the rules.

544
00:45:45,774 --> 00:45:48,844
They say you are
the Peaky Blinders...

545
00:45:48,894 --> 00:45:50,454
Peaky scum!

546
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:15,574
Who the fuck's next?

547
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:20,094
Come here!

548
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:30,574
Put some ice on 'em!

549
00:46:34,854 --> 00:46:36,254
Get out.

550
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:41,134
Yeah?

551
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,084
Yeah?

552
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:46,574
Are you going to use that?

553
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:52,494
Didn't think so.

554
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:11,724
We came here...

555
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:13,774
not to make enemies...

556
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,414
No!

557
00:47:17,894 --> 00:47:20,334
We came here to make new friends.

558
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:27,524
Those of you who are last

559
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:29,614
will soon be first.

560
00:47:33,494 --> 00:47:36,124
And those of you who are downtrodden

561
00:47:36,174 --> 00:47:37,534
will rise up.

562
00:47:39,454 --> 00:47:40,734
Yip.

563
00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:43,814
You know where to find us.

564
00:47:52,774 --> 00:47:54,444
I think I've lost a tooth.

565
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:56,894
I'll have none left at this rate!

566
00:47:58,094 --> 00:47:59,804
Some fucking holiday this is.

567
00:47:59,854 --> 00:48:03,444
Yeah? You all right without
your fucking medicine, Arthur?

568
00:48:03,494 --> 00:48:05,324
~ Here, this'll fix you. ~ Give me that!

569
00:48:05,374 --> 00:48:07,444
You, John boy...eh? How are you?

570
00:48:07,494 --> 00:48:10,364
~ Or should I ask your fucking wife?
~ Oh, give over!

571
00:48:10,414 --> 00:48:12,764
No more talk of chickens,
do you hear me?

572
00:48:12,814 --> 00:48:13,884
Fuck the chickens.

573
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,524
I've 50 quid in me pocket.

574
00:48:15,574 --> 00:48:17,084
Let's paint the town, eh?

575
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:21,254
Come.

576
00:48:25,014 --> 00:48:30,004
~ Oh, dear God! ~ Good Lord,
I assumed it was Betty with tea.

577
00:48:30,054 --> 00:48:33,764
Forgive me, sir, but your secretary
was not at the desk.

578
00:48:33,814 --> 00:48:37,244
No, because she takes lunch -
like normal people.

579
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:38,764
And you can turn around,

580
00:48:38,814 --> 00:48:41,404
this lady is
a professional life model.

581
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:42,974
She does this for a living.

582
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:47,164
I'm more than happy
to come back later, sir.

583
00:48:47,214 --> 00:48:50,054
No, no, no. Later on
I'm in the house. Just, erm...

584
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:54,404
..keep your back turned,
if you must.

585
00:48:59,174 --> 00:49:03,414
I would guess you haven't been
exposed to Bohemian society, Major?

586
00:49:05,094 --> 00:49:08,404
Well, I...I...play cards on occasion.

587
00:49:08,454 --> 00:49:13,204
You're a stranger to cocaine
and exotic dancing, too, I imagine.

588
00:49:13,254 --> 00:49:17,204
I find the more obvious vices
the easiest to resist.

589
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:21,934
It's the sneaky little obscure ones
that bring you to your knees, yes?

590
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:27,004
So what business is so urgent
it trumps lunch?

591
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:29,004
Well, sir, our man in Birmingham

592
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:31,564
has passed his first test
with flying colours.

593
00:49:31,614 --> 00:49:33,484
Oh, I'm horrible at faces.

594
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:38,924
So I think we can begin to
prepare him for the bigger task.

595
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:42,684
~ Expressions elude me,
I think too much. ~ Sir?

596
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:48,764
I need your authority
to proceed with all urgency

597
00:49:48,814 --> 00:49:52,564
in preparing the new man
for the bigger task.

598
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,524
You're talking about
your bookmaker.

599
00:49:55,574 --> 00:49:56,604
Yes, sir.

600
00:49:56,654 --> 00:49:59,934
You have a history with this man.
Why did you choose him?

601
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:05,364
To apply pressure on a man
for this type of work

602
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:06,964
you have to know his weaknesses

603
00:50:07,014 --> 00:50:10,884
and I know this man's weaknesses
intimately.

604
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:13,044
And after "mission accomplished",

605
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:16,164
do we trust him
to keep his mouth shut?

606
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:17,934
Absolutely not, sir.

607
00:50:19,294 --> 00:50:21,724
So when he's served his purpose,

608
00:50:21,774 --> 00:50:23,684
he will be consigned to history

609
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:25,964
in exactly the same way
as his predecessor.

610
00:50:26,014 --> 00:50:29,524
You mean at the end of a rope?

611
00:50:29,574 --> 00:50:31,004
Well, the end of the rope

612
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:35,254
has been this man's destiny
since the night he was born.

613
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:05,854
You're early.

614
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:09,364
Shut your eyes, Lizzie.

615
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:10,684
What?

616
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,614
Shut your eyes.
Go on, shut your eyes.

617
00:51:15,454 --> 00:51:16,604
Good.

618
00:51:16,654 --> 00:51:18,284
Now, come with me.

619
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:19,804
No, shut your eyes!

620
00:51:19,854 --> 00:51:23,124
~ This way. ~ What are you doing, Tom?

621
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:25,374
You've got to sit down
here. Right...

622
00:51:26,574 --> 00:51:30,524
Sit down. Now, OK...

623
00:51:30,574 --> 00:51:32,724
~ Type this. ~ Why?

624
00:51:32,774 --> 00:51:34,244
Lizzie, type this.

625
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:37,884
"If wi..." Put your cigarette down.

626
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:39,804
Right. "If winter comes..."

627
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:44,484
"..then can spring be far behind?"

628
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,844
Why?! Did you say spring?

629
00:51:47,894 --> 00:51:50,614
Lizzie, what comes after winter?

630
00:51:53,734 --> 00:51:55,364
Let's see.

631
00:51:55,414 --> 00:51:57,644
That's a question.
Where's the question mark?

632
00:51:57,694 --> 00:52:00,004
Put in the question mark.

633
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:01,924
Now type this.

634
00:52:01,974 --> 00:52:05,284
"Wanted - secretary
for expanding business."

635
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:06,684
Slow down!

636
00:52:06,734 --> 00:52:09,334
"Must be able to take dictation
and touch-type."

637
00:52:10,614 --> 00:52:13,564
"Five days a week.

638
00:52:13,614 --> 00:52:16,004
"Eight pounds
and four shillings a month.

639
00:52:16,054 --> 00:52:18,374
"Must be able to start immediately."

640
00:52:19,814 --> 00:52:21,094
Are you serious?

641
00:52:24,454 --> 00:52:27,054
Things are starting
to happen, Lizzie.

642
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,814
I need someone who can
look the other way sometimes.

643
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:41,974
And you can stop
the other work too, Lizzie.

644
00:52:43,054 --> 00:52:45,054
All of it this time.

645
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:48,294
No exceptions.

646
00:52:54,774 --> 00:52:57,644
Eight o'clock, Monday morning,
the upstairs office.

647
00:52:57,694 --> 00:52:58,774
Don't be late.

648
00:53:11,494 --> 00:53:13,844
Newmarket was profitable.

649
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:16,804
Arthur told me
how you left your message.

650
00:53:16,854 --> 00:53:19,444
And when I asked him
where his medicine was,

651
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:21,484
he said you poured it away.

652
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:24,604
All I poured away was opium
and bromide.

653
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:27,124
Oh, that's how it works
in London, isn't it?

654
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:29,964
Every boss has to have
a mad dog at his side.

655
00:53:30,014 --> 00:53:33,404
Yeah, somebody who can't be
predicted, somebody mad in the head.

656
00:53:33,454 --> 00:53:35,444
But Thomas Shelby
uses his own brother.

657
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:38,254
~ Stop fucking fighting me!
~ Somebody has to.

658
00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:41,324
That arrived an hour ago.

659
00:53:41,374 --> 00:53:44,964
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

660
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,364
I was going to burn it.

661
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:47,804
I should have.

662
00:53:47,854 --> 00:53:51,084
Well done, Tommy,
you've picked a side.

663
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:52,974
Now you're at war with Sabini.

664
00:54:33,014 --> 00:54:35,324
Ada, are you coming for a drink?

665
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:38,084
No, the woman upstairs
is looking after Karl.

666
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:39,694
She goes mad if I'm late!

667
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,244
Ada Shelby?

668
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:13,414
No.

669
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:23,644
Your brother broke the rules.

670
00:55:23,694 --> 00:55:25,164
I don't have a fucking brother.

671
00:55:25,214 --> 00:55:27,684
Me and my friends here need
a bit of female company.

672
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,284
~ Let's go for a drive. ~ No!

673
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:31,734
~ Hold her steady, boys. ~ Get off!

674
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:44,814
Fucking hold him!

675
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:18,844
Tommy Shelby,
I missed you at my club.

676
00:56:18,894 --> 00:56:21,084
I was at the races.

677
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:22,654
Sabini.

678
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:26,614
Don't say my name.

679
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:29,564
Jesus!

680
00:56:29,614 --> 00:56:33,574
Franco,
take my name out of his mouth.

681
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:45,404
While you're in there,
do a bit of digging for gold.

682
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:46,564
Pay for the petrol.

683
00:57:02,414 --> 00:57:04,564
You see how much I know about you?

684
00:57:04,614 --> 00:57:07,294
I even know what's in
your fucking mouth.

685
00:57:08,494 --> 00:57:09,684
Look at me.

686
00:57:09,734 --> 00:57:11,364
Look at me!

687
00:57:11,414 --> 00:57:12,654
Look at me.

688
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:16,324
You take up with the Jews.

689
00:57:16,374 --> 00:57:18,844
Yeah, you think that's
what London's all about.

690
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,244
You can just come down,
pick a side.

691
00:57:21,294 --> 00:57:23,804
You fucking clown!

692
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:25,614
Now your life is over.

693
00:57:26,774 --> 00:57:30,724
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

694
00:57:30,774 --> 00:57:32,404
Your mistake.

695
00:57:32,454 --> 00:57:34,534
You remember that
when you get to hell.

696
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:41,494
Finish him off.

697
00:58:09,374 --> 00:58:13,814
I suppose we should
see if the bastard's still alive.
