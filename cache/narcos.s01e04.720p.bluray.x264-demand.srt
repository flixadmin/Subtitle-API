1
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,844
Murphy, join t' party, huh?

2
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:41,725
What's wrong?

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,935
All you guys having a good time?

4
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:46,604
You gotta let it go, man.
There's good that came out of this.

5
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:49,566
Yeah, we used him,
then we got him killed.

6
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,402
No, we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

7
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,863
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

8
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,157
Look on the bright side, huh?

9
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:03,080
Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

10
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:07,584
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

11
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,003
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

12
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:16,384
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

13
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:20,055
Finally, the Colombian government
had to react.

14
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:24,183
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

15
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,103
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100,000 REWARD

16
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:31,357
Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.

17
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,112
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

18
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,614
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US,

19
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,199
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

20
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,536
This made all the difference in the world.

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,539
If you were a narco in Colombia,

22
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:49,459
jail time meant banging girls,
watching movies,

23
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,252
hanging with the fellas...

24
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:55,339
Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.

25
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:57,258
It was a fucking joke.

26
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,844
Back home,
it was a whole different deal.

27
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:03,723
The seventh richest man in the world?
No one gives a shit.

28
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:08,103
You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day,
just like every other loser,

29
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:09,729
a fucking nightmare.

30
00:02:09,938 --> 00:02:13,650
Now Pablo had someone to fear: us.

31
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,369
Extradition doesn't mean anything
unless you can catch him.

32
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:50,997
- With our help, you will.
- Oh, that's right.

33
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,582
Gringos to the rescue.

34
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,419
It's one fucking man
against the United States of America.

35
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:00,965
One man with helicopters, airplanes,
vehicles, planned escape routes,

36
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,814
- and a network of informants.
- Our government will provide money,

37
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,304
- men, weapons...
- You make it sound so easy.

38
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:10,433
But Escobar has always
managed to stay one step ahead of us.

39
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:12,936
Help us catch him.

40
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:17,023
I'll never be assigned to this.
Jaramillo hates my guts.

41
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:18,691
Let me take care of that.

42
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,654
- You think extradition's a victory.
- It is.

43
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,247
Escobar will not go lightly.

44
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,710
He will make Colombia bleed.

45
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,342
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

46
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,013
You make the mistakes,
and then you preach solidarity?

47
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:51,432
- Shut up, fag.
- What the fuck, Carlos?

48
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,602
Why are you always defending him?

49
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:56,646
Did he get your sister back
for you or not?

50
00:04:56,854 --> 00:05:00,524
We rescued her because we did it together.
Right?

51
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,489
Gentlemen...

52
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,619
I suggest we form another organization

53
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:15,123
to fight against
the injustice of extradition.

54
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:17,416
Like John Lennon said,

55
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,962
- "Come together, brothers and sisters..."
- Stop that fag shit right now.

56
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:24,174
So Jorge...

57
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,301
what will we call it?

58
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,638
First, "Death to Kidnappers,"
then "the Extraditables."

59
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:36,060
Once again, the narcos were united
against a common enemy: jail in America.

60
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:39,772
But it was not quite like
"one for all, and all for one."

61
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,527
It was more like each man for himself.

62
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,029
Next!

63
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:50,241
Gacha, being Gacha, decided that
all he had to do to defeat extradition

64
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,371
- was kill anyone who tried to arrest him.
- Fire!

65
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:57,707
So he hired a bunch of
Israeli mercenaries and prepared for war.

66
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,790
Next!

67
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,586
Lehder, being Lehder, got high as a kite
and took to the airwaves.

68
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:06,049
The gringos
are the ones who use the drugs.

69
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:10,511
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

70
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,722
I'm not sure how helpful that was.

71
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,641
I mean, all of our problems...

72
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,021
are because of those imperialist gringos!

73
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,648
No, stay there... stay there.

74
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:26,694
As for the Ochoa brothers,
they went with a fancy PR firm

75
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:30,323
and got ripped off because, well...
that's what PR agencies do.

76
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,533
"Better a grave in Colombia

77
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:34,077
than a grave in the United States."

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,122
No, I've got it, Fabio, I've got it.
Let's see...

79
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,752
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

80
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,295
- What do you think?
- I love it.

81
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,714
Very good.

82
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:50,218
And for $50,000 more,
we'll make your logo.

83
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,303
Done.

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,393
By the way,
here's the logo $50,000 got you.

85
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:02,146
In the upcoming presidential election,
extradition became the defining issue

86
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,564
amongst the candidates.

87
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:06,234
Those the narcos could buy,
they bought.

88
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:08,527
The ones they could scare,
they scared.

89
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:11,489
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

90
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,576
And so, unable to buy him
and unable to scare him,

91
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:18,871
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery,

92
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,873
and he wrote Galán a letter.

93
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,670
"And to conclude, I want
to express my most energetic protest

94
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:29,466
over the improper interference
of North America

95
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:32,427
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

96
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,553
of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

97
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:37,265
He's got some balls.

98
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:39,058
Escobar is shameless.

99
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:43,729
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency, Mr. Galán.

100
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,857
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States,

101
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:49,819
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

102
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,780
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

103
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:55,741
My campaign manager,
Dr. Gaviria,

104
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:58,286
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

105
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:02,373
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle,

106
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:05,168
when clearly,
they're losing a war.

107
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,212
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

108
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,592
If you speak in favor
of extradition, you will be their puppet,

109
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:16,012
and that will be your death sentence.

110
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,350
I don't care about the Americans, but I am
still going to support extradition.

111
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,686
Besides, if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country,

112
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,104
then let them take them.

113
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:26,689
Since he couldn't get to Galán,

114
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,526
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

115
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,445
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

116
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,655
if no judge was willing to apply it.

117
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,327
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons

118
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,663
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States,

119
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:46,125
know we, the Extraditables,
will pass judgment on you

120
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,794
and bring a sentence far harsher."

121
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:51,172
The judges were so scared and intimidated

122
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:54,008
that special court procedures
had to be created.

123
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:56,553
For the first time
in the history of Colombia,

124
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:59,514
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

125
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:01,349
Defendants, please rise.

126
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,896
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

127
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:13,903
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

128
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,323
Despite his threats,
many brave men defied him.

129
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,953
And true to form,
when the pen failed...

130
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,039
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

131
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:34,048
In light of this terrorism,
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

132
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:37,968
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority, right?

133
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:39,470
Well, guess again.

134
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:43,433
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

135
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,144
All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

136
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,940
We got FARC, we got M-19,
we got EPL, we got ELN,

137
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,568
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

138
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:57,405
Sorry, Agent Peña, but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems,

139
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,782
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

140
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:03,786
Communists. Remember them?

141
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,291
With Reagan in the White House,
it was hard to forget.

142
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,417
In his words:

143
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,629
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

144
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:17,007
The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing, always had been.

145
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,637
In Hollywood, he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

146
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:23,722
In Washington,
he created the Reagan Doctrine,

147
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:26,476
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

148
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:30,020
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

149
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:33,691
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world,

150
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:34,942
you'd better be chasing reds.

151
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,529
Ambassador, if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets,

152
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:40,573
the Colombians will get Escobar.

153
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:43,701
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

154
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:46,412
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

155
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:51,584
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

156
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:54,920
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker, and as such,

157
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:59,967
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

158
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:05,222
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

159
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:06,932
Let the Colombians get him.

160
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:11,103
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100,000

161
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,357
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah, it's a fucking joke.

162
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,192
That's about what he spends on shoes,
isn't it?

163
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,362
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

164
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,863
So what do we do now?

165
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,449
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

166
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,120
It's true,
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

167
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,956
But delivered into the right hands,
it could make a difference.

168
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:35,794
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia,
honorable men.

169
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:40,758
But the head of counternarcotics,
General Jaramillo, wasn't one of 'em.

170
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:45,971
And as such,
he was exactly what we needed.

171
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:48,725
Thank you for seeing me, General.

172
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,434
You're welcome.

173
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:54,104
Listen, I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

174
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:58,568
With all due respect, General Jaramillo...
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

175
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,820
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

176
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,740
Well, I don't want him to follow.

177
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,242
I want him to lead.

178
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,332
Go ahead.

179
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,544
Yes, General.

180
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:18,755
As you wish.

181
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,005
Understood.

182
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,219
What happened, honey?

183
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:27,096
Things with work.

184
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,390
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

185
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:33,352
I'm making the chicken he likes,
but he's out with the girlfriend.

186
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,441
Tell me what's wrong.

187
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:41,360
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

188
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,784
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

189
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,788
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man,

190
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,540
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

191
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:56,667
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

192
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:58,753
Hm.

193
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:03,257
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back, well, then...

194
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,259
I didn't hear them complaining, did I?

195
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:08,011
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

196
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:10,931
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

197
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,852
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police, you know?

198
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,295
And most of all, to the top brass.

199
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:19,189
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

200
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:20,357
Mm.

201
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,322
Oh, shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

202
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,116
Egrets from the Himalayas.

203
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,703
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

204
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:35,873
They cost me a million dollars.

205
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,131
Bastards.

206
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:47,844
Stay in the fucking tree!

207
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:00,439
Seems like you lost that dough,
eh, cousin?

208
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,610
That's your problem, Pablo.

209
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:07,196
You think that everything
can be controlled,

210
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,782
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

211
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:15,705
OK, OK, OK, Gustavo... OK.

212
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,083
Your English is really good.

213
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:23,295
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

214
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:25,005
How long you been at the comuna?

215
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:27,174
Just a few weeks.

216
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:29,802
Is your husband
gonna help us here, too?

217
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:33,222
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

218
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,060
Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

219
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:46,276
- I fucked up.
- How?

220
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,000
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

221
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:50,113
No, Jaramillo's sending a message.

222
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,869
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

223
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:57,496
He's setting Carrillo up for failure,
and when he does fail,

224
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,915
he'll fire him for incompetence,

225
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:01,792
and me and you,
we lose the only cop we can trust.

226
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:05,671
- Hey!
- Hey!

227
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:07,464
- Sorry I'm late, honey.
- Mm...

228
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:11,009
Javier, this is my friend, Elisa.

229
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,893
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

230
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,012
Nice to meet you.

231
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:18,517
Are you another... janitor at the embassy,
like Steve?

232
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,686
No, actually, I'm CIA.

233
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:24,189
But that's classified,
so don't tell anybody.

234
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:27,818
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

235
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:30,613
- The janitor thing, what, that was you?
- Mm.

236
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,865
No, it's just a cover.

237
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,367
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

238
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:38,412
Just so you know,
I'm a communist guerrillera.

239
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:41,707
Perfect.

240
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,376
If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

241
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:47,004
we probably wouldn't have cared.

242
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:49,381
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

243
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:52,551
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

244
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:55,679
He had better resources
and better information.

245
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,223
And at the time,
he owned over 800 homes and fincas,

246
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:01,310
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

247
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:04,981
And cops...
he owned a lot of them, too.

248
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:06,231
But not all of them.

249
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,778
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

250
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:13,405
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

251
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,741
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

252
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:19,453
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

253
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,082
Trapped a little bird.

254
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,794
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

255
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:29,045
Jesus.

256
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:36,846
Just remember that you wanted all in.

257
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:38,931
Hand me that coffee.

258
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:53,195
He already gave up
the name of three fincas,

259
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,531
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

260
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,660
But you do know
where he is hiding, don't you?

261
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:22,766
Look, little brother,

262
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,103
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

263
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,024
But I will also kill you.

264
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:32,192
And very slowly.

265
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:36,405
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

266
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:41,118
Well, then, you should pray we find him,
and quickly.

267
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:46,999
We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out,

268
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:50,627
but there was a small part of me
that thought, in his arrogance,

269
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,838
he would stand and fight.

270
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:55,382
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

271
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,342
Boss!

272
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:58,427
Poison...

273
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,803
Boss!

274
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:04,058
They were headed for El Bizcocho,
but they got off the main highway.

275
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:06,894
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

276
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:08,228
Two hours, boss.

277
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,774
Round up the guys,
and tell them to get ready.

278
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,776
- We're leaving.
- All right.

279
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,864
We have to go.

280
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,158
Go where?

281
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,952
The police are coming.

282
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,287
- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry, my love,

283
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,249
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

284
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:31,209
We'll buy new ones later,
won't we?

285
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:36,339
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,176
Do you hear me complaining?

287
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:47,225
As long as you're with us, Pablo,
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

288
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,237
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- Yes, sir.

289
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,656
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

290
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,909
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

291
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:05,285
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

292
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:07,830
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

293
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:14,461
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

294
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,213
Yes, sir!

295
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,107
What's wrong, Gustavo?

296
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,568
You fucked us, Pablo.

297
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,198
Not only you and me.

298
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,907
You fucked the whole family.

299
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,623
But of course, since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

300
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,378
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country,

301
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,797
the rest of us get screwed,
isn't that right?

302
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:06,471
But what the fuck...

303
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:10,308
a man only dies once, right?

304
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:14,688
Come here.

305
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,863
My brother.

306
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,491
I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

307
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:30,662
There we go.

308
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:43,800
I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

309
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,344
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time,

310
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:50,807
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

311
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:54,978
You may have 800 houses, my friend,
but none of them is home.

312
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:58,148
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life,

313
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:01,193
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

314
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:03,779
From now on, nowhere is safe.

315
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,217
The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

316
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,636
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

317
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:32,933
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

318
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:37,729
Hey, if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out, too.

319
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,733
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

320
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:44,611
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

321
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:47,197
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

322
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,370
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit,
I got very lucky.

323
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:58,167
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

324
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,003
We raided it,
and guess who we found?

325
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,255
Blackbeard.

326
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:06,716
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

327
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:10,304
In custody,
he would describe a cocaine empire

328
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:14,224
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

329
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:17,102
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

330
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:21,523
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice,

331
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,817
home of Colombia's supreme court,

332
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,444
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

333
00:22:27,988 --> 00:22:32,242
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

334
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:33,702
Fuck.

335
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:37,497
Fuck.

336
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,624
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

337
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,877
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

338
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,296
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

339
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,506
Javi, there's some good stuff in here,
stuff we can use.

340
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:48,758
None of it can leave the room.

341
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,636
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

342
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,556
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

343
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,309
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

344
00:23:03,357 --> 00:23:04,524
Take 'em.

345
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,695
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

346
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:10,739
What are you talking about?

347
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,283
Do you want to catch Pablo
or not?

348
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:19,122
- Why me?
- Because they'll suspect me.

349
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:21,666
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

350
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,460
They're not gonna
search a white boy, OK?

351
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:25,795
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

352
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:26,963
Just do it.

353
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,593
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

354
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,721
- And sometimes, bad people...
- Señor.

355
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,056
Help you do good things.

356
00:23:37,057 --> 00:23:39,684
These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

357
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:43,813
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

358
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,399
Yes.

359
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:51,488
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

360
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:53,073
Obviously, it's an alias.

361
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:57,077
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle."

362
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,413
Because he's not Colombian.

363
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:05,001
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

364
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:06,836
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

365
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,007
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

366
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:15,637
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

367
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,767
Suarez, do you ever worry
what will happen to you

368
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,146
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

369
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,857
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

370
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,569
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

371
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:37,451
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

372
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:41,413
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

373
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:49,879
Wha... What the fuck is this?

374
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:51,589
This is me giving you homework.

375
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:54,050
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

376
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,885
And I need you to find out who it is.

377
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,847
First off, I don't fucking work for you,
Murphy, you hear me?

378
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,808
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

379
00:25:04,394 --> 00:25:06,355
What's he up to these days?

380
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,730
Barry Seal.

381
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,116
Barry Seal, a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football,

382
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,869
mind-altering chemicals,
and pussy...

383
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:23,497
which made him perfect CIA material.

384
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,792
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

385
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:30,587
Finding Barry was easy.

386
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,756
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

387
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,301
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite, too.

388
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:39,185
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

389
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:42,391
No, I'm serious.

390
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:44,767
Look.

391
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:48,063
Oh, my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

392
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:49,606
Until next time.

393
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:56,112
- Goddamn, is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

394
00:25:57,364 --> 00:25:59,616
Come on, we got you a ride
waiting over here.

395
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,368
Hi, Vanessa.

396
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,080
It's fun to say, though,
ain't it? "McPickle"?

397
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,503
Have a seat, Barry.

398
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:20,220
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

399
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:23,014
Well, you guys ain't got shit.

400
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:27,852
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

401
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,938
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

402
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:34,734
Yeah? Well, let's see
if that holds up in court, huh?

403
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:38,530
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

404
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:40,323
without making a refueling stop.

405
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,743
Yeah, according to the records,
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

406
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:46,371
The manifests don't lie.

407
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:50,584
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine,

408
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:54,337
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?

409
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:58,300
Well, damn...
you guys are good.

410
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,717
Communist sympathizer.

411
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,803
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big, red bow

412
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,731
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

413
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:06,266
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments,

414
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:08,893
that's treason and trafficking.

415
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:11,354
What's that,
two life sentences for the price of one?

416
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,565
That's right.

417
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:20,697
Well... see,
I figured this day might come.

418
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,825
Why don't you uncuff me, boys.
I got something to show you.

419
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,034
Yeah? What's that?

420
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:27,829
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

421
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,291
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on, uncuff me.

422
00:27:31,374 --> 00:27:33,876
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

423
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,922
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

424
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:42,051
'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas,

425
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:44,929
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

426
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:47,724
for cocaine shipments to the US.

427
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:51,853
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

428
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,271
I couldn't have made that up.

429
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:55,231
- Holy shit.
- It was too good.

430
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:58,109
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait, wait, wait. No.

431
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:00,945
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

432
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:04,491
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

433
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:06,743
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

434
00:28:06,826 --> 00:28:10,288
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

435
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,624
- You know, I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

436
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:16,211
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

437
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:28,848
I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants,

438
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:32,018
but frankly,
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

439
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:33,978
He was just another busted trafficker

440
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:37,649
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

441
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:41,361
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

442
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:44,614
to get the resources we needed,
then fuck him.

443
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:47,033
Strange bedfellows, indeed.

444
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:50,870
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

445
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,039
Washington is gonna go crazy.

446
00:28:53,873 --> 00:28:55,542
Thank you, Ambassador.

447
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,962
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

448
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:01,172
Of course.

449
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,508
Thank you.

450
00:29:06,886 --> 00:29:11,474
In Washington, "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

451
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:15,562
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

452
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:18,565
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

453
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:23,069
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

454
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:26,322
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

455
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:29,659
This picture shows Federico Vaughan,

456
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:33,580
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua,

457
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:38,627
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

458
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,923
No, there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

459
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:47,260
Being a rat is a dangerous business,

460
00:29:47,343 --> 00:29:49,471
and Escobar's reach was long.

461
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,181
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

462
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,395
and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

463
00:29:57,604 --> 00:29:58,896
Whoops.

464
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:08,406
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

465
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,618
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña, if he wanted a long life,

466
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:14,454
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

467
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:17,290
I didn't kill him, Escobar did.

468
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,585
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

469
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:22,838
Look on the bright side, man.

470
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:26,800
From then on, according to Reagan,

471
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:30,345
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

472
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:34,056
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

473
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,101
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

474
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,606
planes, helicopters,
you fucking name it. Everything.

475
00:30:46,486 --> 00:30:50,824
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

476
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:55,453
and burn 'em straight to the ground,
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

477
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:58,581
We were kicking ass,
and the narcos were feeling it.

478
00:30:59,332 --> 00:31:02,126
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

479
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:06,506
Despite all this, we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

480
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:10,301
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether,

481
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,136
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

482
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:13,345
Got it!

483
00:31:14,764 --> 00:31:17,517
The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia,

484
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:21,062
Medellín's biggest processing lab,
and we hit it hard.

485
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,482
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

486
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:27,318
but in the end,
it got us our biggest victory to date,

487
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:31,698
the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.

488
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:34,868
In my tent is a bag with $50,000...

489
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:36,953
ten times this if you give me one hour.

490
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:41,457
There's no way out,
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

491
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,589
Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States,

492
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:53,135
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

493
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:58,349
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

494
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,479
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

495
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:06,900
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán,

496
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:11,237
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

497
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,656
Extradition would become his battle cry.

498
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,658
Gentlemen?

499
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,703
Thank you.

500
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:23,792
And for the narcos,
this was a declaration of war.

501
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,004
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

502
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,300
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

503
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:36,053
against the legality of extradition.

504
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:41,058
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

505
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,728
Can we buy someone in that court?

506
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:46,898
Unfortunately, no.

507
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:50,443
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

508
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:54,530
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

509
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:57,408
Brother... even after he's dead,

510
00:32:57,617 --> 00:33:00,870
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

511
00:33:00,954 --> 00:33:02,872
He's totally fucked.

512
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,582
This is gringo bullshit.

513
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:08,461
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

514
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,797
We're next, aren't we?

515
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:12,882
You're right.

516
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:14,884
Pablito?

517
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:16,469
Do you have an answer or what?

518
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:26,103
Well... in my opinion, a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

519
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:30,358
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

520
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,028
Carlos was one of us.

521
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:39,909
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

522
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,277
But remember,
there's something they want more than us.

523
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:45,456
So, brothers...

524
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:48,629
it's time to give them what they want,
isn't it?

525
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:53,422
I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

526
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:56,801
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

527
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:01,263
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

528
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:06,644
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

529
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,439
Two million US dollars.

530
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,150
It's very dangerous.

531
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,114
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

532
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:23,036
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous, right?

533
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:35,798
But for us, brother...

534
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:40,386
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

535
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:45,100
We have an historical obligation.

536
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,062
We can't forget that.

537
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:50,772
I'm his girlfriend.

538
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,948
Meet Pablo Escobar.

539
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:04,035
Miss.

540
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:06,788
- OK.
- We have a deal.

541
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,289
All right, then.

542
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:11,542
We were just leaving.

543
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:12,961
Good night.

544
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:22,595
What the hell is this?

545
00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:24,806
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

546
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,601
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

547
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:31,395
In exchange for what?

548
00:35:31,604 --> 00:35:36,025
Unless you are willing to be part of it,
I cannot say.

549
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:43,116
It's a partnership,
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

550
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,578
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

551
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:04,512
Connie?

552
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,430
Elisa? What's going on?

553
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:08,766
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

554
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,852
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

555
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,145
Yeah.

556
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:13,993
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

557
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:15,272
About what?

558
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:19,443
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

559
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:21,570
I don't know what it is,
but I know it's gonna be bad.

560
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:24,657
Wait, Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

561
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:28,285
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

562
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:29,829
and you need to hide me.

563
00:36:31,164 --> 00:36:32,748
OK. Come on.

564
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:39,255
Steve's already at work,
but Javi lives downstairs.

565
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,598
I just hope he's here.

566
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,100
I am.

567
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,645
- Well, what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

568
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:56,231
I'll be right back. Go.

569
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:02,904
- She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

570
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,987
Hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

571
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:08,367
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

572
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,870
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

573
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:12,121
Escobar and M-19?

574
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:14,498
She didn't tell me any details,
just that it would be bad.

575
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,500
No... that doesn't make any sense.

576
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:19,378
She asked me to hide her,
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

577
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:20,504
OK. All right.

578
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:34,973
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

579
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:38,231
Ambassador, I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

580
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:40,942
- supreme court building.
- Oh, my God.

581
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,945
"Oh, my God" is right.

582
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:48,490
Financed by Escobar, the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

583
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,077
and occupied the supreme court.

584
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:54,371
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

585
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:58,126
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

586
00:37:58,334 --> 00:37:59,877
but it was all bullshit.

587
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,213
The military attacked.

588
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:04,173
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage,

589
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:07,718
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

590
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,346
Most of the M-19 were killed.

591
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:14,600
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

592
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:21,983
setting fire to the room that contained
600,000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

593
00:38:23,192 --> 00:38:25,736
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

594
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:33,328
In the United States,
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

595
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,412
so they can't testify in court.

596
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:40,876
In Colombia, Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

597
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:47,216
The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

598
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,844
as cannon shells exploded inside.

599
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,187
- Where is she?
- Well, come on in.

600
00:38:59,395 --> 00:39:02,606
You, up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

601
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,983
Put the gun away.

602
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,152
Put it away.

603
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:09,364
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

604
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:11,615
- Can I say something?
- No, you may not.

605
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:15,244
Murphy... calm down.

606
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:18,956
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

607
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,209
Your wife brought her to me.

608
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:25,629
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife, I truly do,

609
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:27,756
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

610
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,759
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

611
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,016
If she can tie Escobar to the siege,
I say we bring her in.

612
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:38,684
Well, she's M-19.

613
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:41,145
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

614
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:42,479
and then she gets disappeared.

615
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:44,815
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

616
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:47,026
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

617
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:49,445
Look, all she did was warn us.

618
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:51,989
She's not on anybody's radar.

619
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:54,158
She's not involved in anything.

620
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:02,166
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

621
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,668
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

622
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:08,797
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

623
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:11,508
Folks, this is more complicated
than what it seems.

624
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:15,096
This was Escobar, classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

625
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:18,933
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

626
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:22,144
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

627
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,563
He doesn't hold grudges,
not if it suits his purposes.

628
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:28,567
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

629
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:31,195
You willing to identify this informant,
Agent Peña?

630
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:34,990
- No, I am not.
- Needless to say...

631
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:38,660
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

632
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:40,871
in light of this communist aggression.

633
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,831
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

634
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,876
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

635
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:09,191
They're looking for us everywhere.

636
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:11,235
What did you expect?

637
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:13,279
That it would be any different?

638
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:19,827
You did a very good job.

639
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:37,094
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

640
00:41:37,303 --> 00:41:40,348
No, brother.
The truth is, you helped mine.

641
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:45,060
You, Ivan...

642
00:41:46,145 --> 00:41:49,398
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

643
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:53,944
The same one that freed this country.

644
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,536
Now it belongs to you.

645
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:11,462
With it, you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

646
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:17,634
I promise you,
I will continue the fight.

647
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:19,803
You earned it, brother.

648
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,098
As for me...

649
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:26,435
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

650
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,979
We are also...

651
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,486
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

652
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:38,864
And the fucking sword.
