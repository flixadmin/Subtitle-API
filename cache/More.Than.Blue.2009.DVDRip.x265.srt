00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,730
Hey, Jung-sik?

7
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:56,974
How is it?

8
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:58,508
What do you think.

9
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:00,843
I need it for the drama next week

10
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:02,278
so tell him it's great!

11
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,113
Like Seung-chul ever listens to me.

12
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:07,416
Then make him. He's gotta do this song.

13
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:10,716
But the lyrics are weak, man.

14
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:13,322
What the suits say
goes. That's show biz.

15
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,314
Whatever, man!

16
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,193
- Hold up!
- What is it?

17
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:18,327
You like this song?

18
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,561
Of course! Why?

19
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:23,165
Singing about a girl to
come back to me at my age?

20
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,867
My heart this and tears that...

21
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:26,869
Isn't it childish?

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,138
No! It's perfect! Don't you think?

23
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:30,840
It's great.

24
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,074
Make your fans really
feel the song, man!

25
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:35,076
But I don't feel anything!

26
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:38,780
You can do it, man. Feel me?

27
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:39,782
- It's great!
- No.

28
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,773
It's not working for me.

29
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:46,188
Seung-chul! Come on!

30
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,521
Get him!

31
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:49,921
Seung-chul!

32
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,592
Yes, director.

You always do this to me.

Please?

50
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:27,628

<i>Producer HONG Jung-pyo</i>
So get me a good song and I'll sing it!

52

Damn!

53
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,901
What about 'Hee-ya'?

54
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:35,536
'Hee-ya, please look at me.'

55
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:37,171
Give me a break.

56
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,807
That was a hit only cuz you sang it.

57
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:42,343
Wanna hear this song I got?

58
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:43,444
What is it?

59
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:45,846
It's off a flopped album.

60
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:48,048
Forget it, kid!

61
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:50,351
Let's hear it.

62
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,616
Really? Turn it on.

63
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:00,524
<i>To give you everything
and all my love...</i>

64
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:03,429
Who wrote this? The lyrics are great.

65
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,127
Really? Then let's ask
them to write our lyrics.

66
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:08,735
Who wrote this?

67
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:12,205
Not sure. I got this off someone.

68
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,007
Who?

69
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,541
Min-chul. He used to
work for KIM Gap-sik.

70
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,772
Gap-sik? I know him well.

71
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,815
Hey, didn't he leave the biz?

72
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,083
Who does your friend work for now?

73
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,352
He left the biz, too.

74
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,387
What does he do?

75
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:29,583
He runs a cafe in Chung-pyung.

76
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,484
Wanna go over, Seung-chul?

77
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,958
- Know where it is?
- Yes.

78
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:35,763
Lead the way.

79
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38,323
<i>Director WON</i>

80
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,194
Got the album?

81
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,532
Ah, here.

82
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:48,607
What's the title?

83
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,505
It's the second track.

84
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:53,074
Second track?

85
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,619
'No one else like Thee' by Cream?

86
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,019
What's her real name?

87
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:06,956
I think it was EUN Won. 
Yeah, that's it.

88
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,956
Got her number?

89
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:10,596
She's gone.

90
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:12,898
Gone? To where?

91
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,567
Right after KANG Chul-kyu left...

92
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:19,732
KANG knows her well?

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,701
Of course. He was
totally in love with her.

94
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:28,206
Do you have KANG's number?

95
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,846
- He died.
- He's dead?

96
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,217
When?

97
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:35,710
About a month after
he married off EUN Won.

98
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,853
Mr. KANG!

99
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:42,418
What was the name of his show?

100
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,495
'Ugly Ducklings in Love'.

101
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:46,831
Yeah, that's it!

102
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:50,034
He married off the woman he loved?

103
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:52,902
- What does that mean?
- Well...

104
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,138
Tell us what happened.

105
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:00,506
It's a long story.

106
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,225
Hi, Chul-kyu!

107
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:08,310
<i>KANG said he saw stars</i>

108
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:09,679
<i>when he first met Cream.</i>

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,671
Why you little punk!

110
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,123
<i>Like he'd been slapped
on the back of his head.</i>

111
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:23,348
<i>He said it was love
at first sight.</i>

112
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,194
<i>Without even talking to her.</i>

113
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:28,889
<i>I asked,</i>

114
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,863
<i>'Shouldn't you at least
say a few words, first? '</i>

115
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:33,559
<i>Then he said...</i>

116
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:38,464
<i>If you need words,
then how can mutes love?</i>

117
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:55,791
How did you know my name?

118
00:06:55,792 --> 00:07:00,024
Isn't it a waste living
in this big place alone?

119
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,829
Want me to live with you?

120
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,486
Think of a name for me,
and I'll make one for you.

121
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,580
We can't change our names.

122
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:29,481
Why not?

123
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:32,959
<i>Her name is Cream
and my name is K.</i>

124
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:35,863
<i>She was cold like ice cream,</i>

125
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:38,666
<i>- but also sweet like ice cream.
- The curtains won't do.</i>

126
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,867
We're changing everything.

127
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:42,462
<i>And she was soft like ice cream.</i>

128
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:48,772
<i>And I'm not A, B, C,
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K...</i>

129
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,839
<i>But just K.</i>

130
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:06,786
<i>We had a lot in common.</i>

131
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:11,221
<i>We were the same age.
We both liked noodles.</i>

132
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,896
<i>We loved listening to
music on rainy days.</i>

133
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:19,800
<i>We loved coffee.</i>

134
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:24,574
<i>We hated school.</i>

135
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,880
<i>She liked me.</i>

136
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,886
<i>And I liked her.</i>

137
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,957
<i>And we were both orphans.</i>

138
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,396
<i>Prison and love...</i>

139
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,264
<i>Once you're stuck,
you can't get out.</i>

140
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:54,432
<i>I fell in love with Cream.</i>

141
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,243
<i>Even the very air she breathed.</i>

142
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,653
<i>Romeo must've been so worried...</i>

143
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:14,690
<i>loving Juliet, but
afraid he might lose her.</i>

144
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:22,867
<i>Why did he drink the poison?</i>

145
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:27,433
<i>Perhaps he knew.</i>

146
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:31,243
<i>To love someone</i>

147
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:33,474
<i>- is to give her everything.
- I'll visit often.</i>

148
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:42,983
<i>I received so much from her
like the catcher who gets the ball.</i>

149
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:47,358
<i>Love was like dry ice.
Sometimes cold, sometimes hot.</i>

150
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,417
Wait!

151
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,357
<i>Cream was so loveable.</i>

152
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:58,130
<i>But I couldn't tell her
that I loved her.</i>

153
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:06,774
<i>Cuz I had cancer cells in me
ready to strike at any time.</i>

154

<i>More than Blue</i>

155
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,257
Thank you, Mr. KIM.

156
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:57,728
It's the least I can do.

157
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:01,098
Writers need to eat well
to do all that thinking.

158
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:06,636
Have some soup with the
Kimbap and chew carefully.

159
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:08,739
Is this your new singer?

160
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,168
Greet them, girl. They're
the best writers in SBC.

161
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:20,484
Hello, I'm Cat Girl. I
promise to sing my heart out.

162
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,680
Damn right you should.

163
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:25,021
Great outfit.

164
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:28,115
It's a new concept. She's a cat.

165
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,426
It's Cat Girl.

166
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:34,897
This gal's got brains.

167
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:38,000
She's a student at Seoul University.

168
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,662
Really?

169
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,005
It's Seoul University of Arts.

170
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:45,031
Who's side are you on?

171
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:47,810
You could get in trouble for
lying about schools these days.

172
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:52,314
If you're so holy, go be a cop instead.

173
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:53,373
Sorry.

174
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,051
Mr. Kang!

175
00:11:58,155 --> 00:11:59,055
How are you?

176
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:03,253
Here's Seung-chul's
new album. It's deep.

177
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:06,862
- It's a sure hit.
- I'm sure it's great.

178
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:07,930
- Say hi.
- Hello.

179
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,193
Call me K.

180
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,567
Let's go for drinks some time.

181
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:13,297
- Sounds great.
- Bye.

182
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:17,173
Seoul Univ. of Arts. Same difference.

183
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:18,473
That's right.

184
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:19,907
Did you eat, sir?

185
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:21,910
Mr. Kang!

186
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,212
- How've you been?
- I waited so long for you.

187
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:27,882
She's Cats. Damn, I keep forgetting.

188
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,976
It's Cat Girl, sir.

189
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:33,883
Go on and introduce yourself, girl.

190
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:38,793
I'm Cat Girl. I promise
to sing my heart out.

191
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:39,961
Thank you.

192
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:42,624
Of course you should.

193
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:45,867
Let's go some place
quiet to talk, Mr. Kang.

194
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,200
See you folks later.

195
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:53,007
- Come on, what are pals for.
- I can't.

196
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:56,944
It's just a show of my appreciation.

197
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:58,746
The album's finished?

198
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:02,450
I put together all the
best songwriters around.

199
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:05,682
You know me, I get what I want.

200
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:07,355
How is she?

201
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:10,858
Oh, her? Not bad.

202
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:14,862
But she has trouble getting
along with the others.

203
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:17,197
Still she's got talent. Be nice.

204
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:20,793
Of course. Anything for you.

205
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,038
- But do this for me.
- I can't.

206
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,530
It's not much. Please, take it!

207
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:34,781
I can't sleep at the thought of you.

208
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:40,152
My dear love.

209
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,661
That part you just sang. Try
not to scream it this time.

210
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:49,653
You'll scare 'em off.

211
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,295
How, sir?

212
00:13:54,569 --> 00:14:00,006
How would you feel if someone
screamed they loved you?

213
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:05,677
You know, softly and
tenderly? You're good at that.

214
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:10,375
What? Not that. Stop making me do it.

215
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:15,113
- That's not what I meant!
- Roll it!

216
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,497
What's she so good at?

217
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:30,495
Drop it will ya, man?

218
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,936
Come on. Just between us?

219
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,377
She's my future. That's
all I can tell ya, man.

220
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:48,052
Did you fix the second verse?

221
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,655
What?

222
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,389
The climax on the second verse.

223
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,822
'Always like yesterday'?

224
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,088
It's a little corny, isn't it?

225
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,995
'A world without love? ' How's that?

226
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,998
Like that's not corny?

227
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,843
It's just a suggestion.

228
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:21,944
Let's not get too excited here.

229
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,592
You two write it, then. I'm out.

230
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,661
What?

231
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,899
So feisty.

232
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,658
Do you have to become a singer?

233
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,153
What?

234
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,568
Got enough medication left?

235
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:31,247
My damn connection to your family.

236
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:38,586
First your father, now you.

237
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:43,491
There are too many illnesses
that can't be cured.

238
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:03,750
What's wrong?

239
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:10,123
What is it?

240
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,330
Don't cry.

241
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:16,856
Stop crying.

242
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:21,294
The bastards told me to rewrite it.

243
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:31,002
'If I could live again'.
How's that for the title?

244
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:34,146
'If I could live again? '

245
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:40,150
If you could, what would
you like to be reborn as?

246
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:43,289
Besides a person?

247
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,022
Anything.

248
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:50,197
Well...

249
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,098
If I could live again...

250
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,340
A ring?

251
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,740
Wait.

252
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,075
Start over.

253
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,815
If I could be born again...

254
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:16,387
A ring.

255
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,484
A pair of glasses.

256
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,623
A bed.

257
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:26,162
A diary.

258
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:29,803
Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?

259
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:34,366
You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.

260
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:38,145
So sensible.

261
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:40,571
Did you eat?

262
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:42,476
Of course, I did.

263
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:45,316
Well, I didn't.

264
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:49,253
Then let's eat.

265
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:56,664
Is there anything you want to tell me?

266
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:58,396
Like what?

267
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,269
A deep, dark secret?

268
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,535
Think of it as a confession
at a Catholic church.

269
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:10,337
I'll be the priest and listen.

270
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:13,280
A deep, dark secret?

271
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:17,884
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

272
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:19,512
I like you.

273
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:26,659
I want to ask you something.

274
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:29,590
Do you have a wish?

275
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:31,389
A wish?

276
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,296
If you could have anything in the world?

277
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,161
First, hold up your spoon.

278
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:44,170
Then?

279
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:46,873
Eat all your food.

280
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,347
Then?

281
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,855
Meet a great guy and get married.

282
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,323
Can't I marry you?

283
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:04,487
I'm not a great guy.

284
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,670
It wasn't my choice, but heaven's will,

285
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:15,040
to fall in love with you.

286
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:22,470
I was born to love you.
Heaven sent me to love you.

287
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:24,875
ID: Little Mermaid.

288
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:29,717
Now, for the requested song.

289
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:43,828
Your second toe is longer
than the first one like mine.

290
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:47,401
That means your mom will outlive you.

291
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:52,136
Who says that?

292
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:58,374
I think I read it somewhere.

293
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,374
It's a lie.

294
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,247
Why?

295
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:05,951
Cuz my Mom and Dad died on the same day.

296
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:10,685
If you...

297
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:13,525
If you die before me, I'll kill you!

298
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:24,398
<i>Here's another requested song.</i>

299
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:59,805
Are you finished?

300
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:03,771
Excuse me?

301
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,605
The coffee.

302
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,622
Then can I have the cup?

303
00:22:38,348 --> 00:22:40,282
Which side did you drink from?

304
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:42,382
Pardon?

305
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:52,327
This isn't kissing, is it?

306
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:09,409
- Hey.
- Yeah?

307
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:16,545
- You know the guest doctor?
- Yeah?

308
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,988
What kind of doctor is he?

309
00:23:21,623 --> 00:23:22,749
Huh?

310
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:31,429
We need to fill a cavity.
Amalgam is stronger than resin.

311
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:39,638
We kiss on the first day.

312
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:48,282
You see inside me, on the second day.

313
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:56,248
What should we do on the third day?

314
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:03,530
What?

315
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:07,561
We'll decide when the time comes.

316
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:18,636
I'm in love!

317
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:24,040
A guest on another show. He's a dentist.

318
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:31,988
Pass me the toothbrush?

319
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,462
You're listening to 'Happy Hour'.

320
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:46,899
- As you're out driving...
- Did you eat?

321
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,334
Oh, hi.

322
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:51,963
- Got a show to record, today?
- No.

323
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:57,204
The guest doctor on your show...

324
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:01,175
Who? You mean CHA Joo-hwan?

325
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,247
How is he?

326
00:26:03,248 --> 00:26:06,342
He's a great guy. Why?

327
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,687
Just wondering.

328
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:15,888
His family's rich, he's nice,
and he makes a ton of money.

329
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:18,928
And he's a famous dentist.

330
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:22,398
You look a little sad today.

331
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:25,203
Good job, bro.

332
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:26,971
It was fun.

333
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:30,708
- Great show.
- Cut it short.

334
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:33,269
Hey, nice seeing you.

335
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:35,246
Let's go out for drinks.

336
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:37,649
Not if it's just a few drinks.

337
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,608
- How much then?
- All night?

338
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:43,186
All night! Alright!

339
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:47,124
<i>What's his social
security number?</i>

340
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:51,362
<i>- 730313105...
- 730313...</i>

341
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:56,166
Sure you can get his medical records?

342
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:58,727
<i>Insurance companies
get everything.</i>

343
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:01,204
<i>But why do you want
to check out a guy?</i>

344
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,906
I'll tell you later.

345
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:08,402
<i>Bingo! He's got life
and medical insurance.</i>

346
00:27:08,513 --> 00:27:11,948
<i>No record of family illness
or any operations.</i>

347
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:15,819
<i>He has an impeccable
health record.</i>

348
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,154
You sure?

349
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:19,556
<i>Insurance companies know
how to make money, man.</i>

350
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:20,324
KANG!

351
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:22,826
<i>If he has a hospital
record, we'll see it.</i>

352
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:23,860
KANG!

353
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:25,726
Thanks. I owe you one.

354
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:29,966
Got a minute Mr. KIM?

355
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:32,833
For you, any time!

356
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:40,098
It's a gift.

357
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:46,314
Ah, thank you.

358
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:49,345
Just a thank you?

359
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:55,619
First my lips, then my insides...

360
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,787
Now, you're in my head.

361
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:01,227
Buy me a drink?

362
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:08,603
A drink?

363
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:12,537
I don't get it.

364
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:20,014
Who would've thought I'd use my
former dark roots to help you?

365
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:25,554
No need to worry. Now about Cats.

366
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:29,858
Man, I gotta change that name!

367
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:31,826
It's Cat Girl, sir.

368
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:36,992
I know! It's up here
but I can't say it right!

369
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:41,002
Call me whatever you want, hon.

370
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:43,767
Who cares if it's a cat or a dog?

371
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:47,907
That's my pretty.

372
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:51,078
My sweet Cats.

373
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:55,050
We're changing the name.

374
00:28:56,786 --> 00:29:00,155
- Ah, sir?
- I said, I know!

375
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,351
Not that. The phone.

376
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:07,792
Sorry, Producer KANG! I checked and...

377
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,697
You kids scram for a sec.

378
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:16,295
I gotta take this call. Go!

379
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,877
CHA Joo-hwan's family's loaded!

380
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:27,481
He even has a hot fiancé.

381
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:30,849
He's got it made.

382
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,252
<i>Fiancé?</i>

383
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:35,154
Is something up?

384
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:44,725
Oh, you dropped your candy.

385
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,959
Let's put it in your pocket.

386
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:03,074
Have you ever been in love?

387
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:08,315
Like a rock thrown into the river.

388
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,351
Give me the ring.

389
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:15,786
Excuse me?

390
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:17,557
Your ring.

391
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:33,708
Like this.

392
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:51,792
Someone to pull you out. Like this.

393
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,430
I'm engaged.

394
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:08,176
It doesn't matter.

395
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:09,743
Let's keep drinking.

396
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:19,850
It's so cold.

397
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,497
Did you drink?

398
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:38,365
What do you like so much about him?

399
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,547
I feel like I'm being sterilized.

400
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:48,377
Sterilized?

401
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:51,445
Sterilized.

402
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,220
Perfect.

403
00:32:41,138 --> 00:32:44,073
- Let's eat.
- Sorry, I gotta run.

404
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:47,937
- You're not eating?
- I can't.

405
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:50,169
What about all this food?

406
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:52,148
You eat it all.

407
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:56,542
I'll see you later.

408
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:27,977
ABCDEFGHIJK...

409
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:08,351
Hello?

410
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:11,626
<i>Is this EUN Won's number?</i>

411
00:34:11,627 --> 00:34:15,324
Yes, it is.

412
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:18,289
<i>May I speak to her, please?</i>

413
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,297
She's not here.

414
00:34:22,704 --> 00:34:24,939
<i>My name's CHA Joo-hwan.</i>

415
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,408
<i>We were supposed to meet today</i>

416
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:31,612
<i>but something came
up at the clinic.</i>

417
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,348
<i>Is there any way
I can reach her?</i>

418
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:36,783
Where were you going to meet?

419
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,759
So cold.

420
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:23,589
Hey.

421
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,097
He can't come.

422
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:26,727
Who?

423
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,290
Him.

424
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,506
The doc.

425
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:39,612
Where are you going?

426
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:41,274
I gotta go.

427
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:45,074
Sit down. The curry here is great.

428
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,955
You know I don't eat curry.

429
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:50,089
Then what do you want?

430
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,224
What else is there?

431
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:53,216
What do you want to eat?

432
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:55,889
Kimbap.

433
00:35:56,931 --> 00:35:58,625
So boring.

434
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:00,629
Just eat curry.

435
00:36:03,903 --> 00:36:05,427
You're buying.

436
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:12,705
Come on Producer KANG. Spill it.

437
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,143
Did he rip you off or something?

438
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:18,784
Then, why didn't you say so!

439
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:26,516
My boys can get the money
back before lunch in no time.

440
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:28,283
It's not that.

441
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,329
Then what is it?

442
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:37,128
Why would someone like you want
the dirt on some guy's fiancé even?

443
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:43,240
Are you interested in his fiancé?

444
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:46,038
Just find out, please.

445
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:47,805
Fine, then.

446
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:55,281
Anyway, Cats' album's
startin' to get noticed, now.

447
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:58,656
Let's cook up something with your show

448
00:36:58,657 --> 00:37:02,024
and sell 'em like hot pancakes!

449
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:04,095
I'm sure it'll do well.

450
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,859
Of course.

451
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:07,563
Hey, Min-chul!

452
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:09,761
Did you like the house?

453
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:13,365
Mother said she liked it.

454
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:15,405
It's not bad.

455
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:17,971
I heard you stopped holding exhibitions.

456
00:37:18,543 --> 00:37:20,841
I'm tired of putting on shows.

457
00:37:22,547 --> 00:37:25,015
And there's nothing to take pictures of.

458
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:32,052
I'm sorry I'm not more fun to be around.

459
00:37:32,224 --> 00:37:36,888
Don't worry. I like
to have fun by myself.

460
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:39,390
That's sad.

461
00:37:40,698 --> 00:37:45,260
- Let's have fun together from now on.
- Sure.

462
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,903
Can I get an ashtray here?

463
00:37:50,274 --> 00:37:53,175
I'm sorry. There's no smoking here.

464
00:37:54,812 --> 00:37:57,406
The world's such a bore.

465
00:37:57,515 --> 00:38:00,382
Get her an ashtray to
put that out, please.

466
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:02,509
Yes, sir.

467
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:05,848
Interesting.

468
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,589
Keep smoking.

469
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:14,125
Should've known. She's
really somethin' all right.

470
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:18,097
She's got men coming out of her ears.

471
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:21,771
I told 'em to take some good pics.

472
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:22,972
It won't be long.

473
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:26,609
<i>How did you pose
for your album cover?</i>

474
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,878
I posed like I practiced
with my boss last night.

475
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,980
Exactly how?

476
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,083
<i>- Here?
- Pardon?</i>

477
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:37,645
Men are all the same.

478
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:40,647
Okay, then.

479
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:47,055
First, I open my eyes like a cat.

480
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:48,698
Like this.

481
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,266
- Ah, Cat Girl?
- Then...

482
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:54,370
I hold my hands up and
open my mouth like this.

483
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:57,339
Look at her. She's a natural born star!

484
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,103
You can just tell us.

485
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:02,010
But my boss said a star

486
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:04,546
<i>- has to speak with the body.
- See that?</i>

487
00:39:04,547 --> 00:39:09,985
Girls like her adjust so quickly.

488
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:13,581
That foxy babe. Who wouldn't love her?

489
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:19,027
- Ah, sir?
- KANG!

490
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:20,995
- What's wrong?
- KANG!

491
00:39:30,773 --> 00:39:32,604
Where is he?

492
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:37,603
- Hey!
- I'm dead beat.

493
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,441
What's wrong with you!

494
00:39:39,882 --> 00:39:41,406
What's with you!

495
00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:45,249
Don't start.

496
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:51,089
Why does he keep fainting like this?

497
00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:56,397
It's hereditary, but it could also be

498
00:39:56,398 --> 00:39:59,000
not enough calcium in his diet.

499
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:05,706
We've been eating the same food
in the same house for years!

500
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:08,175
Why are you the only
one who keeps fainting!

501
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:12,576
You eat way more than I do.

502
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,046
You're only eating anchovies
from now on, got that!

503
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,593
You!

504
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,606
Yes?

505
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:41,698
What did he just say?

506
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,876
To break off your engagement...

507
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:51,246
- Stop! Please!
- Who are you!

508
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:55,619
What the hell are you trying to pull!

509
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,821
You don't wanna mess with me!

510
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:05,895
Get the hell out of my sight!

511
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:13,668
I said, get lost.

512
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,823
Why are you doing this?

513
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,756
Huh?

514
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:45,898
You're a successful radio show producer.

515
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:49,473
Trailing a woman and
getting slapped like that.

516
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,577
Aren't you embarrassed?

517
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:55,046
I don't have time to be embarrassed.

518
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:59,008
What are you talking about?

519
00:41:59,385 --> 00:42:04,152
One mountain after
another. But no time to go.

520
00:42:08,427 --> 00:42:10,588
Ow, my head.

521
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:14,896
Does it hurt?

522
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:17,932
I'm hurt, too.

523
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:24,271
What's with me today?

524
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,201
It's cuz we're sad.

525
00:42:28,447 --> 00:42:33,441
Then cry instead of making jokes.

526
00:42:34,086 --> 00:42:36,316
I don't want to cry.

527
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:40,389
Don't wanna make someone cry even more.

528
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:49,197
I'm dying. Just like my dad.

529
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,532
Chul-kyu!

530
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:04,707
<i>Mom left me a year
after Dad died.</i>

531
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:11,120
<i>It probably wasn't
cuz she resented me.</i>

532
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,548
<i>She was sick of
everything cuz of Dad.</i>

533
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:21,260
<i>I understand. I was
sick of everything, too.</i>

534
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:27,134
<i>But when she left me all alone...</i>

535
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,568
<i>I was so lonely.</i>

536
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:36,006
<i>People...</i>

537
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,114
should never be alone.

538
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:09,970
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

539
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:13,173
<i>I want you to leave your fiancé.</i>

540
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:16,694

<i>The girl that I love is in love with him.</i>

541
00:44:16,694 --> 00:44:19,180
<i>-Medical records-
The girl that I love is in love with him.</i>

542
00:44:21,024 --> 00:44:22,616
<i>I beg you.</i>

543
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,531
Under one condition.

544
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:37,038
But...

545
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:38,597
But?

546
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:48,143
No, please! Tell me.

547
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:01,758
I want to take your pictures.

548
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:10,395
Your medical records said
you don't have much time left.

549
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,440
Now, that's an interesting model.

550
00:45:20,248 --> 00:45:22,512
I think it'll be fun.

551
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:25,311
I don't think it'll be fun.

552
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:29,723
Then the deal's off.

553
00:45:33,828 --> 00:45:35,853
Drink up, first!

554
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:39,827
Give me a drink, too!

555
00:45:46,941 --> 00:45:49,808
- Hi! Hi!
- Hi! You're late!

556
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:58,148
Hello. I spoke to you on the phone.

557
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,287
Oh, hi.

558
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:01,550
I'm KANG Chul-kyu.

559
00:46:01,723 --> 00:46:02,985
CHA Joo-hwan.

560
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:05,524
- Thanks again for that day.
- Anytime.

561
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:07,491
You know him?

562
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:09,260
The sterilizer?

563
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:15,101
- Did you eat?
- No, I'll eat now.

564
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:16,865
Why are you so late?

565
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,404
- Still recording a show.
- What?

566
00:46:19,506 --> 00:46:20,973
You said you're done.

567
00:46:20,974 --> 00:46:23,499
Not yet. I gotta go back.

568
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:27,874
- Here.
- Thank you.

569
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:34,116
The song's great.

570
00:46:35,122 --> 00:46:36,589
'If I can live again'?

571
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,749
Of course, I wrote it.

572
00:46:40,194 --> 00:46:42,594
Sorry, I gotta run.

573
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:46,656
- Come on.
- Don't go.

574
00:46:46,767 --> 00:46:48,166
I'll see you later.

575
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:49,761
Bye.

576
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:53,100
- See you next time, then.
- Sure.

577
00:46:58,411 --> 00:46:59,969
Be careful in the snow!

578
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:47,248
Why are you back so early?

579
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,553
Aren't you supposed
to be recording a show?

580
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:53,596
Change of plans.

581
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,697
Me, too.

582
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:03,366
Drink this.

583
00:48:10,114 --> 00:48:11,706
Didn't you eat?

584
00:48:12,016 --> 00:48:16,112
I did, but I'm still starving.

585
00:48:21,992 --> 00:48:25,325
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

586
00:48:25,596 --> 00:48:29,555
Just wanted something simple.

587
00:48:30,801 --> 00:48:32,098
It's good, huh?

588
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:38,502
If you could stop time,
what would you do first?

589
00:48:40,576 --> 00:48:45,570
If everyone else is frozen
and only you can move?

590
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:50,048
If time stopped, you wouldn't die.

591
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:54,886
Don't you want to live?

592
00:48:59,262 --> 00:49:01,025
Not talking to me?

593
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:07,593
Too sorry to die and leave
the girl you love alone.

594
00:49:09,806 --> 00:49:12,604
Okay, I can understand that much.

595
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:15,804
But still...

596
00:49:17,613 --> 00:49:21,174
How can you marry her
off to someone else?

597
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:25,479
Isn't that going overboard?

598
00:49:29,057 --> 00:49:31,457
You're not dead, yet.

599
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:36,654
- How can you watch that?
- Ah, Jenna?

600
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:40,563
Let's just stick to our jobs.

601
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:44,302
What's love?

602
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,614
Like brushing your teeth.

603
00:49:53,915 --> 00:49:55,780
Brushing your teeth?

604
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,220
But you do that alone.

605
00:49:59,221 --> 00:50:01,519
Do you brush to show someone?

606
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,720
Why didn't you come yesterday?

607
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:13,534
Pardon?

608
00:50:23,511 --> 00:50:26,002
I said, did you wait for me?

609
00:50:26,313 --> 00:50:33,344
Well, just wondering
why you didn't come.

610
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:36,548
You fell in love with me, didn't you?

611
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:38,017
What?

612
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:42,928
Love makes you wonder
and wait for that person.

613
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:48,435
It's not that. If a patient
doesn't come, I wait.

614
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:51,030
Do you wonder about every patient?

615
00:50:51,705 --> 00:50:53,229
Well...

616
00:50:54,475 --> 00:50:58,377
You're blushing. It's love all right.

617
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:01,848
Hey, KANG Chul-kyu!

618
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:03,507
Yes, boss.

619
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:06,652
How much did you get from KIM Gap-sik?

620
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:10,722
Should've been more discreet!

621
00:51:10,723 --> 00:51:13,283
Cat Girl's on your show 10 times a week!

622
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:16,362
Think people will stay still?

623
00:51:16,796 --> 00:51:22,564
Someone wrote in to audit your show!

624
00:51:22,735 --> 00:51:26,330
What's got into you all of a sudden?

625
00:51:26,439 --> 00:51:30,432
You of all people!

626
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:36,874
When are you going to break it off?

627
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:39,441
In a rush?

628
00:51:40,487 --> 00:51:42,478
You saw my medical records.

629
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:47,491
I want to keep playing.

630
00:51:49,028 --> 00:51:53,522
But I guess you don't have that luxury.

631
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:00,695
Under one condition.

632
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:09,246
Now, what.

633
00:52:10,082 --> 00:52:12,346
I'll tell you after I break it off.

634
00:52:12,851 --> 00:52:15,046
A promise is a promise.

635
00:52:30,169 --> 00:52:33,764
Since when was it no smoking in here.

636
00:52:36,942 --> 00:52:38,739
No idea.

637
00:52:47,786 --> 00:52:51,812
Our parents will be shocked.

638
00:53:02,366 --> 00:53:08,805
I should be really angry
at a time like this, right?

639
00:53:08,806 --> 00:53:13,140
Yell at you or something?

640
00:53:16,013 --> 00:53:24,013
Funny, somehow I feel a little grateful.

641
00:53:26,457 --> 00:53:28,550
I'm going out for a smoke.

642
00:53:31,929 --> 00:53:33,294
So uncomfortable.

643
00:53:37,335 --> 00:53:39,098
My engagement's off.

644
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:50,111
I don't have parents.

645
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:56,576
I was studying late at high
school in my senior year.

646
00:53:57,787 --> 00:54:01,188
My homeroom teacher came
in and stared right at me.

647
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:09,458
Like someone who came
to take me on death row.

648
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:14,229
Like in the movies, you know?

649
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:19,371
Anyway, he told me

650
00:54:19,643 --> 00:54:23,977
to go to the hospital right away.

651
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:27,283
When I asked why...

652
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:30,586
if he said my parents and

653
00:54:30,587 --> 00:54:34,022
sister died in a car accident...

654
00:54:34,556 --> 00:54:39,823
then I wouldn't have gone
and seen them like that.

655
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:45,063
I see...

656
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:48,297
K's been with me ever since.

657
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:50,738
K?

658
00:54:52,975 --> 00:54:57,071
You saw him, Producer KANG Chul-kyu?

659
00:54:57,913 --> 00:55:01,747
His name sounds too corny
so I just call him K.

660
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:09,753
At home, he's my Mom
At work, he's my Dad.

661
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:12,187
When I'm sad, he's my brother.

662
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:16,920
Sometimes he's like a lover.
Though he always chickens out.

663
00:55:18,534 --> 00:55:21,697
Can I kiss you?

664
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:25,895
You wanna kiss me?

665
00:55:34,515 --> 00:55:35,880
Stupid.

666
00:55:37,185 --> 00:55:39,585
Let me see.

667
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:43,114
Oh, no.

668
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:45,249
That's right, I'm stupid!

669
00:55:54,135 --> 00:55:57,161
Open the door. Are you okay?

670
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:10,346
<i>Don't look! Stupid!</i>

671
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:24,622
<i>Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!</i>

672
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:55,094
<i>I was born to love you.</i>

673
00:56:55,095 --> 00:56:59,156
<i>Heaven sent me to love you.</i>

674
00:57:01,101 --> 00:57:03,502
<i>Cat Girl's 'If
I could live again'</i>

675
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,663
<i>requested by
ID: Little Mermaid.</i>

676
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:07,839
- You wrote this song, Cream?
- Yes.

677
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,400
Let's hear, 'If I could live again'.

678
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:21,277
(Did you eat?)

679
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:25,380
(I'm almost done!)

680
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:43,475
Yes, boss.

681
00:57:43,476 --> 00:57:47,245
<i>Come to my office, now.</i>

682
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:48,543
Okay.

683
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:59,921
Producer KANG!

684
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:02,752
KANG!

685
00:58:03,061 --> 00:58:08,599
I heard everything. I'm going to
speak with the boss, right now!

686
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,594
How can he fire a genius like you!

687
00:58:13,771 --> 00:58:15,672
I'm not getting fired.

688
00:58:15,673 --> 00:58:18,475
Same difference.

689
00:58:18,476 --> 00:58:21,172
- You can't go like this!
- I'm taking a break.

690
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:26,884
Really? That's not what I heard.

691
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:30,514
I'm going to the States
to study for a while.

692
00:58:30,622 --> 00:58:37,790
Really? Guess there's
no use going to the boss.

693
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:42,466
Thank you for everything, Mr. KIM.

694
00:58:42,467 --> 00:58:45,902
- Anytime. 
- You too, Min-chul.

695
00:58:46,136 --> 00:58:49,401
Give him the demo tape, Min-chul.

696
00:58:50,641 --> 00:58:54,543
Producer CHOI! Hold on! Wait!

697
00:59:02,553 --> 00:59:04,180
Min-chul...

698
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:31,509
It's a ballad.

699
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:33,448
Write up a good song.

700
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:43,853
What's marriage?

701
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:47,652
Marriage?

702
00:59:48,097 --> 00:59:49,462
Marriage.

703
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:56,463
- Marriage...
- Wait!

704
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:10,977
A toothbrush holder.

705
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:13,817
What?

706
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:19,027
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

707
01:00:20,997 --> 01:00:23,397
What's that got to do with marriage?

708
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:30,628
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

709
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:36,677
Then I must be married, already.

710
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:41,505
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

711
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:45,686
Really?

712
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:49,479
I gotta pee.

713
01:01:18,686 --> 01:01:20,586
<i>No one else but Thee.</i>

714
01:01:27,094 --> 01:01:29,221
'Thee' is a lucky person.

715
01:01:32,966 --> 01:01:34,866
Wanna hear it?

716
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:14,564
EUN Won and I living
together probably got to you.

717
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:17,175
But there's nothing to worry about.

718
01:02:17,176 --> 01:02:18,837
I'm okay with that.

719
01:02:19,512 --> 01:02:25,280
I'm thankful for
everything you did for her.

720
01:02:25,551 --> 01:02:29,146
Let's get together often.

721
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,787
Go on trips together and stuff.

722
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:33,925
Sounds good.

723
01:02:35,762 --> 01:02:40,563
She says she wants to pick
out her wedding dress with you.

724
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,562
Gotta love her wild ideas.

725
01:02:42,668 --> 01:02:44,693
Why me?

726
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:48,702
I want what she wants.

727
01:02:51,611 --> 01:02:54,171
Please do it for her.

728
01:02:56,315 --> 01:03:04,315
And I hope it's the last
thing you ever do for her.

729
01:03:07,225 --> 01:03:10,888
Sure. Please take good care of her.

730
01:03:11,029 --> 01:03:15,125
Of course. She's my woman, now.

731
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:16,798
Let's drink.

732
01:03:32,484 --> 01:03:34,042
What do you think?

733
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:41,682
Very pretty.

734
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:49,462
It's time for the groom-to-be
to try on his suit.

735
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:52,769
I'm not the groom.

736
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,362
Try it on.

737
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,309
Come up here.

738
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:11,578
Come here. Can you take a picture of us?

739
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:15,249
On three. One, two, three!

740
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:26,834
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

741
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:05,115
Why are all the clocks stopped?

742
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:06,823
No reason.

743
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:12,696
Can I turn one on?

744
01:07:16,803 --> 01:07:18,236
Why?

745
01:07:19,005 --> 01:07:20,302
No reason.

746
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:23,800
No reason?

747
01:07:25,111 --> 01:07:26,373
Sure.

748
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:57,036
Jenna? I have a big favor to ask.

749
01:07:58,111 --> 01:07:59,578
What is it?

750
01:08:01,514 --> 01:08:07,383
I need to send flowers on her
anniversary for a few years.

751
01:08:10,522 --> 01:08:14,458
She'll get suspicious, if
I lose touch altogether.

752
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:20,861
I had one more condition. Remember?

753
01:08:23,869 --> 01:08:25,666
What is it?

754
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,687
Please die at my side.

755
01:08:58,136 --> 01:09:01,401
You booked the tickets?

756
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:07,237
I'm running low on battery.

757
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,074
Hey.

758
01:09:12,517 --> 01:09:13,814
What are you making?

759
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:21,581
My phone battery ran out.

760
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:28,529
I'll charge it and call you back later.

761
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:30,100
Bye.

762
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:31,398
Hi.

763
01:09:35,907 --> 01:09:39,536
Why'd you leave me there like that?

764
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:42,145
It's for you.

765
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,552
Who do you think you are!

766
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:56,887
What's with you?

767
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,893
Who says you can touch my phone!

768
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:03,996
The hell you...

769
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,864
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

770
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:44,903
Can I help you?

771
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,634
Is K home?

772
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,837
K?

773
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:15,232
Someone's here.

774
01:11:34,055 --> 01:11:38,549
She's pretty. I can
see why you love her.

775
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:44,955
You think she's happy?

776
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:47,934
What are you saying?

777
01:11:48,703 --> 01:11:50,762
She didn't seem happy.

778
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,207
Can you send this for the next 3 years?

779
01:11:58,046 --> 01:11:59,479
It's pretty.

780
01:12:00,848 --> 01:12:02,713
Maybe too pretty.

781
01:12:05,987 --> 01:12:09,115
It looks fake. Like your love.

782
01:12:10,191 --> 01:12:12,125
Then what's real?

783
01:12:16,197 --> 01:12:17,629
Real?

784
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,093
If you're hungry, you eat.
If you're hurting, you cry.

785
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:29,465
If you're having fun, you
laugh. Not hold it in like you.

786
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:33,539
You really wanna die like this?

787
01:12:36,283 --> 01:12:37,773
No!

788
01:12:39,986 --> 01:12:41,851
I don't want to die like this.

789
01:12:43,256 --> 01:12:45,451
I want to live a happy life.

790
01:12:48,095 --> 01:12:50,359
I want to be the one marrying EUN Won...

791
01:12:51,498 --> 01:12:53,523
...instead of him, tomorrow.

792
01:12:57,871 --> 01:12:59,338
But...

793
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:02,268
That's just a dream.

794
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,638
A sad dream.

795
01:13:08,047 --> 01:13:11,210
I'm done with dreaming.

796
01:14:06,538 --> 01:14:09,098
<i>Sleep tight and sweet dreams.</i>

797
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:32,487
<i>Did you eat?
- Cream</i>

798
01:14:36,568 --> 01:14:37,899
Thanks.

799
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,179
<i>I'm not talking to you.</i>

800
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:09,155
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

801
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:17,639
<i>For what?</i>

802
01:15:20,511 --> 01:15:22,069
<i>For everything.</i>

803
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:30,616
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

804
01:15:31,355 --> 01:15:32,652
<i>For what?</i>

805
01:15:33,757 --> 01:15:35,054
<i>For everything.</i>

806
01:15:38,362 --> 01:15:41,421
<i>I love you...</i>

807
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,968
<i>I like you.</i>

808
01:15:48,304 --> 01:15:49,635
<i>Me, too.</i>

809
01:18:11,178 --> 01:18:13,042
That's some story.

810
01:18:15,314 --> 01:18:18,647
KANG... amazing guy. I had no idea.

811
01:18:20,286 --> 01:18:26,714
Is there anyway to reach
them? What about the dentist?

812
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:36,398
Wonder what happened to her.

813
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:46,975
Let's record it.

814
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:51,511
Really? I'll call right now.

815
01:18:51,684 --> 01:18:54,881
No, the other song.

816
01:18:56,222 --> 01:18:58,747
Oh, that song.

817
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:25,975
I gotta go, I'm late.

818
01:20:25,976 --> 01:20:29,343
Get up and eat. I made breakfast.

819
01:21:26,936 --> 01:21:28,301
<i>What's this?</i>

820
01:21:29,539 --> 01:21:33,908
<i>Ah, Vitamin ABC. It
helps me get smarter.</i>

821
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:24,117
Where'd you get these pills?

822
01:22:24,593 --> 01:22:26,787
They're my friends' pills.

823
01:22:27,495 --> 01:22:31,955
Since when did your
friend start taking this?

824
01:22:32,867 --> 01:22:34,391
Why?

825
01:22:35,069 --> 01:22:39,369
The pain must've been
severe to take these pills.

826
01:22:40,841 --> 01:22:41,933
What?

827
01:22:42,476 --> 01:22:48,005
They're painkillers for
patients with cancer or leukemia.

828
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:50,375
<i>Terminal patients.</i>

829
01:22:51,686 --> 01:22:55,417
<i>Have you heard of
the hospice ward?</i>

830
01:22:56,357 --> 01:23:00,157
<i>It's where dying patients stay...</i>

831
01:23:00,594 --> 01:23:04,655
<i>with consent from their families.</i>

832
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:20,908
Mom!

833
01:23:21,047 --> 01:23:23,649
Watch the house while we're out.

834
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:26,050
See you later, sis!

835
01:23:32,225 --> 01:23:33,658
No!

836
01:23:58,385 --> 01:24:01,445
<i>When I found out what
Vitamin ABC really was...</i>

837
01:24:01,688 --> 01:24:05,556
<i>When I finally realized
what they were...</i>

838
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:10,353
<i>When my whole world
turned pitch dark before me...</i>

839
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,263
What's wrong?

840
01:24:12,498 --> 01:24:15,194
<i>I died before K.</i>

841
01:24:18,103 --> 01:24:25,839
<i>I met K a year after my
whole family passed away.</i>

842
01:24:27,579 --> 01:24:31,572
<i>Though almost 3 hours passed...</i>

843
01:24:32,918 --> 01:24:36,012
<i>he stood there frozen like stone.</i>

844
01:24:36,255 --> 01:24:39,857
<i>Crying and looking in the
direction his mother went.</i>

845
01:24:39,858 --> 01:24:44,659
<i>This will be enough to support you
till you're an adult, Chul-kyu.</i>

846
01:24:45,731 --> 01:24:51,829
<i>He looked sadder
and more hurt than me.</i>

847
01:24:53,272 --> 01:24:56,070
<i>He needed a hug more than me.</i>

848
01:24:57,075 --> 01:24:59,339
Is there anything you want to tell me?

849
01:25:00,111 --> 01:25:01,635
Like what?

850
01:25:04,816 --> 01:25:08,513
A deep, dark secret?

851
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:14,750
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

852
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,793
I like you.

853
01:25:18,096 --> 01:25:20,724
<i>Stupid idiot.</i>

854
01:25:21,332 --> 01:25:23,129
Do you have a wish?

855
01:25:23,234 --> 01:25:24,801
What's with you?

856
01:25:24,802 --> 01:25:27,930
Just curious all of a sudden.

857
01:25:29,674 --> 01:25:33,440
If you could do anything
you want in the world.

858
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:36,036
<i>K is dying.</i>

859
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,848
Meet a great guy and get married.

860
01:25:39,016 --> 01:25:40,884
Can't I marry you?

861
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:43,080
I'm not a great guy.

862
01:25:43,254 --> 01:25:45,555
Then who is?

863
01:25:45,556 --> 01:25:49,457
Someone who is healthy and nice.

864
01:25:50,026 --> 01:25:52,517
Who knows how to take
care of his family.

865
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:56,927
<i>I already met a great guy.</i>

866
01:25:57,767 --> 01:26:01,430
<i>But K told me to
meet someone else.</i>

867
01:26:01,905 --> 01:26:05,397
<i>He said that was his wish.</i>

868
01:26:06,977 --> 01:26:10,913
<i>KANG Chul-kyu</i>

869
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:17,678
<i>When I heard K fainted...</i>

870
01:26:18,188 --> 01:26:21,954
<i>I rushed over,
afraid I'll go crazy.</i>

871
01:26:23,627 --> 01:26:25,424
<i>But I...</i>

872
01:26:26,363 --> 01:26:27,963
<i>...couldn't even go crazy.</i>

873
01:26:27,964 --> 01:26:29,965
No, doc.

874
01:26:29,966 --> 01:26:32,628
But she should know.

875
01:26:33,603 --> 01:26:36,094
What are you going to do?

876
01:26:36,806 --> 01:26:38,864
I don't know.

877
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:46,180
It feels like a needle
stuck in my throat.

878
01:26:49,518 --> 01:26:51,247
Right here.

879
01:26:53,022 --> 01:26:55,149
It gets stuck right here.

880
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:59,253
I can't say it.

881
01:27:00,963 --> 01:27:07,766
She'll live on. Think of yourself.

882
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:10,971
She's different.

883
01:27:12,308 --> 01:27:14,401
She needs someone beside her.

884
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:32,215
- Hello.
- There goes Mr. Perfect.

885
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:35,928
Glowing from head to toe!

886
01:27:40,768 --> 01:27:43,032
<i>I picked a man.</i>

887
01:27:52,814 --> 01:27:54,975
Which side did you drink from?

888
01:27:58,086 --> 01:27:59,319
Pardon?

889
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,720
I'm engaged.

890
01:28:02,257 --> 01:28:09,629
<i>Stupid. You think I care
whether you're engaged or not?</i>

891
01:28:10,932 --> 01:28:14,527
<i>Just play along and
meet me. For K.</i>

892
01:28:15,603 --> 01:28:17,628
<i>Am I a bitch?</i>

893
01:28:18,339 --> 01:28:20,840
<i>I don't have time
to worry about that!</i>

894
01:28:20,841 --> 01:28:23,207
<i>The man I love is dying!</i>

895
01:28:34,087 --> 01:28:39,889
<i>If I could be born again...
A ring? A pair of glasses?</i>

896
01:28:41,595 --> 01:28:45,691
<i>A bed? A diary?</i>

897
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:49,863
<i>Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?</i>

898
01:28:50,137 --> 01:28:54,767
<i>You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.</i>

899
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:14,590
What's wrong? Are you okay?

900
01:29:16,696 --> 01:29:17,958
Let me see your hand.

901
01:29:25,338 --> 01:29:26,828
Where are you going?

902
01:29:46,559 --> 01:29:48,527
<i>I made a deal with myself.</i>

903
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:51,729
<i>If he turns around,
I'd tell him everything.</i>

904
01:29:53,265 --> 01:29:57,634
<i>If he turns around, I'd
hug him and stop everything.</i>

905
01:29:59,372 --> 01:30:02,363
<i>But K didn't look back.</i>

906
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:07,166
<i>And there was nothing
I could do.</i>

907
01:30:12,851 --> 01:30:15,319
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

908
01:30:16,287 --> 01:30:18,482
Just wanted something simple.

909
01:30:21,993 --> 01:30:24,587
- It's good, huh?
- Yeah.

910
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:31,760
<i>As I sat eating the
noodles with him...</i>

911
01:30:32,937 --> 01:30:35,339
<i>I'd think, 'Don't
die you bastard'</i>

912
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:38,207
<i>and drank some water instead.</i>

913
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:43,477
<i>'Tell me. Let me hold you!
I'll die with you! '</i>

914
01:30:43,815 --> 01:30:48,275
<i>'I'll follow you and pay you back
for everything you did for me! '</i>

915
01:30:49,087 --> 01:30:52,283
<i>Instead, I just drank the water.</i>

916
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:55,951
<i>And finished the noodles.</i>

917
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:05,762
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

918
01:31:07,371 --> 01:31:10,169
What's that got to do with marriage?

919
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:17,605
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

920
01:31:21,385 --> 01:31:23,683
Then I must be married, already.

921
01:31:25,155 --> 01:31:29,023
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

922
01:31:31,028 --> 01:31:32,518
Really?

923
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:05,125
Can we get married, soon?

924
01:32:30,553 --> 01:32:33,282
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

925
01:33:09,758 --> 01:33:11,851
The hell you...

926
01:33:14,863 --> 01:33:17,661
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

927
01:33:28,008 --> 01:33:29,600
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

928
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,276
<i>I want to tell him I love him.</i>

929
01:33:39,687 --> 01:33:44,056
<i>I want to open my mouth
and say I love him.</i>

930
01:33:45,526 --> 01:33:49,394
<i>But I knew tears will fall
before I could say it.</i>

931
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:53,131
<i>So I kept silent, again.</i>

932
01:34:06,513 --> 01:34:08,708
When are you going to talk to me?

933
01:34:10,217 --> 01:34:14,710
Didn't you hear me screaming
at you all this time?

934
01:34:15,321 --> 01:34:16,754
What?

935
01:34:18,257 --> 01:34:19,918
Stupid.

936
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,594
I didn't hear anything.

937
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:25,928
Then how can mutes love?

938
01:34:38,177 --> 01:34:39,974
I love you.

939
01:34:44,917 --> 01:34:46,384
Me, too.

940
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:13,703
<i>We became a real couple.</i>

941
01:35:13,945 --> 01:35:16,072
<i>Cuz we made it down the aisle.</i>

942
01:36:48,338 --> 01:36:50,533
<i>Heaven's Gate Resting Place</i>

943
01:37:09,492 --> 01:37:10,618
Wait!

944
01:37:10,693 --> 01:37:12,058
You never learn!

945
01:37:13,163 --> 01:37:15,028
How can you write
with a brain like that?

946
01:37:24,274 --> 01:37:26,674
This isn't kissing, is it?

947
01:37:38,854 --> 01:37:40,412
Can you take a picture of us?

948
01:37:40,656 --> 01:37:43,090
On three. One, two, three!

949
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:52,993
<i>I was born to love you.
Heaven send me to love you.</i>

950
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:55,429
<i>- EUN Won -</i>

951
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:57,163
<i>I'm making noodles.
Want some?</i>

952
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,232
<i>No, I gotta work.</i>

953
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:00,600
<i>You sure?</i>

954
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:02,364
<i>Yes, I'm working!</i>

955
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:06,463
<i>- Then I'm just making one!
- Okay.</i>

956
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:09,172
<i>Don't come beggin' later.</i>

957
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,311
<i>- Hey!
- What?</i>

958
01:39:11,312 --> 01:39:14,475
<i>No eggs! Give me that.</i>

959
01:39:16,918 --> 01:39:19,442
<i>Wonder who invented noodles.</i>

960
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:22,154
<i>You said you didn't want any.</i>

961
01:39:22,155 --> 01:39:23,747
<i>Changed my mind.</i>

962
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:26,182
<i>Is there any rice?</i>

963
01:39:27,994 --> 01:39:31,225
<i>Hold on. There's
some in the fridge.</i>

964
01:39:32,432 --> 01:39:37,495
<i>Chul-kyu...
I'm coming to you.</i>

965
01:39:38,838 --> 01:39:41,306
<i>Don't worry.</i>

966
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:46,743
<i>I trust you. You
were always my compass.</i>

967
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:53,585
<i>Remember when I said
I can see you</i>

968
01:39:53,586 --> 01:39:56,783
<i>even when you're not with me?</i>

969
01:39:58,558 --> 01:40:00,890
<i>Go wherever you want.</i>

970
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:04,694
<i>I'll find you, soon.</i>

971
01:40:06,599 --> 01:40:10,466
<i>Don't get mad when you see me.</i>

972
01:40:11,937 --> 01:40:19,537
<i>Don't ask me why I followed
you or get angry at me.</i>

973
01:40:20,913 --> 01:40:27,944
<i>After everything to come to
you, if you get mad I'll cry.</i>

974
01:40:29,288 --> 01:40:34,316
<i>When we meet again on the other
side, let's not cry again.</i>

975
01:40:34,493 --> 01:40:37,485
<i>Wait for me.
I'll be right there.</i>

976
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:58,284
Even if...

977
01:40:58,437 --> 01:41:01,801
...Im reborn a thousand more times,

978
01:41:02,844 --> 01:41:07,544
There will not be another one like you.

979
01:41:09,138 --> 01:41:12,279
The one who...

980
01:41:12,493 --> 01:41:15,902
...would warm up my sad life.

981
01:41:15,926 --> 01:41:21,746
I'm really grateful for that person.

982
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:30,079
For that person, my heart could...

983
01:41:30,142 --> 01:41:37,190
...be hurt indefinitely.

984
01:41:37,462 --> 01:41:43,487
Even if
I can't tell you that I love you,

985
01:41:43,555 --> 01:41:46,950
the fact that I'm able to...

986
01:41:46,974 --> 01:41:51,565
...look at you from a distance,

987
01:41:51,589 --> 01:41:59,372
give you everything and love you.

988
01:41:59,396 --> 01:42:09,536
Even if I'm sad, I'm happy.

989
01:42:18,809 --> 01:42:25,732
There is no other love
in this world...

990
01:42:26,233 --> 01:42:32,151
...that could make my chest shiver
with such anticipation.

991
01:42:32,566 --> 01:42:39,070
I've buried so deep
in my memories...

992
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:45,268
...my only love.

993
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:49,581
For someone like you,

994
01:42:49,792 --> 01:42:53,042
all the painful tears,

995
01:42:53,043 --> 01:42:58,923
I could endure it indefinitely.

996
01:42:59,138 --> 01:43:05,346
Even if
I can't tell you that I love you,

997
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:08,778
the fact that I'm able to...

998
01:43:08,802 --> 01:43:13,321
...look at you from a distance,

999
01:43:13,345 --> 01:43:20,940
give you everything and love you.

1000
01:43:20,964 --> 01:43:27,086
Even if I'm sad, I'm happy.

1001
01:43:27,169 --> 01:43:33,138
I don't want anything else except...

1002
01:43:33,162 --> 01:43:41,084
...your laughter. With it, I'll be happy.

1003
01:43:41,108 --> 01:43:45,099
Because love is about giving everything,

1004
01:43:45,123 --> 01:43:48,996
just about giving.

1005
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:58,861
So, even if I'm sad,
I'm happy.
