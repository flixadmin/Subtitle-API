1
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,628
You've got too
much wood in there.

2
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,381
But the more wood, the bigger the fire.

3
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,425
It needs to breathe.

4
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,510
- Take off that big log.
- (Samwell grunts)

5
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,607
You know your fires.

6
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,951
Someone built your
fires for you growing up?

7
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,746
It doesn't get so cold down in the reach.

8
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,189
And there were servants, of course.

9
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,752
I knew you were highborn.

10
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,426
Oh, I found something
at the fist of the first men.

11
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:04,810
Buried treasure.
Thousands of years old. I think.

12
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,188
What does it do?

13
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,733
I'm not sure that it does anything.

14
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,027
It's beautiful, though, isn't it?

15
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,154
(Baby gurgling)

16
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,453
How much longer?

17
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,040
Not so far. A few more days.

18
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,211
Is the wall as big as they say?

19
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,629
Bigger.

20
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,134
So big you can't even
see the top sometimes.

21
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,052
It's hidden in clouds.

22
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,264
You're playing with me.

23
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,473
I'm not.

24
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:49,187
It's 700 feet high, all made of ice.

25
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,565
On a warm day you can see it weeping.

26
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,655
Castle black is nice enough.

27
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,745
They keep a fire burning in the long
hall day and night.

28
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:10,876
And hobb makes venison stew with onions.

29
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,294
Very tasty.

30
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,465
Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.

31
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,341
Dareon sings best.

32
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,428
- Do you sing?
- No.

33
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,139
No, no, no. (Chuckles) Not very well.

34
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,185
Sing me a song.

35
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:34,191
Oh, all right. Let's see.

36
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,696
(Clears throat)

37
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,368
The father's face is stem and strong

38
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,622
he sits and judges right from wrong

39
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,833
he weighs our lives, the short and long

40
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,212
and loves the little children

41
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,049
the mother gives the gift of life

42
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,761
and watches over every wife

43
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:07,224
her gentle smile ends all strife

44
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,061
and she loves her little children

45
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,777
That's not how you skin a rabbit.

46
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,320
I know how to skin a rabbit.

47
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,239
Not by the looks of it.

48
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,131
Osha: You grow up north of the wall,

49
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,843
you learn the proper way to handle game.

50
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,095
I didn't see any game before I got here.

51
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,473
If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen.

52
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,433
Well, I made this bow myself.

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,760
Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the wall.

54
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,771
You learn how to use your fists.

55
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,773
Oh, you're gonna punch
the rabbits to death?

56
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,316
I had someone else in mind.

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,752
Well, someone else is sitting right here.

58
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,487
You're both very good at skinning rabbits.

59
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,282
Some of us are just a little better.

60
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,759
Well, some of us would say thank you

61
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,035
when someone else
hunts down their breakfast for them.

62
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,472
Or don't they teach you
to say thank you north of the wall?

63
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,958
You've got
a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.

64
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,626
- Brandon: Stop it!
- Hodor: Hmm.

65
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,729
- Hodor.
- You've been fighting since you met.

66
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,796
Just stop it.

67
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,923
Lady Reed here's got
a stick so far up her ass,

68
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,050
it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.

69
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,762
You've been nasty to her every
day. Of course she's nasty back.

70
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,556
Me? It's my fault?

71
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,617
First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

72
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,935
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

73
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:40,108
We can't fight each other.
We'll never make it to the wall.

74
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,986
I want you both to make peace.

75
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,973
Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker.

76
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,498
I said so, didn't I?

77
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,583
Osha!

78
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,922
You're a good little hunter.

79
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,926
Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it?

80
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,011
- Thank you.
- Don't push me.

81
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,804
(Jojen breathing heavily)

82
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,317
Meera: I'm right here with you.

83
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,527
What's happening?

84
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,655
I'm right here with you.

85
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,532
What's wrong with him?

86
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,705
The visions take their toll.

87
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,000
He's having one now?

88
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,510
(Breathing normally)

89
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,523
I saw Jon snow.

90
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,777
You saw him? At castle black?

91
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,758
He was on the wrong side of the wall,

92
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,075
surrounded by enemies.

93
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,081
(Indistinct chattering)

94
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,422
Used to be you couldn't find a
tree within a mile of the wall.

95
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,508
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

96
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,889
Your flock gets smaller every year.

97
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,523
You ever climbed it before?

98
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,620
But tormund's done it half a hundred times.

99
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,494
You're afraid.

100
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,204
(Exhales)

101
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,289
Aren't you?

102
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,543
Well, it's a long way
up and a long way down.

103
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,630
But I've waited my whole life
to see the world from up there.

104
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,180
Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you.

105
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,768
They're too big for you, but they're good.

106
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,478
You kill someone for them?

107
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,563
Nah.

108
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,734
I didn't kill him,
but I bet his balls are still bruised.

109
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,152
(Laughing)

110
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,535
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

111
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,998
Well, he didn't do
that thing you do with your tongue.

112
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,001
Can we not talk about that here?

113
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,679
(Mimicking)
"Can we not talk about that here?

114
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,255
"I'm Jon snow.

115
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,382
"I've killed dead men and qhorin halfhand,

116
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,593
"but I'm scared of naked girls."

117
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,956
Did I seem scared the other day?

118
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,554
You were trembling like a leaf.

119
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,223
Only in the beginning.

120
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,724
Huh.

121
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,518
Only in the beginning.

122
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,189
You're a proper lover, Jon snow.

123
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,441
And don't worry.

124
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,736
Your secret's safe with me.

125
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,114
What secret?

126
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,201
Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls

127
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,411
in silk dresses you knew growing up?

128
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,621
(Chuckles)

129
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,624
You're onal and you're brave.

130
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,966
You didn't stop being a crow the day
you walked into mance rayder's tent.

131
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,225
But I'm your woman now, Jon snow.

132
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,814
You're going to be loyal to your woman.

133
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,446
The night's watch don't
care if you live or die.

134
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,908
Mance rayder don't care if I live or die.

135
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,745
We're just soldiers
and there's more to carry on if we go down.

136
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:15,091
It's you and me that matters to me and you.

137
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,223
Don't ever betray me.

138
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,024
I won't.

139
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,904
'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right
off and wear it 'round me neck.

140
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,918
Sink your metal deep

141
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,421
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

142
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,926
And if you fall, don't scream.

143
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,554
You don't want that
to be the last thing she remembers.

144
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,972
(Laughs)

145
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,266
(Grunts)

146
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,693
Arya: Joffrey.

147
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,782
Cersei.

148
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,576
Ilyn Payne.

149
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,537
You're good.

150
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,128
You're not as good as you think you are.

151
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,549
Face, tits, balls...

152
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,993
I hit 'em right where I wanted to.

153
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,680
But you took your sweet time of it.

154
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,016
You won't be fighting
straw men, little lady.

155
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,312
Show me your position.

156
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,317
Keep your elbow high.

157
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,112
You want your back doing the hard labor.

158
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,365
You're holding.

159
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,534
Never hold.

160
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,577
What?

161
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,204
Your muscles tense up when you hold.

162
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,874
Pull the string back to
the center of your chin and release.

163
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,251
Never hold.

164
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,711
But I have to aim.

165
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,505
(Chuckles) Never aim.

166
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,215
Never aim?

167
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,844
Your eye knows
where it wants the arrow to go.

168
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,887
Trust your eye.

169
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,515
(Sighs)

170
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,227
There's someone out there.

171
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,359
(Horse snuffles)

172
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,165
That's about far enough.

173
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,755
We come as friends.

174
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,274
Anguy: Begging your pardon, m'iady,

175
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,050
but we'll be the judge of that.

176
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,346
Valar morghulis.

177
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,389
Thoros: Valar dohaeris.

178
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,599
(Both speaking valyrian)

179
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,186
I don't see many priestesses of r'hllor
in the riverlands.

180
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,564
You are thoros of myr.

181
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,943
The high priest gave you a mission.

182
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,239
Turn king Robert away from his idols
and towards the lord of light.

183
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,116
What happened?

184
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,868
I failed.

185
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,496
You quit, you mean.

186
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,291
The heathen continue to slaughter
each other and you continue to get drunk.

187
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:40,588
You worship him your way,
and I'll worship him mine.

188
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,342
Do you speak the common tongue?

189
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,136
My friends here don't speak high valyrian.

190
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,140
Why are you here, my lady?

191
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,395
(Footsteps approaching)

192
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,780
Forgive my manners.

193
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,741
I don't see many ladies these days.

194
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,576
Lucky for the ladies.

195
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,275
How many times has
the lord brought him back?

196
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,152
Six.

197
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,362
(Both in valyrian)

198
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,698
That's not possible.

199
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,909
The lord has smiled upon me.

200
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,037
You should not have this power.

201
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,290
I have no power.

202
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,751
I ask the lord for his favor,

203
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,920
and he responds as he will.

204
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,888
I've always been a terrible priest.

205
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,891
Drank too much rum.

206
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,186
Fucked all the whores in king's landing.

207
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,606
It's a terrible thing to say,

208
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,817
but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our lord.

209
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,490
I decided that he, that all the gods,

210
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,951
were stories we
told the children to make them behave.

211
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:40,082
So I wore the robes, and every
now and then I'd recite the prayers,

212
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,793
but it was just for show.

213
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,671
A spectacle for the locals.

214
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,051
Until the mountain
drove a Lance through this one's heart.

215
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:59,310
I knelt beside his cold body
and said the old words.

216
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,230
Not because I believed in them, but...

217
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:09,153
He was my friend and he was dead.

218
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,615
And they were the only words I knew.

219
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,203
And for the first
time in my life, the lord replied.

220
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,834
Beric's eyes opened, and I knew the truth.

221
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,213
Our god is the one true god.

222
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,093
And all men must serve him.

223
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,144
You've been to the other side.

224
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,814
The other side?

225
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,609
There is no other side.

226
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,697
I have been to the darkness, my lady.

227
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,704
He sent you to us for a reason.

228
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,915
You have someone he needs.

229
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,543
Anguy: Bodkin point.

230
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,172
Penetrates plate at 200 yards.

231
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,261
Can you make 'em?

232
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,765
Yeah, nothing tricky about it.
Just need decent steel.

233
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,851
I'll get you the steel.

234
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,561
Man: Come on.

235
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,314
- (Indistinct talking)
- (Wheels squeaking)

236
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,690
Arya: I don't like that woman.

237
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:28,983
(Chuckles)

238
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,278
That's 'cause you're a girl.

239
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,339
What does that have to do with anything?

240
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,781
(Horse neighing)

241
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,163
Forgive me, lad.

242
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,417
(Grunting)

243
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,378
What are you doing? Let go of him.

244
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,995
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

245
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,884
He wants to be one of you. He wants
to join the brotherhood. Stop them!

246
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,513
We serve the lord of light,
and the lord of light needs this boy.

247
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,891
Did the lord of light
tell you that, or did she?

248
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,829
Arya: You're not doing this for your god.

249
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,860
You're doing it for gold.

250
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,737
We're doing it for both, girl.

251
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,784
We can't defend the people without
weapons and horses and food.

252
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,579
And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.

253
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,052
Gendry: You told me
this was a brotherhood.

254
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,901
You told me I could be one of you.

255
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,511
You are more than they can ever be.

256
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,263
They're just foot
soldiers in the great war.

257
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,766
You will make kings rise and fall.

258
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,812
(Panting)

259
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,781
You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.

260
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,996
I see a darkness in you.

261
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,626
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me...

262
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,795
Brown eyes,

263
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,006
blue eyes, green eyes.

264
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,093
Eyes you'll shut forever.

265
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,807
We will meet again.

266
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,686
(Horse neighing)

267
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,413
(Metal clan king)

268
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,922
(Tormund grunting)

269
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,476
(Panting)

270
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,193
(Grunting)

271
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,580
(Wind howling)

272
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,713
(Panting)

273
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,551
You staring at me ass, Jon snow?

274
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,305
Look out!

275
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,099
(Groans)

276
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,355
You all right?

277
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,566
(Grunts)

278
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,486
Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.

279
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,905
(Tormund laughing)

280
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:07,993
(Horn blaring)

281
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,454
(Gasps)

282
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,211
Sorry. Were you sleeping?

283
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,630
(Pants) Wa...

284
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,093
Wa... wa...

285
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,098
Water? You want some water.

286
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,477
I wish I had some for you.

287
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,070
(Whimpers)

288
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,494
So, let's play a game.

289
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,665
Which body part do you need the least?

290
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,544
Please.

291
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,337
"Please" is not a body part.

292
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,964
I'll tell you everything, please.

293
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,424
(Clicks tongue)

294
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,136
But you've already told me everything.

295
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,054
Remember?

296
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,474
(Mocking) Your daddy was mean to you.

297
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,977
The starks didn't appreciate you.

298
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,147
(Normal voice) One good bit, though.

299
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:23,235
The stark boys, they're still alive.

300
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,324
Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?

301
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,120
You failed, but I'm a
better hunter than you.

302
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,041
Now...

303
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,003
How about your little finger? You
don't use that for much, do you?

304
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,006
No? Good. Let's start with that.

305
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,720
Ah!

306
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,854
You've been wondering
why you're here, haven't you?

307
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,190
Where you are.

308
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,486
Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you.

309
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,280
So, guess.

310
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,952
If you guess right, I'll tell you.

311
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,955
By the old gods and the new, I swear it.

312
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,042
You win the game

313
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,545
if you can figure out
who I am and why I'm torturing you,

314
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,924
and I win the game
if you beg me to cut off your finger.

315
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,471
If I win, you'll let me go?

316
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,726
If you think this has a happy ending,

317
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,562
you haven't been paying attention.

318
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,189
Please.

319
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,026
You say "please" again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

320
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,825
You first. Where are we?

321
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,744
The north.

322
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,579
Too vague.

323
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,081
Deepwood motte.

324
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,457
(Boy laughs)

325
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,419
Terrible guess.

326
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,421
(Groans)

327
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,798
(Groaning)

328
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,262
Now, where?

329
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,016
Last hearth.

330
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,560
(Laughs) Do I look like
a fucking umber to you?

331
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,980
(Screams in pain)

332
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,107
Karhold!

333
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,782
Karhold?

334
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,829
How did you know that?

335
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,250
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

336
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,462
It was just a guess.

337
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,632
Very good, lord theon.

338
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,470
And who am I?

339
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,347
Torrhen karstark.

340
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,849
He's dead.

341
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,686
Strangled by the kingslayer.

342
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,356
He was your brother.

343
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,324
Your father is lord Rickard karstark.

344
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,918
You swore to tell me if I...

345
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,252
You're right.

346
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,924
Lord Rickard karstark
is robb stark's bannerman.

347
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,968
I betrayed robb.

348
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,347
That's why you're torturing me.

349
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,768
Yes.

350
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,523
You win.

351
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,995
Of course, you forgot to ask one question.

352
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,665
You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.

353
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,503
(Screaming in pain)

354
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,881
I'm afraid I am.

355
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,509
(Screaming continues)

356
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,971
Everything I told you is a lie.

357
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,351
This isn't happening to you for a reason.

358
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,603
But, well, one reason...

359
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,147
I enjoy it.

360
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,400
Theon: Please, cut it
off! Cut it off! Cut it off!

361
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,235
(Continues screaming)

362
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,283
Iwin.

363
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,035
Robb: Thank you for riding here so quickly.

364
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,496
I know travel isn't easy in these times.

365
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,249
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

366
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,127
When the king of
the north summons us, we come.

367
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,922
Lothar: Our father has instructed
us to tell you that his alliance

368
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,843
with the north can continue
if his terms are met.

369
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,804
Lord frey requires a formal apology

370
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,058
for your violation of your sacred oath
to marry one of his daughters.

371
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,020
Of course.
He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.

372
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,564
As restitution for this betrayal,

373
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,775
he demands harrenhal
and all its attendant lands.

374
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,194
I don't think that's...

375
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,653
We are fighting for the north.

376
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,324
Harrenhal is not in the north.

377
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:25,954
It is his once the war is over and we
have no further strategic need for it.

378
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,583
And there's something else.

379
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,045
We will do whatever
we can to give lord frey what he needs.

380
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,548
Not what, whom.

381
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,968
What?

382
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,974
(Laughs nervously)

383
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,059
Uh, no.

384
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:52,147
Our father requires lord edmure to
wed one of his daughters. Roslin.

385
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,315
How old is she?

386
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,483
Nineteen.

387
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,859
Could I see her first?

388
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,319
You want to count her teeth?

389
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,988
We depart for the twins in the morning.

390
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,074
We need an answer before we leave,

391
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,843
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

392
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,494
or this alliance is at an end.

393
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,497
Your father does
realize we're in the middle of a war?

394
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,958
Father is old.

395
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,754
It will put his heart at peace if he
could see her wed to a good husband.

396
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,425
And his recent experience
has made him wary of long engagements.

397
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,803
He has every right to be.

398
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,014
Please excuse us while we discuss it.

399
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,108
(Door opening)

400
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,285
Why should I let
that old ferret choose my bride for me?

401
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,246
At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.

402
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,872
I'm his liege lord.

403
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,125
Robb: He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

404
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,545
Edmure:
I didn't wound him. My answer is no.

405
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,595
Listen to me and listen
very carefully. You...

406
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,223
The laws of gods and men are very clear.

407
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,976
No man can compel another man to marry.

408
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,312
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

409
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,814
It's all right. You heard him.

410
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,735
If you refuse,
our alliance with the freys is dead.

411
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,572
He's wanted me for
one of his daughters since I was 12.

412
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,449
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.

413
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,493
When I say no, he will come back

414
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,620
and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

415
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,331
You're willing to risk our freedom

416
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,296
and our lives for a
chance at a prettier wife?

417
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,793
I have a war to fight.

418
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,380
We can't win it without them.
I have no time to haggle.

419
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,626
You said you wanted
to make amends for the stone mill.

420
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,262
You recall that heroic engagement?

421
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,227
I had something less permanent in mind.

422
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,440
I've won every battle,
but I'm losing this war.

423
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:05,614
If we don't do this and
do it now, we're lost.

424
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,621
I'll marry her.

425
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,001
You're paying
for my sins, uncle. It's not fair or right.

426
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,420
I'll remember it.

427
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,430
Bolton: I see my men have finally found
you something appropriate to wear.

428
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,682
Brienne: Yes. Most kind of them.

429
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,436
You're a stark bannerman, lord Bolton.

430
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,855
I am acting on lady stark's orders

431
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,316
to return Jaime Lannister
to king's landing.

432
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,028
When king robb left
harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.

433
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,490
If she wasn't his mother,
he'd have hanged her for treason.

434
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,083
I should send you back to robb stark.

435
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,419
You should.

436
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:04,673
But instead, you're sitting
here, watching me fail at dinner.

437
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,634
Why might that be?

438
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,680
Wars cost money.
Many people would pay a great deal for you.

439
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,182
We both know who would pay the most.

440
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,020
Or make you pay the most
if he found out you had captured me

441
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,356
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

442
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,024
You're right.

443
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,612
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.

444
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:28,989
Jaime: It would be,

445
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,826
if you honestly believed
my father would never find out about it.

446
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,162
King robb is keeping
your father quite busy.

447
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,539
He doesn't have time for anything else.

448
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,416
He'll make time for you.

449
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,630
As soon as you're well enough to travel,

450
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,799
I will allow you to go to king's landing

451
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,386
as restitution
for the mistakes my soldiers made.

452
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,764
And you will swear to
tell your father the truth,

453
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,350
that I had nothing to do with your maiming.

454
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,525
Shall we drink on it?

455
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,860
I don't partake.

456
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:12,407
You do understand
how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

457
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,452
Very well.

458
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:21,416
My lady, may our journey
continue without further incident.

459
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,918
Oh, she won't be going with you.

460
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,670
I am charged with bringing ser Jaime to...

461
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,256
Bolton: You are charged
with abetting treason.

462
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,717
I'm afraid I must insist.

463
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,261
You're in no place to insist on anything.

464
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,389
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

465
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,100
about overplaying your position.

466
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,148
- Olenna: Impossible.
- Why?

467
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,025
My grandson is the pride of highgarden.

468
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,029
The most desirable bachelor
in all seven kingdoms.

469
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,573
- Your daughter...
- Is rich,

470
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:57,035
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms,

471
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,455
and the mother of the king.

472
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,581
Old.

473
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,667
Old?

474
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,169
Old.

475
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,256
I'm something of an expert on the subject.

476
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,800
Her change will be upon her before long.

477
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,428
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

478
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,098
You may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

479
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,308
but this is another matter entirely.

480
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,104
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

481
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,569
My stomach remains quite strong, however.

482
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,655
The only thing that
might turn it are details

483
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,324
of your grandson's nocturnal activities.

484
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,535
Do you deny them?

485
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,703
Oh, not at all.

486
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,663
A sword-swallower through and through.

487
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,292
A boy with his affliction
should be grateful for the opportunity

488
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,003
to marry
the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms

489
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,547
and remove the stain from his name.

490
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,717
Did you grow up
with boy cousins, lord tywin?

491
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,554
Sons of your
father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?

492
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,514
Of course.

493
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:03,018
And you never...

494
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,815
Not once? Not in any way?

495
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,900
Never.

496
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,653
I congratulate you upon your restraint.

497
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,906
But it's natural,
boys having a go beneath the sheets.

498
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:22,329
Perhaps highgarden has a high
tolerance for unnatural behavior.

499
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,747
I wouldn't say that.

500
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,416
True, we don't tie ourselves in knots

501
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,002
over a discreet bit of buggery, but

502
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,881
brothers and sisters...

503
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,054
Where I come from, that stain
would be very difficult to wash out.

504
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,640
I will not breathe further life

505
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,975
into a malicious lie by discussing it.

506
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,646
Lie or not,

507
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,982
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

508
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,443
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

509
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,738
and send them off
to kill lannisters and tyrells,

510
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,573
thanks to our new affiliation.

511
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,700
I don't care what people believe.

512
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,577
And neither do you.

513
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,953
(Chuckles)

514
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,165
As an authority on myself, I must disagree.

515
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,794
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

516
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,755
then Joffrey is no king at all,

517
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,842
and house Tyrell is throwing
its prized flower into the dirt.

518
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,721
And if Cersei is too old
to give loras children,

519
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,685
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

520
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,437
It is a chance we simply cannot take.

521
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,440
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable?

522
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,651
All right.

523
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,362
I'll remove it for you.

524
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,324
If you refuse to marry loras to Cersei,

525
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,285
I will name him to the kingsguard.

526
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,622
I'm sure you're familiar
with the kingsguard vows.

527
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,500
He will never marry.
He will never have children.

528
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,545
The Tyrell name will fade.

529
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:57,716
And highgarden will
go to the children of Joffrey and margaery.

530
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,095
You would have your grandson protected
by someone who disgusts you?

531
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,890
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

532
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,018
who takes his vows seriously.

533
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,688
So, shall I draw up the order?

534
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,650
Or do you consent to this match?

535
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:26,536
It's a rare enough thing,
a man who lives up to his reputation.

536
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,498
(Wind howling)

537
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,833
(Indistinct shouting)

538
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,592
(Grunts)

539
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:52,854
(Grunts)

540
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,607
- (Ygritte grunts)
- (Cracking)

541
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,819
(Cracking continues)

542
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,031
(Breathing heavily)

543
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,083
(All screaming)

544
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,800
(Grunting)

545
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,051
(Screaming)

546
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,765
(Both grunting)

547
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,517
(Grunting)

548
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,018
(Both panting in relief)

549
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,229
(Yelling)

550
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,070
We've gotta cut them loose!

551
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,072
No! (Grunting)

552
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,922
(Grunting)

553
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,434
- (Orell grunts)
- (Screams)

554
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,109
(Grunting)

555
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,444
(Gasping)

556
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,452
Take my hand!

557
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,959
(Jon grunting)

558
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,795
(Panting)

559
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,934
(Grunts)

560
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,574
Sansa: That's a wonderful pin.

561
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,286
It's more of a brooch, really.

562
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,542
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

563
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,009
I'm very happy about...

564
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,597
Yes. I am as well.

565
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,077
Sansa: I feel like I'm
in a dream. (Chuckles)

566
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,187
Yes, me, too. Definitely.

567
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,483
I've dreamed of
a large wedding since I was young.

568
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,861
The guests, the food, the tournaments.

569
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,533
And the bride, of course.

570
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,369
(Chuckles)

571
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,666
The most beautiful bride in the world

572
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,753
in a beautiful gown of gold and
green brocade with fringed sleeves.

573
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,508
Have you ever been to highgarden, my lady?

574
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,427
No. I had never left winterfell

575
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,513
before I came to king's landing.

576
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,642
But it sounds wonderful.
I can't wait to see it.

577
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,687
And to leave this place.

578
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,648
It's terrible, isn't it?

579
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,611
The most terrible place there is.

580
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,457
Tyrion: I don't suppose
there's anything we can do about this.

581
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,334
We can have them both killed.

582
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,505
It's hard to say which of the four of us

583
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,465
is getting the worst of this arrangement.

584
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,468
Probably sansa.

585
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:57,306
Though loras will certainly come to
know a deep and singular misery.

586
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,308
Father doesn't discriminate.

587
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,146
We're all being shipped
off to hell together.

588
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,981
On a boat you built.

589
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,984
The tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

590
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,528
I did what I did to protect our family.

591
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,030
I'm your family.

592
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,117
A member of your family who has actively

593
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,619
contributed to that family's survival.

594
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,124
Whether or not you
or father or anyone else wants to admit it.

595
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,959
I do admit it.

596
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,796
If it weren't for your
trick with the wildfire,

597
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,924
Stannis would have sacked
the city before father got here.

598
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,219
Our heads would still be
rotting on the city gate.

599
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:39,348
Trying to have me killed
is an odd way of saying thank you.

600
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,811
There are two people in king's landing

601
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,980
who can give an order to a kingsguard.

602
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,816
Did you or did you not order ser mandon

603
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,694
to kill me during the
battle of the Blackwater?

604
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,664
The impulse I understand.

605
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,960
He hates me because I'm the only one

606
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,713
who tells him what he really is.

607
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:20,348
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead. But his stupidity?

608
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,352
He could have had me
poisoned and no one would have known.

609
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,855
But the king orders a kingsguard

610
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,776
to murder the hand
of the king in full view of his own army.

611
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,319
The boy's an idiot.

612
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,904
What do you want me to say?

613
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,782
I want you to tell me
if my life is still in danger.

614
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,367
Probably.

615
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,496
But not from Joffrey.
He won't do anything now father's here.

616
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:49,460
Seven kingdoms united in fear
of tywin Lannister.

617
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,712
Not the tyrells.

618
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,632
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.

619
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,136
Joffrey will belong to margaery,
the little Doe-eyed whore,

620
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,013
and so will his children
and their children.

621
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,099
History will be taken from our hands.

622
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,311
You may escape, at least.

623
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,522
Once Jaime gets back,

624
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,734
ser loras may come down with a terrible
case of sword through bowels.

625
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,446
When Jaime gets back, yes.

626
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,575
But when will that be?
He's out there somewhere.

627
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,455
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

628
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,669
Who's going to tell her?

629
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,256
Do you think people will like it?

630
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,258
Shae: I don't think
they will even notice it.

631
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,261
You're right. It's not my wedding.

632
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,347
Anyway, from what I can tell,

633
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,308
the dressmakers in highgarden will be

634
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,310
far superior to the ones in king's landing.

635
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,521
They'd never make me
anything as dull as this for my wedding.

636
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,567
Loras likes green and gold brocade.

637
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,444
I'm sure he does.

638
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,947
Will they let me invite my family?

639
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,283
They haven't asked my opinion.

640
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,202
But do you think they will?

641
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,605
Lady sansa, lord Tyrion to see you.

642
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,713
Should I...

643
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,715
I beg your pardon, my lady.

644
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,136
Good afternoon, lord Tyrion. I was
trying on a gown for Joffrey's wedding.

645
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,767
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

646
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,479
I need to speak with you, lady sansa.

647
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,647
Of course.

648
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,274
Alone, if I may.

649
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,109
Why do you need to speak to her alone?

650
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,945
Shae.

651
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,863
Please excuse her. She's not from here.

652
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,660
But I trust her,
even though she tells me not to.

653
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,374
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something,

654
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,335
and it's only aftennards,
when it's too late,

655
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,629
that we realize we wished we'd heard it

656
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,965
under entirely different circumstances.

657
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,883
It's all right, really.

658
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,223
How to begin?

659
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,850
(Door closes)

660
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,310
Tyrion: It's... this...

661
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,064
This... this is awkward.

662
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,027
Varys: A thousand blades

663
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,947
taken from the hands
of aegon's fallen enemies,

664
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,325
forged in the fiery breath
of balerion the dread.

665
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,202
There aren't 1,000 blades.

666
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,789
There aren't even 200.

667
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,291
I've counted.

668
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,626
Varys: (Scoffs) I'm sure you have.

669
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,212
Ugly old thing.

670
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,882
Littlefinger: Yet it has a certain appeal.

671
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,302
The lysa arryn of chairs.

672
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,346
Shame you had to settle
for your second choice.

673
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,473
Early days, my friend.

674
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,018
It is flattering, really,

675
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:58,983
you feeling such dread
at the prospect of me getting what I want.

676
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:03,404
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition, I promise you.

677
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,281
Although who doesn't like to see

678
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,033
their friends fail now and then?

679
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,451
You're so right.

680
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,412
For instance, when I thwarted your plan

681
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,165
to give sansa stark to the tyrells.

682
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,125
If I'm going to be honest,

683
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:20,838
I did feel an unmistakable
sense of enjoyment there.

684
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,508
But your confidant,

685
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:28,054
the one who fed
you information about my plans,

686
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,681
the one you swore to protect...

687
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,226
You didn't bring her any enjoyment.

688
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,772
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.

689
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,193
She was a bad investment on my part.

690
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:49,617
Luckily, I have a friend
who wanted to try something new.

691
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,244
Something daring.

692
00:47:53,621 --> 00:48:00,169
And he was so grateful
to me for providing this fresh experience.

693
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,176
I did what I did for the good of the realm.

694
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,095
The realm?

695
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,098
Do you know what the realm is?

696
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,311
It's the 1,000 blades of aegon's enemies.

697
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:22,566
A story we agree
to tell each other over and over,

698
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,652
till we forget that it's a lie.

699
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:29,407
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

700
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:33,911
Chaos. A gaping pit
waiting to swallow us all.

701
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,664
Chaos isn't a pit.

702
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,834
Chaos is a ladder.

703
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,924
Many who try to climb it fail
and never get to try again.

704
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,469
The fall breaks them.

705
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:04,817
And some are given
a chance to climb, but they refuse.

706
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:12,658
They cling to the realm
or the gods or love.

707
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,035
Illusions.

708
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,914
Only the ladder is real.

709
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,877
The climb is all there is.

710
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,712
(Wind howling)

711
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,381
(Panting)

712
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,940
(Grunting)

713
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,072
(Both panting)

714
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,586
(Cawing)

715
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,671
(Jon grunts)
