00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:37,772
Do you need something?

6
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,901
No, I'm not well.

7
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,529
This is going to pass, Isak.

8
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:03,008
Even if it doesn't look
like it for now...

9
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:05,205
Even though ... it's painful.

10
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,779
Broken hearts always hurt.
You may think it will not happen, but it will.

11
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:31,322
But...

12
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:38,518
Let me know if you want to chat or ...

13
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,612
If you need anything.

right now. Stop sending messages.]

I saw you on July 21, 1999 at 21:21 p.m.

I loved you and I always will.
Love you, forever.]

TUESDAY

19
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,333
Yes, but I do not understand why.
they are friends? Is he Kim?

20
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:59,476
-They're just colleagues-
-Hi.

21
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:02,658
Are you kidding?
Are there waffles in the canteen?

22
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
-Yes.
-We'll talk later.

23
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:09,052
Why did you miss school?

24
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,208
I was a little sad.

25
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:16,553
What happened?

26
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,388
Even surged.

27
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,405
What did he do?

28
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,289
He went out on the street.
Naked in the middle of the night.

29
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,662
Apparently he's bipolar.

30
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,364
-Hi guys.
My mother is also bipolar.

31
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,530
You have a crazy mother too?

32
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,226
She's not crazy, she's bipolar.

33
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:47,345
Yeah, but ... What's she like?

34
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:52,163
She is amazing.
You've met her, haven't you?

35
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:56,583
Yes, I met her, but
she was normal.

36
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,219
She is normal.

37
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:03,885
But ... She only has a few moments.
When she's depressed and happy.

38
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,920
Who were you talking about?

39
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,760
Even. He is also bipolar.

40
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,976
He left naked in the
Street in the middle of the night.

41
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,407
-Oh really?

42
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,510
How hilarious!

43
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,402
It's not funny.

44
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,385
But it's comical. Oh really.

45
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,780
Do you know what my mother did?

46
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,954
She was so angry
With the NSB (Subway),

47
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,247
That she discovered
The name of the manager

48
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:34,775
And sent a letter of
Resignation in his name.

49
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:39,288
Like: "I give up, I cannot
work anymore. Bye!".

50
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:43,774
Where's Even now?

51
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,445
At home, I guess.

52
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:51,961
Not physically but mentally.
Is he happy or depressed?

53
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:54,947
I have not talked to him yet.

54
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:56,408
Why not?

55
00:06:57,716 --> 00:07:00,516
Because it was all a lie
From him.

56
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:03,346
What you mean?

57
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,830
He was a maniac!

58
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:12,025
Been with him for a long time.
He was not a maniac all the time.

59
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:18,094
Because when my mother is maniac,
I cannot get in touch with her.

60
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:21,824
You can get in
touch with Even?

61
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:27,559
Yes, but Sonja said that he's
been a maniac all the time.

62
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,410
Who is Sonja?
- His ex.

63
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,768
Then,

64
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:38,898
You believe when his ex says
That he has no feelings for you?

65
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:43,096
Well smart, Isak ... That's it.
The best thing I heard today...

66
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:46,582
Wow! Wow!

67
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,792
Asked Even
how he feels?

68
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,792
He no...

69
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,205
He is not brain dead
Because he had a maniac episode.

70
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:59,028
Talk to him when
He is calm.

71
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,290
You're very nice, Magnus.
Did you realize that just now?

72
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:09,655
-Yes?
-Okay, thanks Jonas.

73
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:12,193
You're very cool too.

74
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:16,222

77
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:31,632
Hello?
- Hi, Isak.

78
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:42,002
Hey you. How are you doing? Wanted
To know ... are you really going to go on Friday?

79
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:45,371
-Yes I will. When...
-How nice.

80
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,137
-When does it start?
-20: 30

81
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:51,658
Right.

82
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:58,747
-But hey ... cool.
So you have a boyfriend?

83
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,190
I was just,
just kidding.

84
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,589
Yes, OK.

85
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:15,326
But we'll see you on Friday.
I'm excited to see you.

86
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,550
And Mom too.

87
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:19,873
-Yes.

88
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,065
Yeah ... Okay, great.

89
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:26,192
Dad

90
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,650
-Yes?

91
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:31,572
I was not joking.

92
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,047
It's just over.

93
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,433
And That's it.

94
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:49,104
Ok but you are sad
About it, or?

95
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:53,984
-No I'm well.
-OK.

96
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,529
-Well, then...
-Yes Yes.

97
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:03,557
So...
-Bye Bye...

98
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:32,367
From Even:
[Dear Isak. I'm sitting on the spot
Where we met for the first time

99
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,867
And I'm thinking of you. It is almost
21:21. I want to tell you a thousand things.

100
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:39,415
Sorry if I frightened you. Sorry that
I have hurt you. Sorry for not

101
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:43,013
Telling you that I'm bipolar. Was with
afraid to lose you. I had forgotten

102
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:46,536
That it is impossible to lose someone,
Since all humans are alone.

103
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,110
Somewhere else in the universe
We are together for infinity,

104
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,294
remember this.
I love you. Even.]

105
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:40,297
You are not alone.
