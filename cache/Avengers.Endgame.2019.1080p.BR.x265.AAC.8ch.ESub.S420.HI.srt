00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,981
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

153
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,775
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

157
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,948
Thought I was dreaming.

158
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,285
Tony, I'm gonna need you
to focus.

159
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,027
And I needed you.

160
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,240
As in, past tense.

161
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,657
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

162
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,950

166

...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

167
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,431
was a suit of armor
around the world.

168
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,515
Remember that?

169
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,268
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

170
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,476
That's what we needed.

171

Well, that didn't work out,

172
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,308

"We'll do that together, too."

174
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,274
And guess what, Cap?

175
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,730
We lost.

176

And you weren't there.

177
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,942
But that's what we do, right?

178

Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

179

We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

180
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,246
Okay.
Right?

181

00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,971
and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

208

I can tell you
where Thanos is.

211
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,944
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

212
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,611
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

213
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,868
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

214
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,448
I'd ask...

215
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,661
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

216
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,159
And his answer
was always the Same.

217
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,382
"To the Garden."

218
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,758
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

219
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,464
So, where is he?

220
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,880
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

221
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,142
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

222
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,930
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

223
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,311
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

224
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,812
Until two days ago...

225

on this planet.

226
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,435
Thanos is there.

227
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,863

232
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,874

Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

236
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,922
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

237
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,801
If we do this, how do we know

238
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,044
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

239
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,837
Because before
you didn't have me.

456
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,114
Are you okay?

457
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,282
Yeah.

458
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,444
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

459
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,362
Only to make conversation.

460
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,073
All right, so...

461
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,167
five years ago,
right before...

462
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,870
Thanos...

463
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,338
I was in a place
called the quantum realm.

464
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,000
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

465
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,347
To get in there, you have
to be incredibly small.

466
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,007
Hope. She's my, um...

467
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,807
She was my...

468
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,760
She was supposed to
pull me out.

469
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,478
And then Thanos happened...

470
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,310
and I got stuck in there.

471
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,901
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

472
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,234
Yeah, but that's just it.

473
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,565
It wasn't.

474
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,945
For me, it was five hours.

475
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,532
See, the rules of
the quantum realm

476
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,699
aren't like they are up here.

477
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,236
Everything is unpredictable.

478
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,618
Is that anybody's sandwich?

479
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,028
I'm starving.

480
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,488
Scott.

481
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,951
What are you talking about?

482
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,200
<font color="#87CEFA">(muffled)</font> So...

483
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,751
what I'm saying is...

484
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,043
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

485
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,175
The only problem is right now

486
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,677
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

487
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,678
But what if we did?

488
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,721
I can't stop thinking
about it.

489
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,807
What if we could
somehow control the chaos...

490
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,100
and we could navigate it?

491
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,768
What if there was a way...

492
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,478
that we could enter
the quantum realm

493
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,729
at a certain point in time...

494
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,273
but then exit
the quantum realm

495
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,435
at another point in time?

496
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,940
Like...

497
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,777
Like before Thanos.
<font color="#FFA500"><b>STEVE</b></font>: Wait.

498
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,528
Are you talking
about a time machine?

499
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,441
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

500
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,653
This is more like a...

501
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,612
Yeah. Like a time machine.

502
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,665
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

503
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,876
<font color="#87CEFA">(stammers)</font> But I can't stop
thinking about it.

504
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,118
There's gotta be...

505
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,337
some way... <font color="#87CEFA">(sighs)</font>

506
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,125
It's crazy.
<font color="#FFA500"><b>NATASHA</b></font>: Scott.

507
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,585
I get emails from a raccoon...

508
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,750
so nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

509
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,594
So, who do we talk to
about this?

510
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,946
Chow time!

511
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,446
Maguna.

512
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,189
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

513
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,251
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Define "lunch"</i></font>

514
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,493
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>or be disintegrated.</i></font>
Okay.

515
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,371
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

516
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,965
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

517
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,047
I'm making for Mom.

518
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,387
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

519
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,642
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

520
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,350
No.
That's what you want.

521
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,637
How did you find this?

522
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,645
Garage.
Really?

523
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,807
Were you looking for it?
No.

524
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,559
I found it, though.
Hmm.

525
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,478
You like
going in the garage, huh?

526
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,657
So does Daddy. <font color="#87CEFA">(grunts)</font>

527
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,492
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

528
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,446
So, I'm gonna...

529
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,600
<font color="#87CEFA">(stammers)</font> No.
We know what it sounds like.

530
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,726
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

531
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,811
is anything really impossible?

532
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,020
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

533
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,940
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

534
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:28,977
Can we agree on that?

535
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,231
Thank you.

536
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,519
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

537
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,103
I did.
No.

538
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,240
You accidentally survived.
<font color="#87CEFA">(sighs)</font>

539
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,403
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

540
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,661
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

541
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,039
A time heist?

542
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,418
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

543
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,711
Why didn't we think
of this before?

544
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,338
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

545
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,591
The stones are in the past.

546
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,992
We could go back,
we could get them.

547
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,380
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

548
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,466
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

549
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,639
I don't believe we would.

550
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,762
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

551
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,351
However, high hopes
won't help...

552
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,564
if there's no logical,
tangible way

553
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,024
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

554
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,153
I believe
the most likely outcome

555
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,237
will be our collective demise.

556
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,072
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

557
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,993
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

558
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,530
no betting on sporting events.

559
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,445
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

560
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,832
Are you seriously telling me

561
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,620
that your plan
to save the universe...

562
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,455
is based on
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>Back to the Future?</i></font>

563
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,329
Is it?
No.

564
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,632
Good. You had me
worried there.

565
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,841
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

566
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,129
That's not how
quantum physics works.

567
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,464
Tony.

568
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,888
We have to take a stand.

569
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,424
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

570

<font color="#FFA500"><b>SCOTT</b></font>: I know you got
a lot on the line.

572
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,767
But I lost someone
very important to me.

573
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,526
A lotta people did.

574
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,689
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

575
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,116
to bring everyone back,

576
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,701
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

577

That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,318
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

610
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,562
Except it was worse for me...

611
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,947
'cause I lost twice.

612
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,903
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

613
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,202
and then, we all lost.

614
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,444
No one blamed you, Bruce.

615
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,987
I did.

616
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,083
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

617
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,293
like he's
some kind of disease...

618
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,751
something to get rid of.

619
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,167
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

620
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,875
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

621
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,634
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

622
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,045
and now, look at me.

623
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,430
Best of both worlds.

624
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,516
Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
Yes.

625
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,017
Can we get a photo?

626
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,429
100%, little person.

627
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,643
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

628
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,193
Oh, yeah, yeah.
<font color="#FFA500"><b>SMART HULK</b></font>: Thanks.

629

00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,690
That's a good one.

633
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,735
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

634
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,416
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

635
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,667
Nobody does.
No, he wants you to take

636
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,461
a picture with him.
I don't want a picture.

639

I don't want it, either.

Sorry.

Right.

656
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,071
The whole time travel do-over?

657
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:55,115
Eh, guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

658
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,824
Well, you pulled this off.

659
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,666
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

660
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,582
I've got a mild inspiration.

661
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,958
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

662
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,127
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

I should put it in a lockbox

Let me ask you something.

If we can do this, you know...

1004

go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

First of all, that's horrible.

It's Thanos.

1008
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,907
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

1009
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,238
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

1010

Look, we go back,
we get the stones

before Thanos gets them...

1012
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,033

the stones. Problem solved.

that past becomes
your future...

1028

becomes the past...

01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,146
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1070
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,605
Our history.

1071
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,772
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1072
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,736
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

1073
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,442
Correct.

1074
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,410
So, let's start
with the Aether.

1075
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,787
Thor, what do you know?

1076
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,586
<font color="#FFA500"><b>NATASHA</b></font>: Is he asleep?

1077
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,293
<font color="#FFA500"><b>RHODES</b></font>: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1078
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,048
Uh, where to start? Um...

1079
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,260
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1080
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,557
Someone called it
a stone before.

1081
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,938
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1082
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,817
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1083
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:00,979
and stop saying that.

1084
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,982
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1085
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,021
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1086
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,692
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1087
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,570
Ooh. <font color="#87CEFA">(chuckles)</font> Scary beings.

1088
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,454
So, Jane, actually...

1089
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,577
Oh, there she is.

1090
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,411
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1091
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,627
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1092
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,635
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1093
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,841
and she became
very, very sick.

1094
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,974
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1095
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,136
which is where I'm from...

1096
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,267
and we had to try and fix her.

1097
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,053
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1098
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,598
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1099
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,980
<font color="#87CEFA">(sighs)</font> who's dead and, um...

1100
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,989
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1101
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,991
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1102

<font color="#87CEFA">(mouthing)</font>

1103
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,368
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1104
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,786
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1105
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,788
Why don't you come sit down?
I'm not done yet.

1106
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,415
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1107
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,827
is impermanence. <font color="#87CEFA">(laughs)</font>

1108
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,872

1109
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,083
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,593
against the forces
of darkness...

1508
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,924
our world would be overrun.

1509
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,805
Millions will suffer.

1510
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,216
So, tell me, Doctor.

1511
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,972
Can your science
prevent all that?

1512
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,145
No...

1513
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,263
but we can erase it.

1514
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,147
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1515
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,479
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1516
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,144
at the moment it was taken.

1517
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,779
So, chronologically...

1518
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:40,861
in that reality...

1519
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,115
it never left.

1520
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,583
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1521
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,630
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1522
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,383
We will. I will. I promise.

1523
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,257
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1524
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,767
It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1525
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,555
to protect the Time Stone.

1526
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,803
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1527
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,855
What did you say?

1528
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,359
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1529
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:18,569
Willingly?
Yes.

1530
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:24,243
Why?
I have no idea.

1531
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,985
Maybe he made a mistake.

1532
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,417
Or I did.

1533
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,107
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1534
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,772
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1535
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,191
I fear you might be right.

that the greater good

When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

how to successfully operate
that thing?

1888
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:26,485
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1889
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,646
I thought about
what my dad did.

I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1893
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:35,954
And now, looking back on it,

1894
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:37,241
I just remember
the good stuff.

1895
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:38,996

Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1977
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,068

the stones...

Isn't that right?

And we're talking
about space magic.

2037

maybe...
