
1
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,808
Let me go!

2
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:07,600
Let me go!

3
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:10,017
Let me go!

4
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:12,142
Leave me--

5
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:13,392
Release me!

6
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:15,225
Let go of me!

7
00:01:27,683 --> 00:01:29,975
It's confirmed, boss.
He's our target.

8
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,808
No--

9
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:11,433
Don't kill me.

10
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,933
Hey! Ask him to text me
after transferring the money.

11
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:33,017
Okay.

12
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,267
Where is that guy?
What's he doing inside?

13
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:58,975
He may land us in trouble.

14
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:00,058
What, boss?

15
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,017
- Boss, my foot!
- Okay, boss.

16
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:36,933
<i>Breaking news for our viewers!</i>

17
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:41,142
<i>The news I'm about to share
has never happened earlier in this area.</i>

18
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:43,225
<i>It's a rampage all around.</i>

19
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:47,225
A hyena has been spotted here.

20
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:59,767
Saffron TV will give you
live updates by the minute.

21
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,475
People from nearby villages
have gathered here.

22
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,517
We have no idea
what the hyena is going to do.

23
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:15,517
Tell me, Joshy.

24
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,120
Sathya, I'm trying to reach Parthiban.

25
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:18,808
His phone is not reachable.
Where is he?

26
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,100
He must have gone
to drop Siddhu at school.

27
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:24,183
Try calling Siddhu.
His phone will be in the car.

28
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:26,850
If he gets in touch,
please ask him to call me.

29
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,267
Handle this properly!

30
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,225
Place a barricade there.
Hurry up!

31
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:31,350
- Kumar.
- Sir?

32
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:34,725
- What's happening?
- Sir, nothing's right here. Everything--

33
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,642
Sir, nothing is right here.

34
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:39,159
- If it continues, many will be injured.
- Whom have they sent?

35
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:41,475
Two experts have come
from Wild Life SOS team.

36
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:44,350
They've handled only cheetahs,
but this is a hyena.

37
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,600
Nobody knows how to handle this, sir.

38
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,100
Parthiban, we have a situation.
It's an emergency.

39
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:54,683
Can you come here?

40
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:57,767
All right, first, see the photo
that I've sent you.

41
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,600
Footprints are large.

42
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:08,183
Maybe it's a spotted hyena.
If so, it will be extremely ferocious.

43
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,475
Okay.
How soon can you get here?

44
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:30,350
Promise me, you won't tell your mom
that you were late for school today.

45
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,142
You promise me that you won't tell mom

46
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:37,892
that I took my phone to school
just for today.

47
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,517
Please, Dad!

48
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:55,767
The situation
is not under control, Parthiban.

49
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,767
Hyenas are social animals, Joshy.

50
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,475
They live in packs.

51
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,058
If a hyena is alone here,
either it has lost its way

52
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:06,392
or the rest of its clan is dead.
People will fear it and try to kill it.

53
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:07,909
But we have to think
how we can capture it alive.

54
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,850
If you think like your men,
it will feast on us happily.

55
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,308
What to do now?
What are you suggesting?

56
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,183
Walkie-Talkie.

57
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:19,475
- Hey, Channel 3. We are on Channel 3.
- Got it.

58
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,392
Dad, I'll come along.
I'll be helpful.

59
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,767
Stay in the car, my dear son.

60
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,933
That will be the biggest help.

61
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:30,308
I don't want to get chided by your mom.

62
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:31,433
Okay?

63
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,767
Put it!
Put up the barricades.

64
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,183
Push it here, quickly.
Hurry up. Come on.

65
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:39,243
- Why did you place the barricades?
- DFO's orders, sir.

66
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:40,475
Watch out.

67
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:42,642
What are you looking at?
Do it now.

68
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,058
Sir, why did you place
the barricades here?

69
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:50,183
The animal will barge into the school.
It's very risky. Please remove it.

70
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,017
Ranger, listen to me.

71
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,642
I'll give you my uniform.
Do my job as well.

72
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,017
Hey! What are you all looking at?

73
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,868
- Place the barricade properly.
- Come in, Parthiban.

74
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:02,558
- Yeah, Joshy.
- They think it's a joke. Such a mess!

75
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:04,451
I don't know what to do.
The situation is out of control.

76
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,725
Get a tranquilizer from the sanctuary.

77
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:08,201
I'll tell you when to fire
and from where.

78
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,350
Yes, okay.

79
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,975
Catch it--

80
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:19,392
It's scared and is looking
for a place to hide.

81
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,409
They are trying to kill it
without understanding that.

82
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,284
If this continues,
the hyena will enter the school.

83
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,892
Bring the tranquilizer
to the west end of the school.

84
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:28,017
Help!

85
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,517
Help--

86
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:33,475
All the kids should go in!

87
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:35,475
All the kids should go in!

88
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:37,683
Kids, get inside!

89
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,683
Students,
go to your classrooms immediately.

90
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,392
It's an emergency!
Teachers and staff!

91
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:54,267
Please take all the children
safely into the classroom.

92
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,058
There is no time.
Hurry up!

93
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:01,808
Get in--

94
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,975
Go. Get in!

95
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,975
I got permission for a tranquilizer gun.
I'm taking it, okay?

96
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:10,225
Okay, sir.

97
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,558
<i>Parthiban.</i>

98
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,392
<i>I'm in position.</i>

99
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:07,892
Joshy, wait!

100
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:10,600
Don't aim at its neck
like our usual procedure.

101
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,600
Its striking force will be as heavy
as its pitch of laughter.

102
00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:16,058
Aim for the lungs!

103
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:23,308
Shoot.

104
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,267
Darn.

105
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:32,433
- Hang on.
- This is the perfect time. Shoot, Joshy.

106
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,683
The gun is jammed, Parthiban.

107
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:39,558
A gun can't adapt
to the situation and operate.

108
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:42,308
It's a machine.
You need to service it every month.

109
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:43,267
- Siddhu?
- Dad.

110
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,475
Get your spear.

111
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:47,267
- Give your shoe lace to Joshy.
- Okay, Dad.

112
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:55,642
- Don't go--
- Run away.

113
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,975
You heard your dad, right?

114
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,433
Give me your shoe laces.

115
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,392
- Uncle, give the javelin to me.
- What?

116
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:03,683
Get inside!

117
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,183
Let's go!

118
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:20,517
<i>Parthiban, the spear you asked for
is on its way.</i>

119
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,142
- Tell my dad that I'm throwing it.
- Parthiban, here it comes!

120
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,392
Hey, come on, move.

121
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,725
Who is that man?

122
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,267
His name is Parthiban.

123
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,058
He's from Tamil Nadu.

124
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:43,767
Animal rescuer.

125
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,100
He runs a coffee shop nearby.

126
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,142
Hey!

127
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,017
- Get inside.
- Please, sir.

128
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:53,392
Come on, start.

129
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,850
Wait a minute.

130
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,892
Ask the questions in an order.
The DFO will answer you.

131
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:03,767
Look. This issue is not something
out of the ordinary.

132
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,392
It is our daily job.

133
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,159
Animals migrate
in search of food and water--

134
00:13:07,183 --> 00:13:09,743
We've got exclusive news.
Why are you here instead of covering it?

135
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:13,433
There's nothing to cover here.
These forest officers didn't do anything.

136
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,975
A middle-aged man in a white shirt
that was tucked in.

137
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:19,017
Find him and get
the real information from him.

138
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:20,475
That is exclusive.

139
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:22,100
- White shirt. Middle-aged man?
- Yes.

140
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:24,183
Where do I find him in this crowd?

273
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,058
Everyone on the road is panic-stricken
and running around.

274
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:12,308
At that time, the serial killer
stands in the middle of the road

275
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:13,892
and shoots blindly.

276
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:17,267
There's already a pile of corpses
on the road.

277
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,892
He is notorious.
He shoots whomever he sees.

278
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:26,892
At that time, a brave and bold
police officer arrives

279
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:29,142
and fires at the serial killer.

280
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,850
The serial killer runs and hides.

281
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,392
The police officer reloads the gun

282
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,142
and in that gap, the serial killer fires.

283
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,225
Hey--

284
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:43,058
So the wounded police officer
falls at your feet.

285
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:47,308
He falls at the place where
you were safely hiding behind the car.

286
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:52,017
Now the police officer's gun
is in your hand

287
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:54,350
and you have a clean shot.

288
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:01,433
The serial killer doesn't know
that you are there

289
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:05,100
but you can easily shoot him
from your position.

290
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,517
We got only Rs. 300.

291

And just this phone.

292
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:12,433
Hey! Get rid of this
and look for a bigger car.

293
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,517
And you have an easy way out.

294
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,433
You can even escape
without being seen by anyone.

295
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:21,100

297

Oh! Will you just sleep?

298
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:29,808
- Yes.
- Siddhu, it's getting late. Go to bed.

299
00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:31,243
Wait, Mom.
Just a couple of minutes.

300
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:35,017
I'll take the easy way out
and bring in more police officers.

301
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,142
No, by then, the serial killer
will kill more innocent people.

Help me!

318
00:24:39,808 --> 00:24:41,975
- PIN?
- Please don't hurt me.

319
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,850
- What's the PIN?
- Don't hurt me.

320
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:47,808
- What's the PIN?
- Please.

321
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:53,058
- No.
- What's the PIN?

322
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,558
Please don't.

323
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:56,267
Then I'll shoot him myself.

324
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,558
If you shoot him,
you'll also become a murderer.

325
00:25:07,142 --> 00:25:11,433
It is against the law.
Think of something else.

326
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Picture yourself.

327
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:15,267
Hey! Why did you shoot him?

328
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,725
How did you get this gun?

329
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,517
- PIN?
- What?

330
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,850
PIN?

331
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:26,725
I don't know what else to say, Dad.

332
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:29,642
Whichever way you see it,
my hands will be blood stained.

333
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:33,183
How does it matter if it's the blood
of a saint or a sinner?

334
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,517
Siddhu, go.
Go upstairs and sleep, It's getting late.

335
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:43,142
Chintu, come.

336
00:26:21,183 --> 00:26:22,475
Dad!

337
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:23,808
Dad!

338
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,350
The only option is to shoot him.

339
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:28,933
Whom do you intend to shoot?

340
00:26:29,017 --> 00:26:31,892
The killer in the picture-yourself story.

341
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:33,475
Picture yourself?

342
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:37,725
I already told you.
Then you'll also be a murderer.

343
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:40,183
You'll end up in jail.
You can't even sleep peacefully.

344
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,100
Is that okay?

345
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,475
I won't be sent to jail.
I'll be sent to a juvenile home.

346
00:26:45,142 --> 00:26:47,517
And if I'm lucky,
I'll get a sewing machine.

347
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I Googled it.

348
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:51,808
Go!

349
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:55,183
- What were you busy chatting?
- Nothing.

350
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:56,600
What time is the wedding?

351
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,642
We'll drop her at the school
and reach on time.

352
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:02,142
He knows everything, right
up to getting a sewing machine!

353
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:04,142
Both of you, please sign.

354
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,017
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

355

Please come and sign.

356

357
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:17,267
I'll see you guys.

358
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,850
- Bye.
- Yeah, see you, sir.

359
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,308
You can touch her only after I say so.

360
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,892
Take good care of her.

361
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,100
- Bye.
- Bye.

362
00:27:27,183 --> 00:27:28,475
What about you, madam?

363
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,558
I've some work in the record room.
I'll go home by myself after that.

364
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:35,392
Do you wish to say anything?

365
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,558
Stop telling Siddhu
such nonsense picture-yourself stories.

366
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:41,975
- Why? What happened?
- Show me your phone.

367
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,600

368
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,475

Mine or his?

369
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:53,267

No, I'm just reading it.

374
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,267
Who taught him all this?
How does he know?

375
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,475
Okay, I'll ensure
this doesn't happen again.

376
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:10,642
- I'll keep an eye too!
- Okay.

377
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,600
Great horned owl, Joshy.

378
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:23,808
It's already
in the protected species' list.

379
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,267
Where did you get this?

380
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:30,433
Sir, this owl is from Australia.
We caught it. We know about it.

381
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:32,683
- He's lying, sir.
- I'll slap you!

382
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Is it necessary to do this at this age?
How many more owls did you catch?

383
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:38,600
Just this one, sir.
I hit it with my slingshot.

384
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,850
It fell down unconscious with a thud.

385
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,183
Joshy, inform Blue Cross.
It needs immediate treatment.

386
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:46,725
Send for our veterinary doctor too.

387
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,975
He's no more.

388
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,743
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

389
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,225
He died on the spot
in a car accident last night.

390
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:57,642
I think he lost control
and fell headlong into the valley.

391
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:00,725
Yeah.

392
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
What?

393
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,933
Okay, I'll come.
Yeah.

394
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,517
It's not a car accident.

395
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,353
It was a planned murder
of the veterinary doctor.

396
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,933
Murder?
How come?

397
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:22,600
He was shot dead.
I just got the information.

398
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,433
Did they use a gun in our town?

399
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:27,808
Last week, when the collector died

400
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:31,100
I thought it's a hit and run case,
but now the veterinary doctor--

401
00:29:31,183 --> 00:29:33,642
Looks like a killing spree.

402
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:35,767
I don't get it, Joshy.

403
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,392
I've lived in this town
for the past 20 years.

404
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:40,600
I've never heard of anything like this.

405
00:29:40,683 --> 00:29:42,767
How did anyone get a gun
in this town, Joshy?

406
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,975
Parthiban, why are you anxious?
We'll take care of it.

407
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:48,183
I'll go now and check.

408
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,600
Shall I come along?

Lal, drive to the hospital first.

547
00:41:56,725 --> 00:42:00,433
It doesn't look like a clot.
No physical injuries.

548
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:03,642
But she is showing signs of PTSD.

549
00:42:03,892 --> 00:42:06,975
This child is in shock.
She is bound to feel anxious.

550
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,975
But there's nothing to worry.
I'll give her some medicine.

551
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:12,433
Take good care of her, okay?

552
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,433
Parthiban.

553
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:21,267
Parthiban, stop thinking about it
and getting upset.

554
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:24,642
Anyone in your place
would've done the same.

555
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:27,225
We will face the consequences.

556
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:29,767
I'll be there for you.

557
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,183
I'll take care of the children
till you get released.

558
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:38,642
- But don't regret--
- Sathya, I don't know what happened.

559
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:43,100
He went towards Chintu.

560
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,058
I saw him.

561
00:42:47,017 --> 00:42:48,475
I was--

562
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,892
After that--

563
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:53,975
- Sir, I can't wait any longer.
- May I go in?

564
00:42:59,808 --> 00:43:01,618
Parthiban, the police officers
are waiting outside.

565
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:04,433
They say they can't wait any longer
to start the remand procedures.

566
00:43:04,517 --> 00:43:08,058
- Joshy, without this remand--
- Sathya, are you kidding?

567
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:10,892
Do you know the seriousness of this?

568
00:43:11,142 --> 00:43:12,892
Five of them have been killed.

569
00:43:13,308 --> 00:43:15,892
What do you want me to do?
He's a murderer now.

570
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:19,683
He has to be remanded for 15 days.
We have to follow procedures.

571
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:22,493
We can handle everything
after he's produced in the court.

572
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,975
Don't panic, okay?

573
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:28,767
Parthiban, let's go.

574
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,100
- Come on--
- Thanks.

575
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:45,475
According to the ballistic reports,
five bullets fired from the gun

576
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,808
penetrated the victims' foreheads
at point-blank range.

577
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,767
Not a single bullet misfired.

578
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,975
A person who has never
handled a gun before

579
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:55,808
was able to fire five bullets
in a split second. How?

580
00:43:55,892 --> 00:44:00,058
Sometimes, even trained police officers
struggle to shoot below the knee.

581
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:02,975
But without being least perturbed

582
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:05,933
how could he shoot five times
at point blank range?

583
00:44:06,017 --> 00:44:08,100
Inspector Bhawar Jetha.

584
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:10,683
Compare Mr. Parthiban's shooting skill

585
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:13,725
with that of a few ordinary men.

586
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,558
This court orders proper proof
backed with adequate explanation.

587
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,058
Nazrat!

588
00:44:22,517 --> 00:44:23,933
Go and stand over there.

589
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:28,058
- Hey! Stop!
- Shahid.

590
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:29,475
Note down everything.

591
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:30,975
Sashikanth.

592
00:44:32,642 --> 00:44:35,058
- What are you doing?
- First lower the gun.

593
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,725
Parthiban!

594
00:44:39,017 --> 00:44:40,267
Parthiban!

595
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,600
Step forward.

596
00:45:23,475 --> 00:45:24,850
- Kumar.
- Sir?

597
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:26,475
Give him the 9 mm.

598
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:08,933
The man who killed my husband

599
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:13,100
and my younger brother--

600
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:16,767
Only after I send him
with his family to their graves

601
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:20,975
will I allow the funeral rites
of my husband to be performed.

602
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:23,975
I take this vow!
I promise!

603
00:46:24,058 --> 00:46:25,642
I swear by both of them!

604
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:36,308
It's okay.

605
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:42,017
Parthiban, here--

606
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,892
Your action was only a general exception.
Don't worry.

607
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:48,225
Parthiban! The ones you killed
weren't good people.

608
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:51,267
They are all gangsters.
It will come under self-defense.

609
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,267
Okay?
Nothing to worry.

610
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,308
We'll take care.
Okay?

611
00:46:56,808 --> 00:46:59,808
Your Honor, a few days ago,
when a spotted hyena

612
00:46:59,892 --> 00:47:04,225
strayed into our town,
everyone wanted to kill it

613
00:47:04,308 --> 00:47:06,600
but my client risked his life

614
00:47:06,683 --> 00:47:09,017
and saved the hyena
from the people's cruel assault.

615
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,683
This is my question, Your Honor.

616
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:13,267
How can a man who loves
even a beast to this extent

617
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,100
kill those five men?

618
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:18,017
He killed those ruthless men
in an act of self-defense

619
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,980
with the sole intention of saving his
employee, his daughter and himself.

620
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:23,767
Your Honor,
the mighty penal code may insulate

621
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,142
this gentleman's act of self-defense.

622
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:33,183
Bearing in mind the interrogation,

623
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,933
arguments and statements debated here,

624
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:39,850
having scrutinized this case thoroughly,

625
00:47:40,017 --> 00:47:42,892
Mr. Parthiban, the accused,
remanded for the crime

626
00:47:42,975 --> 00:47:46,433
as per IPC Section 103 and 106,

627
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,767
has been proven innocent.

628
00:47:49,475 --> 00:47:52,808
The court pronounces its verdict.

629
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:57,767
Also, I recommend
to our government to award

630
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,767
Mr. Parthiban with
the National Bravery Award for this year.

631
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:04,933
Parthiban,
walk free with your head held high.

632
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:21,017
Move!

633
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,558
- Move them out of the way.
- Move aside.

634
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:26,725
Move out of the way.
Ask them to move out of the way.

635
00:48:27,683 --> 00:48:30,350
- Is the decision to acquit you right?
- Move.

636
00:48:30,558 --> 00:48:33,392
What's the reason
you had to shoot five people?

637
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:34,475
Come.

638
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:40,225
Give me that.

639
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:41,933
Get in.

640
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:43,392
Sir--

641
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:44,892
Move!

642
00:48:45,183 --> 00:48:46,725
Move. Move out of the way.

643
00:48:46,808 --> 00:48:48,850
- Sir--
- Sir!

644
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:54,642
You okay?

645
00:49:02,267 --> 00:49:03,350
Dad.

646
00:49:03,642 --> 00:49:05,350
- Yes?
- You were right, Dad.

647
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:08,975
Even if we're holding a gun,
we shouldn't shoot.

648
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:10,975
That isn't easy.

649
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:12,933
I can picture myself.

650
00:49:18,017 --> 00:49:21,600
I feel sorry for you, Dad.
I can't bear to see you like this.

651
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:32,808
The dead men have many cases against them.
They aren't ordinary criminals.

652
00:49:32,892 --> 00:49:36,350
This is a loss to their acquaintances.
Do you think they will keep quiet?

653
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:38,975
<i>To be on the safer side,
be careful, Sathya.</i>

654
00:50:15,642 --> 00:50:17,433
D'Souza, here you go!

655
00:50:29,558 --> 00:50:31,183
I can't forget everything

656
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:34,517
and go back to normal
at the coffee shop, Sathya.

657
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,183
I'm unable to focus.

688
00:52:04,725 --> 00:52:07,100
I kept it somewhere here.

689
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:10,433
Where is it?

690
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:15,475
What are you looking for?
You won't find anything there.

691
00:52:15,558 --> 00:52:18,600
You need to buy something
to claim that it's missing.

692
00:52:18,892 --> 00:52:21,725
How much longer will you hide
at home, Parthiban?

693
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:25,225
The cafe has been closed since ten days.

694
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:28,475
You aren't even sending
your daughter to school.

695
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:30,308
Just look at their faces.

696
00:52:30,975 --> 00:52:33,308
Not only have you confined yourself
to the home

697
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:36,767
you've kept your family locked up
within these four walls.

698
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:41,600
How long will you shut your ears
when you hear a slight noise?

699
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:44,642
Go get some fresh air.

700
00:52:44,892 --> 00:52:48,517
I'll take care of the house.
Take your family out first.

701
00:52:50,308 --> 00:52:51,725
Go!

702
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:10,225
I feel like drinking coffee.

703
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:13,142
I'm stepping out to buy a packet of milk.

704
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:14,850
Do any of you want anything?

705
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:37,225
- Greetings, sir.
- Hello, sir.

706
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:39,850
- Hi, sir.
- Greetings.

707
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:42,142
He is a brave man.

708
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,600
Parthiban, I need to buy
something in that shop.

709
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,017
You guys come with me.

710
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:53,683
Buy whatever you wanted.
Come, Siddhu.

711
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:55,058
- Take care.
- Okay, Dad.

712
00:53:56,642 --> 00:53:58,933
Mom, I want bread omelet.

713
00:53:59,017 --> 00:54:00,600
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

714
00:54:00,725 --> 00:54:03,058
- One bread omelet, please.
- Okay, ma'am.

715
00:54:03,142 --> 00:54:05,350
- You give it, I'll be back.
- Okay, Mom.

716
00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:12,392
- Hello?
- <i>We've got an SOS alert from CR, sir.</i>

717
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:13,350
- <i>It's a pitch deck information.</i>
- Yeah.

718
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:17,058
There's some suspicious activity in town.
Parthiban's family is in danger.

719
00:54:17,142 --> 00:54:19,683
We got this information
from an undercover agent two weeks ago.

720
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:21,308
<i>But the inspector hid it.</i>

721
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,493
<i>So inform his family not to go out
without protection, sir.</i>

722
00:54:23,517 --> 00:54:25,558
Yeah, okay, I'll call you back.

723
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,058
Parthiban, where are you?

724
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:34,892
- I'm at the market.
- <i>Does anyone seem suspicious around?</i>

725
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:41,475
<i>Parthiban?</i>

726
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:44,892
- No. Why?
- The department got information

727
00:54:44,975 --> 00:54:46,475
that some unwanted elements are here.

728
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:49,475
Do me a favor, just drop whatever
you're doing and get back into the car.

729
00:54:49,558 --> 00:54:51,142
<i>Right now, please--</i>

730
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:08,975
Hey! Only after I kill you and your family

731
00:55:09,058 --> 00:55:12,100
and take your head with me,
will I bury my brother-in-law.

732
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,558
Behead him!

733
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:10,017
Parthiban!

734
00:57:11,725 --> 00:57:13,308
Hey!

735
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,475
Sathya, move back!

736
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:21,683
Why do you lay your dirty hands
on my family?

737
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:14,183
Parthiban, don't!
Listen to me.

738
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,808
Parthiban!

739
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,350
Parthiban! Parthiban, don't!
Listen to me!

740
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:29,100
- Let me go!
- No! Parthiban!

741
00:58:43,017 --> 00:58:45,600
Parthiban! What are you doing?
Leave them alone.

742
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:48,392
If I let them go, they will kill us!

743
00:59:16,058 --> 00:59:19,725
Parthi, I'm scared to see you
sitting here like this.

744
00:59:20,517 --> 00:59:22,558
We could've come
when the inspector called, right?

745
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,892
Let's go home now.

746
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:26,558
I'm not going anywhere.

747
00:59:27,642 --> 00:59:28,642
- Kumar!
- Sir!

748
00:59:28,725 --> 00:59:31,017
Why is it so crowded outside?
Is it a fish market?

749
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,433
- Parthi, let's go.
- Go and see.

750
00:59:33,892 --> 00:59:35,183
What are our men doing outside?

751
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:38,058
What is it? I'd asked you to register
a complaint and leave, right?

752
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:40,850
Why do you insist
on waiting for the inspector?

753
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:42,892
Don't we have any other damn work?

754
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,642
Go to the writer's table
and he'll write what you say.

755
00:59:45,725 --> 00:59:48,034
Either sign or stamp your thumbprint
and leave, understand?

756
00:59:48,058 --> 00:59:49,142
I'll see to it.

757
00:59:49,392 --> 00:59:51,100
Hey! Send my tea inside.

758
00:59:55,933 --> 00:59:57,308
Where are you going?

759
00:59:58,558 --> 01:00:00,850
What will you see?
Will you see us die?

760
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:05,350
Do we have to live in fear and wonder
who will attack us every time we step out?

761
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:07,433
Why are you getting worked up?

762
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:13,267
Two weeks ago, one of the corpses
from the shoot-out

763
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,183
went missing from the mortuary.

764
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:18,392
The department asked you to alert us.

765
01:00:18,517 --> 01:00:20,100
Why didn't you caution us, sir?

766
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:23,183
Who told you all this?
The ranger?

767
01:00:23,475 --> 01:00:24,475
Look here.

768
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:27,183
Do we have to think of you
24Ã—7 and serve only you?

769
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:28,100
In all fairness--

770
01:00:28,183 --> 01:00:29,493
- Wait, dear. Wait.
- Please, let's go, Parthi.

771
01:00:29,517 --> 01:00:31,850
In all fairness,
I did what you should've done.

772
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:34,243
I had no choice but to shoot
those who tried to kill my daughter.

773
01:00:34,267 --> 01:00:35,558
They died!
That's all.

774
01:00:36,892 --> 01:00:38,975
Please. No need.
Let's go home, please.

775
01:00:39,058 --> 01:00:42,058
- Please.
- I want an armed guard

776
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:44,142
posted at my house 24Ã—7.

777
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:46,142
I won't leave until then.

778
01:00:46,433 --> 01:00:48,558
Hey! Get up, man!

779
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:50,225
I'm telling you to get up!

780
01:00:50,308 --> 01:00:52,183
Get up!
Get up from here!

781
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:53,267
Please.
Let's go.

782
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:55,308
Do you think
you are a politician with clout?

783
01:00:55,392 --> 01:00:56,683
Get out!

784
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:58,017
Out!

785
01:00:59,725 --> 01:01:02,517
He wants an armed policeman, it seems.

786
01:01:04,308 --> 01:01:08,517
You can't just order
and get an armed cop at your disposal.

787
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,433
The law and the government
must pass the order.

788
01:01:12,808 --> 01:01:14,576
- Let's go, please--
- You are neither the law--

789
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,392
- Please. Let's go.
- --nor the government.

790
01:01:16,475 --> 01:01:19,475
You are a common man
who sells bun and butter, Parthiban.

791
01:01:19,558 --> 01:01:22,767
- Let's go, Parthi!
- Come in. We were waiting for you.

792
01:01:24,933 --> 01:01:27,475
- He can't tolerate noise.
- Let's go, Parthi.

793
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:32,308
We should stand outside his house
holding a gun for his safety, it seems.

794
01:01:32,433 --> 01:01:34,642
And he'll sit inside the house,
hugging his wife--

795
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:37,017
Hey! You're a police officer!
Mind your words!

796
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,183
What did you say!

797
01:01:38,267 --> 01:01:40,975
- Hey!
- Parthiban!

798
01:01:41,225 --> 01:01:43,183
- Let go!
- Parthiban, let him go!

799
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:46,225
Parthiban, don't!
He's a police officer, leave him.

800
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,142
Let go!

801
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:56,142
Parthiban! Listen.
Let go of him.

802
01:01:56,683 --> 01:01:58,183
Hold him back, guys.
Come on.

803
01:01:58,267 --> 01:02:00,267
Parthiban, you've already
been arrested once.

804
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,017
- This will become a huge issue.
- Parthiban, let go!

805
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,558
- Parthiban!
- Parthiban, don't!

806
01:02:04,642 --> 01:02:06,183
He's choking, Parthiban!

807
01:02:06,267 --> 01:02:07,600
Parthiban, he'll die!

808
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,850
Parthiban, let him go!

809
01:02:20,142 --> 01:02:23,267
Sir, are you alright?
Is your neck okay?

810
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:29,850
Parthiban.

811
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:33,284
Why did you do it, Parthiban?
I told you to let him go.

812
01:02:33,308 --> 01:02:36,433
They won't give you police protection
at your behest as you think, Parthiban.

813
01:02:36,517 --> 01:02:40,933
There's no proof of assault against you.
You haven't sustained any injuries.

814
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,725
Who said that I'm not injured?

815
01:03:09,058 --> 01:03:10,892
Parthiban, are you really sure?

816
01:03:10,975 --> 01:03:13,892
Joshy, I may go overboard
if I do it myself.

817
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,308
You do the needful.

818
01:03:20,892 --> 01:03:22,142
You asked for it!

819
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:39,142
- SP.
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>

820
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:41,017
- Can you come to my residence?
- <i>Okay, sir.</i>

821
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,933
- Now. Yes, it's urgent.
- <i>I'm coming, sir.</i>

822
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:44,558
Sir, one small request.

823
01:03:46,142 --> 01:03:49,100
Please give me a police officer
from Tamil Nadu.

824
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,267
Napoleon reporting to duty, sir!

825
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,475
Where is my position, sir!

826
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:09,225
Hush!

827
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:37,558
Who is this man?

828
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,475
Parthiban, you requested
for a high-ranking Tamil police officer.

829
01:05:40,558 --> 01:05:42,642
He is that high-ranking police officer.

830
01:05:42,725 --> 01:05:45,517
You must've heard
of a drug bust in Trichy.

831
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:49,933
I heard he was responsible
for finishing off 50-60 of those men.

832
01:06:42,892 --> 01:06:44,975
- Move these tables over there at once.
- Okay, sir.

833
01:06:45,058 --> 01:06:46,058
Go.

834
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,100
Hey!

835
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:52,517
Put your phone down.

836
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:55,183
Listen!

837
01:06:56,475 --> 01:06:57,600
What do you want?

838
01:06:58,058 --> 01:06:59,058
Wait!

839
01:06:59,142 --> 01:07:01,308
Are you a Tamilian?
Hey, don't run!

840
01:07:13,975 --> 01:07:15,308
Load the stuff fast!

841
01:07:18,517 --> 01:07:19,517
What is it?

842
01:07:20,808 --> 01:07:21,808
What?

843
01:07:44,183 --> 01:07:46,725
Are you transferring our own stuff
without our knowledge?

844
01:07:46,808 --> 01:07:47,808
Come here!

845
01:07:48,683 --> 01:07:50,350
- Come.
- Sir.

846
01:07:51,517 --> 01:07:52,892
Don't, sir!

847
01:07:57,808 --> 01:07:58,808
Sir!

848
01:07:59,017 --> 01:08:00,683
Move aside!

849
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:01,683
Boss!

850
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:04,433
Out of my way!
Move aside!

851
01:08:06,975 --> 01:08:08,225
Boss?

852
01:08:21,933 --> 01:08:25,558
You better pray to God
that it's important news.

853
01:08:25,808 --> 01:08:27,308
Or you'll die here.

854
01:08:27,558 --> 01:08:28,933

If he's really Parthiban,

Almost the same.

- I'll make it better.
- Yes.

917
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,642
There's a girl who has been
looking at you for a long time.

918
01:12:39,725 --> 01:12:41,517
Don't turn around immediately.

919
01:12:49,767 --> 01:12:51,558
Could she be from the press?

920
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,767
- She left.
- Similarly,

921
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,730
a man at the back
has been here for a long time.

922
01:13:07,767 --> 01:13:10,433
He isn't saying anything.
Go and have a word with him.

923
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:12,058
- Where? Behind?
- In the backyard.

924
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:14,183
- Okay. Go, I'll handle him.
- Okay.

925
01:13:26,433 --> 01:13:28,058
"Pleasure is mine."

926
01:13:38,183 --> 01:13:40,267
Hi, sir.
What would you like to eat?

927
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,142
Coffee.

928
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:52,100
- Sugar?
- You know very well

929
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,100
whether I take sugar or not.

930
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:02,350
How would I know
whether you prefer sugar or not?

931
01:14:02,517 --> 01:14:04,392
- With sugar.
- Okay.

932
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,100
I'm sorry, sir.

933
01:14:19,225 --> 01:14:22,600
- One sugar cube or two--
- You know that too.

934
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:27,600
Sir, I don't know that.
You've mistaken me for someone else.

935
01:14:27,683 --> 01:14:31,517
I was thrilled to hear you speak Tamil.
I'm just humoring you, that's all.

936
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,600
Your coffee, your sugar.

937
01:14:33,808 --> 01:14:34,808
Leo?

938
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,100
Leo!

939
01:14:41,017 --> 01:14:42,100
Parthiban.

940
01:14:42,517 --> 01:14:46,933
I don't know anyone named Leo, sir.
There's already a lot of confusion here.

941
01:14:47,017 --> 01:14:50,975
Please don't add to it.
Please drink your coffee and leave.

942
01:14:51,058 --> 01:14:52,225
Do you mind?

943
01:14:57,142 --> 01:14:59,183
Can you make it a little stronger?

944
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:03,267
Sure, sir.

945
01:15:06,017 --> 01:15:07,892
Do you know this brand, Leo?

946
01:15:07,975 --> 01:15:10,475
No, sir.
I don't have the habit of smoking.

947
01:15:10,558 --> 01:15:13,725
- I can't even stand the smell.
- D Slash.

948
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:17,642
You used to call it Honey Badger,
but it is Black Devil.

949
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:19,433
Twenty-five puffs.

950
01:15:19,892 --> 01:15:21,850
The flavor that you created.

951
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:26,808
You really like nocturnal animals, right?

952
01:15:26,933 --> 01:15:29,975
Once a Honey Badger
entered our tobacco field.

953
01:15:30,142 --> 01:15:31,350
Do you remember?

954
01:15:31,517 --> 01:15:33,517
It didn't get caught in your trap.

955
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:36,308
It didn't get killed
by Harold's spear either.

956
01:15:36,392 --> 01:15:39,933
In the end, it died
by the bullet that I fired.

957
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,392
I think you've forgotten it.

958
01:15:42,558 --> 01:15:45,683
Do you want anything
other than coffee or shall I get the bill?

959
01:15:45,767 --> 01:15:49,225
Have you convinced yourself
that your old identity doesn't exist, Leo?

960
01:15:49,308 --> 01:15:50,767
Wait, what?

961
01:15:54,725 --> 01:15:55,933
Listen.

962
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,933
I've many problems on my mind.
I've a splitting headache.

963
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:02,142
I'll tell you in a way
you'll understand, one last time.

964
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,767
You've mistaken me for someone else.

965
01:16:07,308 --> 01:16:09,892
I have very less patience, dear.

966
01:16:10,308 --> 01:16:12,850
So don't waste my time.

967
01:16:13,308 --> 01:16:14,642
Mount View Lodge.

968
01:16:14,725 --> 01:16:17,642
Come of your own accord
and admit that you're Leo.

969
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,933
Sir, alcohol is not allowed.

970
01:16:34,183 --> 01:16:35,933
No alcohol!

971
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:10,350
No alcohol.

972
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:33,017
A friend of my friend is in Kadapa.

973
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:37,100
I sent him a photo of the D Slash
cigarette box and got some details.

974
01:17:37,183 --> 01:17:40,725
Going by what he says,
the chap who came here

975
01:17:41,225 --> 01:17:42,558
is Antony Das.

976
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:47,933
Once upon a time in Andhra Pradesh,
he ran a huge tobacco company.

977
01:17:48,017 --> 01:17:50,558
- After a big fire accident--
- Hold on.

978
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:53,100
Why should I know
the life history of the guy

979
01:17:53,183 --> 01:17:57,433
who barged into my cafe
and blew cigarette smoke in my face?

980
01:17:57,517 --> 01:17:58,683
No, but this is important.

981
01:17:58,767 --> 01:18:01,183
- No, I--
- Let him complete.

982
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,683
Go on, Joshy.

983
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:06,600
Antony Das has a son named Leo.

984
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,350
Okay.

985
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,017
Leo Das.

986
01:18:10,142 --> 01:18:13,392
I couldn't find any details
other than his name.

987
01:18:13,475 --> 01:18:16,017
One group says that he did
something big and died.

988
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,725
Another group believes he is still alive.

989
01:18:19,933 --> 01:18:22,142
He can fool this town.

990
01:18:23,808 --> 01:18:25,892
He can fool the world.

991
01:18:27,267 --> 01:18:29,850
But he can never fool me.

992
01:18:30,017 --> 01:18:33,892
In some odd way,
you have a striking resemblance to him.

993
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:36,225
I saw his eyes.

994
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:39,017
I know his eyes.

995
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,600
It is him.

996
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:44,308
Parthiban, you grew up
in an orphanage, right?

997
01:18:44,392 --> 01:18:48,350
- Do you remember anything from before?
- What is this? This is bullshit!

998
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:49,808
We are the victims here.

999
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,392
Do you understand you are treating
the victim like an accused?

1000
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:54,100
- Let's leave, Parthi.
- Wait, dear.

1001
01:18:54,183 --> 01:18:55,517
Sathya, one moment.

1002
01:18:56,392 --> 01:18:57,558
Joshy.

1003
01:18:59,225 --> 01:19:02,100
I get that you are asking this
out of concern.

1004
01:19:02,475 --> 01:19:04,350
But since my childhood

1005
01:19:04,433 --> 01:19:07,517
until I was 20, I grew up
in Sathyamangalam Orphanage.

1006
01:19:08,183 --> 01:19:09,892
And I met her there--

1007
01:19:10,017 --> 01:19:11,642
What was that, dear?
That--

1008
01:19:12,183 --> 01:19:13,725
Munnar trekking.

1009
01:19:13,808 --> 01:19:15,142
There's where we met.

1010
01:19:16,183 --> 01:19:18,142
I saw her.
I got to know her.

1011
01:19:18,308 --> 01:19:20,642
Within two days,
I asked her if she'd marry me.

1012
01:19:20,725 --> 01:19:21,725
That's all.

1013
01:19:21,892 --> 01:19:25,392
After marrying her,
we settled here because of her job.

1014
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,558
This has been my town since then.
This is my story.

1015
01:19:29,642 --> 01:19:31,683
They have also come
from the south, Parthiban.

1016
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:35,350
If they've crossed so many miles
and come by road to our place

1017
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:38,017
in search of you, something is amiss.

1018
01:19:38,267 --> 01:19:40,808
Whatever came to a grinding halt
because of him

1019
01:19:40,892 --> 01:19:43,100
needs to be completed using him.

1020
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,642
I know how to bring him back
into our fold.

1021
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,933
My world is very small, Joshy.

1022
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:53,100
It's like a snow globe
that fits in the palm of my hand.

1023
01:19:53,183 --> 01:19:57,433
A small independent house,
surrounded by trees, snow, cool breeze.

1024
01:19:58,642 --> 01:20:00,350
Why is this happening to me?

1025
01:20:00,933 --> 01:20:02,933
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1026
01:20:03,142 --> 01:20:04,183
I'm sorry.

1027
01:20:05,975 --> 01:20:08,100
It's alright.
I understand.

1028
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:10,975
If they come back
to cause further trouble,

1029
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:12,808
we'll inform the police.

1030
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:15,517
Keep an eye on his family and friends.

1031
01:20:15,642 --> 01:20:16,892
I'll take care of it.

1032
01:20:25,183 --> 01:20:28,225
I feel like someone
is watching our home, Sathya.

1033
01:20:29,475 --> 01:20:31,808
I don't know, Sathya.
The eerie silence

1034
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:35,683
makes me restless.
I feel very disturbed.

1035
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,808
Look here.
Understand this.

1036
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:46,183
You should feel this way
only if I suspect you.

1037
01:20:47,683 --> 01:20:49,642
Have I ever questioned you?

1038
01:20:50,142 --> 01:20:53,600
Stop thinking about these things
and sleep peacefully, come.

1039
01:20:56,183 --> 01:20:57,558
Won't you come?

1040
01:21:00,017 --> 01:21:02,433
Okay, shall we stand like this and sleep?

1041
01:21:04,683 --> 01:21:07,267
Don't touch the engine,
just fix the heater.

1042
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:09,225
I want my vehicle.

1043
01:21:12,808 --> 01:21:14,808
Get it ready by evening, okay?

1044
01:21:42,225 --> 01:21:43,600
What do you want?

1045
01:21:45,975 --> 01:21:47,517
I saw you, right?

1046
01:21:48,267 --> 01:21:49,517
That's enough for me.

1047
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,475
I'm so mad at you, if I slap you now

1048
01:21:54,725 --> 01:21:56,350
your mouth will be injured badly

1049
01:21:56,433 --> 01:21:59,183
and it will seem like
a weird smile is plastered.

1050
01:21:59,267 --> 01:22:00,308
I'm sorry.

1051
01:22:00,475 --> 01:22:02,392
- Get out!
- I'll leave!

1052
01:22:04,808 --> 01:22:06,350
I'll leave.

1053
01:22:10,808 --> 01:22:13,308
- Tell me, dear.
- I bought the tablet you wanted, Parthi.

1054
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:14,808
<i>Do you want anything else?</i>

1055
01:22:14,892 --> 01:22:16,475
I've given the jeep for service.

1056
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:18,409
Didn't I tell you that we can go later
to the pharmacy?

1057
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:22,225
- <i>Why did you leave the kid alone at home?</i>
- I brought Mathi with me.

1058
01:22:22,308 --> 01:22:23,600
<i>Priya is also with me.</i>

1059
01:22:23,683 --> 01:22:25,743
Okay. We could've waited for a day.
What was the hurry?

1060
01:22:25,767 --> 01:22:27,433
Some things can't be delayed, right?

1061
01:22:27,517 --> 01:22:29,683
<i>It's not a problem.
I'll take an auto home.</i>

1062
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:31,409
- <i>You take care.</i>
- Okay. Go home and call me.

1063
01:22:31,433 --> 01:22:33,642
Let's go.
Come, dear.

1064
01:23:01,642 --> 01:23:02,642
No!

1065
01:23:59,308 --> 01:24:01,517
There's nothing to panic about.

1066
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:05,183
It is the same blood.

1067
01:24:06,017 --> 01:24:07,517
Do you know who she is?

1068
01:24:08,725 --> 01:24:10,183
My granddaughter.

1069
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,600
My blood.

1070
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:16,267
Yesterday you were the one who--

1071
01:24:16,808 --> 01:24:20,183
You better leave
or I may have to call the police.

1072
01:24:21,558 --> 01:24:22,683
Police?

1073
01:24:24,475 --> 01:24:26,558
I haven't come to trouble you, dear.

1074
01:24:26,642 --> 01:24:31,308
You've been living with a guy who you
believe is Parthiban for the past 20 years

1075
01:24:31,517 --> 01:24:34,433
when you realise he was a ruthless killer

1076
01:24:34,558 --> 01:24:39,475
who committed many murders,

1077
01:24:40,017 --> 01:24:41,392
come and meet me.

1078
01:24:42,392 --> 01:24:46,183
I'll show you the true colors
of your husband.

1079
01:24:53,517 --> 01:24:55,326
- Hello?
- Why didn't you answer the call, Parthi?

1080
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:56,910
- He was here.
- <i>What happened, Sathya?</i>

1081
01:24:56,975 --> 01:24:58,100
<i>Who?
Who was there?</i>

1082
01:24:58,183 --> 01:25:00,558
The same guy!
You said he visited the cafe yesterday!

1083
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,322
<i>He came to the medical shop
looking for me.</i>

1084
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,600
<i>Okay.
Where are you now?</i>

1085
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:04,767
I am at home.

1086
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,558
<i>They followed me in their car.
It is parked outside our home.</i>

1087
01:25:07,642 --> 01:25:10,267
<i>Sathya, close the doors.
Give the phone to the police officer.</i>

1088
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,350
He is missing.
No one is here.

1089
01:25:12,433 --> 01:25:13,683
<i>I'm scared, Parthi.</i>

1090
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:15,892
<i>Lock yourself in our bedroom safely.</i>

1091
01:25:15,975 --> 01:25:18,142
<i>Siddhu is coming.
I'm also on my way!</i>

1092
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:31,267
Answer the call!

1093
01:25:31,808 --> 01:25:34,892
- Dad, what is it?
- Siddharth! Go home immediately

1094
01:25:34,975 --> 01:25:36,868
- and pick your spear and go in.
- What are you saying, Dad?

1095
01:25:36,892 --> 01:25:40,267
If anyone tries to enter the house,
throw your spear without hesitation.

1096
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:41,600
Okay, Dad.

1097
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:07,433
Will our lives be like this now, Parthi?

1098
01:27:07,808 --> 01:27:09,648
We have to be on the run.
Then we have to hide.

1099
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:10,975
We should live in fear

1100
01:27:11,058 --> 01:27:14,350
wondering what might happen
to our kids. Right?

1101
01:27:15,142 --> 01:27:17,100
Tell me.
Who is he?

1102
01:27:17,225 --> 01:27:19,558
He claims that our daughter
is his granddaughter.

1103
01:27:19,642 --> 01:27:21,850
I feel terrified when I look at him.

1104
01:27:22,142 --> 01:27:25,350
We don't usually pay attention
to how our heart beats

1105
01:27:25,642 --> 01:27:28,933
but today, I could feel every beat
as I made my way home.

1106
01:27:29,642 --> 01:27:30,808
Chintu, come here.

1107
01:27:30,892 --> 01:27:33,475
Don't call her!
She's already terrified.

1108
01:27:48,975 --> 01:27:51,350
- Listen--
- I forced the police department,

1109
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,392
I fought with the law,

1110
01:27:53,475 --> 01:27:54,975
and went to great lengths

1111
01:27:55,058 --> 01:27:57,017
to bring you to my doorstep.

1112
01:27:57,308 --> 01:27:59,642
I asked you to protect my family.

1113
01:27:59,725 --> 01:28:02,975
Do you possess
any integrity or job ethics?

1114
01:28:05,433 --> 01:28:06,517
Don't say that.

1115
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,534
There's no use
talking about compassion or concern

1116
01:28:08,558 --> 01:28:10,725
to those who work for money.

1117
01:28:10,808 --> 01:28:12,517
Instead of doing your duty like this

1118
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,100
by just eating and sleeping uselessly,
pick up your belongings and go away!

1119
01:28:16,183 --> 01:28:18,392
- Don't say that, sir.
- What?

1120
01:28:18,475 --> 01:28:20,743
- Don't act on impulse.
- Under the pretext of making excuses

1121
01:28:20,767 --> 01:28:22,808
don't provoke me to swear at you.

1122
01:28:22,892 --> 01:28:24,392
- I went to recharge--
- Don't talk.

1123
01:28:24,475 --> 01:28:25,642
Don't talk!

1124
01:28:25,725 --> 01:28:27,267
- I went to recharge--
- Don't talk!

1125
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:29,600
I'm letting you go out of respect
for your age, or--

1126
01:28:29,683 --> 01:28:31,600
You've misunderstood me.

1127
01:28:31,683 --> 01:28:35,017
- Dear--
- Go. Just go.

1128
01:28:38,267 --> 01:28:39,267
I'm sorry, Dad.

1129
01:28:40,142 --> 01:28:43,142
- I didn't know that it was you--
- It's okay, Son.

1130
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:44,350
Good throw.

1131
01:28:44,683 --> 01:28:47,558
- You knew it was me and threw it, right?
- No, Dad.

1132
01:28:56,808 --> 01:28:59,308
<i>When you realize
that the man sharing your bed</i>

1133
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:02,725
<i>is a ruthless killer with no mercy,</i>

1134
01:29:03,433 --> 01:29:04,767
<i>come and meet me.</i>

1135
01:29:17,183 --> 01:29:18,183
Was it a dream?

1136
01:29:19,725 --> 01:29:21,475
It must have been a nightmare.

1137
01:29:35,725 --> 01:29:39,850
<i>I think some major conflict occurred
between the family members.</i>

1138
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:45,475
<i>It seems this is also a reason for
their tobacco industry to get destroyed.</i>

1139
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,683
<i>I have sent the certificates
and photos to you.</i>

1140
01:29:47,767 --> 01:29:50,475
I want to know if they are forged or not.
Okay? Okay, bye.

1141
01:29:50,558 --> 01:29:52,183
<i>It's a myth that stands still, Joshy.</i>

1142
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:55,642
<i>But I believe a man who knows
the full story is alive in Shimla prison.</i>

1143
01:29:55,725 --> 01:29:58,433
<i>His name is Hridayaraj D'Souza
in the records.</i>

1144
01:29:58,517 --> 01:30:01,267
<i>If the intel is right,
he must be very close to Leo Das.</i>

1145
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:04,350
<i>So if you want to see him,
you have only two days.</i>

1146
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:06,683
<i>Practically, I don't know
when you can reach.</i>

1147
01:30:06,767 --> 01:30:08,493
- <i>Can I try to connect him in a call?</i>
- No--

1148
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:10,808
I-I'm on my way,
make the arrangements, please.

1149
01:30:10,892 --> 01:30:12,058
I'll reach by tonight, okay?

1150
01:30:12,142 --> 01:30:13,017
- <i>Sure, Joshy.</i>
- Thank you.

1151
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,392
<i>Who is the villain here?</i>

1152
01:30:20,058 --> 01:30:22,392
It's late.
Your mom isn't back yet.

1153
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,642
Recently, she has been
returning late everyday.

1154
01:30:26,642 --> 01:30:28,600
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1155
01:30:29,642 --> 01:30:31,142
That's her.

1156
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:36,975
- Tell me.
- <i>Parthi, I'm not coming home tonight.</i>

1157
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:39,108
<i>Don't wait for me.
Have your dinner and sleep.</i>

1158
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:43,017
- Why? What happened?
- I've taken many days off, right?

1159
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,725
So there's a lot of pending work.

1160
01:30:44,808 --> 01:30:47,475
I thought I'll finish it
and come home in the morning.

1161
01:30:47,558 --> 01:30:49,493
I yelled at Siddhu this morning,
so he isn't answering my call.

1162
01:30:49,517 --> 01:30:51,267
<i>Is he back home?
Where is he?</i>

1163
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:53,683
Poor boy, I was quite harsh.
Check on him, Parthi.

1164
01:30:53,767 --> 01:30:56,167
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your kind attention, please?</i>

1165
01:30:56,225 --> 01:30:57,850
Okay, where are you now?

1166
01:30:59,225 --> 01:31:01,808
- At the head office.
- Is that so?

1167
01:31:06,558 --> 01:31:08,433
- Chintu.
- Yes?

1168
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,600
You don't suspect your dad, right?

1169
01:31:12,683 --> 01:31:14,558
- No.
- Why?

1170
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:16,642
Because you are my dearest dad.

1171
01:31:17,767 --> 01:31:19,558
Your dearest dad.

1172
01:31:28,767 --> 01:31:30,350
Hey! It's your dad.

1173
01:31:31,225 --> 01:31:32,892
Siddharth, get into the car!

1174
01:31:36,642 --> 01:31:39,392
- I'm calling you, get into--
- Let go of my hand!

1175
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,558
Sir, leave him alone
if he doesn't want to come.

1176
01:31:45,642 --> 01:31:46,683
Don't force him.

1177
01:31:47,225 --> 01:31:49,100
What?
Will you kill him too?

1178
01:31:56,725 --> 01:31:58,183
Okay, don't come.

1179
01:32:08,308 --> 01:32:10,225
<i>♪ Who is the villain here? ♪</i>

1183

1184
01:32:20,267 --> 01:32:21,850
Hey! Go with your dad.

1185
01:32:21,933 --> 01:32:24,100
<i>♪ Who is the villain here? ♪</i>

1186
01:32:28,642 --> 01:32:30,475
- Sir.
- Why are you sitting here

1187
01:32:30,558 --> 01:32:33,225
in the cold at this hour?
No intruder will barge in now.

1188
01:32:33,308 --> 01:32:36,058
I don't care anymore who shoots
and who dies, go to sleep.

1189
01:32:36,142 --> 01:32:37,642
It's okay.
It's okay, sir.

1190
01:32:37,725 --> 01:32:40,975
A courier was delivered in the noon
in your wife's name.

1191
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,392
Sir, one moment.
I wanted to tell you something.

1192
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,975
I understand all your worries and fears.

1193
01:32:48,225 --> 01:32:52,933
I see how well you take care
of the people who depend on you.

1194
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,659
You are anxious and upset
that something might happen to them.

1195
01:32:55,683 --> 01:32:57,350
I'll retire in 60 days.

1196
01:32:57,558 --> 01:33:01,933
If anyone troubles your family
in any way during this time,

1197
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,308
I'll take him down with me!

1198
01:33:04,392 --> 01:33:08,183
Even if there is any emergency
needing my attention back home

1199
01:33:08,267 --> 01:33:10,100
I won't leave this place.

1200
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:14,683
I swear this Napoleon doesn't work
just to eat like a glutton, sir.

1201
01:33:14,767 --> 01:33:18,475
I don't work just to fill my stomach.
Trust me, sir.

1202
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:28,642
Did you really lift such a big gun
at the commissioner's office

1203
01:33:28,725 --> 01:33:30,183
and shoot all of them?

1204
01:33:31,892 --> 01:33:34,692
All I did was read the manual
and instruct as to which button to press.

1205
01:33:34,725 --> 01:33:36,017
Dilli took care of the rest.

1206
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:38,642
Don't tell anyone.
This is my means of livelihood.

1207
01:33:38,725 --> 01:33:39,892
Okay.

1208
01:33:41,058 --> 01:33:43,142
- Chintu.
- Dad.

1209
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:53,600
Why don't you sit?

1210
01:33:53,808 --> 01:33:55,558
- How is he doing?
- He is fine.

1211
01:33:56,017 --> 01:33:58,683
It's been nearly three weeks
since he called me up.

1212
01:33:58,767 --> 01:33:59,975
All okay, right?

1213
01:34:01,183 --> 01:34:03,183
Why take the trouble
to visit me at this hour?

1214
01:34:03,267 --> 01:34:05,558
Had you told me, I'd have couriered it.

1215
01:34:05,767 --> 01:34:09,850
The government registration is pending
without proper certificates.

1216
01:34:10,058 --> 01:34:11,892
We came here on some other job.

1217
01:34:11,975 --> 01:34:13,725
- So we decided to collect it.
- Oh.

1218
01:34:13,808 --> 01:34:15,892
It's in the attic.
Let me get it.

1219
01:34:18,558 --> 01:34:20,642
Sir, this is Hridayaraj D'Souza.

1220
01:34:20,808 --> 01:34:22,451
Counting of heads
will take place in 20 minutes.

1221
01:34:22,475 --> 01:34:25,475
I'll wait over there.
Finish your conversation soon.

1222
01:34:29,558 --> 01:34:32,183
You asked for this brand, right?

1223
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:37,767
Hridayaraj D'Souza.

1224
01:34:38,392 --> 01:34:41,308
I'll come straight to the point
because of time constraint.

1225
01:34:41,392 --> 01:34:43,517
Das & Co Tobacco Factory.

1226
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,933
The duo associated with it,
Antony and Harold.

1227
01:34:47,017 --> 01:34:51,183
We have identity records on both of them,
but we have no details about Leo.

1228
01:34:51,267 --> 01:34:54,142
You are the only one who is alive

1229
01:34:54,683 --> 01:34:58,017
among Leo's associates
who were present during his death.

1230
01:34:58,183 --> 01:35:00,058
I have only one request for you.

1231
01:35:02,183 --> 01:35:04,850
If you can tell me
whether this is Leo or not,

1232
01:35:04,933 --> 01:35:06,475
four lives will be saved.

1233
01:35:09,642 --> 01:35:12,642
I understand.
I can see the fear of death in your eyes.

1234
01:35:12,725 --> 01:35:15,267
I heard you are due
for a death sentence in three days.

1235
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:18,933
If you can narrate what actually happened,
I can send a petition now

1236
01:35:19,017 --> 01:35:22,392
and appeal for a review
of your death sentence.

1237
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:27,767
If you could tell me
the actual sequence of events--

1238
01:35:35,142 --> 01:35:38,017
Hridayaraj, don't test my patience.

1239
01:35:46,142 --> 01:35:48,600
If you're here for a fair and just cause,

1240
01:35:49,017 --> 01:35:53,017
why this back door entry
and sitting near the toilet?

1241
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,850
I've said what I had to, in the court.

1242
01:35:56,142 --> 01:35:59,392
No one can stop my death sentence.

1243
01:35:59,475 --> 01:36:00,308
What else?

1244
01:36:00,392 --> 01:36:02,683
What happened at Das & Co Tobacco Factory?

1245
01:36:02,767 --> 01:36:05,558
Is Leo alive or dead?
Or how did Leo die?

1246
01:36:05,683 --> 01:36:08,600
I'm not saying this for you
or your damn bribe of a booze.

1247
01:36:08,683 --> 01:36:10,725
Anyway I'll die in three days.

1248
01:36:10,808 --> 01:36:14,725
After that, I can't talk about him.
That's why I'll tell you now.

1249
01:36:17,808 --> 01:36:21,225
In the year 1999, Das & Co
was the most flourishing tobacco factory

1250
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:23,850
in Andhra Pradesh.

1251
01:36:23,975 --> 01:36:27,058
The one who built
and ruled that empire was Antony.

1252
01:36:27,725 --> 01:36:29,058
Antony Das.

1253
01:36:31,475 --> 01:36:35,850
<i>Das & Co Tobacco Factory was just a front</i>

1254
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,600
<i>to conduct many illegal businesses.</i>

1255
01:36:39,683 --> 01:36:41,350
<i>He developed the business</i>

1256
01:36:41,433 --> 01:36:45,308
<i>to local, national
and international levels.</i>

1257
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,183
<i>Antony was never the kind to forget
or forgive those who opposed him.</i>

1258
01:36:50,267 --> 01:36:52,767
<i>He would kill them mercilessly.</i>

1259
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:56,558
<i>Gradually that became
a habit in their family.</i>

1260
01:36:59,808 --> 01:37:04,558
<i>Before starting any business,
he'd always sacrifice an animal.</i>

1261
01:37:04,725 --> 01:37:07,975
<i>He believed the growth of his empire</i>

1262
01:37:08,058 --> 01:37:10,183
<i>was only due to this sacrificial ritual.</i>

1263
01:37:10,267 --> 01:37:12,475
<i>It started with goats and cows</i>

1264
01:37:12,558 --> 01:37:16,475
<i>and he went to the extent
of performing human sacrifices too.</i>

1265
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,142
He was very superstitious.

1266
01:37:24,308 --> 01:37:27,100
Harold Das was his younger brother.

1267
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,100
<i>Harold was the only man
whom Antony trusted.</i>

1268
01:37:32,225 --> 01:37:33,225
<i>Harold.</i>

1269
01:37:34,017 --> 01:37:37,475
<i>Harold!</i>

1270
01:37:38,017 --> 01:37:39,975
<i>He went to Canada to study</i>

1271
01:37:40,058 --> 01:37:43,683
<i>but got acquainted with international
drug cartels over there</i>

1272
01:37:43,767 --> 01:37:46,350
<i>and he expanded their business
on foreign soil.</i>

1273
01:37:46,433 --> 01:37:50,058
<i>His dream was to make Das & Co
the number one drug cartel in the world.</i>

1274
01:37:50,142 --> 01:37:53,350
<i>So he created a drug called Datura.</i>

1275
01:37:54,392 --> 01:37:58,183
<i>It was a drug unseen,
unheard of and untried in the market.</i>

1276
01:37:58,308 --> 01:38:00,642
<i>They grew Datura
amidst their tobacco plants.</i>

1277
01:38:00,725 --> 01:38:04,392
<i>They began to manufacture it
within their factory.</i>

1278
01:38:04,475 --> 01:38:07,225
<i>Datura was more lethal than cocaine.</i>

1279
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:11,225
<i>Gradually its demand increased
in the market.</i>

1280
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:13,767
<i>At the same time, this news was leaked</i>

1281
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:16,683
<i>to the Narcotics Control Bureau
by some of his men.</i>

1282
01:38:16,767 --> 01:38:19,725
<i>He threw Datura on the faces
of those whom he suspected</i>

1283
01:38:19,808 --> 01:38:21,683
<i>without even questioning them</i>

1284
01:38:21,767 --> 01:38:26,475
<i>and killed in wild fury ruthlessly
and piled them in heaps remorselessly.</i>

1285
01:38:26,558 --> 01:38:31,058
Even if Antony and Harold took care
of managing the business at the top level

1286
01:38:32,267 --> 01:38:36,475
they still needed someone trustworthy
working at grass-root level, right?

1287
01:38:36,975 --> 01:38:38,975
Antony's son--

1288
01:38:39,767 --> 01:38:42,517
I raised him from the time
he was a toddler.

1289
01:38:43,683 --> 01:38:47,100
Das. Leo Das.

1290
01:38:49,475 --> 01:38:52,725
All this hassle is because one of your men
leaked the information to NCB.

1291
01:38:52,808 --> 01:38:55,308
Have you faced any issue
of this magnitude all these years?

1292
01:38:55,392 --> 01:38:57,933
Think about my position.
Can I dismiss your action as trivial?

1293
01:38:58,017 --> 01:39:00,284
<i>I can't show a wrong count
for namesake the way you think.</i>

1294
01:39:00,308 --> 01:39:02,142
If you want me
to release the seized Datura,

1295
01:39:02,225 --> 01:39:04,058
one among the three of you
needs to surrender.

1296
01:39:04,142 --> 01:39:07,058
That's why I want Leo to surrender.
Only if he is behind bars for a week

1297
01:39:07,142 --> 01:39:09,382
<i>I can remove the stash safely
by silencing my higher-ups.</i>

1298
01:39:09,433 --> 01:39:12,058
<i>If it gets out of hand,
I can't help you, remember that.</i>

1299
01:39:12,142 --> 01:39:15,058
How do we trust
that you'll release him in a week?

1300
01:39:15,142 --> 01:39:17,892
<i>If you want your stash,
you've to trust me, Das.</i>

1301
01:39:21,017 --> 01:39:23,183
- Antony?
- Is Leo there?

1302
01:39:23,267 --> 01:39:24,350
Leo isn't here.

1303
01:39:24,517 --> 01:39:26,975
<i>He said he'd cross the border
with the drugs.</i>

1304
01:39:27,058 --> 01:39:30,433
<i>He must be at the check-post.
I think he's outwitting them.</i>

1305
01:39:30,558 --> 01:39:32,850
Hey, who is smoking over there?

1306
01:39:32,975 --> 01:39:35,517
Give him two tight slaps
and bring him here!

1307
01:39:35,975 --> 01:39:37,058
Tell me, sir.

1308
01:39:37,558 --> 01:39:38,892
Yes, sir.
I'm at the spot.

Who is mediating?
Go ask Daniel.

What is your problem?

01:42:12,392 --> 01:42:15,017
What issue do you have to work with him?

He is my problem!

I can't work under this mongrel.

1347
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:29,600
If that's what you'll do,
I will hold back the drugs.

1348
01:42:29,683 --> 01:42:31,558
I'll show you I'm important too.

1349

What do you want me to do?

1350
01:42:35,183 --> 01:42:37,100
I don't want him butting in, that's all.

1351
01:42:37,183 --> 01:42:39,475
If he does, we can't dispose the drugs.

1352
01:42:51,225 --> 01:42:52,600
He asked for it.

1353
01:42:53,475 --> 01:42:54,558
Right?

1354
01:43:14,642 --> 01:43:18,142
I care two hoots for friendship
or whatever crap other than this stash.

1355

<i>by crossing two inter-state borders.</i>

1375

2,000 kilos of Datura.

1376

It was worth millions at that time.

He kept his word

1378
01:44:31,808 --> 01:44:34,558
He took matters in his own hands

Amidst all this, Antony's quest
for human sacrifices didn't stop.

1381
01:44:41,017 --> 01:44:44,558
For two years, he was searching
for a unique horoscope.

1382
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:46,659
He believed that if such a person
was found and sacrificed,

1383
01:44:46,683 --> 01:44:48,767
his tobacco factory

1384
01:44:48,850 --> 01:44:52,225

We were least bothered about this.

Only these two horoscopes
will suit our purpose

1406
01:46:39,225 --> 01:46:42,142
out of all the horoscopes
I searched for, till date.

1407
01:46:42,225 --> 01:46:44,100

I shouldn't have shown Elisa's
and Leo's horoscopes to you

1422
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:44,683
but I had no option.

1423
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:47,767
I'm not sure
if we can find a similar horoscope

1424
01:47:47,933 --> 01:47:50,433
with the same star and date of birth, Das.

1425
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:05,308
Hey! Is there no other way?

1426
01:48:05,642 --> 01:48:07,975
Can't you come up with any other option?

1427
01:48:23,142 --> 01:48:24,933
I feel really sad to say this.

1428
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:27,975
If you ask for my opinion,

1429
01:48:29,642 --> 01:48:31,058
I'll choose Leo.

1430
01:48:33,517 --> 01:48:34,517
No.

1431
01:48:35,808 --> 01:48:38,142

1454
01:50:53,267 --> 01:50:55,308
I had to do this, Leo.

1455
01:50:56,558 --> 01:50:58,767
Even now, between you and your sister

1456
01:50:59,183 --> 01:51:02,767
many chose you,
they opted to sacrifice you.

1457
01:51:02,850 --> 01:51:04,725
My brother also chose you.

1458
01:51:05,808 --> 01:51:08,850
I was the one who saved you!

1459
01:51:10,267 --> 01:51:12,225
You need not thank me for that.

1460
01:51:14,558 --> 01:51:16,017
Just pardon me.

1461
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,767
From my childhood till date,

1462
01:51:19,850 --> 01:51:22,933
I've killed countless people
for your sake.

1463
01:51:24,017 --> 01:51:27,433
I took your word as gospel
and killed my friend too.

1464
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:31,142
That was for our business.

1465
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:35,975
But this is mere superstition!

1466
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:38,183
Let go of Elisa!

1467
01:51:38,392 --> 01:51:40,142
Leo!

1468
01:51:40,308 --> 01:51:42,600
This is also for our business.

1469
01:51:43,892 --> 01:51:46,517
- Understand that!
- Hey!

1470
01:51:49,725 --> 01:51:51,767
She isn't just my sister.

1471
01:51:53,267 --> 01:51:56,808
She is my twin.
A part of me, my other half!

1472
01:51:57,308 --> 01:51:59,642
If anything untoward happens to her,

1473
01:51:59,808 --> 01:52:01,975
no matter how many births you take

1474
01:52:02,683 --> 01:52:07,017
the day I see you will be your last day!

1475
01:52:07,475 --> 01:52:09,308
The day I meet you

1476
01:52:09,392 --> 01:52:12,683
will be your last day on Earth!

1477
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,100
Are you begging him?

1478
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,725
Didn't I tell you the day
our mother passed away?

1479
01:52:19,808 --> 01:52:22,683
That he has something
to do with her death.

1480
01:52:22,767 --> 01:52:25,683
If he has decided
to sacrifice his children,

1481
01:52:26,308 --> 01:52:27,767
I don't consider him my dad anymore,

1482
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:30,100
none of them here are my kith and kin!

1483
01:52:31,183 --> 01:52:32,892
Will you do me a favor, Leo?

1484
01:52:34,558 --> 01:52:37,558
Don't spare any of them alive.

1485
01:52:52,392 --> 01:52:53,642
Hey!

1486
01:52:54,558 --> 01:52:56,183
Don't even think about it.

1487
01:52:59,350 --> 01:53:00,725
Hey!

1488
01:53:01,892 --> 01:53:03,142
Hey!

1489
01:53:03,267 --> 01:53:04,933
Don't you dare!

1490
01:53:05,183 --> 01:53:06,642
Let her go!

1491
01:53:06,725 --> 01:53:08,350
Dad!

1492
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,350
Dad!

1493
01:53:11,517 --> 01:53:12,850
Hey!

1494
01:53:12,933 --> 01:53:15,475
Release her!
Let her go!

1495
01:53:33,725 --> 01:53:35,892
Elisa, try to understand!

1496
01:53:36,642 --> 01:53:37,892
Understand my plight!

1497
01:53:41,767 --> 01:53:43,767
Leo!

1498
01:53:47,892 --> 01:53:49,392
Hey!

1499
01:53:52,308 --> 01:53:54,308
Leo, burn down the entire factory.

1500
01:53:54,392 --> 01:53:56,142
Harold, don't let them escape.

1501
01:53:57,892 --> 01:54:01,725
Harold!
Don't let them escape!

1502
01:54:11,642 --> 01:54:12,725
Leo!

1503
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:25,142
- Come on.
- Come!

1504
01:54:31,017 --> 01:54:33,308
- Come on.
- Catch--

1505
01:54:37,683 --> 01:54:39,808
Hey! Don't spare anyone.

1506
01:55:03,642 --> 01:55:06,558
Don't leave anything out!
Burn everything down!

1507
01:55:06,642 --> 01:55:07,808
Everything!

1508
01:55:45,017 --> 01:55:46,433
Hey!

1509
01:55:46,683 --> 01:55:47,725
Hey!

1510
01:55:48,767 --> 01:55:52,058
You wanted to sacrifice
your children for this, right?

1511
01:55:53,433 --> 01:55:54,475
Hey, Leo!

1512
01:55:54,558 --> 01:55:56,058
This shouldn't exist anymore!

1513
01:55:56,142 --> 01:55:57,558
Hereafter this--

1514
01:55:58,017 --> 01:55:59,225
Hey!

1515
01:55:59,350 --> 01:56:00,808
--shouldn't exist!

1516
01:56:00,892 --> 01:56:02,600
Leo, stop it!

1517
01:56:05,975 --> 01:56:07,892
Hey! Throw me a knife.

1518
01:56:13,558 --> 01:56:17,017
Elisa!

1519
01:56:25,933 --> 01:56:28,892
Elisa--

1520
01:56:30,017 --> 01:56:32,558
- Elisa--
- Leo.

1521
01:56:34,475 --> 01:56:36,433
Don't be with them, Leo.

1522
01:56:36,517 --> 01:56:37,600
Elisa!

1523
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:39,767
Go somewhere far away.

1524
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,392
My dearest Elisa!

1525
01:57:40,017 --> 01:57:42,350
Elisa!

1526
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:47,058
Elisa!

1527
01:58:13,267 --> 01:58:14,767
I raised him.

1528
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:18,517
The day he collapsed and burned
to his death in front of my eyes

1529
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:21,017
is embedded in my heart.

1530
01:58:25,767 --> 01:58:28,517
Tell me if it's Leo in this photo.

1531
01:58:30,183 --> 01:58:31,058
No need.

1532
01:58:31,142 --> 01:58:34,475
If you just identify him,
all the problems will be solved.

1533
01:58:38,683 --> 01:58:40,975
Even if he stands amidst 1,000 people,

1534
01:58:41,058 --> 01:58:43,517
I can identify Leo from his eyes.

1535
01:58:43,933 --> 01:58:45,100
This isn't him.

1536
01:58:45,308 --> 01:58:48,142
Don't play unnecessarily
with an innocent man's life.

1537
01:58:48,225 --> 01:58:50,808
Warden!
Take me away.

1538
01:58:50,933 --> 01:58:53,433
He is shell-shocked
upon hearing one day's happenings.

1539
01:58:53,517 --> 01:58:56,933
If he hears the entire story,
he's likely to lose his life!

1540
01:59:02,225 --> 01:59:03,225
Give it.

1541
01:59:04,767 --> 01:59:09,017
We clicked this during third grade.
This is in fourth grade.

1542
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:10,975
And this is in fifth grade.

1543
01:59:11,642 --> 01:59:14,267
This is the letter he wrote to me
during his college days.

1544
01:59:20,683 --> 01:59:22,267
May I ask you something?

1545
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:24,683
I consider you my brother
and I'm asking you this.

1546
01:59:24,767 --> 01:59:28,975
I know what's on your mind.
I won't tell him about your visit.

1547
01:59:29,058 --> 01:59:30,808
Make sure that he doesn't find out.

1548
01:59:30,892 --> 01:59:33,058
If he finds out, he'll be devastated.

1549
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,808
- Hello?
- <i>Sir, is this Parthiban?</i>

1550
01:59:39,975 --> 01:59:42,267
- Yes.
- <i>Sir, come to the coffee shop at once.</i>

1551
01:59:42,350 --> 01:59:43,392
<i>It's an emergency.</i>

1552
01:59:45,517 --> 01:59:48,517
He was drinking with us, sir.

1553
01:59:48,725 --> 01:59:51,433
I don't know why he kept saying
that he saw his friend.

1554
01:59:51,517 --> 01:59:53,183
He was happily drinking.

1555
01:59:53,267 --> 01:59:55,225
He even bought booze
for all the passers-by, sir.

1556
01:59:55,308 --> 01:59:57,767
Then he left in an inebriated state.

1557
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:00,118
He stood on the road and spoke to someone
over the phone for a long time.

1558
02:00:00,142 --> 02:00:02,350
Then some people arrived in a car
and took him away.

1559
02:00:02,517 --> 02:00:04,350
- Was it a black car?
- Yes, sir.

1560
02:00:11,808 --> 02:00:12,850
Hey!

1561
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:18,267
He claimed to be your friend
and came to your cafe.

1562
02:00:18,350 --> 02:00:21,475
He sat there and chatted with you.
He has even taken your photo.

1563
02:00:21,558 --> 02:00:24,558
How do you know him?
Can't you hear me?

1564
02:00:27,433 --> 02:00:31,558
Sir! If he was a regular customer at my cafe,

1565
02:00:31,642 --> 02:00:34,392
I should've at least been
slightly upset, right?

1566
02:00:35,642 --> 02:00:37,767
Look into my eyes.
Are there tears?

1567
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,892
I don't know him, sir.

1568
02:00:41,267 --> 02:00:44,683
How can I be responsible
for him dying in front of my cafe?

1569
02:00:44,767 --> 02:00:48,767
I'll come to the station when you call me.
You can interrogate me there.

1570
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:52,183
I've left my little girl alone at home.
I'm scared for her. I need to go.

1571
02:00:52,267 --> 02:00:54,517
- Okay, go.
- Thank you, sir.

1572
02:01:23,683 --> 02:01:27,350
I don't know whether to feel sorry
or be suspicious of Parthiban.

1573
02:01:27,433 --> 02:01:28,600
Listen.

1574
02:01:28,725 --> 02:01:33,100
Every human being
has a limit to lie and pretend.

1575
02:01:33,392 --> 02:01:35,142
He can do it only up to a breaking point.

1576
02:01:35,225 --> 02:01:39,433
He can't continue to put on an act
beyond that point.

1577
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,642
Because no one is mentally strong
to that extent.

1578
02:01:42,725 --> 02:01:45,892
I feel Parthiban isn't acting.

1579
02:01:45,975 --> 02:01:47,558
He is Parthiban indeed.

1580
02:01:48,392 --> 02:01:50,558
Beyond this, if truth has to be told,

1581
02:01:51,058 --> 02:01:54,517
Leo, who is allegedly dead
has to come in person and say it.

1582
02:01:55,975 --> 02:01:57,225
Parthi, are you back?

1583
02:01:57,308 --> 02:01:59,558
I heard you left in a hurry
because you got a call.

1584
02:01:59,642 --> 02:02:00,683
Where did you go?

1585
02:02:00,767 --> 02:02:02,868
Do you know how hectic the past two days
have been at work for me?

1586
02:02:02,892 --> 02:02:05,100
Why is your dinner untouched?

1587
02:02:05,392 --> 02:02:09,433
Parthi, what happened?
Why are you sitting here quietly?

1588
02:02:25,308 --> 02:02:29,350
Beyond this,
I have nothing left to lose, dear.

1589
02:02:30,683 --> 02:02:34,267
I'm a loser.

1590
02:02:37,517 --> 02:02:40,433
From my fingerprints
to the black pupils of my eyes,

1591
02:02:40,517 --> 02:02:42,225
you are suspecting every part of me.

1592
02:02:42,308 --> 02:02:44,350
- It's not like that, please--
- Don't touch me!

1593
02:02:44,433 --> 02:02:46,017
Don't touch me.

1594
02:02:49,475 --> 02:02:52,475
This whole world can suspect me.

1595
02:02:52,558 --> 02:02:56,725
But how could you doubt me?
How did you see me as a stranger?

1596
02:02:56,808 --> 02:02:57,933
Sathya?

1597
02:03:03,933 --> 02:03:07,850
Oh, no! No matter what
explanation you give to appease me,

1598
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:12,100
the fact that you suspected me

1599
02:03:12,183 --> 02:03:14,725
will haunt me forever.

1600
02:03:15,225 --> 02:03:16,558
Is our bond so fragile?

1601
02:03:16,642 --> 02:03:19,808
The life that we led so far
has lost its meaning.

1602
02:03:19,892 --> 02:03:20,933
That's it, right?

1603
02:03:25,475 --> 02:03:27,600
I am not him!

1604
02:03:27,933 --> 02:03:30,267
Parthiban isn't that kind of a person.

1605
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:33,142
Despite repeating myself
over and over again,

1606
02:03:33,517 --> 02:03:36,433
just because some
random chap resembles me--

1607
02:03:39,683 --> 02:03:41,159
- What happened, Dad?
- It's nothing, sweetie.

1608
02:03:41,183 --> 02:03:44,433
I wasn't feeling well.
Go to sleep.

1609
02:03:44,642 --> 02:03:47,600
<i>♪ Dance for me. Oh-- ♪</i>

1610
02:03:47,683 --> 02:03:51,308
<i>♪ I've never seen anybody do the things
you do before ♪</i>

1611
02:03:51,392 --> 02:03:54,475
<i>♪ They say, move for me ♪</i>

1612
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:59,433
<i>♪ And when you're done,
I'll make you do it all again ♪</i>

1613
02:04:01,183 --> 02:04:03,350
Hey, you.

1614
02:04:04,558 --> 02:04:06,392
Some random fellow--

1615
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:11,267
If they torture me claiming
I resemble some random riff-raff,

1616
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:13,100
what can I do?

1617
02:04:13,433 --> 02:04:16,308
You've forsaken your trust in me.

1618
02:04:16,392 --> 02:04:18,558
My son asked me if I'm his dad.

1619
02:04:18,642 --> 02:04:22,142
You ask me if I'm your husband!
Who am I? Tell me.

1620
02:04:25,517 --> 02:04:26,683
That's correct.

1621
02:04:27,225 --> 02:04:30,767
I don't know who my parents are
or what my place of birth is.

1622
02:04:30,892 --> 02:04:32,308
I'm an orphan.

1623
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:35,933
Maybe if they were alive,
they wouldn't have suspected me.

1624
02:04:36,017 --> 02:04:37,142
I'm an orphan, after all.

1625
02:04:37,225 --> 02:04:38,683
- Don't say that.
- Just an orphan.

1626
02:04:38,767 --> 02:04:42,017
Parthi, you're not an orphan.
Look at me.

1627
02:04:42,267 --> 02:04:44,433
I'm telling you to look into my eyes.

1628
02:04:44,850 --> 02:04:47,767
I didn't do this
due to lack of trust in you.

1629
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:51,808
When other people ask me,
I need to tell them with certainty, right?

1630
02:04:52,225 --> 02:04:53,725
"He is not that man."

1631
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:56,743
I should be able to confidently assert
this is my husband, Parthiban, right?

1632
02:04:56,767 --> 02:04:58,850
Why can't you understand?

1633
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:01,725
My dear.

1634
02:05:02,558 --> 02:05:05,558
I need to ask just one question.

1635
02:05:06,308 --> 02:05:09,767
After you suspected
that I was someone else,

1636
02:05:10,475 --> 02:05:13,225
how could you touch me with familiarity?

1637
02:05:13,850 --> 02:05:15,350
Wouldn't you feel disgusted?

1638
02:05:15,433 --> 02:05:17,183
The way actress Revathi
says in <i>Mouna Ragam</i>,

1639
02:05:17,267 --> 02:05:20,183
"I feel a hairy caterpillar
is crawling all over--"

1640
02:05:27,308 --> 02:05:28,725
Trust me.

1641
02:05:30,558 --> 02:05:31,850
Sathya.

1642
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:36,683
Please trust me.

1643
02:05:37,808 --> 02:05:40,808
I'm your Parthi, dear.

1644
02:05:53,558 --> 02:05:56,558
<i>Leo, the time I gave you is over.</i>

1645
02:05:56,725 --> 02:05:59,683
<i>You didn't come.
So I am here to see you.</i>

1646
02:05:59,767 --> 02:06:00,850
<i>Look outside.</i>

1647
02:06:05,308 --> 02:06:07,308
Hey! Who the hell are you all?

1648
02:06:07,683 --> 02:06:09,183
What are you doing here?

1649
02:06:09,392 --> 02:06:10,975
You better leave!

1650
02:06:11,058 --> 02:06:12,725
I'll shoot you all down!

1651
02:06:12,808 --> 02:06:14,808
You won't leave this place alive!

1652
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:20,392
<i>This need not have gone so far.</i>

1653
02:06:20,517 --> 02:06:24,642
If you had come of your own accord
and admitted to me that you are Leo

1654
02:06:25,308 --> 02:06:27,892
I wouldn't have come here now.

1655
02:06:28,058 --> 02:06:30,392
Sir! Don't come downstairs
for any reason whatsoever.

1656
02:06:30,475 --> 02:06:31,767
I'll deal with them!

1657
02:06:32,183 --> 02:06:34,183
I came to meet you

1658
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:37,433
but a mongrel is barking over here!

1659
02:06:39,475 --> 02:06:40,475
Okay.

1660
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:44,350
Amidst all this, give some thought
to where your son is.

1661
02:06:45,683 --> 02:06:46,892
Sathya?

1662
02:06:46,975 --> 02:06:48,058
Where is Siddharth?

1663
02:06:48,142 --> 02:06:49,933
- What happened?
- Where is Siddhu?

1664
02:06:50,017 --> 02:06:51,951
- Check on Siddhu.
- <i>You won't be able to find him.</i>

1665
02:06:51,975 --> 02:06:54,767
- <i>He would've reached his destination.</i>
- He isn't here!

1666
02:06:54,850 --> 02:06:55,892
Siddharth!

1667
02:06:56,433 --> 02:06:58,558
Bring our daughter.

1668
02:06:58,850 --> 02:07:02,100
But your son is so damn cute.

1669
02:07:02,308 --> 02:07:05,642
<i>He came out to smoke, got trapped
and made it easy for us.</i>

1670
02:07:06,058 --> 02:07:07,558
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1671
02:07:07,975 --> 02:07:10,850
Parthiban, what is happening here?
Where is Siddhu?

1672
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:13,267
Whom are you talking to?

1673
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:15,767
If anyone except me enters the house,
you must stab them.

1674
02:07:15,850 --> 02:07:16,767
Why?

1675
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:19,183
You will do it.
Hold it! Come on!

1676
02:07:20,933 --> 02:07:22,725
Go in.

1677
02:07:22,808 --> 02:07:24,808
Lock the door from inside, Sathya.

1678
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:27,308
<i>You don't have to be Leo.</i>

1679
02:07:27,392 --> 02:07:30,183
But think about it.

1680
02:07:30,267 --> 02:07:32,183
<i>Why should I kidnap your son?</i>

1681
02:07:32,725 --> 02:07:36,683
Twenty-two years ago, your sister died

1682
02:07:37,725 --> 02:07:39,475
on this very day.

1683
02:07:39,725 --> 02:07:42,350
<i>I'm taking your son today</i>

1684
02:07:42,808 --> 02:07:45,183
and you know the reason behind it.

1685
02:07:45,975 --> 02:07:49,850
Don't you understand?
I don't have a sister or any damn sibling.

1686
02:07:50,142 --> 02:07:52,183
Let go of my son, rascal!

1687
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:58,392
- Sir?
- You'll come on your own, Leo!

1688
02:07:59,767 --> 02:08:02,558
- What is it?
- Sir, open the door!

1689
02:08:13,017 --> 02:08:16,642
- Sir, they have kidnapped Siddhu.
- I didn't know they took him.

1690
02:08:18,183 --> 02:08:19,642
Hey!

1691
02:08:40,267 --> 02:08:41,683
Load your gun, sir.

1692
02:09:18,058 --> 02:09:19,225
Sir, hold tight!

1693
02:09:21,558 --> 02:09:23,350
Watch out!

1694
02:11:01,767 --> 02:11:03,850
Where is my son!

1695
02:11:03,933 --> 02:11:06,142
Answer me!
Where is my son!

1696
02:11:23,225 --> 02:11:24,850
Hey!

1697
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:32,850
Siddhu?

1698
02:11:33,142 --> 02:11:34,183
Siddhu?

1699
02:11:35,892 --> 02:11:37,058
Siddhu!

1700
02:12:14,517 --> 02:12:16,350
My son!

1701
02:12:26,642 --> 02:12:28,558
I failed to kill you, Leo.

1702
02:12:29,475 --> 02:12:32,142
But I won't fail to kill your son!

1703
02:12:45,058 --> 02:12:47,350
I'm not the man you're looking for!

1704
02:12:47,433 --> 02:12:50,392
You're presuming I'm your son
and ruining my life!

1705
02:12:53,392 --> 02:12:55,725
Where is my son?
Come on, tell me.

1706
02:12:55,892 --> 02:12:58,975
Speak up! Where is my son?
Tell me!

1707
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:03,225
Accept that you're my son.

1708
02:13:05,392 --> 02:13:07,683
And I'll let your son go.

1709
02:13:07,767 --> 02:13:11,975
Oh, God!
I'm not your son! No.

1710
02:13:12,058 --> 02:13:13,642
I'm not your son!

1711
02:13:58,017 --> 02:13:59,225
Tell me.

1712
02:14:00,433 --> 02:14:01,975
You're my son, right?

1713
02:14:08,475 --> 02:14:12,850
Harold, Antony is no more.

1714
02:14:14,100 --> 02:14:15,975
I'm bringing the boy.

1715
02:14:18,058 --> 02:14:21,308
Napoleon needs bed-rest.
I'm there, I'll take care of him.

1716
02:14:21,392 --> 02:14:24,892
But they won't stop at this.
They will come looking for you.

1717
02:14:25,017 --> 02:14:26,808
Your son will be safe for now.

1718
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:29,392
We will send a task force and find him.

1719
02:14:30,142 --> 02:14:32,183
But you shouldn't stay here.

1720
02:14:32,267 --> 02:14:34,892
If you stay here,
your life will be in grave danger.

1721
02:14:34,975 --> 02:14:36,267
Please listen to me.

1722
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:39,850
I've arranged a car.
It's parked at your doorstep.

1723
02:14:39,933 --> 02:14:42,975
Collect your essentials and leave.
Now!

1724
02:14:47,433 --> 02:14:48,475
Who is this?

1725
02:14:55,225 --> 02:14:58,142
Leo, no matter where you go and hide

1726
02:14:58,350 --> 02:15:00,767
you know very well
that I'll come and get you.

1727
02:15:00,850 --> 02:15:02,350
<i>All I want is your life.</i>

1728
02:15:02,433 --> 02:15:04,683
Don't step on my ego and lose your family.

1729
02:15:04,767 --> 02:15:06,683
If you want your son back

1730
02:15:07,683 --> 02:15:09,683
hand over my elder brother to me.

1731
02:15:10,267 --> 02:15:13,392
Bring him here and take your son.

1732
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:28,100
Parthiban, take it.
Go soon and bring back your son.

1733
02:15:50,683 --> 02:15:52,850
Das, I've sent boss' body.

1734
02:15:52,975 --> 02:15:56,517
We have boarded him on the train.
We will reach in an hour.

1735
02:16:54,225 --> 02:16:58,017
Sir, as per your request,
I've given your brother's body.

1736
02:16:58,475 --> 02:17:01,350
Please give my son back, I'll leave.

1737
02:17:03,975 --> 02:17:07,308
I know, you won't believe me
no matter what I say.

1738
02:17:07,725 --> 02:17:09,933
- That's why I--
- Hey!

1739
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:16,100
Don't be scared.
This is just my son's school bag.

1740
02:17:16,433 --> 02:17:17,618
Sir, this is my birth certificate

1741
02:17:17,642 --> 02:17:19,159
and these are my 10th
and 12th mark sheets.

1742
02:17:19,183 --> 02:17:20,993
This is my ration card, Aadhar card
and wedding photos.

1743
02:17:21,017 --> 02:17:22,659
This was clicked during
my daughter's ear piercing ceremony.

1744
02:17:22,683 --> 02:17:24,493
This was clicked on my son's
first birthday, sir.

1745
02:17:24,517 --> 02:17:25,350
Look at this, sir.

1746
02:17:25,433 --> 02:17:27,618
When I was in 10th grade,
I took part in an oratorical contest

1747
02:17:27,642 --> 02:17:29,076
and bagged the first prize with my speech
on <i>Kappalottiya Thamizhan</i>.

1748
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:30,517
This was taken there.

1749
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:33,433
My name is in bold letters
in the certificate.

1750
02:17:40,892 --> 02:17:44,808
Look here. This is you and your sister
on your 10th birthday.

1751
02:17:44,892 --> 02:17:47,975
A Honey Badger
had entered our tobacco field.

1752
02:17:48,058 --> 02:17:49,933
This photo was taken after it was killed.

1753
02:17:50,017 --> 02:17:52,392
Look how smart you look
with that blood-stained face.

1754
02:17:52,475 --> 02:17:53,517
I understand, sir.

1755
02:17:54,683 --> 02:17:58,225
It's not wrong
that you mistook me for Leo, sir.

1756
02:17:58,308 --> 02:18:00,558
He bears a striking resemblance to me.

1757
02:18:03,350 --> 02:18:05,975
Hey! Do I look like a fool?

1758
02:18:07,642 --> 02:18:10,850
- Sir--
- Do I seem like an imbecile?

1759
02:18:12,725 --> 02:18:14,225
Leo.

1760
02:18:14,433 --> 02:18:17,767
You know what I did to your twin sister.

1761
02:18:17,933 --> 02:18:19,975
I think you haven't forgotten that.

1762
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:23,017
You better accept that you are Leo.

1763
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:25,808
Or your son will share
the same fate as your twin.

1764
02:18:25,892 --> 02:18:29,558
Sir, I don't have a sister.
How do I make you understand?

1765
02:18:29,642 --> 02:18:30,808
Siddhu?

1766
02:18:39,225 --> 02:18:40,558
Sir.

1767
02:18:43,308 --> 02:18:45,975
In all these years,
he is scrutinizing someone

1768
02:18:46,225 --> 02:18:48,058
for the first time.

1769
02:18:48,225 --> 02:18:52,100
Human beings can lie.
Certificates can be fake.

1770
02:18:52,725 --> 02:18:55,142
But birds and beasts never lie.

1771
02:18:55,225 --> 02:18:59,100
I've never seen an eagle
at such close quarters in my life, sir.

1772
02:18:59,517 --> 02:19:01,725
Ask it to step back.
I'm scared, sir.

1773
02:19:08,892 --> 02:19:09,767
Hey.

1774
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:13,058
This performance
is just to protect your family, right?

1775
02:19:13,142 --> 02:19:15,308
You committed a blunder even there.

1776
02:19:15,725 --> 02:19:17,975
You came here to save your son

1777
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:20,183
but left your wife and your daughter

1778
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:22,600
all alone at home, my dear boy.

1779
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:24,642
Shall I ask my men

1780
02:19:24,933 --> 02:19:29,558
to slit their throats?

1781
02:19:30,433 --> 02:19:31,433
Hey!

1782
02:19:32,475 --> 02:19:33,933
Okay, sir.

1783
02:19:43,808 --> 02:19:45,642
Sir, don't harm them.

1784
02:19:45,725 --> 02:19:47,183
Sir, please.

1785
02:19:58,767 --> 02:20:00,683
Hey!

1786
02:20:00,767 --> 02:20:04,142
Instruct your guys not to harm them, sir.
Poor souls, sir.

1787
02:20:12,475 --> 02:20:15,142
- Shut up!
- Hush!

1788
02:20:18,475 --> 02:20:20,183
Let's run for our lives!

1789
02:20:24,308 --> 02:20:26,725
What's this?
They have planted bombs here!

1790
02:20:27,767 --> 02:20:30,267
- What is it, Mom?
- Nothing, dear, go back to sleep.

1791
02:20:30,350 --> 02:20:33,017
Sir, tell them not to go in.

1792
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:34,159
- Hey, what happened--
- Sir.

1793
02:20:34,183 --> 02:20:36,433
- Will you walk in the front?
- Shut up!

1794
02:20:39,267 --> 02:20:41,350
No, don't!

1795
02:20:42,683 --> 02:20:44,725
Hey! He's gone.

1796
02:20:48,142 --> 02:20:50,850
My eyes are burning!

1797
02:20:50,933 --> 02:20:52,767
It's burning!

1798
02:20:52,892 --> 02:20:53,975
Come with me.

1799
02:20:56,308 --> 02:20:58,100
Hey! You climb up.

1800
02:20:58,225 --> 02:21:00,392
What?
Can you open it or not?

1801
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:01,683
Hey!

1802
02:21:01,892 --> 02:21:03,058
- Sir--
- Hey!

1803
02:21:03,142 --> 02:21:05,350
Sir, at least you tell him, please.

1804
02:21:05,433 --> 02:21:07,273
Tell them not to do anything, sir.
Please, sir.

1805
02:21:07,308 --> 02:21:10,142
Instruct them not to enter
my house, please, sir.

1806
02:21:18,767 --> 02:21:21,308
You're leaving me alone to face this!

1807
02:21:31,350 --> 02:21:33,683
- You climb up.
- Let's come back in the morning.

1808
02:21:33,767 --> 02:21:34,975
Hey! Just climb!

1809
02:21:46,225 --> 02:21:47,475
My side is all clear.

1810
02:21:47,558 --> 02:21:50,308
Check those who are entering
through the main door.

1811
02:21:50,392 --> 02:21:53,142
Watch it, there could be more booby traps.

1812
02:22:10,892 --> 02:22:13,142
Who is this?
Looks like Chhota Bheem.

1813
02:22:20,642 --> 02:22:22,767
Hey! Stupid guy, come!

1814
02:22:23,892 --> 02:22:24,975
Hey!

1815
02:23:07,183 --> 02:23:08,183
Sir.

1816
02:23:08,392 --> 02:23:11,933
I killed all those who barged in
except for one guy.

1817
02:23:12,017 --> 02:23:14,118
He climbed in from the side
and entered upstairs, sir.

1818
02:23:14,142 --> 02:23:15,725
<i>He will go to hell soon.</i>

1819
02:23:15,808 --> 02:23:17,058
<i>You be safe.</i>

1820
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:25,225
Hey!

1821
02:23:29,933 --> 02:23:31,058
Hey!

1822
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:34,892
Are you playing the fool with me?
I'll chop you into pieces!

1823
02:23:37,433 --> 02:23:39,475
- Sir, please--
- Hey!

1824
02:23:39,558 --> 02:23:41,767
- Sir.
- Why are you hanging up on me?

1825
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:43,517
- Sir.
- What is going on there?

1826
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:46,642
He's no ordinary fellow, sir.
He has set traps all around the house.

1827
02:23:46,725 --> 02:23:48,225
<i>All our men are dead.</i>

1828
02:23:48,808 --> 02:23:50,642
<i>I know him like the back of my hand.</i>

1829
02:23:50,725 --> 02:23:52,058
<i>I confirm, he is Leo.</i>

1830
02:23:52,142 --> 02:23:53,475
Who is in front of you?

1831
02:23:53,558 --> 02:23:56,433
His wife and daughter.
Shall I slit their throats open?

1832
02:23:56,517 --> 02:23:58,767
No need.
Put the phone on speaker.

1833
02:23:59,017 --> 02:24:00,600
<i>Give the phone to his wife.</i>

1834
02:24:03,683 --> 02:24:04,933
You better listen to me.

1835
02:24:05,017 --> 02:24:06,725
- Accept that you are Leo.
- Sir.

1836
02:24:06,808 --> 02:24:08,225
<i>I'll let them go.</i>

1837
02:24:09,767 --> 02:24:10,767
Parthi!

1838
02:24:14,058 --> 02:24:15,808
Sathya, don't panic.

1839
02:24:19,225 --> 02:24:20,433
Accept it.

1840
02:24:25,975 --> 02:24:27,683
Subramani.

1841
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:53,267
Hey!

1842
02:24:53,350 --> 02:24:55,118
I'm talking seriously here
and you're laughing!

1843
02:24:55,142 --> 02:24:56,142
Me?

1844
02:24:57,017 --> 02:24:58,808
I think it's some rabid dog.

1845
02:25:01,683 --> 02:25:02,767
Go away!

1846
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:24,058
I told you to instruct your men
to not go in, sir.

1847
02:25:24,142 --> 02:25:25,683
Poor fellows.
Right, sir?

1848
02:25:55,142 --> 02:25:57,017
Now the Leo we know will emerge.

1849
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:33,058
Chittu, he has to accept that he's Leo.

1850
02:27:02,933 --> 02:27:06,100
- Don't let go of him!
- Hold him tight!

1851
02:27:06,183 --> 02:27:08,308
- Chop him!
- Don't let go of him.

1852
02:28:08,183 --> 02:28:09,558
Chop him into pieces!

1853
02:28:42,892 --> 02:28:44,725
Chop him!

1854
02:29:10,850 --> 02:29:12,517
Hey! Stay with his son.

1855
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:16,475
Hey!

1856
02:31:16,725 --> 02:31:19,183
I used this to kill your sister--

1857
