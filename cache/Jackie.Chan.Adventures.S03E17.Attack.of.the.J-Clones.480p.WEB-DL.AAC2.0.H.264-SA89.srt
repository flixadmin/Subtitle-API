1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,938
This is a little much.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,376
Here, here.
Kudos to the j-team!

3
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,712
El toro fuerte,
the masked wrestler.

4
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,648
Tohru, sumo-
extra-ordinaire.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,352
Viper, the former thief
turned museum's best friend.

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,189
And of course, the brains
who put the "j" into j-team--

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,892
Jade, and her trusty
sidekick Jackie.

8
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,327
Ahem.
- Huh?

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,628
I'm sorry,
young lady,

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,897
the kid's corner
is right this way.

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,866
But I'm the fifth member
of the j-team!

12
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,701
Who do think
wrote your copy?

13
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,503
Look, yade.
Crayons!

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,304
Grr!

15
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,107
And it's Jade,
paco.

16
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,777
Of course, we are here
to celebrate the j-team

17
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:47,046
and the stolen artifacts
they recovered.

18
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,614
So without further ado,

19
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:53,218
our newly reinstated
collection of Jade!

20
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,522
(All gasp)

21
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,090
But where's
the yade?

22
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,192
It's been jacked. Duh!

23
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,227
And it's Jade.

24
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,267
Who wants to bet this
is the work of the creep

25
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,002
who stole the Jade
in the first place?

26
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,637
Seor Chang?

27
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,005
Not likely.

28
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,174
Chang's been
doing hard time
in the federal pen

29
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:16,809
since you all
put him there.

30
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:19,244
Well, if not
captain hook, who?

31
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,748
The museum's surveillance
footage is about to tell us.

32
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,553
(Camera shutter clicks)

33
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,987
(Click)

34
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,389
(All gasp)

35
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,124
So, uh...

36
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,725
Who's the babe?

37
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,984
Really, I appreciate
you guys giving me
the benefit of the doubt.

38
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,154
I'm sorry, viper.

39
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,788
You know
I have no choice.

40
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,657
Tch. Hello?

41
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,159
Viper's
a former thief,

42
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,627
accent
on "former."

43
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,995
I have to admit

44
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,130
we have been through
too much with viper.

45
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,933
I cannot believe
she would resort
to her old ways.

46
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,334
But the tape--

47
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,502
viper's face--

48
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,603
let me assure you:

49
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,639
My agents
will be on this 24/7

50
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,941
until we uncover
the truth.

51
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,943
Well, what are we
waiting for, team?

52
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,512
Let's get the vipester
off the hook.

53
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,250
Jade, what
are we looking for?

54
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,419
A crumb, a follicle,
an eyelash,

55
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,922
any little thing
that'll prove
viper's been framed

56
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,790
for swiping the Jade.

57
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,827
Why was this Jade
not stolen?

58
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,964
Because it would take a man
of my strength to lift it.

59
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,700
Then did miss viper
steal just the hand?

60
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,368
It was
the only piece
of the collection

61
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,070
we were not
able to recover.

62
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:28,607
Because it's still attached
to old Chang's elbow, paco.

63
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,012
Hmm.

64
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,317
A fine example of
pre-aztec <i> lucha libre.</i>

65
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,655
(Alarm blares)

66
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,893
All: El toro?!

67
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,595
What has gotten
into you?

68
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:50,762
Hold this,
<i>por favor.</i>
Uhh!

69
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,265
You are in cahoots
with viper? Unh!

70
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,601
Not the stairs!

71
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,269
Uhh--uhh--uhh...

72
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,706
Uhh!
(Crash)

73
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,841
(Growls)

74
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:03,942
(Gasps)

75
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,010
El toro?

76
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,578
A criminal?

77
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,013
Tch. Think again.

78
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,181
Uhh!

79
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,049
El toro,
what are you doing?

80
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,184
The fuerte fandango.

81
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,318
Uhh!

82
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,688
Huuup!

83
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,091
I smell a rat
in bull's clothing.

84
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,199
El toro fuerte
never removes his mask.

85
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,167
Eww!

86
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,603
Whoa!

87
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,738
Uhh!

88
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,744
If he is a phony,

89
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,812
where is
the real El toro?

90
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,016
(Muffled)

91
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,217
Huh?

92
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,518
Oh, boy.

93
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,354
So soon?

94
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,296
So that's why you
never remove your mask.

95
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,965
Just fooling,
handsome.

96
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,135
A frame-up
seems to be the most
logical explanation.

97
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:07,239
Why else go to
the trouble of creating
such perfect imposters?

98
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,107
Even I could not
tell the difference.

99
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,742
Do you know
what this means?

100
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,977
If there's a villain
out there

101
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,645
who recognizes us
as a team,

102
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,347
then we're
big time!

103
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,349
Considering
the evidence
acquitting viper,

104
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,550
I've decided
to bring Chang in

105
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,118
for questioning
after all.

106
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,887
He's the only one
with a motive.

107
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,890
And what about
the...Uh, mask?

108
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,658
(Sighs) <i> Nada.</i>

109
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,393
The lab says
its constituent parts

110
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,829
aren't based
in any science we know.

111
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,565
Then maybe it's time
to bring in...

112
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,367
The man from uncle.

113
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,937
Aiyaaa!

114
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,340
Uncle, I'm glad you--

115
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,641
what could be so important

116
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,777
that you drag uncle
out of mah-jongg tournament?!

117
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,415
I will pin
all of you to the mat.

118
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,217
With what arms,
El fake-o?

119
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,418
We need your
expert advice--

120
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,753
aiyaaa!

121
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,422
Why did you not drag uncle
from tournament earlier?

122
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:02,894
This mask is clearly
a product of dark forces.

123
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,764
Really, captain black.

124
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,033
You pull me out of prison
to accuse me

125
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,602
of orchestrating a plan
from inside prison

126
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:13,805
that I couldn't possibly do
unless I was outside prison?

127
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,607
I'll ask
the questions here.

128
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,975
What's the deal, Chang?

129
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,211
How are you
pulling it off?

130
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,579
Come now, captain.

131
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,782
As much as I would enjoy
having revenge on the j-team

132
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:27,018
for retrieving
the precious Jade
I worked so hard to steal,

133
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,654
you know my every move
is monitored.

134
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:33,692
I'm sure your people are
even aware of the flavor
of my chewing gum.

135
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,727
What?
- Spearmint, Jackie.

136
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,262
No! His hand!

137
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,297
He has 2!

138
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,367
What are you
talking about?

139
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,136
Chang has 2 hands

140
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,972
because that
is not really Chang.

141
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,508
It is his
magical duplicate.

142
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,077
You mean we're
dealing with clones?

143
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,278
Aiyaa!

144
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
Who said anything
about clowns?

145
00:06:55,682 --> 00:07:00,452
We are facing forces more
powerful than the circus!

146
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,288
I regret to inform you

147
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,958
that your clone
counterpart has
been discovered, sir.

148
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,761
Then it is time
to proceed to phase 2.

149
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,963
Is the next clone
ready, yip?

150
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,133
Hmm. And in position

151
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,403
outside section 13.

152
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,605
Chang: Then one by one,

153
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,707
the j-team
will be replaced

154
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,410
and eliminated.

155
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,487
So, are we off
to the top-secret
meeting about the clones?

156
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,089
Jade, the meeting
is for team members only.

157
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,925
Right.
Race ya there.

158
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,428
Hey, think
I have a clone?

159
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,596
Duh!

160
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,764
Of course I do.

161
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,165
It's the only
surefire way

162
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,402
for them to take out
the brains of the team.

163
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:52,003
Just what I need--

164
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,272
another Jade.

165
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,440
Bwaa!

166
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,611
Oh.

167
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,980
I must have clones
on the brain.

168
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,882
Hmm.

169
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,184
Was there always
a mirror here?

170
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,553
Ha.

171
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,055
Uhh.

172
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,756
Blablabalbalabla.

173
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,380
Oh, silly me.

174
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,115
Hey, Jackie.
Hello.

175
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,253
Oh! Ugh!

176
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,155
(Groans)

177
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,162
Daaahhh!

178
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,284
Going down?

179
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,652
(Blows)

180
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,986
Daaahhhh!

181
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,822
Do not worry.

182
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,758
You will
not be missed.

183
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,565
Duplicates
are imperfect.

184
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:31,002
They contain flaws
like Chang's extra hand,

185
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,904
but each
is more powerful

186
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,006
than its human
counterpart,

187
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,075
due to its magic.

188
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,677
Oh, we can
take 'em, unc.

189
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,712
We'll face off
in an epic
battle royale.

190
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,480
Human versus clone,

191
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,582
good versus evil,

192
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,517
Jade versus Jade.

193
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,253
You miss uncle's point!

194
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:52,857
Magic must defeat magic.

195
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,526
Look who decided to show.

196
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,861
Heh. Sorry I'm late.

197
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,864
Hmm, now
one more thing.

198
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,700
We must be very watchful

199
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,402
for these
defective duplicates.

200
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,870
(Breathes rapidly)

201
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,472
Uncle!

202
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,740
We must watch out for--

203
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,242
it is Jackie's clone!

204
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,913
Huh? No! Wait!

205
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,581
Ohh!

206
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,017
I am me!

207
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,419
He is not me!

208
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,388
Tricky clone, isn't he?

209
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,058
Which is
the real Jackie chan?

210
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,729
I have a little quiz
only the real Jackie
could answer.

211
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,965
Jackie,
when is my birthday?

212
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,835
Oh, uh...
- Oh, uh...

213
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,738
Gee, Jackie.
I thought we were
pretty good friends.

214
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,239
Ahem. Hey, Jackie.

215
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,075
Will you take me
to moose world
this weekend?

216
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,377
Of course.
- Not!

217
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,978
You have
homework.

218
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,780
There's your clone.

219
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,521
I'm sorry. I'll be back
to destroy you later.
Thank you!

220
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,194
Not to worry.

221
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,497
Jackie's clone
will lead us
right to Chang himself.

222
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,867
You see, I planted
a little tracking device
on his...

223
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,170
Collar.

224
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,338
Cheer up, chief.

225
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,874
I managed to place
a tracker on the clone.

226
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,075
(Clears throat)

227
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,143
Then let's
move out, team.

228
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,412
No one is moving out!

229
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:23,548
There may yet be
a clone among us.

230
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,054
A bit excessive,
don't you think?

231
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:32,824
Do you want duplicate
to attack uncle
when it is discovered?

232
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,693
No? Then sit quietly.

233
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,666
Uh, viper,
did you always
have that mole?

234
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,468
Hey, if you
want to start--

235
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,937
let us not accuse
one another.

236
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,339
Any one of us
might be a clone--

237
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,774
eh, except for me.

238
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,176
Hey!

239
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,244
Doesn't anyone think
I might be a clone?

240
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,345
All: No.

241
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,648
I'm not feeling
the love here.

242
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,917
If a duplicate
is among us,

243
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,518
fish will glow.

244
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,188
(Chanting)

245
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,225
If I were a clone,
would I know it?

246
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,763
Tohru is
the only j-team clone
we have not encountered.

247
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,232
Then I am a clone.

248
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,469
(Sobs) I am so sorry.

249
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,339
Fish does not lie.

250
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,941
Ah, thank you, fish.

251
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,209
<i>Excellente!</i>

252
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,845
(Without accent)
They are not clones, Jade!

253
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,848
Um, what did you
call me?

254
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,950
Your name, of course.
Jade.

255
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,219
That's what I thought.

256
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,887
Let me see that.

257
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,691
(All gasp)

258
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,327
Paco has a clone,
and I don't?

259
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,962
Way unfair!

260
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,097
We are
- in great danger.

261
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,633
Paco, please.
Say it is not so.

262
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:49,801
But it is,

263
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,770
and now I will
destroy you all.

264
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,438
Mwa ha ha ha ha!

265
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,061
Ungh!

266
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,697
Uh, I'll be
just a moment.

267
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:20,865
Ungh!

268
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,342
Unh, almost got it.

269
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,947
Uncle, how
do you stop it?

270
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,650
Uncle has not yet
researched that part!

271
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,765
But, El toro,
you cannot harm me.

272
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,633
You are the greatest.

273
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,502
I cannot.

274
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,905
(Grunts) How about now?

275
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,142
(Gasps)

276
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,276
Whaaaaa!

277
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,411
Unh!

278
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,379
(Grumbles)

279
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:12,083
Uh, someone want
to help me with this?

280
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,152
Is that
the best you have?

281
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,856
If this thing
is a clone,

282
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,024
then where
is the real paco?

283
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,664
El toro, where are you?

284
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,743
Looks like Chang's returned
to his old stomping grounds.

285
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,950
If seor Chang has harmed
one hair on paco's head...

286
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,531
He is big.

287
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,639
Jade clone,
10 o'clock.

288
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,240
Where?

289
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,976
Oh. You mean me.

290
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:15,580
Jade, we left you
at section 13
for a reason.

291
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,315
How did you
find us here?

292
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,651
Tracking device.

293
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:23,421
(Grumbles)
Tracking device.

294
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,824
Look!

295
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,993
Paquito.

296
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,867
How do we get past them?

297
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,168
Duh.

298
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,737
You think
they can tell
we're not clones?

299
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,642
Remember!

300
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,444
Think like a clone.

301
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,587
(Robotic)
I am tohru's clone.

302
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,724
Are you all right?

303
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,292
Uh, fine. You?

304
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,761
Master Chang
requires your presence.

305
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,797
We'll guard the hostage.

306
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,971
My brave <i> hombre.</i>

307
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,878
Jade, can you believe
even I have a clone?

308
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,848
Ha ha. Yeah.
Pretty awesome.

309
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,283
How convenient.

310
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:28,119
The entire j-team
in one spot,

311
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,055
which ought
to facilitate
your group demise

312
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,457
rather nicely.

313
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,758
How did you do it, Chang?

314
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,927
Magic was never your m.O.

315
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,329
All it takes
is a little
collaboration

316
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,832
with a master
of the dark arts

317
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,567
and a grudge.

318
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,835
Clones!

319
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,180
Where's mine?

320
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,583
Ok, team.
Let's rock!

321
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,853
What's the kid doing here?

322
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,155
(Sighs)
She never listens.

323
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:07,191
Ok, team.
What my clone said.

324
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,904
Grrr!

325
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,839
Hold it, big fella.
It's me.

326
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,409
Oh, sorry.

327
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,077
Gotcha. Hee-yah!

328
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,314
Hi-yah!
Oof!

329
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,652
Got you.

330
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,229
Wedginator!

331
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,364
Eep!

332
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,100
Raaah!

333
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,135
El toro: Grrrr!

334
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,370
Vaaah!

335
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,083
Aah!

336
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,118
Oof!

337
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,353
Wrong one!

338
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,489
Sorry.

339
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,927
(Cell phone rings)

340
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,128
Hello?

341
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,031
Jackie, I have devised
way to defeat clones.

342
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,300
Let me speak
to my apprentice.

343
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,406
Uh, it is for tohru.

344
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,210
This is tohru.

345
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,412
Tohru, like the originals,

346
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,581
the duplicates
are naturally good.

347
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:40,084
An additional spell was
required to make them evil.

348
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,286
On an interesting
side note--

349
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,656
very compelling, but--

350
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,692
ooh!

351
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,163
Uncle: ...Which
is why your mother
has terrible manners.

352
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,398
Sensei, please.
The spell.

353
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,434
Uncle is
getting to that!

354
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,170
Maybe
you didn't know

355
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,506
I'm a master
of the ancient art
of butt whup.

356
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,607
Chi-yah!

357
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,741
Ha! Chi-yah!

358
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,842
Ha!

359
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,782
Whoa--ohh.

360
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,918
Maybe you didn't
know the original

361
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,253
is always better
than a copy.

362
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,621
Ohh.

363
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:17,922
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

364
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,357
Ok, got it.

365
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,492
(Chanting)

366
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,634
All is quiet, sir.

367
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,870
Then the j-team
is no more?

368
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,273
My clones
are far more powerful

369
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,542
than their
human counterparts.

370
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,612
Huh?
- Huh?

371
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,929
Jade and Jade clone:
Let's rock, team--wha!

372
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,098
Jackie and Jackie clone:
Jade, leave this
to the grownups.

373
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,400
Ohh!
- Ohh!

374
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,511
The j-team
has done it again, Jade.

375
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,813
Both: Teams, paco.
The j-teams,

376
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,516
and it's Jade.

377
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,684
Unh.

378
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,085
Just what I need.

379
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,021
Another j-team.

380
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,826
Hey, Jackie.

381
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,194
Are you afraid
of the dark?

382
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,430
Yes and no.

383
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:36,701
Sometimes when I'm walking
in a very dark, dark place,

384
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,070
there's somebody--
just tell me
the ghost story.

385
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,772
As long as I'm
not doing bad things,

386
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,474
always helping people--

387
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:47,278
wherever I go,
I don't scare dark anymore.
