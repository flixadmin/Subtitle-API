Get to your positions.
Come on. Same as last time.

11
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,875
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

12
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,916
Meet back at the trucks. Be careful, okay?

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,392
- Let's go. Quickly and quietly.
- Run fast.

Bring your things. Hurry. Come on.
Come on. Move it. Move it. Go, go, go.

00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,791
- Come on. Come on, quickly.
- Come on, Mia. Let's go.

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,833
- Hurry up. Quickly.
- Where?

17
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:57,916
This way.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,750
Move it. Move it.

19
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,375
You two, follow me.
This way, guys. Come on!

20

This way.

21
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,166
Faster.

22
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,666
Faster. Move it.

23

Come on. Let's go.

24
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,583

- No.

Don't stop. Let's go.

Let's go. Come on. Move. You first.

27

Okay.

28
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,500
- Nico.
- I'm here.

29
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,875
- I don't fit. Fuck, I don't fit!
- You can do it.

30
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:54,875
- Push me.
- Okay.

31
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,500
Sorry.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,875
- Are you okay? Yeah, you're okay.
- What?

33
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,875
Back up!

34

Let's go.

Come on. Follow me.

36
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,875
Hold my hand.

Come on.

38
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,333
Let's go, love.

39
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,458
Stay back, don't move.

40
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,666
Now!

41
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,041

00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,958
You wait here.

47
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,958
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

48
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,215
Didn't tell me about these two.
Bring 'em over.

49
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,291
You, here.

50
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,166
It's fine.

51
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,625
- Is anything wrong?
- The conditions are riskier than expected.

52
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,791
I need more money.

53
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,958
No, no, no. We don't have any more money.

54
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,833
I see how this works.

55
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,375
- Babe, give me your ring.
- No.

56
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,416
{\an8}- Yes. You've got to.
- No. We gave them everything. Not my ring!

57
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,458
Mia, we've got to leave now.

58
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,541
Take it.

59
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:14,958
Come on.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,125
Come on. We don't have all night. Move it.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Good. This way.

62
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,458
Safe travels.

63
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,875
We're gonna make it.

64
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,083
There it is. Our luxury liner.

65
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,166
Move it, asshole!

66
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,166
- Come on.
- Let's go!

67
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
Now!

68
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,000
Step to the back.

69
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500

- No.

Wow.

That's better.

88
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,083
- Okay? Here.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,541
Make him shut up.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,125
Where'd you get this?

91
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,041
Ah...

92
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,125
Tell me.

93
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
It's a secret.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,583
Let's not have it now.

95
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,875
Let's save it
and eat it when we get there.

96
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,875
- To celebrate, right?
- Exactly.

97
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,125
Do you think the regime will go there too?

98
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,166
Ireland has ruled in opposition to it.

99
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,250
Doesn't matter.
Governments are falling everywhere.

100
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,583
- I'll tell you something about the Irish.
- What?

101
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,958
It's impossible to overthrow them.

102
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,333
- They drink dark beer.
- Right.

103
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,875
Ireland won't give in.

104
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,750
You're allowed to be afraid, you know.

105
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,625
Everything will work out, you'll see. Hmm.

106
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,583
- You don't know for sure.
- The worst part is over.

107
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,708
You don't know that.

108
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,833
There's one thing I do know.

109
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,125
What?

110
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,666
That I love you more than yesterday.

111
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,958
But less than tomorrow.

112
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,250
What's happening? Are we there?

113
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,041
We're leaving.

114
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,750
Turn off the games.

115
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,333
Do you think she's pregnant?
She's all alone.

116
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,875
If she's pregnant, she's not alone.

117
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,375
How's our little Noa doing?

118
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,208
I didn't know we decided yet.

119
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,375
Noa.

120
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,083
- What do you wanna name her?
- I hope it isn't a girl.

121
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,791
I mean it.

122
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,166
Well, I think she's a girl, a warrior.

123
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,416
Just like her mother.

124
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
I don't feel her.

125
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,750
What?

126
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,666
She hasn't kicked me in two days.

127
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,208
That's not good.

128
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,083
Why didn't you tell me?

129
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:34,958
Dunno.

130
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,416
What are you doing?

131
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,208
Haven't you noticed?

132
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,250
She always pushes right here.

133
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,625
I think this is a foot.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How do you do it?

135
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,708
What?

136
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,875
Act like everything's fine.

137
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,875
Like nothing's happened to us.

138
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,708
You know that's not true.

139
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,208
- You know, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,208
You brought my duck!

141
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,583
Hi, there. What's wrong?

142
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,333
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

143
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,416
No, no, no. Don't cry.

144
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,125
- What does the duck say?
- Shh. Don't cry. You're okay.

145
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,541
- Shh.
- Nico.

146
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,625
Yeah?

147
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,000
What if she's alive,

148
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,125
and we're leaving her behind?

149
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,125
All alone.

150
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,250
She's not alive.

151
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,458
They took her away,

152
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,666
and they killed her.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hmm.

154
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,541
Hey! Hey! Hey!

155
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,625
Nico! Nico!

156
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,541
{\an8}Mia!

157
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,708
Come on, now! Hurry up! Move it!

158
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,208
Move it! Get in there now! Come on!

159
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,791
What are you doin'?
Stop. There's too many. Back out!

160
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,500
- Nico! Nico!
- Mia!

161
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,583
Listen up! There's too many of you.

162
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,250
There's another truck coming.

163
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,791
- Half of you get out. Now!
- You heard him! It's too full.

164
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,666
- Get some of 'em out!
- Come on! Come on! Get outta here!

165
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,625
Mia! Mia! Mia!

166
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,208
- Nico!
- Get out!

167
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,017
- Wait! Mia!
- Come on, keep moving. Hey, you!

168
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,750
You can't stay!

169
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,416
Hey. Are you deaf or what?
Get off the truck.

170
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,041
No, no. I was on this one, with my wife!

171
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,250
- Get out!
- Get out!

172
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,791
- Nico!
- The rest move back.

173
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,666
- Stay back!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please! No!

174
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,583
No. No, no, no. Nico. No, no, no.

175
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,625
Keep moving! Come on! To the back!

176
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,333
Nico. Nico.

177
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,208
Nico.

178
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,416
Nico. No.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,125
Nico, Nico.

180
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,333
One-zero-seven green.

181
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,833
No. No, please. Wait, wait, wait.

182
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,625
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Mia.</i></font>
- Babe, are you all right?

183
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,166
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.</i></font>

184
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,875
- Okay, Nico.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Yeah?</i></font>

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,833
- How will we find each other again?
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- We're okay. My truck is behind yours.</i></font>

186
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,333
- I can't do this alone.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- What?</i></font>

187
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,583
No, no.
I can't do it alone, I really can't.

188
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,708
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Listen to me. You can't trust anyone.
Understand? Keep your things tucked away.</i></font>

189

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Be careful, my love.</i></font>

190
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,458
Yeah.

191
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,708
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Did you hear me?</i></font>

192

193
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,250
Nico, listen to me.

194
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,541
Are you sure they're taking us
to the same location?

195
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,666
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Yes, and when they stop, I'll escape.</i></font>

196
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,791
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Our ship is the only one
setting sail this week.</i></font>

197
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,083
- Nico.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Yes?</i></font>

198
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,708
I wanna be with you.

199
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Me too. I love you, Mia.</i></font>

200

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.</i></font>

201
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,541
- Okay.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- We're gonna be okay.</i></font>

202
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,583
- Okay.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- We'll talk soon, all right?</i></font>

203
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,500
Don't go yet, don't hang up.

204
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,958
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Love, we can't waste our batteries.</i></font>

205

208
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:49,916
Come soon.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,958
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I will. As soon as I can.</i></font>

210
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,083
Okay.

211
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,541
What makes you think
you're better than us?

212
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,375
Little girl, be quiet.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
<font color="#FFFF00">GIVE US OUR CHILDREN BACK</font>

214
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,625
No, please, no!

215
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,083
No...

216
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,541
<font color="#FFFF00">MURDERERS!
THIS IS NOT THE WAY</font>

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,333
What's going on?

218
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Hey.

219
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,500
- What's going on?
- Move to the back.

220
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,375
Don't talk.

221
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,916
How you doin'?

222
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,041
Good, thanks.

223
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,875
Step outside.
Bring your documents.

224
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,250
Do I have to get out?

225
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,291
- Transporting?
- Behind schedule.

226
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,208
Very good.
Come with me to the back, please.

227
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,333
Uh, sure.

228
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,583
This is the entire load?

229
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,666
Yes.

230
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,083
You can't tell me what you're moving?

231
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,833
Small load. All in the manifest.

232
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,000
I know what it says.

233
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,083
Problem is you don't.

234
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,541
Look, it's been a long week.
I log a lot of miles.

235
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,125
Lots of shipments.

236
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,208
Stop!

237
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,166
Is there a problem?

238
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,666
Another one's pullin' in.

239
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,750
He can park there.

240
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,958
Am I clear?

241
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,041
You in a rush?

242
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,208
Uh, it's just if... if I'm late,
I'll be penalized.

243
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,916
Well, I'm required
to check inside the truck.

244
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,208
But is that necessary?
I'm barely carrying anything.

245
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,791
Don't worry about it.
I'll write you a note.

246
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,041
Travis, back here.

247
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,000
Do it!

248
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,458
Great, thank you.

249
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,541
Well done.

250
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,541
You can come out now.

251
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,625
Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you.

252
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,958
You won't come out?

253
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,875
I know that the austerity measures
have been cruel.

254
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,458
They're especially hard
on women and children.

255
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,666
I understand
if you don't think you can trust me.

256
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,416
It's hard to know
who to trust, right? Hmm?

257
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,916
Not those who forced you
into this container.

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,281
They stuffed you in here
with barely enough air to breathe

259
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,708
and robbed you
of all the money you had left.

260
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,083
And they promised you...

261
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,041
...you could have a better life
in a better place.

262
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,208
They lied.

263
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,041
A better place doesn't exist.

264
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,291
So you should come out.

265
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,208
Because if you don't, I'll have to shoot.

266
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,833
Damn it. Don't make me give that order.
I've had to give it so many times.

267
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,083
I can save your lives.

268
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,583
Well, I tried.

269
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,375
Come. Take my hand.

270
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,625
Hey! Good for you!

271
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,250
Come on up! Take my hand!

272
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,916
All right, boys. You know what to do.

273
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,000
Puppy!

274
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,958
Get the bodies out of here
and get rid of all their shit.

275
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,000
Take this one.

276
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,333
Good enough. Let's go.

277
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,333
- All good, boss.
- Great.

278
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,625
Nico. You've gotta hide. Hide, Nico.

279
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,833
They killed everyone.

280
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:01,250
You've gotta hide.
They're gonna kill you. Hide, Nico.

281
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,916
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hello, this is Nico.
I can't talk now, but try me again later.</i></font>

282
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,291
Nico.

283
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm okay and I'm at the port.

284
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,833
Where are you?

285
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,375
Where are you? Why don't you pick up?

286
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,000
Just call me.

287
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,000
- Watch out, it's gonna come loose.
- Help!

288
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,083
I need help!

289
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,708
Come on, let's go!

290
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,958
It's gonna fall! Watch out!

291
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,041
Please help!

292
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,291
Hey! Hey! I'm in here!

293
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,208
Let me out! Please, I'm here!

294
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,750
Hey! Hey!

295

I'm in here!

296
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Help!

297
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,041
- Help!
- It's going to fall!

298
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,125
Please, help me!

299
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,916
- Is somebody there?
- Yes, I'm here! Help me, please!

300
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,916
God.

301
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,333
Help.

302
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,583
What?

303
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,750
No, no, no, no. No.

304
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,541
No way.

305
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,666
Please.

306
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,166
Please. Please.

307
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,416
Aw, come on.

00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,166
Fuck.

313
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,583
Shit.

314
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,333
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

315
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,375
Oh, no.

316
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:01,791
What?

317
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,208
Hey!

Hey!

Nico, I'm over here!

Nico!

Nico!

327
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:26,166
Where are you?
Hang on! Just hang on! Wait.

328
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,750
Okay.

329
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,208
Nico!

330
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,791
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

331
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,166
Wait. Wait!

332
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,291
Nico!

333
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,708
It's me. Come on, answer the phone.

334
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,541
Please, answer me. No, no, no, no.

335
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:49,958
No!

336
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,291
No! Please, I'm here!

337
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,500
No!

338

Something's happening to me, Nico.

374
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,333
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- What's wrong?</i></font>

No, no, no. You've gotta listen to me.
I'm not... You won't...

<i><font color="#80FFFF">What? What's going on?</i></font>

378
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,583
I'm not on the boat.

379
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,625
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- What do you mean?</i></font>
- I'm not on the boat.

380
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,625
- My container's in the ocean.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Wait. Your... What? Where are you?</i></font>

381
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,750
I don't know. I'm floating in the ocean.
I'm drifting. I don't know where.

382
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,875
I'm okay for now,
but the water's seeping in.

383

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Oh my God, Mia.
Can you see anything outside?</i></font>

384
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,851
Yes, I can see, but all there is is water.
There's just water.

385
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,675
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- There's nothing else?</i></font>
- Nothing. Just water.

386
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,833
- I'm in the middle of the ocean, Nico.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Fuck!</i></font>

387
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,500
Say something. I'm scared.

388

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Just don't worry, Mia.
I'll rescue you. I promise.</i></font>

389

- Nico...
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Just try to hang in there.</i></font>

390
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,208
- I'm trying, but I...
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Do it for the baby.</i></font>

391
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,250
I don't think I can do this much longer.

392
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,253
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- You can do it.</i></font>
- I just miss her so much, Nico.

393
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,375
<i><font color="#80FFFF">No, no, no, no. No, no.</i></font>

394
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,208
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- My love, don't do this. Not now.</i></font>
- I messed up again.

395
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,083
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's not your fault. Do you understand?</i></font>

396
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,750
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What happened to Uma was not your fault.</i></font>

397
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,041
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Sweetheart.</i></font>
- It wasn't?

398
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,833
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You're the strongest person
I've ever known.</i></font>

399
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,708
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Promise you won't give up?</i></font>
- Yes.

400
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:34,791
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Mia...</i></font>
- Yeah?

401
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,250
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I love you more than yesterday.</i></font>

402
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,625
But less than tomorrow.

403
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:42,458
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I will call you
as soon as I figure out a plan.</i></font>

404
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,416
- Find me. Bye.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Don't lose your phone.</i></font>

405
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,791
Oh no, no, no, no, no. Not now.
Not now. Don't do this right now.

406
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,416
Just wait. Help Mommy and wait.

407
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,875
Daddy's on his way.
Wait for Daddy to come.

408
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,000
No. No, no, no.

409
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,833
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

410
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:05,708
Please, please wait. Wait a bit longer.
Please wait, please wait a little longer.

411
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,958
I wanted you to wait!

412
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:16,625
Nico!

413
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,375
No!

414
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,583
Ah! No, no, no!

415
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:27,833
No!

416
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,208
What? Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

417
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:29,083
Breathe, please. Please. Come on.

418
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,958
Come on, breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

419
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:35,291
Oh please, breathe.

420
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,625
Mm-hmm.

421
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,708
Oh! Oh!

Honey. Sweetie.

425
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,208
What's wrong?

426
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,166
Want a fresh diaper? Yes?

427
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,750
All right, all right.
It's okay. I can hear you.

428

You're so loud. I know, I know.

429

You're hungry, aren't you?
Okay, it's coming. That's right. Hang on.

Come on, sweetie. I know you're hungry.

Come on, lovie.

433

You're hungry, but you won't eat.

Okay, okay, okay.
Everything's all right.

Mommy needs to eat too.

Mm...

No fucking way. Fuck.

Honey, why won't you eat? Okay...

Hey, listen, listen, listen, listen.

443
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:42,166
Your job is to eat,
and my job is to take care of you, okay?

444
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,875
We're gonna get out of here, promise.

Please don't be so sad, honey.

446
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:10,791
Hey! That's enough now!

447
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:14,833
I have to do this so we can get out
of here and get some help. Okay?

448
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,166
Be quiet and let me work!

449
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,000
Try to be patient for me, please.

450

00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,791
Okay. You're starving.

454
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,333
Honey...

455
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:47,041
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Come on.

456
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:51,166
Be quiet! Stop! Stop this! Enough!

457
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,833
You have to eat or you will die!
You wanna die?

458
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:55,291
{\an8}Huh? Is that what you want?

459
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,208
{\an8}I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby.

460
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:04,541
{\an8}Mommy loves you.
I'm sorry. Forgive me. I didn't mean it.

461
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,041
{\an8}I'm gonna take care of you.

462

I know, I know.

463
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,083
I'm so sorry.

464

It's all right.

465
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,833
Come here, my little warrior.

466
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,500
Let's try again. Okay?

467
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,583
Still hungry?

468
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,458
I know, and we're gonna try again.

469
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:46,291
You've been waiting for so long.
I'm sorry it took so long.

470
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:48,041
I know, I know, I know.

471
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:49,958
Ready?

472
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,375
Here we go, sweetheart.

473
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,458
That's it.

474
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,708
Latch on for Mommy.

475
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,333
Keep drinking for Mommy.

476
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:20,125
Mommy's milk came.

477
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:22,291
Finally.

478
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:24,916
That's right.

479
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:30,333
Good girl.
We're good, we're good, we're good.

480
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,166
Mm...

481
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:54,833
Mm.

482
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,166
Come on!

483
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:18,500
All right. Almost there.

484
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,791
Huh? What's going on?

485
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:28,625
No. Come on!

486
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,916
Please work.

487
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:32,666
Let's go.

488
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,583
Come on!

489
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
No.

490
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:39,875
No!

491
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
No...

492
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,083
Yes!

493
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:31,833
Come on.

494
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,583
No. No.

495
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:36,375
Please work. Come on, work!

496
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,708
Come back! Please!

497
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:42,375
Don't do this to me!

498
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:45,250
Ugh! Come on! No! No. no. no. Hey!

499
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:46,333
Ugh.

500
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,416
No!

501
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,875
It's all right.
It's all right, sweetie. I know.

502
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:48,791
That's better, isn't it?
Shh, there, that's better.

503
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:50,625
Much, much better.

504
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:09,291
Mm...

505
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,166
Hm...

506
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:15,958
Mm...

507
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:54,333
Eh...

508
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,833
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

509
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:01,125
Don't cry. It's okay.
I'm here, sweetie. Mommy's here.

510
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,333
Don't worry. I'm here.

511
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,875
Don't be afraid. It's okay, it's okay.

512
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:13,375
Okay.

513
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Go away!

514
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,583
Get outta here!

515
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,541
Okay. It's gone.

516
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,750
I've got you. I'm here.

517
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,041
It's gone.

518
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,125
It's gone.

519
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,250
<font color="#FFFF00">DAY 6</font>

520
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:09,083
Huh?

521
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:26,666
Mm.

522
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,208
- Mommy?
- Uma, my darling.

523
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,625
Uma, please come here.

524
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,708
Come closer. Please. I wanna see you.

525
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Hi, honey.

526
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:42,541
Mommy, can we go home now, please?

527
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:46,291
I miss you so much, Uma.

528
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:49,291
Mommy, why did you let them take me away?

529
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:51,583
I'm sorry.

530
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:56,583
I'm sorry.

531
01:00:57,791 --> 01:00:59,000
It was my fault.

532
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:03,541
I just wanted to play with the airplane.

533
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:07,791
I know, it was a mistake.

534
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,041
No, stay.

535
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:25,625
I'm sorry.

536
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,541
It was my fault. I messed up.

537
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

538
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:40,666
It wasn't your fault.

539
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:53,833
It wasn't your fault.

540
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,291
Mommy will
get you out of here, okay?

541
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:12,333
Sweetheart. Look at the world.

542
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,250
Up above is the sky.

543
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,166
Down below is the sea.

544
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:22,041
And very far over there
is where we're going.

545
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:28,541
Nico, where are you?

546
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,750
Feels good to be outside, right?

547
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,625
Yeah, you seem much happier.

548
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,416
You like the sun and fresh air.

549
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:09,250
This way. Over here.

550
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:10,333
Here.

551
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,791
Come on. Over here. This way.

552
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:00,666
Here. I'm here.

553
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:46,208
Shh! It's okay, my love.
I'm here. It's okay. It's okay.

554
01:08:46,291 --> 01:08:47,416
I'm here. I'm here.

555
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:09,916
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

556
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:12,583
I've got this.

557
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:35,541
Oh.

558
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:38,541
Don't worry, sweetie.

559
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,458
Come on.

560
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,541
Come on, come on.

561
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,166
Come on.

562
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:22,958
Come on, come on. Come, come, come, come.

563
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Come on.

564
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,291
Come on.

565
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:55,125
Don't give me that look. I'm desperate.
You know what it feels like.

566
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:08,458
<font color="#FFFF00">MAXIMUM</font>

567
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:13,041
<font color="#FFFF00">DAY 9</font>

568
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,875
Good job. You're Mommy's big girl.

569
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,250
It's mini bath time.

570
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:20,541
Where are you? Where are you?
Call me. Come on, Nico. Call me.

571
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,583
Call me, please. Call me!

572
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:50,583
<font color="#FFFF00">DAY 12</font>

573
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:10,791
Look, this is me.

574
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:11,875
At school.

575
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,791
With one of my students.
Did I tell you I'm a teacher?

576
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,500
This is your daddy. His name's Nico.

577
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:21,416
He's at work, in our store.

578
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:26,375
We were forced to close the store
because there wasn't much food to sell.

579
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:31,625
At the end, there wasn't anything at all.
But people came to visit him anyway.

580
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,666
Because he cared about them.

581
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:36,541
I know he'll find a way
to get us out of here

582
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:39,958
because... he always knows what to do.

583
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:47,083
This is your grandma, Noa.

584
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,083
Do you like that name? Noa.

585
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:52,083
I think it's beautiful.

586
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:54,708
It means "long life." Spelled with an H.

587
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,291
But it's prettier without it.

588
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,583
In Noah's Ark, that's a story,

589
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,291
they survived and got to land.

590
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,166
There are animals in it.
I'll read it to you some day.

591
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:12,875
This is Uma.

592
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:15,916
You wanna know about her, don't you?

593
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:23,500
Well, you know,
you have the same eyes as she did.

594
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:24,583
Exactly.

595
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,958
And when she was a baby,
the shape of her face was just like yours.

596
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:30,416
She wanted to be an airplane pilot.

597
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:33,125
She liked to say "airplane pilot."

598
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:35,375
You would've had fun with her.

599
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,375
What happened is that when...

600
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,250
...when the regime took over,

601
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,875
we were forced to lock ourselves
inside the house.

602
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:50,416
And your daddy would go out
to get us food.

603
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,791
At first, it was fine,
but as time went on...

604
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:59,458
Uma wanted to go outside because...

605
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:04,416
because a girl can't stand
being locked up for too long

606
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:07,250
in her house, you know.

607
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:14,625
There wasn't enough room to play,

608
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,375
so one day,

609
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,916
she kept begging me
and insisting we go out.

610
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:25,333
And, um,

611
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:27,250
I said, "Okay."

612
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:31,291
We were only outside five minutes,
but they took her.

613
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It was all my fault.

614
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,041
I should've known better.

615
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,416
I messed up.

616
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,750
What's wrong?

617
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:12,583
What's wrong? Are you okay?

618
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,125
You're freezing.

619
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,500
There we are.

620
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,291
You're snug as a bug in a rug like that.

621
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,750
My beanie looks cute on you.

622
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:43,625
You'll feel much better tomorrow, okay?

623
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:46,000
You're all bundled up.

624
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:48,541
Warm and cozy.

625
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:07,000
Sweet pea. All right. I got you.

626
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,625
<font color="#FFFF00">DAY 12</font>

627
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,166
No, no, no.

628
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,041
<font color="#FFFF00">MAXIMUM</font>

629
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,666
Nico! Nico!

630
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,833
Oh, come on, come on, connect.
Please, come on.

631
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:11,708
Please work. Come on, connect. Connect.

632
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:14,833
Nico. Nico.

633
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,875
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Mia.</i></font>
- Can you hear me?

634
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:19,541
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Uh, yes, at last.</i></font>
- It's finally you, my love.

635
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,000
I'm so sorry I couldn't call you.

636
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:23,333
I didn't have a signal.
And my cell is broken.

637
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:25,916
No, no, I mean the screen is broken.
Where are you?

638
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,291
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Listen to me, please, my love.</i></font>
- What's wrong, Nico?

639
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,166
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I won't be able to come for you.</i></font>

640
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:33,375
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You'll have to make it on your own.</i></font>

641
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:35,625
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Promise me you will.</i></font>

642
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,250
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Promise.</i></font>

643
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,458
Nico, what's wrong?

644
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:43,625
Please, Nico. I'm scared. What's wrong?

645
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:44,750
My love, tell me.

646
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:51,583
- Nico...
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- I'm... I'm hiding in a container.</i></font>

647
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:56,541
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I snuck onto a ship, but they found me.</i></font>

648
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:59,125
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And when I ran, they shot me.</i></font>

649
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,375
Are you hurt?

650
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:05,083
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm losing so much blood.</i></font>

651
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,500
- What?
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- My love...</i></font>

652
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:12,458
- Honey?
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- I just... I just wanted to say goodbye.</i></font>

653
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:17,125
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And I want you to know that I fought hard.</i></font>

654
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:20,458
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I fought hard. As hard as I could.</i></font>

655
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:23,041
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I promise I did.</i></font>

656
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:25,750
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And... you were right.</i></font>

657
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:27,625
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You were always right.</i></font>

658
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,708
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm too optimistic.</i></font>

659
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:31,916
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We should've stayed.</i></font>

660
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:35,833
- No. No. Nico, listen to me.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- I'm sorry.</i></font>

661
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:37,196
- Listen to me, Nico.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- So sorry.</i></font>

662
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,541
Please, my love, listen to me.

663
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,750
- You saved our lives.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- How?</i></font>

664
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:44,041
- Understand?
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- How? You said "our lives"?</i></font>

665
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,833
Yes, my love, she's here.

666
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:50,750
She's here, Nico. She was born.

667
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:54,583
She's a beautiful little girl.

668
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,125
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- That's amazing.</i></font>
- Yeah.

669
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:58,375
<i><font color="#80FFFF">A girl, huh? See, I knew it.</i></font>

670
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,625
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Are you okay?</i></font>

671
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:03,875
- Yeah. We're both fine. We're both fine.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- I wish I were with you.</i></font>

672
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:07,208
You're here, Nico.
You are. You've been here the whole time.

673
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,583
You were here during my labor,

674
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:12,375
you were here
when I finally opened the container.

675
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:16,250
I promised I wouldn't give up
and I fought.

676
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:20,458
I fought so hard.
And you're here when I sing to her.

677
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:21,875
You're always here with me.

678
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:25,458
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- What? You, sing?</i></font>
- Yes.

679
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:30,458
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Sweetheart,
what does she look like?</i></font>

680
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:33,708
She looks like you.

681
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:36,875
She's so beautiful,
she's strong, and funny.

682
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:39,833
She makes me laugh,
she's caring just like you.

683
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:42,166
You know what? She's right here.

684
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,541
I'll put the phone next to her
so she can hear your voice.

685
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:48,125
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Okay.</i></font>
- Sweet pea,

686
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:49,666
your daddy wants to talk to you.

687
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,750
He's on the phone. Say something.

688
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:57,791
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hello, how's my princess? I'm your daddy.</i></font>

689
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:02,166
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm the pesky guy
who pushed your foot all the time</i></font>

690
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,166
<i><font color="#80FFFF">when you were in your mommy's tummy.</i></font>

691
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:07,708
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Okay. Now listen.</i></font>

692
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,333
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm gonna tell you a secret.</i></font>

693
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:14,958
<i><font color="#80FFFF">If you ever feel sad
and confused about life,</i></font>

694
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:19,875
<i><font color="#80FFFF">close your eyes
and sit in your mom's lap for a while.</i></font>

695
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:26,250
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You'll see that when you're in her arms,
everything's all right. Always.</i></font>

696
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:33,000
Did you hear her? She's brilliant.

697
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:35,875
Her name is Noa.

698
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:37,833
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Noa?</i></font>

699
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,250
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Are you sure?</i></font>

700
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:44,166
She looks like a Noa.

701
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:47,791
So as it turns out,
Noa was the perfect name for her.

702
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:50,791
Nico.

703
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:52,541
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Yeah?</i></font>

704
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:55,291
Nico, I love you more than yesterday.

705
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:58,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But less than tomorrow.</i></font>

715
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:15,333
It's okay. I gotcha.

716
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:27,583
Hey!

717
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:30,083
Noa!

718
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,791
That was a seagull.

719
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,500
You know what that means, honey?

720
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,875
<font color="#FFFF00">MAXIMUM</font>

721
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:07,125
Okay.

722
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:14,458
Huh?

723
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,791
No!

724
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,500
No.

725
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:57,666
You're fucking kidding.

726
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,125
What's happening?

727
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:33,083
No!

728
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:50,875
Noa!

729
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,833
Noa!

730
01:31:54,916 --> 01:31:55,958
Noa!

731
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,875
Noa!

732
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:03,750
Noa!

733
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:10,708
No. Go away!

734
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,375
Noa. Noa!

735
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:15,291
Noa!

736
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:18,333
Noa!

737
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:41,875
Noa!

738
01:32:41,958 --> 01:32:45,500
Noa! Noa! Noa!

739
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:47,666
Noa!

740
01:33:04,416 --> 01:33:06,625
Noa, I'm coming!

741
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:08,916
Noa!

742
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,583
Noa!

743
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,750
I'm here. Don't worry.

744
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:46,333
I'm here. Noa. Noa.

745
01:33:57,541 --> 01:33:58,875
Everything's fine.

746
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:33,875
Hm...

747
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:48,708
We're almost there.

748
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,375
We've almost made it. Don't give up now.

749
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:55,958
Just gotta keep going

750
01:34:56,541 --> 01:34:57,625
for a while longer.

751
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,583
Gotta hold on.

752
01:34:59,666 --> 01:35:02,208
We've gotta live to tell our story, Noa.

753
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,041
Yeah, I know. They'll think we're crazy.

754
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:09,583
But we know it's true, don't we?

755
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,000
We put up a good fight, honey.

756
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:19,500
We did everything we could, didn't we?

757
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,000
My love, you saved me.

758
01:35:28,166 --> 01:35:29,416
You saved my life.

759
01:35:34,166 --> 01:35:35,166
Forgive me.

760
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:37,208
I was so scared.

761
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,875
But you gave me strength.

762
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:46,250
And I did everything I could...

763
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:50,875
didn't I?

764
01:35:50,958 --> 01:35:52,375
I did everything I could.

765
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:57,458
I couldn't have done more.

766
01:36:02,666 --> 01:36:04,000
I did everything I could.

767
01:36:50,958 --> 01:36:53,000
- There's no fish, Dad!
- Wanna try this?

768
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:55,166
Do you wanna say something?
No, no. I'm only joking.

769
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,833
No, we only use the radio...

770
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:02,041
I told you.
I think you have to move.

771
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:18,750
Do you see those seagulls?

772
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,208
Can we go a little bit closer?

773
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:40,666
What's that?

774
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:05,625
Jesus Christ.

775
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,250
Hey.

776
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,041
Where's his family?

777
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:54,458
Come on!

778
01:40:00,833 --> 01:40:02,625
You can do it! Harder!

779
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:08,916
That's it.
That's it. Turn her over.

780
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,208
It's okay.

781
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:14,708
It's okay. It's okay.

782
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:15,791
It's okay.

783
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:18,250
It's okay.

784
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:24,833
Get her over.

785
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,875
- Come on. Sit her up against there.
- Gently. There you go.

786
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:32,291
- Okay. Just get her over here.
- Hey.

787
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:37,166
You're okay. You're okay.

788
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:42,166
My daughter? My daughter.

789
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:44,125
- She's here, she's here.
- My daughter.

790
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:46,208
Mayday, mayday. We have an emergency here.

791
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:48,208
We pulled a woman
and a child out of the water.

792
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:49,375
The woman's okay.

793
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:51,791
She has...
We've given her CPR and she's alive.

794
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:53,666
She's okay. She's not hurt.

795
01:40:58,166 --> 01:40:59,208
Hey. She's okay.

796
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,916
Yeah, yeah.
We're on our way back now.

797
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:06,375
We should be back in port
in about 20 minutes.

798
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:11,631
Your jacket's soaking wet.
Need to take it off.

799
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:13,291
No, no. Please don't. I want it on.

800
01:41:13,375 --> 01:41:14,975
- Please. Please.
- It's okay. It's okay.

801
01:41:19,375 --> 01:41:20,791
Are you hurt?

802
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,458
Do you have other children?

803
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:27,500
Were there others with you?

804
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:31,541
You're okay, you're safe. Okay?
