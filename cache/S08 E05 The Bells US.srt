1
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,397
Come in.

2
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,152
And?

3
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,865
-Nothing?
-She won't eat.

4
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,580
We'll try again at supper.

5
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,084
I think they're watching me.

6
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,339
-Who?
-Her soldiers.

7
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,551
Of course they are. That's their job.

8
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,105
What have I told you, Martha?

9
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,151
The greater the risk,
the greater the reward.

10
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,697
Go on. They'll be missing you
in the kitchen.

11
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,599
-The Northern armies?
-Just crossed the Trident.

12
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,185
They'll be at the walls
of King's Landing in two days.

13
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,732
-How is she?
-She hasn't seen anyone since we returned.

14
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,111
Hasn't left her chambers,
hasn't accepted any food.

15
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,905
She shouldn't be alone.

16
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,784
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.

17
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,035
Aren't you worried for her?

18
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,287
I am worried for all of us.

19
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,332
They say every time a Targaryen is born,

20
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,293
the gods toss a coin
and the world holds its breath.

21
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,254
We're not much for riddles where I'm from.

22
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,382
We both know what she's about to do.

23
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,307
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.

24
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,769
Men decide where power resides,
whether or not they know it.

25
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,024
What do you want?

26
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,820
All I've ever wanted.
The right ruler on the Iron Throne.

27
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,241
I still don't know
how her coin has landed.

28
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,870
But I'm quite certain about yours.

29
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,381
I don't want it. I never have.

30
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,220
I have known more kings and queens
than any man living.

31
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,058
I've heard what they say to crowds,
and seen what they do in the shadows.

32
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,186
I have furthered their designs,
however horrible.

33
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,189
But what I tell you now is true.

34
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,026
You will rule wisely and well, while she--

35
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,904
She is my queen.

36
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,885
Your Grace?

37
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,079
There's something you need to know.

38
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,749
Someone has betrayed me.

39
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,674
Yes.

40
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,096
Jon Snow.

41
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,645
Varys.

42
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,649
He knows the truth about Jon.

43
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,360
He does.

44
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,075
Because you told him.

45
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,538
You learned from Sansa.

46
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,418
And she learned from Jon,
though I begged him not to tell her.

47
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,713
As I said…

48
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,424
he betrayed me.

49
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,093
I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand.

50
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,305
I need to be aware
of any threats you're facing.

51
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,099
And Varys?

52
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,602
Your Master of Whisperers
needs to be aware too.

53
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,688
You spoke to him first.

54
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,775
Without coming to me.
Without asking my permission.

55
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,821
It was a mistake.

56
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,534
Why do you think Sansa told you?

57
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,622
-What do you think she hoped to gain?
-She trusts me.

58
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,166
Yes, she trusts you.

59
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:45,590
She trusted you to spread secrets
that could destroy your own queen.

60
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,386
And you did not let her down.

61
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,185
If I have failed you, my queen,
forgive me.

62
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,314
Our intentions were good.

63
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,819
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.

64
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,448
Varys as much as anyone.

65
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,376
But it doesn't matter now.

66
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,129
No.

67
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,590
It doesn't matter now.

68
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,712
It was me.

69
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:40,681
I hope I deserve this.
Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong.

70
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,149
Goodbye, old friend.

71
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,775
Lord Varys.

72
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,780
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,
First of My Name,

73
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,950
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons…

74
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,996
sentence you to die.

75
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,341
Dracarys.

76
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,354
This was all she brought with her
when we crossed the Narrow Sea.

77
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,524
Her only possession.

78
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,769
What did I say would happen
if you told your sister?

79
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,063
I don't want it,
and that's what I told him.

80
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,650
She betrayed your trust.

81
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,862
She killed Varys as much as I did.

82
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,448
This was a victory for her.

83
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,786
Now she knows what happens
when people hear the truth about you.

84
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,917
Far more people in Westeros
love you than love me.

85
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,756
I don't have love here.

86
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,301
I only have fear.

87
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,097
I love you.

88
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,311
And you will always be my queen.

89
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,445
Is that all I am to you?

90
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,032
Your queen?

91
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,946
All right, then.

92
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,122
Let it be fear.

93
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,171
The people who live there,
they're not your enemies.

94
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,133
They're innocents,
like the ones you liberated in Meereen.

95
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,135
In Meereen,
the slaves turned on the masters

96
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,721
and liberated the city themselves
the moment I arrived.

97
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,055
They're afraid.

98
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,392
Anyone who resists Cersei
will see his family butchered.

99
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,978
You can't expect them to be heroes.

100
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,813
-They're hostages.
-They are.

101
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,608
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?

102
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,111
What does it matter whose fault it is?

103
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,740
Thousands of children will die
if the city burns.

104
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,534
Your sister knows how to use
her enemies' weaknesses against them.

105
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,995
That's what she thinks our mercy is.

106
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,788
Weakness.

107
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,165
-I beg you, my queen--
-But she's wrong.

108
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,334
Mercy is our strength.

109
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,172
Our mercy towards future generations

110
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,799
who will never again
be held hostage by a tyrant.

111
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,931
Ready the Unsullied.

112
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,268
Tonight you sail for King's Landing
to join the Northern armies.

113
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,104
Cersei's followers will abandon her
if they know the war is lost.

114
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,272
Give them that chance.

115
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,693
If the city surrenders, they will
ring the bells and raise the gates.

116
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,571
Please, if you hear them
ringing the bells, call off the attack.

117
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,665
Wait for me outside the city.

118
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,876
You'll know when it's time.

119
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,034
Your brother was stopped
trying to get past our lines.

120
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,959
It seems he hasn't abandoned
your sister after all.

121
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,758
The next time you fail me…

122
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,970
will be the last time you fail me.

123
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,905
-Open the gate!
-Let them pass.

124
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:47,918
Through the gate.

125
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,170
-On your feet.
-Get going.

126
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,923
The rearguard should be here by daybreak.

127
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,217
She wants to attack now.

128
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,845
Daybreak at the earliest.

129
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,390
-Careful with that.
-My lord.

130
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,895
Davos.

131
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,149
I need to ask you a favor.

132
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,488
You're the greatest smuggler alive,
aren't you?

133
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,033
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

134
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,495
He's always better
when he's got some food in him.

135
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,956
Problem is when he's got drink in him.

136
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,126
-See what he did the other week?
-Aye. Fighting as well.

137
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,589
Ay up. Where you going?

138
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,509
I'm Arya Stark.

139
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,970
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

140
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,853
Think about it.
She kills Cersei, the war's over.

141
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,315
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.

142
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,155
-I need to go talk to my captain.
-Go ahead, talk to him.

143
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,660
Where's he going?

144
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,525
We speak the common tongue.

145
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,488
Good.
I want to be alone with the prisoner.

146
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,657
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.

147
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,076
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

148
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,203
Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

149
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,539
No.

150
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,501
Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen,
I outrank whomever gave your order.

151
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,961
Probably by quite a lot.

152
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,028
How did they find you?

153
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,997
Did you consider taking it off?

154
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,794
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

155
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,007
And you're going back to her,
to die with her.

156
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,969
-You've underestimated her before.
-She's going to die.

157
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,390
Unless you can convince her
to change her course of action.

158
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,101
Difficult to do from here.

159
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,110
When have I ever
been able to convince Cersei of anything?

160
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,402
Try.

161
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,030
If not for yourself, if not for her,

162
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,493
then for every one of the million people
in that city, innocent or otherwise.

163
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,578
To be honest,
I never really cared much for them.

164
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,248
Innocent or otherwise.

165
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,376
You do care for one innocent.

166
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,088
I know you do. And so does Cersei.

167
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,633
She has a reason now.

168
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,388
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

169
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,308
All the worst things she's ever done,
she's done for her children.

170
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,438
-It's not impossible that she'll win.
-She won't.

171
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,400
Her enemy's forces have been depleted,
as she said they would be.

172
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,277
Two of the three dragons are dead.

173
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,405
-She's evened the odds.
-The city will fall tomorrow.

174
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,323
She has the Lannister army,
she has the Golden Company--

175
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,492
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

176
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,911
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

177
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,872
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow,
if not before.

178
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,373
Why?

179
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:43,922
Escape.

180
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,966
The two of you, together.

181
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,843
Remember where we met,

182
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,888
where they keep the dragon skulls,
beneath the Red Keep?

183
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,724
Take her down there.

184
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,186
Keep following the stairways down,
down as far as they'll go.

185
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,229
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

186
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,315
A dinghy will be waiting for you.

187
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,901
Sail out of the bay.

188
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,737
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to Pentos.

189
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,990
Start a new life.

190
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,456
Sail right past the Iron Fleet
and into a new life?

191
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,125
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war.

192
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,794
There won't be an Iron Fleet
for much longer.

193
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:24,838
Do it.

194
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,799
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

195
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,349
Swear to me.

196
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,395
You have my word.

197
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:46,860
If it works,

198
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,240
give the order to ring all the bells
in King's Landing and open the gates.

199
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,700
That will be our signal
that the city has surrendered.

200
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,701
I'll try.

201
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,497
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

202
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,042
Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

203
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,961
Your queen will execute you for this.

204
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,631
If Daenerys can make it to the throne
without wading through a river of blood,

205
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,968
maybe she'll show mercy
to the person who made that possible.

206
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,893
Tens of thousands of innocent lives…

207
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,981
one not particularly innocent dwarf…

208
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,943
it seems like a fair trade.

209
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,663
If it weren't for you,
I never would've survived my childhood.

210
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,958
You would have.

211
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,509
You were the only one…

212
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,179
who didn't treat me like a monster.

213
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,934
You were all I had.

214
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,007
Eyes on the horizon!

215
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,636
Load the scorpion!

216
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:19,930
Scorpion free!

217
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,943
Archers, close up!

218
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,421
Archers, line up!

219
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,347
This way! Come here, now!

220
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,640
Clear the streets now!

221
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,892
-No!
-In, now.

222
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,686
And you, come on.

223
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,271
-Inside, now!
-Quickly.

224
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,316
Yes. Follow down there.
They're here. Get to the Red Keep.

225
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,277
There, there.

226
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,320
-My son!
-Get inside!

227
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,496
-Come on!
-Keep moving!

228
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,373
-Keep going!
-Keep moving!

229
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,208
-Quickly!
-All the way!

230
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,334
-Come on!
-Come on!

231
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,645
-Keep moving!
-Make way for the Golden Company!

232
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,448
Close the gate!

233
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,722
If you hear the bells ring,
they've surrendered.

234
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:09,933
Call off your men.

235
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,239
Move along now, lads.

236
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,021
-That's it.
-Go on, move it.

237
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,069
Come on, move, move. Faster, faster.
Come on, move it.

238
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,738
Keep going.

239
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,035
Move.

240
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,414
-Hold on.
-Come on, hold my hand.

241
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,541
-Get behind there.
-Close the gate!

242
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,132
-No.
-No, Mommy.

243
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,760
-Vicky! Please!
-No, please, sir!

244
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,055
-Open the gate!
-Close the gate!

245
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,389
-Open it!
-Open the gate!

246
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:36,269
-Get back.
-Look, try that one. Go. Go.

247
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,819
-The gates are locked now!
-Open!

248
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,572
Open the gate!

249
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,575
Soldier! Soldier!

250
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,994
-Open up!
-Go back to your homes!

251
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,081
-Stay back! It's closed!
-Soldier!

252
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,211
-Move away! Stop!
-Let us in!

253
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,799
You can't leave us!

254
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:15,994
Turn!

255
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,143
-Turn it around!
-Turn it around!

256
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,438
Get back! Back!

257
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,944
Fire!

258
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,635
Ready!

259
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,220
Move!

260
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,598
Fire!

261
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,687
-Reload!
-Reload!

262
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,064
Faster!

263
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,857
Hurry!

264
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,118
Fire!

265
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:00,653
Go!

266
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,825
Run!

267
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,881
Your Grace.

268
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,508
All we need is one good shot.

269
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,846
The scorpions have all been destroyed,
Your Grace.

270
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,267
The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay.

271
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,937
Euron killed one of her dragons.

272
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:39,317
-He can kill another.
-Your Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning.

273
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,611
The gates have been breached.

274
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,571
The Golden Company--

275
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,532
Our men will fight harder
than sellswords ever could.

276
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,703
They will defend their queen
to the last man.

277
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,623
-Yes, Your Grace.
-The Red Keep has never fallen.

278
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,500
It won't fall today.

279
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,532
No, no, no!

280
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,119
Move, move!

281
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,971
Run!

282
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,601
Run!

283
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,269
Come on!

284
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,031
-Ring the bells!
-Ring the bells!

285
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,742
The bells!

286
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,161
-Ring the bells!
-Ring the bells!

287
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,251
-Ring the bells!
-Ring the bells!

288
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,755
-Tell the queen to ring the bells.
-Ring the bells!

289
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,756
Ring the bell!

290
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,427
Ring the bell!

291
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,266
This way.

292
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,356
Ring the bells!

293
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,316
Ring the bells!

294
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,193
Ring them!

295
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,532
Ring the bells!

296
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,453
Ring the bells!

297
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,666
-Ring the bells!
-Help us!

298
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,459
In the name of the…

299
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,963
Please, we surrender!

300
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,472
-Ring the bells!
-Now! Come on!

301
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,147
Ring the bells!

302
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,034
Ring the bells!

303
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,805
No! Get back!

304
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,390
Get back!

305
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,560
Stay! Stay!

306
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,186
No, no, no--

307
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,155
Quickly. Quickly.

308
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,701
Stop!

309
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:33,183
-Come here!
-Get off him!

310
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,186
-Get off me! Get off, bitch!
-No, get off! Help! Help!

311
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,563
No!

312
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:08,552
Go!

313
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,096
Go!

314
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,177
Find somewhere to hide.

315
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,432
The Kingslayer.

316
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,062
We need to get the queen
out of King's Landing.

317
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,897
Listen.

318
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,359
That's the sound of a city dying.

319
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,656
-It's over.
-Well, maybe for you.

320
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,910
If you kill another king before you die...

321
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,205
they'll sing about you forever.

322
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,374
You're no king.

323
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,334
Oh, but I am.

324
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,671
And I fucked the queen.

325
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,634
If I win...

326
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:18,432
I'll bring your head to Cersei
so you can kiss her one last time.

327
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,788
Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer.

328
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,915
The Red Keep
is the safest place in the city.

329
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:09,751
The Unsullied have breached the gates
of the Red Keep.

330
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,140
Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place
to wait out the storm.

331
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:01,803
You fought well…

332
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,556
for a cripple.

333
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,560
Another king for you.

334
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:07,035
But I got you!

335
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,039
I got you!

336
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,257
I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.

337
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:45,949
Go home, girl.

338
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,245
The fire will get her,
or one of the Dothraki.

339
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,457
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.

340
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,792
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

341
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,212
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

342
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,590
I'm going to kill her.

343
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,677
You think you wanted revenge a long time?

344
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,931
I've been after it all my life.
It's all I care about.

345
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,975
And look at me. Look at me!

346
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,063
You wanna be like me?

347
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:27,074
You come with me, you die here.

348
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,464
Sandor.

349
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:50,722
Thank you.

350
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:54,870
Your Grace.

351
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,763
Hello, big brother.

352
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,147
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

353
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,660
-Ser Gregor, I command you.
-Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

354
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,720
Yeah, that's you.

355
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,849
That's what you've always been.

356
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:15,904
You're hurt.

357
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:18,990
It doesn't matter.

358
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,124
You're bleeding.

359
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,395
Alanna!

360
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,939
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?

361
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,066
Have you seen my wife?

362
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,319
-Let go.
-Have you seen my wife?

363
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,419
Out of the way!

364
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:04,906
No!

365
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,804
Take my hand. Take my hand.

366
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,140
Get up. Get up.

367
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,359
-No. No.
-Wait! Wait!

368
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,236
No!

369
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:10,865
Fucking die!

370
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,669
We need to fall back!

371
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,630
Fall back behind the wall!

372
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,134
-Fall back!
-Fall back!

373
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,510
Get out of the city!

374
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,263
Fall back!

375
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:02,602
Fall back!

376
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,312
-Fall back!
-Fall back!

377
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:01,596
You can't stay here.

378
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,098
You have to keep moving.

379
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,101
-We can't go out there.
-You have to.

380
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,896
Everyone out there is dead.

381
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,274
If you stay here, you'll die.

382
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:16,360
Follow me.

383
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:19,280
Follow me!

384
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:25,995
-Come on, quickly. Come to me.
-Lean him up there.

385
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,164
Come on, quickly. All of you.

386
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,419
Run!

387
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,259
Run!

388
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,223
Mama!

389
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,184
Mama!

390
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,102
-Mama!
-No.

391
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,396
Mama! Mama!

392
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:54,774
Mama!

393
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,406
Get up. Get up!

394
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:07,912
We have to keep moving.

395
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:10,581
Take her.

396
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,250
Take her!

397
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:14,460
-Take her.
-Come on!

398
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:16,629
Come on!

399
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:38,776
This way.

400
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,286
I want our baby to live.

401
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,541
I want our baby to live.

402
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,463
I want our baby to live.

403
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,008
Don't let me die, Jaime.

404
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:46,093
-Please don't let me die.
-It's all right.

405
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,553
-Please don't let me die.
-It's all right.

406
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,430
I don't want to die.

407
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,350
Just look… look at me.

408
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,020
-Look at me.
-Not like this.

409
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,731
-Not like this. Not like this.
-Look… look… look me in the eye.

410
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:03,027
Don't look away. Don't look--
Look at me! Just look at me.

411
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,658
Nothing else matters.

412
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:15,623
Nothing else matters. Only us.
