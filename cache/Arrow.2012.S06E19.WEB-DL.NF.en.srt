[Oliver]<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:04,921
Anatoly said that you had a plan
to take control over the city.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,048
It's like you're firing Overwatch.

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,093
I need to stop Diaz.
And in order to do that

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,012
I need to bring
the mission back to basics.

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,015
The impeachment was just the latest step.

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,683
And what's the next one?

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,936
Star City, it's open for business.

9
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,564
[bell tolling]

10
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,656
{\an8}[man] Get your ass out of bed,<i>chillón.</i>

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,410
You can look at that picture all you want.

12
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,579
Your father ain't never coming back, Diaz.

13
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,873
[footsteps approaching]

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,499
I'm getting breakfast.

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,044
When I come back, this place better
be clean for inspection.

16
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,547
No wrinkles on the bed. Seriously, or...

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,427
You get another souvenir
to help remind you.

18
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,974
If you do it again,
I'll tell Sister Heller.

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,851
You think they'll believe
someone like you, <i>chillón?</i>

20
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,355
What...

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,191
You want to take a shot at me?

22
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,778
Go ahead. I'm right here.

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,282
Give it back! That's my only one.

24
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,079
No family's gonna wanna take you in.

25
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,456
Why would they?

26
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,752
You're nothing. You're a loser.

27
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,262
I think you need that reminder now.

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,356
{\an8}You know that they invited us here, right?

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,860
Breaking and entering is a bit
disrespectful, don't you think?

30
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,403
I'm tired of waiting.

31
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,781
You're the one who wanted to tag along.

32
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,992
To see how you operate,
to see your big job.

33
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,829
So far all we've done is drive
in a car for three hours

34
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,205
and wait outside

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,916
for two more.

36
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:11,214
Patience. It's one of the most
important virtues a person can have.

37
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,465
[closes door]

38
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,093
Meaning?

39
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,472
If you think short-term,
you're gonna drift moment to moment.

40
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,685
If you want something big,
something truly remarkable,

41
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,562
you got to think long-term.

42
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,190
We've been waiting out here long-term.

43
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,153
Let me put it in perspective.

44
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,156
I've been working on something
for five years.

45
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,158
What's waiting two hours?

46
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,285
A slap in the face?

47
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,788
Small price to pay for introduction
to the Quadrant.

48
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,124
I thought they were an urban legend.

49
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,626
They're very real.

50
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,463
They control all criminal enterprises
across the entire country.

51
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,591
The four corners.

52
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,760
Yeah, "Quadrant," I get it. Very clever.

53
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,430
They didn't get that type of power
without patience.

54
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,641
Well, if they're so powerful,
then why didn't you come with any backup?

55
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,895
I'm not. I got you.

56
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,781
You're early.

57
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,120
My father couldn't make it.
You don't mind, do you?

58
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,914
Let's get started.

59
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,665
We have a lot to discuss.

60
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,250
Indeed, we do.

61
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,510
Hey, you made it.

62
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,095
Yeah. Um...

63
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,309
-I did.
-That's great. I'm glad you did.

64
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,435
Hmm.

65
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,645
What's wrong?

66
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,106
It's just been a while since
we've done any Helix Dynamics stuff.

67
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,983
Yeah, well, we've been busy.

68
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,193
We've been fighting.

69
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,821
Not you and me. Our teams, yeah,
but that's not an issue for me anymore.

70
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,741
Glad it's not for you, but you know,
Rene is still in the hospital.

71
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,451
He's only now just getting out.

72
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,246
I'm sorry. About our teams...

73
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,790
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,709
I'd really like Helix to work.

75
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,422
Looks like you're trying
to stabilize a neural interface.

76
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,050
Yeah, I mean
it's just still really twitchy. [chuckles]

77
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,511
You know,
actually I had a thought about this.

78
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,931
I think the serotonin interface is
a result of the pathogenic reaction.

79
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,518
Star City is open for business.

80
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,355
We have the police, the ports,
the whole city...

81
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,065
We got it wired.

82
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,485
Now, you wanna run merchandise,
you wanna move product,

83
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,404
launder money, anything...

84
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,657
Star City is the place.

85
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,829
{\an8}Assuming we're interested, not saying
that we are, but assuming,

86
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,748
{\an8}how much are you looking to charge?

87
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,166
{\an8}It's free.

88
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,085
{\an8}[chuckles]

89
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,046
{\an8}Nothing's ever free.

90
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,300
{\an8}I just want a seat at the table.

91
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,218
{\an8}Of the Quadrant?

92
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,469
{\an8}Mmm-hmm.

93
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,972
{\an8}That seems reasonable to me.

94
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,808
{\an8}You make the Quadrant
sound like it's a potluck.

95
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,228
{\an8}As if there's always room
at our table for anyone

96
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,981
{\an8}with something to add. [chuckles]

97
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,441
{\an8}But it's not.

98
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,694
{\an8}We're a family.

99
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:25,867
{\an8}We're not really that welcoming
to outsiders.

100
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,830
{\an8}At least, not before we know...

101
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,459
{\an8}[clears throat] ...that you can
operate at our level.

102
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,296
{\an8}I just offered you a whole city.

103
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,883
{\an8}Hell, if you can't see
the opportunity in that,

104
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,302
{\an8}why don't I talk to your father?

105
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,720
{\an8}He sent me.

106
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,100
{\an8}We're just looking
for a little something extra.

107
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,811
{\an8}Call it establishing your bona fides.

108
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,230
{\an8}What did you have in mind?

109
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,818
{\an8}This is Robert Baylor,
one of our guys. [clears throat]

110
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,361
{\an8}The FBI pinched him.

111
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,113
{\an8}-That's not ideal.
-Right?

112
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:09,243
{\an8}We need to know where
the Federal Marshals are holding Baylor

113
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,620
{\an8}so we can get him out.

114
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,830
{\an8}You want him to audition?

115
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,458
{\an8}Well, that's not a very productive
way of putting it.

116
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,002
{\an8}-[Laurel] And yet...
-It will be nothing for me.

117
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,090
{\an8}It's not a problem. Whatever it takes
to get the deal done, right?

118
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,550
{\an8}Champion mindset. [chuckles]

119
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,427
{\an8}You got a john in this place?

120
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,929
{\an8}It's right over there.

121
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,931
I'm at the location now.
Thanks for the address.

122
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,226
{\an8}I'd say I owe you one, but you owe me 20.

123
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,981
{\an8}It's Armand's contact at the FBI.

124
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,191
{\an8}Oh, so more waiting then.

125
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,360
{\an8}We have to get a picture of the guy.

126
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,863
{\an8}Proof of life.

127
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,577
{\an8}They tell you to fetch, you fetch.
So, what's next? Roll over?

128
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,580
{\an8}Oh! That's right.
You've already done that.

129
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,791
You think I'm giving in
to these people too much?

130
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,460
I don't think it, I know it.

131
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,881
It's just business.

132
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,676
You're okay with all this?
How that guy talked to you?

133
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,555
Cartier is nothing. He's a stepping stone.

134
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,642
Long-term thinking, remember?

135
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,227
Yeah, I remember.

136
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,938
How's that working out for you?

137
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,319
Smoke break.

138
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,662
Fetch, roll over, sit. Good boy.

139
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,333
You know that the Quadrant

140
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,502
is the most powerful criminal
organization on the continent?

141
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,963
When I joined up with Cayden James,
I gained a city.

142
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:32,512
When I join the Quadrant,
I'm gonna have an empire.

143
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,940
Okay. Try it.

144
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,486
-Success.
-Yes!

145
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,447
Pathogenic reaction is completely
stabilized. [laughs joyfully]

146
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,157
Yes! Damn, we make a good team!

147
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,494
-Speaking of team...
-No, don't do that.

148
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,162
Why would you do that?
We're having such a good time.

149
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,498
Earlier you said the team thing
wasn't an issue for you anymore.

150
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,292
-Did I say that?
-Yeah, you did. The question is why?

151
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,755
Oliver sort of fired me. I mean,

152
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,093
he's saying that he didn't,
but it sure feels like he did, you know.

153
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,553
Not sort of fired... He fired me.

154
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,139
Wait. I'm sorry. What happened?

155
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,976
Long story short, Oliver had a run-in
with Vertigo, the pharmaceutical,

156
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,060
not a person,

157
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,395
and he came out of it with this epiphany

158
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,856
that to stop Diaz
he has to "go back to basics."

159
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,734
-Meaning?
-Meaning he's a lone wolf.

160
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,488
-No more Team Arrow.
-So, did he also fire John?

161
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:37,034
No. Uh, John left about a week before.

162
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,037
Wow! Okay, uh, well...

163
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,623
I am going to have to try not
to take satisfaction out of that.

164
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,874
Try really hard.

165
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,502
Okay, so it was down to you and Oliver.

166
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,588
-Mmm-hmm.
-Now it's just Oliver.

167
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,089
Yep.

168
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,050
-How are you doing with all this?
-I'm fine.

169
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,094
You're not fine.

170
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,637
What?

171
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,016
So, none of your people could find him.

172
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,977
I did.

173
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,062
Hmm.

174
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,399
I'll tell him to start
carving the monument.

175
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,735
[Laurel] They brought your boy
out for a smoke.

176
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,154
Looked more like a guest than a prisoner.

177
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:17,950
Honey, ease up.
That's a 30-year-old single malt.

178
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,207
Call me "honey" again,
and I might only break your legs.

179
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,920
Mmm.

180
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,673
[glass slides]

181
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,930
[whispers] I like this one.

182
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,768
So, I held up my part of the bargain.

183
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,021
Time for you to deliver yours.

184
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:52,360
You know, your pretty little friend
makes an inconvenient point.

185
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,738
Seems that Mr. Baylor
has gotten a little chatty.

186
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,198
So what?

187
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,325
So, my father's going
to have to debrief him.

188
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,702
You know, to find out what
he told the Justice Department.

189
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,789
-You want me to...
-Fetch him?

190
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,501
What's a little favor between
future business partners?

191
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,503
So, what's next?

192
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,256
You want me to roll over,
you want me to play dead?

193
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,051
You're absolutely right. Forget I asked.

194
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,928
Thanks for tracking down Baylor for us.

195
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,429
We'll take it from here.

196
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,474
You should've asked me from the beginning.

197
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,185
Are you wasting my time?

198
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,315
I don't react well
when people waste my time.

199
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:37,405
Hey, I had no idea that Baylor would
be cooperating with the Frisbees.

200
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,906
[chuckles]

201
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm gonna deliver Baylor to you.

202
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,328
Afterwards, I meet your father.

203
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,416
You solve this little problem for us

204
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,127
and my dad will be asking
to sit down with you.

205
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,381
Call me when you've got Baylor.
I'll send over a car.

206
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,466
Hey,

207
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,717
what happened to your hand?

208
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,053
I got angry at someone.

209
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,022
The Quadrant's making you jump
through a lot of hoops.

210
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,357
I hope it's worth it.

211
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,734
Why don't I knock on the door?

212
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,614
[screeching]

213
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,451
Hello, boys.

214
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,995
[grunting]

215
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,252

[yells]

219
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,512
-Who are you?
-Doesn't matter.

220
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,846
Are you gonna kill me?

221
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,308
If you keep asking me questions.
On your feet.

222
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,310
[line ringing]

223
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,853
Send the car.

224
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,024
Move. Move!

225
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,153
[screeching]

226
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,949
Cartiers take care of their own.

227
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,326
Once you're in, you're family.

228
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,827
That's my expectation.

229
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,788
All those days, I knew they'd send for me.

230
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,499
I would never snitch.

231
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,627
Sure you wouldn't.
I wouldn't take the chance, though.

232
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,963
You're lucky you don't work for me.

233
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,388
Baylor, buddy. Feds treat you all right?

234
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,848
Whoa. I didn't say nothing.
I swear to God.

235
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,600
[laughs]

236
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,768
Tell him in person.

237
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,573
[gasps]

238
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,911
They're gone.

239
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,249
[pants]

240
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,876
That packs a punch.

241
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,628
What would you have done
if they shot you in the head?

242
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,758
I'd be dead probably.

243
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,807
Getting shot wasn't part of my plan.

244
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,809
Understatement of the year.

245
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,396
You just can't trust anyone these days.

246
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,692
Dad?

247
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,444
Is it done?

248
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,654
Baylor's off the board.

249
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,197
And Diaz?

250
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,826
Never saw it coming. [chuckles]
Idiot really thought he had a shot.

251
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,913
As if we'd share space
with a thug like him.

252
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,248
Tomorrow we'll send a crew to Star City

253
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,292
and lean on Diaz's networks.

254
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,297
And we'll make his city ours.

255
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,513
[indistinct conversation]

256
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,816
So, this whole plan of yours
has gotten a little complicated.

257
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,611
Anything worth wanting
shouldn't be simple.

258
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,613
Hmm. Not my philosophy.

259
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,076
Plans are like men. It's best
to avoid the complicated ones.

260
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,078
Aw, shucks.

261
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,122
You think I'm not complicated.

262
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,458
You do realize that

263
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,044
the guys that you wanted
to impress tonight

264
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,338
are the same guys
that just tried to kill you.

265
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,839
And I was prepared.

266
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,691
It still doesn't explain what
we're doing back here at their place

267
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,901
when we should be on our way
back to Star City.

268
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,654
Maybe that's the difference between us.

269
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,824
When you get knocked down, you give up.

270
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,494
I get up.

271
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,372
I get up. I just don't get stupid, too.

272
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,251
[clicks gun]

273
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,670
Must be nice being pretty.

274
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,966
Pout your lips, you bat your eyes,
everybody gives you what you want.

275
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,845
Everything I wanted, I had to take.

276

Bar's closed.

279
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,648
Everybody move!

[clamoring]

281
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,151
Move!

[patrons clamoring and screaming]

283
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,078
Son of a bitch.

284
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,789
In your enthusiasm to take out your man,

285
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,002
you forgot I was standing next to him

286
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,212
when you started shooting.

287
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,132
But you're sorry about that, aren't you?

288
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,092
It wasn't anything personal.

289
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,178
Bullets make things personal.

290
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,182
May I ask you something?

291
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,683
Um...

292
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,061
Did you ever have to fight for a meal?

293
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,730
[exhales] Uh...

294
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,902
Not once. Not one time.

295
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,991
Mr. Silver Spoon, I had to fight
for every scrap of food

296
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,993
I ate as a kid.

297
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,830
You don't know
what it's like to be hungry.

298
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,168
To want something so bad,

299
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,379
you'd kill for it.

300
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,547
[scoffs]

301
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
I've killed. Plenty.

302
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,719
Not for survival.

303
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,764
Not when the outcome of your life

304
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,100
hangs in the balance.

305
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,269
It's funny you should put it that way.

306
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,646
[guns cocking]

307
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,987
You really got to tell your guys,
creep a little quieter.

308
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,615
There's two to my right,

309
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,952
three more behind me.

310
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,495
[chuckles]

311
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,291
That's pretty confident
for a thug who's outnumbered.

312
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:54,216
You wouldn't think I was outnumbered
if you knew what she can do.

313
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,387
[screaming]

314
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,391
Wow. We really need to restock the fridge.

315
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,268
Do you think soda can go bad?

316
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,395
I should probably already know
the answer to that.

317
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,815
-Felicity? Hey.
-Mmm.

318
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,442
Um...

319
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,987
It's working. Remember? We high-fived.

320
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,738
Yeah, doesn't mean it can't be improved.

321
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,158
Sure, so maybe improve it tomorrow?

322
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,451
When you've had some sleep
and some food and some non-expired soda.

323
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,620
Yeah, I just want to make
a couple adjustments here.

324
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,540
Because that's easier
than talking about your husband?

325
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,209
Hey, he's going back to basics,
so, so am I.

326
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,420
You're one who described it
as "getting fired."

327
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,173
I said "kinda"
and that was just shorthand.

328
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,175
As much as I love being
a part of Team Arrow...

329
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,510
[laughing] ...as downsized
as it may have become,

330
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,555
it was taking us away from our real work.
Helix, this is where it's at.

331
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,890
And you're not worried about him?

332
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,266
No, he can take care of himself.

333
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,934
And I have been doing this
for over five years.

334
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,105
Yeah, in the bunker with computers
and body cams and GPS,

335
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,649
so you knew where he was
and what he was doing

336
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,527
and if he was okay.

337
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,448
Curtis. Yeah, I thought throwing
myself into work would work,

338
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,574
but it's not working.

339
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,658
I mean, I don't know where he is,

340
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,784
he doesn't tell me where he is anymore,

341
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,786
I need to know if he's okay.
I'm dying here.

[Diaz] You're toying with him.

350
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:35,442
Come on. What's a little fun
between future business partners?

351
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,820
Well, we wouldn't want him to think
that we're wasting his time

352
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,448
by sending him on some fool's errand.

353
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,158
Yeah, that would make anyone furious.

354
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,506
Your daddy buy you this place?

355
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,843
A not-so-shiny toy to distract you

356

while he's running the real business.

357
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,852
I never got anything from my family.

358
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,023
You know I'm an orphan?

359
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,902
It's true. I grew up
in a real-deal orphanage.

360
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,655
With nuns and...

361
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,032
And everything.

362
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,451
The full package.

363
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,088
There was this older boy.

364
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,925
His name was Jesse.

365
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,390
Jesse thought he was better than me.

366
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,059
And I believed him.

367
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,313
And I was afraid of him.

368
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,359
I'd cry every night.

369
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:05,115
For years, he treated me like a worm.

370
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,534
Like I was worthless.

371
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,121
Like I was beneath him.

372
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,417
I had to make his bed, I'd clean our room.

373
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,257
He treated me like I was his damn servant.

374

Look at me.

377
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,104
I'm nobody's servant now.

378
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,566
If you cut me, my father will
never give you what you want.

379
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,114
That's prospective, the future.

380
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,451
I'm more interested in the past.

381
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,661
Why did you try and kill him, Eric?

382
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,289
Because I could.

383
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,916
That's not good enough.

00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,003

00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,224
It was my father's idea.

387
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,227
We were gonna take Star City,

388
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,104
co-op your networks.

389
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,731
Take credit for my sweat equity?

390
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,483
That is so inconsiderate.

391
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,069
It sounds like
your precious little Quadrant

392
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,071
is a bunch of selfish jerks.

393
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,656
They didn't know.

394
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,700
We never told them about you.

395
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,327
What?

396
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,748
My father and I, we never brought
your proposal to the Quadrant.

397
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,085
You're a nobody, so...

Satisfied yet?

401
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,900
No.

402
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,196
You're alive now. You wanna stay that way?

403
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,075
Tell me when the Quadrant is meeting.

404
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,954
-Tonight.
-Well, isn't that convenient?

405
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,206
You're going to give me all the details?

406
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,084
They're not just gonna let you in.

407
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,339
I'm not planning on knocking.

408
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:35,891
Somehow we moved past complicated
and straight into crazy.

409
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,186
What I did to Cayden James,

410
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,521
you think that's crazy?

411
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,149
This is manning up.

412
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,485
"Manning up." I hate that phrase.

413
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,696
Okay, let's talk this through.

414
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,324
If the Quadrant is as powerful as you say,

415
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,743
who knows what kind of firepower
they have in there?

416
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,204
You're selling yourself short, kiddo.

417
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,748
You're better than ten men.

418
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,291
And if there's more than ten?

419
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,667
Trust me.

420
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,921
While I appreciate your self-confidence,

421
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,258
you could be overestimating
your powers of persuasion

422
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,927
by just a little bit.

423
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,180
You might not be
their favorite person in the world,

424
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,016
considering what we've just done
to the prince of hair gel.

425
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,852
I said, trust me.

426
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,689
And I would find it
a whole lot easier to do so

427
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,525
if you could just tell me
why it is so important

428
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,111
for you to be a part
of this exclusive club.

429
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,614
There are other ways
you can build your empire.

430
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,702
It's not about empire-building.
It's about respect.

431
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,205
Right, which you want.

432
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,041
And you're willing to disrespect yourself
in order to get it from them.

433
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,334
That's not how it is.

434
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,420
Really? Because that's how
it looks like it is.

435
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,924
Back at that bar,
you were talking about Jerry

436
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,008
like he's still haunting you.

437
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,846
Jesse. It's "Jesse." And he does.

438
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,477
Little bastard was right, I'm a loser.

439
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,271
Well, not anymore.

440
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:10,735
Hey, now you're a king. Forget about him.

441
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,072
I can't.

442
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:22,998
I was afraid of Jesse for so long
that all I had was my fear.

443
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,922
So I named that fear.

444
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,301
-"The Dragon."
-That's cute.

445
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,387
I've lived with the Dragon for so long,

446
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,932
that it's all I had.

447
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,856
But now being a part of the Quadrant,
I'm gonna have something else.

448
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,527
That type of power,
well, I'll never be nothing again.

449
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,033
You remind me of the guy
that brought me here.

450
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,703
To this Earth.

451
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,499
He had so much hate inside of him,

452
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,503
it took control over him.

453
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,172
I control the Dragon.

454
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,761
It doesn't control me.

455
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,026
We're here.

456
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,737
You coming or not?

457
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,421
Glad you decided to come.

458
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,384
Someone's got to make sure
you don't get yourself killed.

459
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,845
That's why I'm glad.

460
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,646
If the Quadrant's everything
you say they are,

461
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,147
they're gonna see this coming.

462
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,734
Maybe. But family can be blinding.

We got incoming.

00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,067
That sounds like a little bit more
than the 11 guys he said there were.

C-4 sends a message.

I went through a lot of trouble
to get to this meeting.

00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,003
It didn't have to be though.

476
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,881
You killed my son.

C-4 killed your son.

Do you have any idea who I am? Who we are?

Yeah.

00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,935
It's why I wanted to meet.

481
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,979
If you know who we are,
you know I'm not going to kill you

482
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,564
for what you did to my boy.

483
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,399
Well, that's a relief.

484
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,444
I'm going to send you
someplace far away from here.

485
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,446
To a hospital I own.

486
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,743
They know every way there is
to keep a man alive

487
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,204
as other men carve pieces out of him.

488
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,165
Sure.

489
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,793
Sure, you could go that way.

490
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,337
You could try.

491
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,343
But if you do, it'll cost you billions.

492
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,096
Annually.

493
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,307
Take him. But make sure he doesn't die.

494
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,934
Wait.

495
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,228
He killed my boy.

496
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,939
Frankly, I'm surprised
your idiot son made it this far.

497
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,444
Talk as if your life depended upon it.
Because it does.

498
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,700
Like I said,

499
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,538
it wasn't supposed to be this way.

500
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,042
Mr. Cartier's son

501
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,967
was supposed to arrange
this meeting without bloodshed.

502
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,638
But Cartier Sr.,
he wanted to go another way.

503
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,182
Because you're not fit to be
in the same room as us.

504
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,726
You're a street thug.

505
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,854
Not even qualified
to work on one of our crews.

506
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,898
I came to this meeting

507
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,193
because I have a business proposition.

508
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,698
You know what's happening
in Star City, right?

509
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,577
I see it's falling apart. I've seen chaos.

510
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,414
No, no, no. Controlled chaos.

511
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:00,209
What you see as dysfunction,

512
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,713
I see a machine

513
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,716
running on full efficiency.

514
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,345
I control the PD,

515
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,682
City Hall, the ports, the rails...

516
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,977
I control everything.

517
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,481
And it could all be yours. All of it.

518
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,400
In exchange for one thing.

519
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,779
One thing.

520
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,659
A seat

521
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,245
at this table.

522
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,167
I don't see an empty chair.

523
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,127
Even if there was one,

524
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,546
I would never sit beside the man
who killed my own blood.

525
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,215
He pushed me to it.

526
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,303
And he pushed and he pushed,

527
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,390
and he pushed.

528
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,227
A man's got his limitations.

529
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,896
And you are mine.

530
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,608
Look at you.

531
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,569
A street thug

532
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:14,534
who couldn't even keep himself
out of prison. You're nothing.

533
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,162
A loser.

534
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,256
[Diaz] Oh.

535
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,591
Looky here.

536
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,679
That's an empty seat.

537
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:42,979
We are successful because
we're deliberate, disciplined and precise.

538
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,399
We're not animals
killing each other for scraps.

539
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,027
We are civilized. This is not.

540
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,906
But your proposal intrigues us, Mr. Diaz.

541
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,951
We'd like to hear more.

542
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,300
[chuckles]

543
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,719
Let's get started.

544
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,899
What's wrong?

545
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,319
You got what you wanted.
You're not a loser anymore.

546
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,321
You are a legitimate crime lord.

547
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,782
And yet, you still seem on edge.

548
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,577
You think a ring and a seat
at the table changes things for me?

549
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,498
I think we ran a gauntlet
because you thought it would.

550
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,585
It's not over yet.

551
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,713
There's still one last thing
I have to care of.

552
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,221
Can I help you?

553
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,350
Oliver?

554
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,234
{\an8}<i>There are no survivors
in the explosion that consumed</i>

555
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,862
<i>a city block in the Glades
earlier this evening.</i>

556
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,614
<i>Given the power of the blast,
experts say that</i>

557
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,491
{\an8}<i>forensics may be required</i>

558
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,451
{\an8}<i>to determine the fate of the Green Arrow.</i>

559
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,495
Please. Come on.

560
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,207
-[door opens]
-[Oliver] Hey, you.

561
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,501
-Oh, my God.
-You okay?

562
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,421
Oh, my God.

563
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,757
I saw the explosion on the news

564
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,509
and you were right in the middle of it.

565
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,636
Yeah. No, I fired a grappling arrow.

566
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,890
I flew backwards,
right out of there. I'm fine.

567
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,392
-Well, I'm not.
-Okay.

568
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,227
Worrying about you out here is...

569
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,522
Well, it's completely different
from worrying about you in the bunker.

570
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,191
Right, because when you're in the bunker

571
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,901
you feel like you can make a difference.

572
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,404
I can. I can make a difference.

573
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,449
I can... I can deploy backup.

574
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,076
I can do... I don't know,
I can do something.

575
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,286
[voice breaks] Out here...

576
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,290
I'm helpless out here.

577
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,919
You aren't helpless anywhere. Ever.

578
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,253
[sobs]

579
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,048
And I'm not helpless either. All right?

580
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,386
I made a promise to that guy in there.

581
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,223
I would always come back.

582
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,018
William made an excellent point
when he said

583
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,938
you coming back is not always
going to be your decision.

584
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,023
William does make excellent points.

585
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:19,403
But I made the promise anyway.

586
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,409
I'm making the same promise to you.
Right here, and right now.

587
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,746
Felicity,

588
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,958
I will always come back.

589
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,591
[Felicity whimpers]

590
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,184
[Diaz] Let's go.

591
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,769
I've been waiting an hour.

592
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,399
[Diaz] Get up the stairs.

593
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,696
I know you hate waiting.

594
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,699
Who's this?

595
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,245
That last thing I have to take care of.

596
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,664
I've got kids.

597
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,833
They need me, please. Please.

598
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,419
Don't hurt me. Whatever you want,
I can give it to you.

599
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,922
You're lucky if you got two dimes
to rub together

600
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,549
on a good day.

601
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,803
How do you know me?

602
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,389
[softly] What?

603
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,059
What?

604
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,480
How do I know you?

605
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,447
I've known you my whole life.

606
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,449
What?

607
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,160
Laurel,

608
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,788
meet Jesse Frederico.

609
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,415
Jesse,

610
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,376
meet Laurel.

611
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,339
I don't think people are supposed
to know that Laurel's working

612
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,631
with a crime lord.

613
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,425
[exhales]

614
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,346
"Crime lord." Crime lord.

615
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,058
I love the sound of that.

616
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,021
You really don't remember me?

617
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,149
Hmm?

618
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,777
<i>Chillón.</i>

619
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,032
Diaz?

620
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,328
That is really disappointing.

621
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,541
I thought I made a bigger impression.

622
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,503
On your knees.

623
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,299
[grunts]

624
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,474
Hey, what are you doing?

625
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,769
Getting my payback.

626
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,564
[Jesse whimpers]

627
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,026
I think that this is
a little bit more than payback.

628
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,994
Hey...

629
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,414
You see that?

630
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,000
[exhales]

631
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,086
I took this from the fire.

632
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,592
I stuck my hand

633
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,053
right in.

634
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,432
I had blisters.

635
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,478
I had raw, cracked skin.

636
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,858
For weeks!

637
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,446
Hey, Jesse.

00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,282
Hey.

00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,162
You still like fire?

Ricardo.

642
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,591
I promised myself

643
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,636
when the time was right

644
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,766
that I'd get my payback...

645
