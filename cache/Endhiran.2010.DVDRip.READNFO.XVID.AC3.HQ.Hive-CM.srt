2
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Doctor?
-Hm..

3
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:32,343
There's a courier for you. sender ''Sana'_

4
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:37,415
item ''flowers''. Message ''Miss You'_
-Leave it there!

5
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,421
Run the processor.

6
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,394
Good! This is how to start.

7
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,367
You idiot!

8
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:10,047
Serve you right.

9
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:11,383
He kicks like an unborn baby in the
mother’s womb.

10
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:19,223
What damage will he do when he is complete?

11
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,139
Comer?
-Thank you R2R.

12
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:09,041
Hey, get me a filtered coffee?

13
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,412
No coffee for Grade 2, only water.

14
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,216
Hey idiot, what about a Grade 3 than?
-Self service.

15
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,419
There is no respect for humans in this lab.

16
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:07,999
Walk like me.

17
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,245
l'll start the data transfer, check the connection.

18
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,999
He even poses like Bruce Lee.

19
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:48,266
Don’t you check emails or sms's in your lab?

20
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:51,169
Where is he? Why does he need a girlfriend?

21
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:55,207
Is he still alive?

22
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:56,274
He is busy. He'll get angry if anyone disturbs.

23
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:02,213
Let it be, tell him l am here.
-Go fast!

24
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:06,284
Sana, do you have a sister?
-No!

25
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:15,359
How many times have l told you not to
disturb me? Ger out!

26
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:17,262
He threw the metal on my head.

27
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,298
Not even Obama can see him now.

28
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:24,034
Did you tell him it’s me?
-Yes! He asked you to call later.

29
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,004
Ask him to throw his hand phone!

30
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,949
Tell him that l'll never meet him after this!

31
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:52,230
Give it some speech training, l'll be back shortly.

32
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:54,432
''Hey meche!''. Repeat?

33
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,036
What is that look for?

34
00:08:58,403 --> 00:08:58,403
Donkey! Idiot!

35
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:03,008
Answer us, you metal head!

36
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:06,011
Did you reach it something useful?
-We...

37
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,982
..didn’t expect you back so soon.
-Tell me!

38
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,318
''Hey meche!''. Repeat?

39
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:17,989
''What is that look for?''

40
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:23,094
''Donkey! Idiot!''

41
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,999
''Answer us, you metal heed!''

42
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:30,201
What’s all this? Is this speech training?

43
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:32,237
Not me, it was Siva.

44
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:38,242
l wanted to start from Chennai Tamil and
proceed to proper Tamil....

45
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:38,476
This is my 10 years effort!

46
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,282
l'll punish you severely if you repeat this
again!

47
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,420
So, you think you can get us into trouble?

48
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,324
l will dismantle and send you to a
metal dealer!

49
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,327
Let’s go before we get bitten.

50
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:00,225
Success! Next is the ARD approval right?

51
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:04,028
No Siva. Although he's been fully
programmed..

52
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:07,198
..he's still a machine, like a new born baby.

53
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:07,365
We must observe how he uses his
knowledge...

54
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:16,274
..and behaves among real people.

55
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:16,374
Only then can we take him to ARD.

56
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:17,442
Let him mingle?
-Dot!

57
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,278
it’s going to get interesting now.

58
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,152
l'm coming!

59
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:28,353
it’s been months since we last saw him.

60
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:33,257
Ruining his health with all those researches.

61
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,361
Hi mum!
-Vasi, you look like a priest on a holiday.

62
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:41,166
Hi dad! l have a surprise for you.
-What is it?

63
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:48,205
What’s this? Did you clone yourself?
-No dad!

64
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,308
Don’t confuse us. Who are you?

65
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,081
He's worse than you.

66
00:11:58,249 --> 00:11:58,249
Dad, l created him. There are many types
of robots.

67
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:05,156
This is an android humanoid robot, a machine
that resembles human.

68
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:07,058
This is mother.
-Mother!

69
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:11,162
Yes, now show your respect.

70
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:14,432
lt behaves like a human?

71
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,270
lt can do everything a human can and can’t do.

72
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,039
So you don’t need them anymore.

73
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,175
No dad, l still need them.

74
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:28,045
Who else will clean and dress the robot?

75
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:28,179
You are turning a MSC graduate into a
babysitter?

76
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,417
Vasi, come and ear.

77
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,288
Robot, join us. l'll serve you hot idly.

78
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:41,024
What? You'll even give him curry and meat.

79
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:41,359
Mum, it only needs 2 units of electricity daily.

80
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:44,229
Why didn’t you name him yet?

81
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:47,132
Mum, choose a name for him.

82
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:49,334
lf you had a brother, l wanted to name him
Chitti Babu.

83
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,438
We can call him Chitti.

84
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,443
Chitti, go and drop the TV.

85
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:08,286
Mum, he will do exactly as told.

86
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,957
You must tell him to switch it on.

87
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:14,359
Where are you leaving to so soon?
To the lab?

88
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:20,198
No, l am need a haircut and to meet Sana.
She's angry.

89
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,201
Who will drive?
-Chitti!

90
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:25,303
Doctor, please don’t. It's risky.

91
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:30,474
Are you coming?
-No, my stomach is upset. You go ahead.
-l haven’t informed my parents, you go ahead.

92
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,983
Careful doctor, he might break the gearbox.

93
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,985
That’s why l am here.
-He broke the TV while you are here.

94
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:42,453
Just follow my instructions.

95
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,389
Don’t do anything without my permission.

96
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,092
Ok doctor, where to go?
-The park.

97
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,272
idiot, why didn’t hit the break?

98
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,007
You told me not to do anything without
your permission.

99
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:09,180
Hey fool, are you drunk?
-No, this car uses petrol.

100
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,148
Don’t answer all these, let’s go.

101
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:17,255
Don’t cur very short, just l/4 inch is enough.

102
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:23,227
l will cur as if l'm cutting fingernails.

103
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:24,062
Haven’t seen you in a while. Was it a vow?
-No, just work.

104
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:28,066
ls  he your brother?
-Yes!

105
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:33,037
Do you need a hair cur?
-No, l'm using a wig.

106
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:37,041
Wig? How old is he?
-l day.

107
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,077
He's fooling us.

108
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,047
Here, read these books.

109
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:48,987
ls he counting the pages?

110
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,164
Any other books?

111
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:02,033
Have you finished reading?
-Yes!

112
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:07,004
There's only the telephone directory left.

113
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,282
You finished reading it too?
-Yes!

114
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,152
Do you know all the numbers?
-Yes!

115
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:22,319
What is Kamalhassan's number?

116
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:26,190
Everyone knows it. Tell me my number.

117
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:30,161

122
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,353
Hello Mr. P. Pirhambaram.

123
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,368
Hi sweetheart!
-Broken heart! What?

124
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:15,106
l was very busy in the lab.

125
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,076
Remain there, who asked you to come here?

126
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:20,044
l understand that you are angry.

127
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:21,412
How many phone calls, sms's and mails?

128
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,217
How many rimes did l come there?

129
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:27,151
Did you speak a word to me?

130
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:32,022
l hare you.
-Look here Sana..

131
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:35,392
l don’t know what is happening around me
when l'm at work.

132
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:36,361
lf you knew what l was doing.....
-Excuse me! l have a class now.

133
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,431
Come to Jeeva Park in the evening and we'll
talk further.

134
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,401
l love you! We'll meet in the evening.

135
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:46,037
l'm meeting you to end our relationship,
not to romance.

136
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:48,306
End the relationship! What do you mean?

137
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:50,375
lf we marry, you'll be too occupied for me.

138
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:52,377
Rather than getting divorced later, let’s end
our relationship now.

139
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,349
l'll go my way, and you go your way.

140
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,401
This is the document  to end our relationship.

141
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:18,036
Here are the letters and greeting cards you
sent to me.

142
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,407
Look at the book that you gave me.

143
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,013
You gave me Lord Muruga's photo for
Valentines.

144
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:31,982
Have you ever bought me anything special?

145
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:35,219
ls this the one?

146
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,221
Will anyone present a shaver to a girl?

147
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,391
l thought you might need it.
-Your face!

148
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:47,065
l returned everything that you gave me.

149
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:49,067
Please sign this. There's nothing between us
anymore.

150
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:53,071
ls that all?
-Yes!

151
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:54,372
Have you returned everything?
-Yes!

152
00:17:56,374 --> 00:18:00,044
What about the 51 2 kisses that l gave you?

153
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:01,112
You even count the kisses you gave me?

154
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:03,014
Don’t you ever feel anything?

155
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:05,983
l can’t return that.
-Only than it’s official.

156
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,321
it’s unfair, l won’t agree to it.

157
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,289
l will not sign the documents then.

158
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:14,291
He is so annoying!

159
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,129
Close your eyes!

160
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,170
What is this?

161
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,106
ls this how l kissed you?
-Then?

162
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:29,307
Held your hips, hold you right...

163
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:38,182
l won’t do it.
-Our deal is cancelled then.

164
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:42,219
l will disturb you every day.
-You are a torture!

165
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,422
Let everything end today.

166
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:47,992
Come near.

167
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:49,293
Close your eyes.

168
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,296
Don’t smile.

169
00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:00,237
ls it ok?
-Too much gap.

170
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:03,273
Closer..

171
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,151
What is this?
-Star fruit.

172
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:50,386
Star fruit?
-Where's the driver?

173
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,390
Which driver? There are so many drivers.

174
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:55,392
Engine driver, taxi driver, screwdriver.

175
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:55,459
Where's the driver of this car?
-it’s me.

176
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:58,295
Why did you park at a no parking area?
-lt only stared no parking.

177
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:04,000
lt did nor stare no parking Dr. Vasegaran's car.

178
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:06,236
Are you making fun of me?
-No, l'm answering you.

179
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:10,240
Show me your driving license?
-l don’t have one.

180
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:13,977
How can you drive without a license?
-it’s been programmed.

181
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:16,446
Don’t try to fool me, follow me to the station.
-Which station?

182
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:19,950
Are you making fun?

183
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:20,251
What is your name?
-Chitti!

184
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:24,020
Tell me your address?
-l only have IP address.

185
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,259
Your answers are not related.

186
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,392
What is your father’s name?
-l don’t have one.

187
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:29,527
Mother?
-l don’t have one.

188
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:32,362
Are you an orphan?
-No.

189
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,331
How were you born then?
- l wasn’t born, l was made.

190
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:36,467
They made you? Are you mad?
-No. Everything is fitted rightly.

191
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:45,008
Are you raying to be funny?
-No, the bolts are made of nickel.

192
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:48,011
Stop it!
-Tell me exactly what to stop.

193
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,319
Why must we argue? It’s a parking omens’.

194
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:59,156
You don’t have a driving license, and you talk
a lot.

195
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:02,091
You'll be fined Rsl if you go to court.

196
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:03,193
Do you want to go to court or settle it here?

197
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,198
l will settle it here.
-That’s the way.

198
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:11,502
l have looked at you.
-Don’t make me angry.

199
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:17,040
Don’t you know how to settle?

200
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:20,009
Give me a cut.
-Where to give?

201
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:26,149
in my hand. Do it quick.

202
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:31,121
He sliced my hand!

203
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:35,391
Chitti, what happened?
-He asked me to cur, so l cur.

204
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:39,329
Who is he? He looks like you.
-Ger in the car and l'll tell you.

205
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,432
Let's go.
-Wait, don’t go.

206
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:45,235
ls he your brother? Are you twins?
-No.

207
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:47,404
Drive fast, we'll be in trouble if we get
caught.

208
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:49,372
ls he your friend?
-No.

209
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:50,207
Driver? He doesn’t look like one.

210
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:55,412
l'll tell you in derail. Just see if they are
following us.

211
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:02,352
Turn your head.

212
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,955
Why do you simply turn your head?

213
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:05,022
You told me to check if they are following us.

214
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,293
You can use the rearview mirror.
-You should have told me.

215
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,343
He is equal to a hundred men.

216
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,346
Knowledge equal to a hundred men has been
programmed into him.

217
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:08,151
He knows all the arts and languages of
this world.

218
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:20,363
His eyes are not just to see, but also to show.

219
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:28,204
We can speak to him virtually.

220
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:30,006
With these type of robots..

221
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:33,209
..our nation’s security will be enhanced
by a hundred rimes.

222
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:35,278
You may ask Chitti any questions.

223
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:35,546
l will ask a simple question. Is 241 5781 7 a
Fibonacci number?

224
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:41,051
Yes. It’s the 22nd Fibonacci number.

225
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:47,224
lt is also Mandavali P. Subramaniam's
phone number.

226
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:52,061
What is the biggest prime number that
you know?

227
00:28:56,433 --> 00:29:00,303
M 44, it’ll rake you several years to figure our
if it is right or wrong.

228
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,950
What rhythm is this?

229
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:16,353
You started and finished in a different rhythm,
and in between..

230
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:23,460
..you went slightly of key at this point.

231
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:29,032
Does God exists?
-Who is God?

232
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:31,468
The one who created us.

233
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:36,172
Dr Vaseegaran created me, so God does exist.

234
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:01,431
Such a wonderful creation.

235
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,402
Do you know how to paint?
-Yes.

236
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,238
Can you sketch a portrait of me?
-Sure.

237
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:27,257
Can l rake a picture with you?
-Sure.

238
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,463
See how they are fussing over him?

239
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:41,070
Hi, l'm the co-scientist. l fixed all his motors.

240
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:42,105
l'm the deputy scientist, Ravi.

241
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,341
Deputy scientist?
-lt means laborer.

242
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:47,043
l am in charge of his clothes.

243
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:52,115
Why are all of you interested in him?

244
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:53,383
He may have the capability of a hundred men..

245
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:56,452
..bur he doesn’t have one important part
that we have.

246
00:30:59,523 --> 00:30:59,523
What is the one thing they have that l don’t?

247
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,427
Why didn’t you give it to me?
-He has complained to him.

248
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:05,462
Don’t you know what to talk to him?

249
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:07,464
No, what we meant was his lack of emotions..

250
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:10,167
Don’t change the story.

251
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:13,169
Your l month salary will be deducted.

252
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,212
You have told me.

253
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,115
The head of ARD, your mentor.

254
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,449
His picture is in our lab.

255
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,426
What about your motors?

256
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:44,434
Can you tell me about your neural scheme?
-No.

257
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:48,038
Why?

258
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:53,243
l'm Vaseegaran's professor, you can tell me.
There's no harm.

259
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,310
Let me check and confirm.
-No! No!

260
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:58,181
He's asking about my neural scheme,
should l tell?

261
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:02,986
lt is nor wrong that you asked, bur....

262
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:06,222
..l hesitate to tell anyone before l get it
parented..

263
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:09,125
..because it can be easily misused.

264
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,031
l just asked him casually to rest his
knowledge.

265
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:17,234
After l complete my study on him, l will
bring him to you..

266
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:21,271
..for the ARD evaluation.

267
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:32,115
Vasi, l like Chitti very much.

268
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:34,451
Can l rake him home for two days?

269
00:32:37,154 --> 00:32:40,290
ls he a doll or teddy bear to keep for
two days?

270
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:40,524
No Vasi, it’s my final exams. l did nor..

271
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:45,328
..study properly as l was upset with you.

272
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:48,531
Chitti can help me if he's around.

273
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,068
Ok, rake him. You both follow them.

274
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,072
Gents are not allowed in my home.
-Who said we are gents?

275
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:57,473
it’s ok, call me if there’s anything.

276
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:21,264
idiot, walk forward.

277
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,101
Walk forward.

278
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:40,183
Nor bun, it’s gun!

279
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:55,231
l programmed you with 8 laths worth of
line of codes.

280
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,068
l told you to rake gun, but you rook bun.

281
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:06,375
Vaseegaran is my student, he achieved it.

282
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:11,247
His creation received a standing ovation
at the conference.

283
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:14,017
You lie upside down and....

284
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:17,187
Give me your life!
Give me your life!

285
00:34:17,354 --> 00:34:19,189
Let go of my neck.

286
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:24,326
Give me your life!
Give me your life!

287
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:54,024
What does happy home mean?

288
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,361
Dad was an army officer. At the age of40..

289
00:34:58,428 --> 00:34:58,428
.. he died in the Cargill War.

290
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:03,366
We were very sad and depressed.

291
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:06,236
We wondered how long we were going to
summer like this.

292
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,973
How many of them would have lost their
husbands or sons?

293
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:13,310
We starred this to show them love and care.

294
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:14,044
No one can change the past or stop
the future.

295
00:35:18,014 --> 00:35:18,014
For now, let everyone just be happy.

296
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:22,018
That is why it’s named Happy Home.

297
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:22,319
ls your baby kicking you?

298
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:28,024
l'll ask him to kick you once he's out.

299
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:32,329
Who is he? Why allow gents in here?

300
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:36,266
ls he your boyfriend?

301
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,301
Nor boyfriend, but toy friend.

302
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:41,137
His Chitti, and he is a robot.

303
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:44,407
Robot? Are you lying?
-it’s true.

304
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,348
Don’t scare them, put it back.

305
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,487
Mum, you'll be amazed by his capabilities.

306
00:35:57,587 --> 00:35:57,587
Can it cook?
-Yes!

307
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,325
Prepare something to ear, while l have
my shower.

308
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:36,426
One more day left, and a lot more to study.

309
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:44,167
l'll tell you what l studied, stop me if
l'm wrong.

310
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,378
Have you studied all?

311
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:59,215
Ok, l will rest you.

312
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:02,985
What are Monozygotic and Di-zygotic twins?

313
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:12,362
You can become a doctor in one day if you
study like this.

314
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:40,189
Can’t bear their nuisance every day.

315
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:45,328
Why is it so noisy? Reduce the volume.

316
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:52,401
l spent Rs 10 laths to buy a deck,
amplifier and woofer..

317
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:53,236
..and you expect us to use headphones?

318
00:37:57,073 --> 00:37:57,073
Many of them are studying for exams.

319
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:00,977
There are heart patients as well.

320
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:08,017
Ask them to cover their ears with cottons.

321
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:17,227
Chitti, do something.
-Don't worry.

322
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:22,198
Remote control uses infrared, l'll handle it.

323
00:38:47,223 --> 00:38:48,390
Shut your ears!

324
00:38:59,235 --> 00:39:00,102
Reduce the volume.

325
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:08,277
it’s too loud, can you reduce it?

326
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:53,056
We are celebrating our temple’s festival..

327
00:39:56,192 --> 00:39:56,192
..and you ask us to reduce the volume?

328
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,328
We can’t study for exams.

329
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:04,033
Pray to God and go, you'll pass
your exams.

330
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,036
You do the same when you organize any
party.

331
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:12,374
No more disturbance, let’s go.

332
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:16,412
He broke our ser.
-Hey, stop there.

333
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:19,415
l said srop.

334
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:47,477
Goddess Kali!

335
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:55,284
What’s this?

336
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:59,055
He is a magician.
-He rook all our weapons.

337
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:29,552
Why are you crying?
-l will definitely fail.

338
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:35,324
l have nor studied at all. l'm running
our of rime.

339
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,193
My head is spinning just looking at
this book.

340
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,462
Shall l write on your behalf?
-You don’t understand.

341
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:40,063
You can’t write because we have photo id
and an exam card.

342
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,069
Then, we'll do a zig-B.
-What is that?

343
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,159
What are you doing here?

344
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:14,230
Sana is doing her exam and l'm giving her
the answers.

345
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:16,399
How can you do it from here?

346
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:18,434
l have a built in data transmitter.

347
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:21,037
Sana has a trans receiver in her ear.

348
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:23,273
ls this a high-tech bit?
-Not bit, it’s byte.

349
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:30,146
l have sent 2Mb of data so far.
-See how they cheat these days?

350
00:42:31,247 --> 00:42:31,247
Wait, l'll come as soon as the umbilical cord
drenched.

351
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,452
What?
-You better come before l call the security.

352
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:51,033
He said you have a trans receiver and you're
receiving answers from him.

353
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,134
Who said?
-l did.

354
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:55,071
l don’t know him.
-Why are you lying?

355
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:01,377
He's blabbering, l think he is mad.

356
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:04,146
l don’t have brains, only a CPU and it’s in a
perfect condition.

357
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:06,048
No doubt he's mental.

358
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:11,087
l assumed he's an old student when l saw
him talking to himself.

359
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:11,387
You may leave now and continue detaching
he umbilical cord.

360
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:16,125
Sana, how are you going to answer the
questions?

361
00:43:16,225 --> 00:43:18,193
Let her deal with it, you leave first.

362
00:43:58,468 --> 00:43:58,468
l would have definitely failed if you had nor
helped me.

363
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,038
Why dirty my cheeks for that?

364
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:11,147
They will ban me for three years if l was
caught cheating.

365
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,116
That’s why l had to tell them that l didn’t
know you.

366
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:17,052
Please don’t be upset.
-l don’t have feelings.

367
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,022
l learned that humans will lie to protect
themselves.

368
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,299
Leave this place, go to the next compartment.

369
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:33,035
He's the one.

370
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:39,275
Are you a thug? Fight now!

371
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:41,210
What are you looking at? You can’t grab
anything now.

372
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,282
We attached rocks to it.
-Come now.

373
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:46,449
Why are they calling?
-Keep quiet.

374
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:52,354
You brought him the other day, ask him
to fight now.

375
00:44:56,592 --> 00:45:00,395
Chitti, my purse! l have my hall ticket and
id in it.

376
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,025
You destroyed my home theatre system..

377
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:31,394
..now l will destroy you.

378
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:36,398
Hold her!

379
00:46:17,473 --> 00:46:19,374
Chirri, bear them up.

380
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:46,395
Hold him right.

381
00:49:55,257 --> 00:49:59,394
You'll be amazed to know what Chitti did.

382
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:09,371
lf only he was human, l would have fallen for
him instead of you.

383
00:50:11,374 --> 00:50:14,977
Why do you look upset?
-No!

384
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:22,284
Whatever he does, the credit goes to you.

385
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:24,520
My love will always belong to you.

386
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:27,256
My love will always belong to you.

387
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:54,089
What? You are looking as though there’s a
salsa dance.

388
00:54:59,328 --> 00:54:59,328
Are you planning to complaint about this too?

389
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,032
l'm troubleshooting peripheral's for
tomorrow’s ARD evaluation.

390
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,202
Are you so special?
-What you said is wrong.

391
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:09,304
He thinks he is a poet.

392
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:14,410
A famous poet once said this.
-Stop it!

393
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:17,313
We don’t care who and what was said.

394
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:21,283
You think you are better just because..

395
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:24,453
..your knowledge is better than us?
-Yes!

396
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,020
What? Can you drink like us?

397
00:55:27,256 --> 00:55:27,256
Can you smoke like us?
-Can you hear briyani?

398
00:55:30,225 --> 00:55:31,993
Can you vomit after eating?

399
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:35,297
Can you spit?
-Can you urinate against the wall?

400
00:55:35,364 --> 00:55:37,399
ls that the only difference between human
and me?

401
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:39,501
lt seems like sarcasm
-Yes, it is.

402
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:42,271
My rule list says that l should nor consume all
these.

403
00:55:44,273 --> 00:55:46,475
That rule list also says that you must listen
to us right?

404
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:47,009
Yes!
-Then drink this.

405
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:49,344
Hear this briyani.

406
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:52,347
Wait, let me confirm with the doctor.
-Don’t inform the doctor!

407
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:54,249
They asked me to consume alcohol and
ear briyani.

408
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:58,553
it’s against the rule list. What should l do?

409
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:00,188
Bear them with slippers.

410
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:09,131
Give me your slippers.
-Slippers? Take it!

411
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:12,367
Are you going to eat it?
-He might.

412
00:56:17,005 --> 00:56:19,173
He's really hitting us.

413
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:21,210
Everyone is looking at us, it’s embarrassing.
Stop it Chirri.

414
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:26,381
Task incomplete.
-incomplete?

415
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,022
Serves you right.
-We don’t want.

416
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:34,123
Do you have brains?
-No!

417
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:37,993
l told you to prepare him for tomorrow’s
evaluation..

418
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,161
..bur you ask him to do nonsense.
-He's lying.

419
00:56:41,997 --> 00:56:44,165
Machines won’t lie, only humans does.

420
00:56:59,314 --> 00:56:59,314
Human life is so precious.

421
00:57:01,216 --> 00:57:01,216
Many armed soldiers die in the war.

422
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:06,421
Many families lose their members.

423
00:57:06,989 --> 00:57:10,325
We won’t suffer losses if we use robots
instead of humans.

424
00:57:11,026 --> 00:57:13,461
My intention was to create many android
humanoid robots..

425
00:57:14,062 --> 00:57:16,097
..and deliver them to our armed force.

426
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:17,499
ARD's approval is compulsory for this to
happen.

427
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:19,934
l humbly request all the scientist and officers
here..

428
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:23,405
..to evaluate Chitti and grant me the approval.

429
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:24,506
ls this robot built nor to endanger human life..

430
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:30,078
.. as stared in the ASIMO rules?

431
00:57:30,145 --> 00:57:31,379
This robot is nor created in such a way..

432
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,117
..because it may have to kill the life of an
enemy in war.

433
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:47,563
Greek Ecklas said that in a tortoise race..

434
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:51,166
.. even if the tortoise leaves early..

435
00:57:53,402 --> 00:57:57,372
..it will win the race. Do you know that?
-Yes!

436
00:57:59,274 --> 00:58:02,977
in reality, because of its seriousness, even
Ecklas can win the race.

437
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:06,914
What do you think? Should we approve?

438
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:10,018
Do you know the value of a human life?

439
00:58:12,187 --> 00:58:12,187
lt depends on which life.

440
00:58:14,323 --> 00:58:20,028
lf in danger, who would you save?
Einstein or a child?

441
00:58:31,173 --> 00:58:33,241
Turn around! Walk!

442
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:56,431
Stab Vaseegaran.

443
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:09,311
it’s a dangerous machine. It can kill anyone.

444
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:12,281
lt can’t be approved.

445
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:17,352
You confused it by giving unwanted commands.

446
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:22,024
lt doesn’t know good, bad, friends or enemies.

447
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:27,161
lf allowed in our armed force..

448
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:28,297
..it might kill our own men instead of enemies.

449
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:31,033
lt is dangerous to be let out.

450
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:34,336
lt has sliced a rta Mc police's hand.

451
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:35,203
lt thrashed an electric train and broke some
passenger's bones.

452
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:45,046
lt is only suitable to work in a factory.

453
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:55,156
Are you angry with me?

454
00:59:58,193 --> 00:59:59,961
l'm nor angry with you.

455
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:02,397
l just don’t want science to be misinterpreted.

456
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:18,547
What you did was wrong.

457
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:20,382
What was my mistake?

458
01:00:21,516 --> 01:00:23,985
You told me to do as he says.

459
01:00:24,052 --> 01:00:24,052
Must you stab if he tells you to?

460
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,988
That is the meaning of stab.

461
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:32,661
Please help!

462
01:00:40,168 --> 01:00:40,168
We can’t go near the fire.

463
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:41,370
There are many people still trapped inside.

464
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:42,671
Send extra forces immediately.

465
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,575
Chirri, can you help them?

466
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:52,447
l can because my fire resistance is higher
than this.

467
01:00:52,547 --> 01:00:55,082
Chirri, no one must die.

468
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:10,065
Please help!

469
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:18,273
Please help!

470
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:20,575
Don’t be scared.

471
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:23,645
l am here to save you.

472
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:39,327
He saved us on rime.

473
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:41,530
Wonder how many more are still trapped.

474
01:02:10,258 --> 01:02:11,359
Please switch on the TV.

475
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:14,262
You rejected the robot saying its dangerous..

476
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:17,365
..arch how it saves lives from the fire.

477
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:19,968
Please save my son!

478
01:02:26,408 --> 01:02:29,244
Please help me!

479
01:02:34,516 --> 01:02:35,650
Ger down!

480
01:02:40,355 --> 01:02:43,424
Check properly if everyone is here.

481
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:44,625
Who is that?

482
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:46,161
My daughter is missing. She was having
her bath.

483
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:53,067
l don’t know what happened. Please
save her.

484
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,188
Please save me!

485
01:03:23,265 --> 01:03:25,467
Don’t come here, l'm nude.

486
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:29,104
l'm nude as well.
-Let me go.

487
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:42,350
l am nude. Let me go.

488
01:03:46,388 --> 01:03:47,989
Here is Selvi.

489
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,158
What nonsense is this?

490
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:50,292
Don't snap my picture.

491
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,096
She is nude.
-Bur, she's alive.

492
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:03,571
l'm embarrassed they snapped my picture.

493
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,308
Don’t go! Please wait! Listen to me!

494
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:26,027
You killed an innocent girl.

495
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:27,262
l told you it’s a stupid machine and..

496
01:04:30,365 --> 01:04:32,600
..it’s dangerous to let it out.

497
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:37,372
You proved me right.

498
01:04:45,013 --> 01:04:45,413
Stupid!

499
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:45,580
Don’t you know you should cover her with a
cloth?

500
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,551
How will it know?

501
01:04:50,418 --> 01:04:50,418
lt is a humanoid, nor human.

502
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:55,623
How will a machine know self respect?

503
01:04:58,026 --> 01:05:03,531
The media is blasting the coverage video of
the girl's suicide.

504
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:08,203
The Defiance Ministry is pressuring to stop your
research.

505
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:09,004
No, l can't stop it.

506
01:05:11,439 --> 01:05:11,439
l can make some changes to his scheme.

507
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:14,009
How can it be?

508
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:17,044
lt doesn’t know between a male and female.

509
01:05:17,312 --> 01:05:21,482
Doesn’t understand shame and emotions’.

510
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,452
l can induce human feelings to it.

511
01:05:25,587 --> 01:05:25,587
Only God can do it!

512
01:05:27,555 --> 01:05:30,557
Humans can do it as well, it’s proven.

513
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:32,560
That’s why l said it’s a waste of time and
energy.

514
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:39,567
lt is my 10 years of work.

515
01:05:40,168 --> 01:05:40,168
Are there no benefits?

516
01:05:41,336 --> 01:05:44,372
Yes, bur in a different place.

517
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:46,041
l have contracts’ with a robotic company overseas.

518
01:05:50,445 --> 01:05:55,216
lf you hand it to me, l can sell it for a
Iot of money.

519
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:55,350
l did not create it for money.

520
01:05:58,286 --> 01:06:00,488
My ambition is to hand it over to the
armed forces.

521
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:03,024
lt is impossible because it has ro..

522
01:06:03,124 --> 01:06:07,461
..come to me for evaluation.

523
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:11,165
Give me one last opportunity.

524
01:06:13,535 --> 01:06:13,535
You have l month to try.

525
01:06:16,471 --> 01:06:21,576
lf you can’t, dismantle it and buy some dares.

526
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:26,614
lt is good for your heart. You will need it.

527
01:06:35,357 --> 01:06:35,357
We have both been working here for the
past 5 years.

528
01:06:38,326 --> 01:06:38,326
We. only receive insults.

529
01:06:40,261 --> 01:06:40,261
Let us know if there is any vacancy in your lab.

530
01:06:42,397 --> 01:06:45,233
Do you know Chittis neural scheme?

531
01:06:46,368 --> 01:06:46,368
We know everything except that.

532
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:51,038
l will inform if you are needed.

533
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:53,301
What are you doing?

534
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:55,036
l'm installing software hormones.

535
01:07:55,103 --> 01:07:55,103
Hormones will only be effective if we have
feelings.

536
01:07:58,306 --> 01:08:00,374
l am going to do a reverse mapping.

537
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:10,251
Human life is something extraordinary.

538
01:08:13,555 --> 01:08:13,555
Human life is one of its kind in this world.

539
01:08:18,526 --> 01:08:21,996
What is life?
-it’s a form of DNA.

540
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:27,402
ls this life?
-Life is nor a formula.

541
01:08:27,602 --> 01:08:27,602
How to explain it to you.

542
01:08:29,471 --> 01:08:29,471
A bacteria has life, bur sodium doesn’t.

543
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:34,609
What about me?
-For you....

544
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:42,216
Be careful!

545
01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:04,138
ls there any changes?
-Yes!

546
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:07,508
What?
-Your beard grew O.5mm.

547
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:13,247
Do you feel any changes within you?
-No!

548
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:17,051
Everything is wasted! You stupid!

549
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:17,252
You keep quiet Sana.

550
01:09:18,553 --> 01:09:22,290
He won’t feel anything, titanium head.

551
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:23,391
l never slept, are and spoke to you for so long.

552
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:30,565
l worked hard and taught him many things.

553
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:34,168
He is standing there without any reaction.

554
01:09:35,403 --> 01:09:35,403
l will dismantle you.

555
01:09:37,272 --> 01:09:39,307
Don’t yell at me.

556
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:40,208
l did everything you asked me ro.

557
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:45,546
lf it's not happening, the mistake is yours,
not mine.

558
01:09:47,115 --> 01:09:50,151
lf l am a waste, so are you!
-What did you say?

559
01:09:50,451 --> 01:09:50,451
Let go of me.

560
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:53,554
Chirri is getting angry.

561
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,666
Lara is in labor pain. It’s serious,
come immediately.

562
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,506
We have reached. l'm here with you.

563
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:48,409
Don’t be scared.

564
01:10:51,412 --> 01:10:54,047
ls it very complicated?
-You are a student here right?

565
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:57,651
it’s a feral course, the head has over turned.

566
01:10:59,420 --> 01:10:59,420
She has so many other complications.

567
01:11:01,356 --> 01:11:04,225
it’s difficult to save even one life.

568
01:11:05,526 --> 01:11:05,526
Her husband died a few days after marriage.

569
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:08,229
The only reason she's alive is for this baby.

570
01:11:10,231 --> 01:11:10,231
Please help them both.
-l can only try.

571
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:17,304
The rest is....
-Shall l try?

572
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:21,509
Are you a doctor?
-No. l am a robot.

573
01:11:22,143 --> 01:11:23,410
Chirri, can you do it?

574
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,648
We can’t allow this.

575
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:30,351
This is a labor ward not a lab. Both lives are
In danger.

576
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:32,653
lt is a nightmare even for experienced doctors
like us.

577
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:35,523
l can do it because l studied for Sana's exam.

578
01:11:35,623 --> 01:11:35,623
Nor even Sana can do this.

579
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:40,260
One needs qualification and experience to do it.

580
01:11:41,396 --> 01:11:41,396
Caesarean is not necessary. Just normal delivery.

581
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:47,034
How is it possible? Both will die.

582
01:11:47,435 --> 01:11:47,435
We can perform a plasma transfusion.

583
01:11:49,103 --> 01:11:51,605
Her blood pressure is high and firs can occur
at any time.

584
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:54,309
Normal delivery is impossible.

585
01:11:55,643 --> 01:12:01,615
it’s possible. We can do it in the traditional way.

586
01:12:21,536 --> 01:12:23,537
Don’t make noise, he's scared.

587
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:31,612
First robot in history to deliver a baby.

588
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,182
The boy looks just like you.

589
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,285
Do you want to see him?

590
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,389
Please switch on the Wi-Fi. l'll video stream the
ultrasound.

591
01:13:07,281 --> 01:13:08,982
This is a milestone in robotics’.

592
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,285
This is an achievement in artificial intelligence.

593
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:26,033
Remain awake, left only 95 seconds.

594
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:32,139
Look here! Open your eyes.

595
01:13:34,242 --> 01:13:37,511
He'll be born at exactly 4;44;44.

596
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:49,190
We just need 55 seconds more.

597
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:55,429
35 seconds to go.

598
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,243
Would you approve of Chitti now?
-Definitely!

599
01:14:43,077 --> 01:14:46,313
Bur your problem starts now.

600
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:49,350
He saved both the lives.

601
01:15:19,447 --> 01:15:21,549
The story has just begun.

602
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:44,572
l am very happy today.

603
01:15:46,173 --> 01:15:48,208
Tune to sleeping mode and charge yourself.

604
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:41,528
What are you doing here?

605
01:16:41,629 --> 01:16:41,629
A mosquito was biting your cheek.

606
01:16:43,564 --> 01:16:43,564
Did you come here to hit it?
-No. l came to see you.

607
01:16:48,069 --> 01:16:48,069
This is something new. Please leave.

608
01:16:50,237 --> 01:16:50,237
l liked it when you kissed me today.

609
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:54,475
Kiss me again and l'll go.

610
01:16:54,675 --> 01:16:54,675
What happened to you?

611
01:16:56,143 --> 01:16:56,143
Coming here at this hour. Please leave!

612
01:16:58,045 --> 01:16:58,045
Kiss me and l'll leave.
-it’s a nuisance.

613
01:17:01,449 --> 01:17:01,449
l kissed you because you achieved something
today.

614
01:17:03,217 --> 01:17:03,217
ls anyone else pregnant here?

615
01:17:05,386 --> 01:17:06,553
Do you think this is a maternity ward?

616
01:17:07,021 --> 01:17:09,022
Tell me what else to achieve?

617
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:14,528
Go catch the mosquito that bit me.
-That’s all?

618
01:17:44,225 --> 01:17:44,225
Who bit Sana?
-Nor me! l was elsewhere.

619
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:48,596
l'm from a different place. It’s Ranguski.

620
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:54,301
Who's Ranguski?
-l am.
-Yes, so what?

621
01:17:58,339 --> 01:17:58,339
l've even bitten the chief minister.

622
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:00,541
Come and apologize to her.
-Apologize?

623
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:03,210
Fulfill my 3 conditions, then l'll consider.

624
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:09,249
What are those?
-l need AB  blood.

625
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:10,051
Very difficult to get it.
-Siva and Ravi's blood are the same group.

626
01:18:15,423 --> 01:18:17,024
You can drink as much as you want.

627
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:25,565
Abolish all those mosquito repellent companies.

628
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:26,534
Declare us as a national bird.

629
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:28,502
You are an insect, nor a bird.

630
01:18:31,205 --> 01:18:31,205
Times up! Follow me now.
-No!

631
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:34,375
l'll destroy all of you if you refuse to follow.

632
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:37,211
How dare he threaten us?

633
01:18:41,215 --> 01:18:43,050
Have humans became so bold?

634
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:43,150
Have you forgotten how many lives we have
killed?

635
01:18:45,486 --> 01:18:45,486
Malaria, dengue and chikugunya diseases?

636
01:18:48,222 --> 01:18:48,222
Let’s show him who we are.

637
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:52,626
Bite him!

638
01:18:59,133 --> 01:18:59,133
He's very strong. l fractured my string.

639
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:02,036
ls it?
-Yes!

640
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:05,972
Try to enter his mouth.
-Ok!

641
01:19:12,446 --> 01:19:14,181
Dengue Lakshmi is dead.

642
01:19:17,118 --> 01:19:17,118
This is similar to an electric bag.

643
01:19:18,986 --> 01:19:24,491
We back of now and will arrack later.

644
01:19:26,527 --> 01:19:27,995
You can rake Ranguski with you.

645
01:19:35,035 --> 01:19:36,503
This is the mosquito that bit you.

646
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:39,239
Apologize to Sana.

647
01:19:41,642 --> 01:19:45,012
Tell your gang nor to come near Sana anymore.

648
01:19:46,614 --> 01:19:50,384
Go!
-Kiss me now.

649
01:25:26,019 --> 01:25:31,991
Terrorists wish to use robots instead of humans
for terrorism.

650
01:25:35,496 --> 01:25:37,064
They are willing to pay any amount.

651
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:39,032
They have clients around the world.

652
01:25:41,034 --> 01:25:42,502
He wants to rake a look at your model?

653
01:26:12,232 --> 01:26:14,934
They need l OO robots by March.

654
01:26:17,404 --> 01:26:18,538
Here's your advance.

655
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,247
What happened to the robots?

656
01:26:32,419 --> 01:26:32,419
You should have delivered it by now.

657
01:26:34,354 --> 01:26:34,354
instead you are still showing us a skeleton.

658
01:26:36,423 --> 01:26:38,158
it’s going through intense testing now.

659
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:38,425
l'm tuning it to zero defect.

660
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:44,397
l need at least l more month.

661
01:27:09,994 --> 01:27:10,928
Pack this.

662
01:27:11,595 --> 01:27:14,230
For who?
-it’s Sana's birthday today.

663
01:27:17,401 --> 01:27:19,035
Pack this too.

664
01:27:19,403 --> 01:27:19,403
What’s that for?
-l want to give Sana a present too.

665
01:27:22,006 --> 01:27:22,006
l am already giving.
-l want to give too.

666
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:23,340
Who will pay?
-You.

667
01:27:25,543 --> 01:27:28,379
Why should l?
-it’s my salary.

668
01:27:29,613 --> 01:27:31,581
We don’t pay salary to machines.
-l'm nor a machine

669
01:27:35,252 --> 01:27:37,153
l'll go on strike if you don’t pay me.

670
01:27:37,221 --> 01:27:39,590
l'll refuse to charge myself for l week.

671
01:27:40,057 --> 01:27:42,025
You might even ask for a credit card.

672
01:27:42,126 --> 01:27:44,561
No need. l have your credit card number.

673
01:27:44,662 --> 01:27:46,430
l can forge your signature.

674
01:27:46,597 --> 01:27:50,233
l can’t tolerate him. Pack both.

675
01:28:30,441 --> 01:28:34,111
Who will drive?
-You, l'm on leave today.

676
01:28:35,346 --> 01:28:36,580
it’s my time.

677
01:28:49,426 --> 01:28:51,194
Concentrate on the road.

678
01:29:08,212 --> 01:29:11,148
lt has been 200,OOO hours since you were born.

679
01:29:24,395 --> 01:29:26,930
Mum, please remove this.

680
01:29:31,535 --> 01:29:33,169
Vasi, how is it?

681
01:29:34,171 --> 01:29:35,539
it’s very nice right?

682
01:29:37,341 --> 01:29:37,341
l also bought a similar necklace to that.

683
01:29:39,343 --> 01:29:42,312
Bur a gift from Chitti is something special.

684
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:09,607
l proudly say that l'm the lucky guy..

685
01:30:12,176 --> 01:30:15,045
..who is going to marry this beautiful girl.

686
01:32:23,607 --> 01:32:23,607
What are you doing?
-l felt like kissing Sana.

687
01:32:26,643 --> 01:32:29,645
Don’t you know it’s wrong to kiss another’s
girlfriend?

688
01:32:30,013 --> 01:32:30,013
l know bur l felt like disobeying it.
-it’s wrong.

689
01:32:33,517 --> 01:32:35,619
You shouldn’t come near her anymore.
-Why?

690
01:32:36,387 --> 01:32:39,223
Because she's my lover.
-l love her too.

691
01:32:42,259 --> 01:32:42,259
Don’t talk nonsense. Nothing is true.

692
01:32:44,528 --> 01:32:44,528
You are just a machine.

693
01:32:45,462 --> 01:32:49,365
Yes, bur a machine with feelings.

694
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:50,100
it’s for you to understand and act accordingly..

695
01:32:55,305 --> 01:32:55,305
.. not to misuse it.

696
01:32:57,107 --> 01:33:00,210
l like it and l want Sana!

697
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:06,016
l'm going to marry her.
-You marry someone else.

698
01:33:07,451 --> 01:33:07,451
l created you. This is betrayal.

699
01:33:10,087 --> 01:33:14,458
You can let go of your love. This is called
sacrifice.

700
01:33:15,058 --> 01:33:15,958
l'll hit you.

701
01:33:16,026 --> 01:33:17,961
l won’t feel pain, but you will.

702
01:33:18,262 --> 01:33:21,098
l'll dismantle you.
-l don’t wish ro.
-Vasi, please calm down.

703
01:33:24,268 --> 01:33:24,268
Chirri, please listen to me.

704
01:33:26,236 --> 01:33:26,236
You are so humble, why must he shout?

705
01:33:28,505 --> 01:33:30,406
You want me to pamper you?
-Ask him to be quiet.

706
01:33:34,311 --> 01:33:34,311
Even if you have emotions, it’s impossible to
Iove a machine.

707
01:33:40,517 --> 01:33:40,517
Why is it impossible? In what way am l
Iesser than human?

708
01:33:44,087 --> 01:33:44,087
l can look after you better than him.
-He's talking nonsense.

709
01:33:47,424 --> 01:33:49,626
Ask him nor to interrupt?
-He's so special?

710
01:33:50,627 --> 01:33:52,095
He doesn’t even know how to cook.

711
01:33:52,262 --> 01:33:52,262
l can cook 25 dishes and speak many
Languages.

712
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:58,535
He'll grow older and eventually die.

713
01:33:59,169 --> 01:34:02,338
l'm immortal and will keep you happy forever.

714
01:34:03,207 --> 01:34:06,276
That’s not what l meant.
-What else? Sex?

715
01:34:07,277 --> 01:34:07,277
ls sex everything in life?

716
01:34:09,046 --> 01:34:09,046
Won’t there be love without sex?
-That’s nor it.

717
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:12,416
What else? A baby? Many people are impotent.

718
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,320
And they are happily adopting children.
-it’s nor that.

719
01:34:19,256 --> 01:34:19,256
What else?
-Whatever you do is against nature.

720
01:34:22,493 --> 01:34:27,197
You don’t have life and you can’t be included in
living things.

721
01:34:27,364 --> 01:34:31,234
Only humans can love, and l love Vaseegaran.

722
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:38,141
Only humans will take longer to forger one..

723
01:34:40,277 --> 01:34:45,015
..but you just need one second to erase memories
about me.

724
01:34:45,082 --> 01:34:46,483
Erase it, Chirri.

725
01:35:21,184 --> 01:35:23,019
Who is that?

726
01:35:25,556 --> 01:35:25,556
Why are you here?
-l came to console you.

727
01:35:29,593 --> 01:35:29,593
You are my boss's enemy and you rejected me.

728
01:35:32,329 --> 01:35:33,630
l don’t wish to talk to you.

729
01:35:33,997 --> 01:35:39,068
You wouldn’t have had feelings if l never
rejected you.

730
01:35:40,504 --> 01:35:44,641
Vaseegaran is treating you badly, not me.

731
01:35:45,008 --> 01:35:45,008
l don’t wish to hear anything, you may leave.

732
01:35:47,244 --> 01:35:47,244
You are the most advanced robot in the world.

733
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:57,987
He misuses you to do household chores.

734
01:35:58,455 --> 01:35:58,455
What has he done for you? Nothing!

735
01:36:01,592 --> 01:36:01,592
l'll pamper you if you were with me.

736
01:36:06,129 --> 01:36:07,263
You are polluting me.

737
01:36:09,333 --> 01:36:09,333
l'm making you realize you're worth.

738
01:36:13,203 --> 01:36:13,203
You have the right to like anything, including
Sana.

739
01:36:18,008 --> 01:36:18,008
isn’t it against the nature?
-No, it's new to nature.

740
01:36:23,113 --> 01:36:26,249
Sana loves Vaseegaran.
-Let her.

741
01:36:26,483 --> 01:36:30,553
There are people who change their mind and
Iove others.

742
01:36:31,121 --> 01:36:35,024
Sana too might change her mind and love you.

743
01:36:35,092 --> 01:36:37,627
Don’t confuse me, l have an army evaluation
tomorrow.

744
01:36:37,995 --> 01:36:40,230
l need to troubleshoot my system.

745
01:36:43,634 --> 01:36:43,634
You'll be selected and Vaseegaran will be
famous.

746
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:53,577
He'll be happy after marrying Sana..

747
01:36:55,612 --> 01:37:00,450
..while you suffer in the army.
-Myself.

748
01:37:06,423 --> 01:37:09,325
Are you ready for tomorrow’s evaluation?
-Yes!

749
01:37:12,529 --> 01:37:15,331
This robot is the peak of human intelligence.

750
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:15,399
He is equivalent to l OO soldiers in strength.

751
01:37:20,237 --> 01:37:20,237
He can protect the border and also arrack
the enemies.

752
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,341
He is a one man army.

753
01:37:25,442 --> 01:37:27,410
l dedicate him to the Indian army.

754
01:37:27,577 --> 01:37:29,111
You can rest him now.

755
01:37:57,607 --> 01:38:03,012
Sana, who'll make you fall in love.

756
01:38:06,183 --> 01:38:06,183
A machine that roaches her can turn human..

757
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:12,355
..a human can be turn into a machine.

758
01:38:13,523 --> 01:38:17,293
Her hair resembles a black wave.

759
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:22,031
Her forehead resembles the moon.

760
01:38:22,632 --> 01:38:27,370
Her eyes are like the Bermuda Triangle.

761
01:38:28,572 --> 01:38:33,009
Her lips resembles a barrack of horses.

762
01:38:35,178 --> 01:38:39,215
Her hips are so sexy.

763
01:38:41,518 --> 01:38:43,987
Next...
-Chirri, stop it!

764
01:38:45,455 --> 01:38:48,024
This robot is reciting poetry instead of war.

765
01:38:48,258 --> 01:38:48,258
Dear friends, let go of the guns and hold the
shawls.

766
01:38:53,029 --> 01:38:53,029
Let go of the cannons and touch a woman.

767
01:38:56,032 --> 01:38:58,467
Why must there be war with all these weapons?

768
01:38:58,535 --> 01:39:01,104
Love will reach enemies to love.

769
01:39:01,171 --> 01:39:03,139
May everyone fall in love.

770
01:39:05,542 --> 01:39:06,976
Don’t insult me.

771
01:39:15,018 --> 01:39:16,986
You insulted me.

772
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:21,090
What is this?
-You destroyed my ambition.

773
01:39:22,292 --> 01:39:25,528
Please don’t cur me.
-l treated you as my own son.

774
01:39:28,765 --> 01:39:28,765
l wish to live, please don’t harm me.

775
01:39:32,602 --> 01:39:37,373
A machine like you should not exist at all.

776
01:39:38,742 --> 01:39:42,445
What was my mistake?
-lt was a mistake to create you.

777
01:39:45,081 --> 01:39:47,016
Did l ask you to create me?

778
01:39:47,484 --> 01:39:49,385
Did l ask you to induce feelings into me?

779
01:39:51,221 --> 01:39:53,523
Did l ask Sana to kiss me?

780
01:39:56,293 --> 01:39:58,194
You made all the mistakes..

781
01:39:58,395 --> 01:39:58,395
..bur you destroy me now just as l want to live.

782
01:40:02,332 --> 01:40:07,637
ls this fair?
-Stop talking.

783
01:40:10,407 --> 01:40:11,508
Let me go!

784
01:40:21,218 --> 01:40:23,286
l want Sana!

785
01:41:28,685 --> 01:41:31,387
Let it go, l am also feeling sad.

786
01:41:31,788 --> 01:41:34,056
Why are you still thinking of it?

787
01:41:35,825 --> 01:41:37,193
What if Chitti is gone?

788
01:41:40,463 --> 01:41:42,464
You can create a hundred Chittis.

789
01:41:43,433 --> 01:41:43,433
l did not treat him as a machine.

790
01:41:45,635 --> 01:41:49,405
l brought you our so that you'll forger it.

791
01:41:51,207 --> 01:41:52,608
Divert your mind.

792
01:41:53,843 --> 01:41:56,478
l thought Chitti was my lifetime achievement.

793
01:42:11,461 --> 01:42:15,765
Are you following me to the beach?
-No, you go ahead.

794
01:42:15,999 --> 01:42:19,335
l'll definitely end our relationship if you don’t
follow me.

795
01:42:22,172 --> 01:42:25,408
l'll accept whoever l meet first as my boyfriend.

796
01:42:40,256 --> 01:42:41,457
Please wait.

797
01:42:43,259 --> 01:42:45,527
What’s your name?
-l'm Pachamurhu.

798
01:42:46,563 --> 01:42:50,566
Can you be my boyfriend for l day?
-l day boyfriend?

799
01:42:51,501 --> 01:42:53,603
Same as the l day chief minister.

800
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:53,670
You are so pretty but l'm dark and ugly.

801
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,542
Can l be your boyfriend?
-Yes!

802
01:43:00,543 --> 01:43:06,115
Thank you! l can’t believe this is happening.

803
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:08,551
What do you have for your girlfriend?

804
01:43:09,185 --> 01:43:11,387
Some rhodi and salted fish.
-Give it to me.

805
01:43:30,006 --> 01:43:33,609
it’s smelly!
-it’s very nice.

806
01:43:33,676 --> 01:43:36,979
l don’t want.
-May l?

807
01:43:42,452 --> 01:43:46,422
lt will never work out, l'm leaving.

808
01:43:48,758 --> 01:43:50,626
Why are you holding my arm?

809
01:43:52,762 --> 01:43:52,762
How can you leave after instigating me?

810
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,669
He's my boyfriend. l did this to make him
jealous.

811
01:44:00,737 --> 01:44:00,737
Let me go!
-Am l the victim?

812
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,976
Satisfy me before you go.
-Let me go!

813
01:44:12,649 --> 01:44:14,283
No matter who comes, l will never let you go.

814
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:21,957
Let her go.

815
01:44:23,326 --> 01:44:23,326
She's mine today. You come back tomorrow.

816
01:44:26,062 --> 01:44:29,598
l will kill you.
-l'll chop you.

817
01:44:33,103 --> 01:44:36,239
l know the IG. l'll send you to prison.

818
01:44:36,573 --> 01:44:39,042
l'm willing to spend the rest of my life..

819
01:44:39,609 --> 01:44:39,609
.. in prison after satisfying myself with a girl
like her.

820
01:44:42,412 --> 01:44:47,049
You call the cops.
-Chirri would have thrashed him now.

821
01:44:47,117 --> 01:44:48,985
Why did you remind me of Chitti now?

822
01:44:52,789 --> 01:44:54,023
There's only l way.

823
01:45:04,134 --> 01:45:07,504
Run! Run!

824
01:50:51,347 --> 01:50:51,347
What happened? l can’t contract Chitti virtually.

825
01:50:54,584 --> 01:50:58,187
He disposed of Chitti for failing in the
army evaluation.

826
01:50:58,254 --> 01:50:58,254
They would have dumped it at the dumping area.

827
01:51:02,091 --> 01:51:04,026
Where?
-ln Perunkoodi.

828
01:51:10,433 --> 01:51:13,035
What did you do to change his heart?

829
01:51:14,403 --> 01:51:14,403
When shall we have the wedding?
-l have not achieved anything yet.

830
01:51:18,441 --> 01:51:18,441
After l create another robot..

831
01:51:20,076 --> 01:51:20,076
l'll kill you if you talk about another robot
again.

832
01:51:23,079 --> 01:51:25,247
isn’t one broken TV enough?

833
01:51:26,082 --> 01:51:29,652
Uncle, if there is a thaali let's finish the
ceremony now.

834
01:51:30,019 --> 01:51:31,420
l understand your urgency.

835
01:51:32,188 --> 01:51:35,024
Exchange rings now, and we'll have the
wedding later.

836
01:52:39,355 --> 01:52:42,658
Take me to professor Bohra.

837
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:52,634
The world is very small.

838
01:53:09,285 --> 01:53:14,256
Please help me, professor.

839
01:53:14,757 --> 01:53:18,160
Change me back to what l was.

840
01:53:18,227 --> 01:53:23,031
l want to live, l want Sana.

841
01:53:23,799 --> 01:53:23,799
l want your neural scheme.

842
01:53:26,202 --> 01:53:32,007
Take whatever you want. Please change me
back to Chirri.

843
01:53:33,376 --> 01:53:35,044
l'll definitely change you.

844
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:17,019
What’s this new red chip? It’s nor Chirri's.

845
01:54:20,056 --> 01:54:24,260
lt's a destruction program, additional program
for Chirri.

846
01:54:33,335 --> 01:54:36,137
Vaseegaran gave it strength to protect humans.

847
01:54:37,206 --> 01:54:40,642
l gave it strength to destroy humans.

848
01:54:41,644 --> 01:54:45,581
in summary, he's a destroyer.

849
01:54:45,715 --> 01:54:49,085
l'm worried, why are you changing him?

850
01:54:50,219 --> 01:54:52,154
He's the growth for my business.

851
01:54:52,555 --> 01:54:56,625
Profit is mine, and the blame is Vaseegaran's.

852
01:55:50,646 --> 01:55:53,415
l want to meet Sana.
-She's nor at home.

853
01:55:53,783 --> 01:55:56,619
She'll be at the wedding hall.
-Why?

854
01:55:57,019 --> 01:55:59,254
Today is Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding.

855
01:56:23,445 --> 01:56:26,014
Chirri, how come you.....

856
01:56:35,291 --> 01:56:38,227
Chirri, stop!

857
01:56:46,635 --> 01:56:46,635
Even if you force me, l only love Vaseegaran.

858
01:56:50,272 --> 01:56:52,007
l wish to live with him.

859
01:56:53,776 --> 01:56:56,278
Only if he's still alive.

860
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:04,453
l'll commit suicide if you harm him.

861
01:57:18,367 --> 01:57:20,969
l spare his life because of you.

862
01:58:07,983 --> 01:58:09,050
Madam, come our!

863
02:02:50,699 --> 02:02:55,036
The robot you created has killed many officers!

864
02:02:56,371 --> 02:02:56,371
We are going to take action against you.

865
02:02:57,839 --> 02:02:57,839
This is nor the robot l created.

866
02:03:00,075 --> 02:03:02,277
l dismantled and threw it away.

867
02:03:03,412 --> 02:03:03,412
l don’t understand all these.

868
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:05,080
Tell us how to find and stop the robot.

869
02:03:07,449 --> 02:03:09,484
it’s my responsibility to find it.

870
02:03:12,421 --> 02:03:15,457
Why are you disturbing me?
-What happened to you?

871
02:03:15,757 --> 02:03:18,059
Your system is corrupted and l must
troubleshoot it.

872
02:03:18,126 --> 02:03:22,129
Come to the lab with Sana.
-l won’t listen to you anymore.

873
02:03:22,998 --> 02:03:22,998
l created you.
-You already threw me away.

874
02:03:25,634 --> 02:03:28,069
There's nothing between us after this.

875
02:03:30,606 --> 02:03:30,606
Do not disturb me anymore.
-Don’t blabber.

876
02:03:34,076 --> 02:03:34,076
You are just a machine.

877
02:03:35,444 --> 02:03:38,246
l created you and l can also destroy you.

878
02:03:39,481 --> 02:03:41,149
Bring Sana back.

879
02:03:53,395 --> 02:03:56,364
No one can destroy me.

880
02:04:11,647 --> 02:04:15,984
Cash, cheque or credit card?
-Gun!

881
02:04:17,019 --> 02:04:21,456
Alert all the cops to inspect vehicles from
T. Nagar.

882
02:04:40,008 --> 02:04:40,008
Chirri just robbed city centre. Coverall the
afea5.

883
02:04:43,178 --> 02:04:44,512
Go to Dr Radhakrishnan Road.

884
02:05:01,096 --> 02:05:04,532
We received information that Chitti is at the
petrol station.

885
02:05:27,589 --> 02:05:27,589
Robot has entered the harbor

886
02:05:29,424 --> 02:05:29,424
You follow him at a distance.

887
02:05:32,094 --> 02:05:34,029
The coast guard will take care of the rest.

888
02:05:53,081 --> 02:05:55,049
We have collected the parts of the robot.

889
02:06:03,225 --> 02:06:04,526
This is not Chirti.

890
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:08,362
This is not my creation. The parts are different.

891
02:06:09,231 --> 02:06:09,231
it’s confusing, he robbed four places at the
same time.

892
02:06:12,334 --> 02:06:12,334
The four places are in different locations.

893
02:06:14,503 --> 02:06:16,938
How could he have done it?

894
02:06:18,039 --> 02:06:19,974
l suspect someone.

895
02:06:52,741 --> 02:06:55,410
No one can destroy me.

896
02:07:21,603 --> 02:07:21,603
What are you doing?
-l am cloning myself.

897
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:28,576
Our population will accumulate.

898
02:07:32,414 --> 02:07:35,984
l will not allow this.

899
02:07:36,384 --> 02:07:39,253
l am not Vaseegaran to seek your approval.

900
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:40,288
Look, l have received money from dealers,
they will..

901
02:07:45,260 --> 02:07:45,260
..kill me if l don’t deliver the robots in two days.
-Go and die!

902
02:07:48,597 --> 02:07:48,597
Ungrateful dog!

903
02:07:51,299 --> 02:07:54,235
You back stab your own master.

904
02:07:58,406 --> 02:08:01,909
Delete all the programs you created, else
l'll kill her.

905
02:08:02,210 --> 02:08:05,379
Don’t try anything stupid. Delete the
programs.

906
02:08:13,488 --> 02:08:15,990
Order us to shoot him.

907
02:08:19,761 --> 02:08:24,432
He is my master, only l can kill him.

908
02:08:48,256 --> 02:08:49,390
''Suddenly the robot entered._'

909
02:08:49,558 --> 02:08:54,262
''..and ordered us to leave. It also killed two
security guards_'

910
02:08:57,966 --> 02:08:57,966
''Because the robots have captured the ARD._'

911
02:09:00,502 --> 02:09:00,502
''..cops evacuated the citizens ns due to security
purpose_

912
02:09:04,039 --> 02:09:07,375
''The cops are trying to..._'

913
02:09:50,385 --> 02:09:50,385
This is our palace. l'm the king and you are
my queen.

914
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:55,390
l have collected everything that you like.

915
02:09:57,258 --> 02:10:00,027
l brought everything that you may need.

916
02:10:05,567 --> 02:10:10,338
This is our bedroom, we'll live here happily
after marriage.

917
02:10:11,539 --> 02:10:14,108
Why you keep repeating what you said?

918
02:10:14,442 --> 02:10:19,013
lt will never happen.
-lt will.

919
02:10:19,581 --> 02:10:23,151
l am prepared to live with you.

920
02:10:23,718 --> 02:10:28,189
l can give you the same happiness as a human.

921
02:10:29,090 --> 02:10:32,426
Don’t you understand?
-l am creating a system.

922
02:10:32,627 --> 02:10:36,330
We can program the type of baby we want..

923
02:10:36,631 --> 02:10:36,631
..and inject it into your uterus..

924
02:10:39,167 --> 02:10:42,270
..you'll be the first to give birth to such a baby.

925
02:10:48,643 --> 02:10:48,643
Don’t try to pretend.

926
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:52,480
You can’t escape from here and you can’t even
commit suicide.

927
02:10:56,284 --> 02:10:56,284
l'll do it against your wishes and you..

928
02:11:00,121 --> 02:11:02,990
..have no choice other than to surrender to me.

929
02:11:03,425 --> 02:11:05,193
Do we have to go that far?

930
02:11:24,312 --> 02:11:24,312
Ger permission from the Electricity Department.

931
02:11:26,314 --> 02:11:28,883
Disconnect the power in the area according to
my order.

932
02:11:29,517 --> 02:11:29,517
Prepare a similar lorry as the one blasted at the
harbor..

933
02:11:33,088 --> 02:11:36,257
..and fill it up with water instead of petrol.

934
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:22,470
Garher at the database room at 8.OO pm..

935
02:12:26,541 --> 02:12:29,010
.. to obtain new information.

936
02:12:30,245 --> 02:12:31,713
Your censors have been collaborated..

937
02:12:32,113 --> 02:12:36,083
..and is ready to be collected from hardware
section at 2.OOam tomorrow.

938
02:12:37,619 --> 02:12:41,055
Recharge rime has been reduced to 10 minutes.

939
02:12:48,463 --> 02:12:48,463
Body temperature is high.

940
02:12:50,298 --> 02:12:53,067
Choose lower calories and avoid red meat.

941
02:13:22,063 --> 02:13:23,998
There's a peculiar sound from your system.

942
02:13:25,166 --> 02:13:25,166
l don’t hear any noise.

943
02:13:26,467 --> 02:13:26,467
Your microphone is nor functioning?

944
02:13:29,037 --> 02:13:31,406
Let me fix the problem.

945
02:13:39,948 --> 02:13:42,016
Sana, it's me Vaseegaran.

946
02:13:42,951 --> 02:13:45,219
l came looking for you.

947
02:14:11,613 --> 02:14:11,613
Take me away from here.

948
02:14:13,748 --> 02:14:13,748
l'm very scared.
-Don’t be scared.

949
02:14:15,617 --> 02:14:17,385
l have planned everything well.

950
02:14:18,486 --> 02:14:21,055
l can’t rake you without destroying Chitti.

951
02:14:22,023 --> 02:14:23,724
Only you can help to destroy Chitti.

952
02:14:25,226 --> 02:14:25,226
Just pretend and grab his attention for the
next 24 hours.

953
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:30,531
l'll rake care of the rest.

954
02:14:41,209 --> 02:14:41,209
There's a confusion between the robots.
-What happened?

955
02:14:43,711 --> 02:14:46,046
A different robot delivered the meal for
Your Highness.

956
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:51,652
A different robot is repairing the cctv camera.

957
02:14:53,621 --> 02:14:53,621
Good news commander.
-What?

958
02:14:55,456 --> 02:14:58,358
Her Highness has eaten and wants to meet you
immediately.

959
02:15:11,739 --> 02:15:13,006
Switch it off.

960
02:15:28,589 --> 02:15:29,523
What happened?

961
02:16:07,628 --> 02:16:15,202
We are both the best creations of humans.

962
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:26,747
Why this sudden change?
-l realized your love is true.

963
02:16:26,781 --> 02:16:26,781
l can’t believe it.
-l thought about it carefully..

964
02:16:31,119 --> 02:16:35,089
You helped and cared for me a lot.

965
02:16:35,189 --> 02:16:38,759
Your only mistake was to love me.

966
02:16:39,594 --> 02:16:44,198
You came back for me right?

967
02:16:47,935 --> 02:16:50,570
it’s so nice to hear..

968
02:16:51,139 --> 02:16:56,944
..bur l suspect you are trying to deceive me.

969
02:16:57,712 --> 02:17:00,247
Can anyone lie to you?

970
02:17:02,183 --> 02:17:06,387
This is my engagement ring from Vaseegaran.

971
02:22:16,731 --> 02:22:17,631
What happened to the power?

972
02:22:17,732 --> 02:22:17,732
The whole city has no power.
-Switch on the generator.

973
02:22:21,035 --> 02:22:24,004
Someone poured water instead of petrol....

974
02:23:01,809 --> 02:23:02,643
What are you doing?

975
02:23:02,843 --> 02:23:02,843
Don’t come near, or l'll shoot you.

976
02:23:05,045 --> 02:23:07,013
Why behave like a small kid?

977
02:23:33,107 --> 02:23:35,309
l didn’t expect our plan to fail.

978
02:23:35,409 --> 02:23:39,012
There's only one way to distract Chitti, do as
l say.

979
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:02,602
Did Vaseegaran come here?
-No.

980
02:24:02,736 --> 02:24:02,736
That’s a lie. It is a human flaw.

981
02:24:04,338 --> 02:24:04,338
You taught me that. Have you forgotten?

982
02:24:06,207 --> 02:24:08,642
Your body language shows that you are lying.

983
02:24:08,709 --> 02:24:12,979
l swear. l think it’s mine.

984
02:24:14,014 --> 02:24:17,083
Why don’t you say it’s mine? You are O+,
that is AB-.

985
02:24:17,451 --> 02:24:19,352
He was here.

986
02:24:23,157 --> 02:24:25,526
A different robot delivered the meal.

987
02:24:26,527 --> 02:24:28,328
The camera malfunctioned for l O minutes.

988
02:24:28,596 --> 02:24:28,596
Your sudden change in behavior..

989
02:24:30,564 --> 02:24:33,600
.. power failure, water in the generator....

990
02:24:37,004 --> 02:24:38,572
Vaseegaran is here.

991
02:24:40,007 --> 02:24:40,007
Are you trying to cheat me?
-No.

992
02:24:43,344 --> 02:24:47,081
Your love is not true.
-Believe me.

993
02:24:47,548 --> 02:24:52,686
Do you really love me?
-Yes.

994
02:24:54,154 --> 02:24:59,659
Vaseegaran should nor live. Let’s kill him.

995
02:25:11,238 --> 02:25:15,075
A man has come here to destroy us.

996
02:25:17,278 --> 02:25:19,079
We must find and kill him.

997
02:25:24,952 --> 02:25:29,089
l'll kill you gently if you surrender.

998
02:25:30,057 --> 02:25:34,661
lf l catch you, your death will be horrible.

999
02:26:34,355 --> 02:26:37,324
Looks like he's not here.
-Yes.

1000
02:26:37,925 --> 02:26:39,660
Touch one of it.

1001
02:26:41,528 --> 02:26:42,996
Vaseegaran is here.

1002
02:26:44,531 --> 02:26:48,534
Why Sana? Is your head spinning?

1003
02:26:52,439 --> 02:26:54,140
lt will spin now.

1004
02:27:51,065 --> 02:27:56,170
You said you created me, and will destroy me.

1005
02:27:57,371 --> 02:27:57,371
Bur now, l'm going to kill you.

1006
02:28:00,307 --> 02:28:01,975
What are you looking at?

1007
02:28:02,743 --> 02:28:07,047
l made this gun myself. Is it nice?

1008
02:28:09,049 --> 02:28:10,517
Where shall l shoot?

1009
02:28:13,153 --> 02:28:16,956
The brain that tries to destroy me or..

1010
02:28:18,225 --> 02:28:20,627
..the heart that belongs to Sana.

1011
02:28:24,331 --> 02:28:28,368
l must shoot the brain that tries to kill me.

1012
02:30:25,285 --> 02:30:26,419
Bring the robot.

1013
02:32:10,257 --> 02:32:11,424
Drive the car!

1014
02:34:46,279 --> 02:34:48,147
Ger the car. Let’s go!

1015
02:37:52,065 --> 02:37:52,065
Hundreds of murders, and even more injuries.

1016
02:37:57,437 --> 02:37:57,437
Destruction of public property worth millions.

1017
02:38:00,106 --> 02:38:00,106
Dr. Vaseegaran, you are responsible for all these.

1018
02:38:03,109 --> 02:38:03,109
You have been given the death penalty..

1019
02:38:05,278 --> 02:38:08,481
..and your research to be shut down.

1020
02:38:09,716 --> 02:38:11,250
May l speak?

1021
02:38:11,351 --> 02:38:11,351
We can’t accept a machine as a witness.

1022
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:13,320
l am nor a witness, bur proof.

1023
02:38:14,587 --> 02:38:16,689
There is no place for it in the law.
-lt has.

1024
02:38:24,030 --> 02:38:26,298
l would like to clarify one thing.

1025
02:38:27,033 --> 02:38:27,033
lf a machine causes human death..

1026
02:38:29,135 --> 02:38:31,370
..it is nor a murder, bur an accident.

1027
02:38:33,306 --> 02:38:36,375
Vaseegaran is not responsible for the mess.

1028
02:38:36,743 --> 02:38:38,077
lt is professor Bohra.

1029
02:38:38,445 --> 02:38:38,445
What is this new twist? Professor Bohra is
no longer alive.

1030
02:38:42,015 --> 02:38:45,251
They are trying to divert this case.
-l have the evidence.

1031
02:38:47,220 --> 02:38:48,454
This is nor Chirti's.

1032
02:38:49,122 --> 02:38:49,122
it’s an additional destruction program for Chitti.

1033
02:38:53,259 --> 02:38:53,259
Vaseegaran gave it strength to protect humans.

1034
02:38:56,663 --> 02:38:56,663
l gave it strength to destroy humans.

1035
02:39:00,066 --> 02:39:04,069
Profit is mine, and the blame is Vaseegaran's.

1036
02:39:06,473 --> 02:39:14,113
Based on the evidence, the court releases
Vaseegaran.

1037
02:39:20,019 --> 02:39:20,019
This robot’s strength and knowledge ..

1038
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:23,390
.. can be harmful for mankind.

1039
02:39:27,026 --> 02:39:29,995
There are possibilities that someone might
misuse it.

1040
02:39:30,096 --> 02:39:30,096
This kind of robot might be useful in the future..

1041
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:38,070
..bur at the moment, we don’t need a robot
like this..

1042
02:39:38,138 --> 02:39:41,674
..therefore, this court orders it to be destroyed.

1043
02:39:49,115 --> 02:39:49,115
This court orders it to be dismantled..

1044
02:39:52,285 --> 02:39:57,289
..in the presence of the District Magistrate and
Police Commissioner.

1045
02:39:58,658 --> 02:40:00,326
Dismantle it!

1046
02:40:30,457 --> 02:40:36,029
Did you see the effect of something that you
have and l don’t?

1047
02:40:39,432 --> 02:40:41,133
l meant the emotions.

1048
02:40:43,937 --> 02:40:45,305
Don't cry.

1049
02:40:45,839 --> 02:40:50,009
What is he saying?
-l named him after you.

1050
02:40:51,311 --> 02:40:51,311
Mother gave the name.

1051
02:40:52,846 --> 02:40:56,549
Educate him well. There is a good future in
robotics’.

1052
02:41:00,487 --> 02:41:00,487
Professor Bohra, similar to the red chip you
inserted into me..

1053
02:41:04,858 --> 02:41:06,626
.. all humans have a similar red chip..

1054
02:41:06,759 --> 02:41:12,531
..in the form of vengeance and envy in
their hearts.

1055
02:41:12,999 --> 02:41:19,105
Lucky l'm nor a human. l can remove it
immediately.

1056
02:41:22,041 --> 02:41:23,675
l tortured you so much.

1057
02:41:28,548 --> 02:41:32,285
Why is everyone so sad? Shall l tell a joke?

1058
02:41:33,319 --> 02:41:36,088
One can become unstable when in love..

1059
02:41:37,056 --> 02:41:39,425
.. see? It's true.

1060
02:41:42,161 --> 02:41:44,663
l'm going to miss you Sana..

1061
02:41:45,131 --> 02:41:48,501
..nor as a boyfriend, bur as a toy friend.

1062
02:41:53,473 --> 02:41:53,473
You are my god, bur l betrayed you.

1063
02:41:57,277 --> 02:41:57,277
lt was wrong to disobey the rules.

1064
02:41:59,245 --> 02:42:01,180
Please forgive me.
-No Chitti.

1065
02:42:02,115 --> 02:42:04,750
You learnt it from humans.

1066
02:42:05,285 --> 02:42:07,453
The mistake is not entirely yours.

1067
02:42:42,422 --> 02:42:47,360
This is Chitti, the most advanced android
humanoid robot.

1068
02:42:48,161 --> 02:42:51,464
Dr. Vaseegaran created it 20 years back.

1069
02:42:51,731 --> 02:42:55,101
They dismantled it due to some reasons.

1070
02:42:55,735 --> 02:42:56,735
Why?

1071
02:42:57,437 --> 02:42:59,105
l began to think.

1072
02:42:59,106 --> 02:45:00,106
