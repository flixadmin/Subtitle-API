1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:04,023
My name is Barry Allen, and
I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:07,053
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:09,117
But secretly, with
the help of my friends

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,135
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:12,991
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:15,257
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,696
she changed the present.

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,299
And now our world is
more dangerous than ever,

9
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:22,735
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

10
00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:25,367
I am The Flash.

11
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:27,887
Previously on "The Flash"...

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,707
- Who's Cicada?
- You'll never catch him.

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,023
This is Sherloque.

14
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:33,895
He's the greatest detective
in all the multiverse.

15
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:35,314
I'm a detective as well.

16
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:36,636
I'm here to catch your killer.

17
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,050
So we're dealing with a
meta-human Jack the Ripper.

18
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:41,416
In my history, he never
killed Gridlock or Block.

19
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:43,148
They're completely different victims.

20
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:45,531
- He's early.
- Because the timeline changed.

21
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:47,126
Because of me.

22
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:03,211
Guys, this is mad crazy!

23
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:06,812
There are, like, fireballs in the sky!

24
00:01:06,814 --> 00:01:09,548
Holy...

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,551
I'm gonna get a better look.

26
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:19,658
There he is! This is gonna be lit.

27
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,894
Wait, there's two of them?

28
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:24,397
Oh, my God, guys. What was that?

29
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:26,465
This is cray! What
is going on right now?

30
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,801
Is the world, like, ending right now?

31
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:31,229
Oh, my phone.

32
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,882
You just saved my life.

33
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:36,574
You are the second speedster

34
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:38,331
who just, like, saved the world.

35
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:42,316
Can I just get a... Can I just get a...

36
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,183
selfie.

37
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:49,589
What the...

38
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:52,758
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

39
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:23,886
Oh.

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,366
Uh...

41
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:33,394
Sorry.

42
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:36,021
- What are you doing?
- Uh, nothing. Go back to bed.

43
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:37,818
I'm just making some breakfast.

44
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:38,964
Like I could go to sleep

45
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:42,769
after the smell of Jitters coffee.

46
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:47,289
So, uh, I see you still know
your way around the kitchen.

47
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,649
What's happening?

48
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,300
- Uh, hey, babe.
- Good morning.

49
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,347
Um, I, um, was thinking

50
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,490
that we could have breakfast together.

51
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:59,425
Right? Like a family.

52
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:01,327
- I love it.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,262
Do you... Hi.

54
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:08,334
- Do you need any help?
- No, no. You guys just sit.

55
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:12,271
Okay.

56
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:16,016
What... do we have here?

57
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,143
Well, these are
pancakes, as you can see,

58
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:21,680
but I made them into
little lightning bolts.

59
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:24,116
Well, the batter kind
of got away from me,

60
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,519
but you see the little zigzag...

61
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:27,416
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah.
I totally see it, yeah.

62
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,698
Yeah.

63
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:32,291
What are-what are you doing?

64
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:34,159
Uh, I am just getting evidence

65
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:37,730
that you make lumpy pancakes
in every time period.

66
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:40,699
Let's try it out.

67
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:47,039
Mmm. Lumpy, but delicious.

68
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,367
- Yeah? Oh, thanks, babe.
- Oh.

69
00:03:51,345 --> 00:03:55,016
I'm sorry, um, when did you...
When did you get a phone?

70
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,182
Uh, Dad got it for me a couple days ago.

71
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:58,651
Mm-hmm.

72
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,526
Nora suggested it. I mean, I
thought it was a great idea.

73
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,691
We're always in and out of
S.T.A.R. Labs, so I just...

74
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:10,395
You know, it'd be
easier to text and call.

75
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:12,164
Yeah.

76
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,836
Yeah, that totally makes sense.

77
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,870
You guys excited to cheer me on

78
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,371
at the charity softball game?

79
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:22,241
Softball, schway.

80
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:24,710
I just hope I don't get stuck
in right field this year.

81
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,748
You, uh, gave your number out already?

82
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,823
Yeah, just to the team and Sherloque.

83
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:35,853
Actually, this text message,
I think, is from him.

84
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:39,658
I don't think he's much of a texter.

85
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,219
No.

86
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:43,395
He, uh, wants us to
come to S.T.A.R. Labs.

87
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,409
I'm gonna go get ready.

88
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:46,105
You haven't had anything to eat yet.

89
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:48,809
Mm. I'm not really a breakfast person.

90
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:56,838
You know, I thought having her here,

91
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,590
we would finally have
a chance to connect,

92
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:01,011
but it's like every time
we take a half-step forward,

93
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:03,181
we end up taking six steps back.

94
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:05,151
I-I mean, don't give
up. She'll come around.

95
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:06,953
- I have a feeling.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:12,491
Well, not if I keep
making food like that.

97
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:14,126
Hey, no, this really is good.

98
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,462
It is. I mean, it's a little, like...

99
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:18,764
- Wait, wait, stop. Just stop.
- Dark, but... No, it's...

100
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:20,417
I'm going to make you
a banana. It's fine.

101
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,585
You're going to make me a banana?

102
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,448
I'm going to make you a banana.

103
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:24,667
Thanks.

104
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:30,242
Wait, no, I asked for everyone.

105
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:34,246
Where is the little, uh...

106
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:36,248
Cisco is laying low
at his parents' house

107
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,250
while he heals up.

108
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:41,250
Well, that's not very brave on his part.

109
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:44,590
I will have a conversation
with him next time I see him.

110
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:46,592
So, Team Flash.

111
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:48,861
How will this handsome, master detective

112
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:50,829
of all the multiverse, Sherloque Wells,

113
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:54,266
pay off his debt to us...

114
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:59,571
and catch this homicidal
maniac together?

115
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,073
Well, we'll begin by asking ourselves

116
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:02,105
a few obvious questions.

117
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:04,019
How he became a meta-human?

118
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:05,678
Well, power manifestation varies.

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,825
The particle accelerator...

120
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:08,800
I don't think we're
interrupting Sherloque, right?

121
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,370
- Right.
- Sure, but you bring up

122
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:11,839
a good point, Dr. Snow.

123
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:14,477
What do we know so
far about this Cicada?

124
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,455
Well, we know that
he's killed two people

125
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,657
and almost a third.

126
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,893
Exactly right. If I could gently be

127
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:23,829
a little more specific,
not just people, right?

128
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,331
Meta-humans.

129
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:28,132
Also, Joe said he got the
feeling that Cicada's a dad.

130
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:31,203
Right. Cicada... parent.

131
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,105
His dagger dampens powers.

132
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,561
Not just dampens the powers, right?

133
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,253
He commands this dagger, right?

134
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,309
It is like an extension of himself.

135
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:39,339
So we know...

136
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:41,913
Maybe they acquired their
powers at the same time.

137
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,116
Yes, very good, Dr. Snow.

138
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:47,720
So, acquired powers...

139
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,455
together.

140
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:50,823
So...

141
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:53,352
there we are, Team Flash.

142
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,594
Very simple.

143
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:57,496
We unravel this puzzle,

144
00:06:57,498 --> 00:07:01,934
and we have a pathway
to tracking Cicada.

145
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:04,800
Cool, or we just answer a
much more basic question,

146
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:08,619
like what's up with his weird mask?

147
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:13,111
Well, the mask conceals his identity.

148
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:14,628
- That's what it's for.
- Right.

149
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,863
What I'm suggesting is,

150
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:18,049
if we find out what the mask is for,

151
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:19,952
we'll find out the man
underneath much faster.

152
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:22,755
37 times I have caught Cicada, right?

153
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:26,391
And not once was this mask
angle very useful, right?

154
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:28,393
But you know what?

155
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,598
The more hours I bill you,
the less money I owe you.

156
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:33,030
So, if you want to spend your
hours pursuing the mask angle,

157
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,344
well, then be my guest.

158
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:38,637
Okay, great. Sounds like a plan.

159
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,472
- We got to get going.
- Yeah, yes.

160
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:41,566
Good stuff.

161
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:44,909
I hope you score a touchdown.

162
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:47,913
- It's softball.
- Ah, score a basket.

163
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:50,482
So, baby giraffe...

164
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:53,051
lead on, my friend.

165
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:55,521
Wow.

166
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:56,855
Look at these guys.

167
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:00,492
They think they're so
much better than us.

168
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,261
Because they are, Bar.

169
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:04,830
I mean, without Captain
Singh or my dad, it's...

170
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,465
Huh.

171
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:10,135
- Huh, what?
- Jonesy isn't here yet.

172
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:11,937
Hey, Detective Rowell,
what do you think?

173
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,206
- Maybe third base for me?
- Right field, Allen.

174
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,341
Babe, I love you, but
leave the hot corner

175
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:18,237
to someone who can
actually field a ball, okay?

176
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,639
- Play ball!
- Come on.

177
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:22,814
- I mean... Good luck!
- Yeah.

178
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:26,652
- You're going to nail it.
- Right field.

179
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:29,955
- Oh, God.
- In right field.

180
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:33,659
Not the hot corner,
but... Guys, come on!

181
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:55,214
Safe!

182
00:08:57,718 --> 00:08:59,384
Whoo!

183
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:04,623
Wow, he really is slow.

184
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,425
Yeah, Papa Joe told me all the stories

185
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,827
about what an awful
athlete Dad was growing up.

186
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:10,462
Well, believe me, they're true.

187
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:12,464
Let's just be grateful
that he has coordination

188
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,816
- when it counts.
- Yeah.

189
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,767
Hey, what is that, Nora?

190
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,504
There is this really
great app called Spyn Zone.

191
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:21,340
The push notifications
let you know the second

192
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:23,275
anything happens in the city.

193
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:24,843
Like Iris' Website?

194
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:26,645
Uh, yeah, kind of.

195
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:28,413
It's just a lot more
up to date than that,

196
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:30,048
and it's, like... It's really cool.

197
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,352
This girl's, like, really in the know.

198
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:35,020
Oh.

199
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:37,155
Yeah, Spencer Young. I know her.

200
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:38,323
Yeah, I see her all the time

201
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:39,698
working on her laptop at Jitters.

202
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:41,839
She... she actually was
a junior reporter at CCPN

203
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,562
when I worked there, but...

204
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,130
she didn't last very long.

205
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,198
- Why not?
- Well, she wanted to be famous

206
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,667
and make a name for herself,

207
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,793
but she didn't care how it happened.

208
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:51,528
Well, I think she's cute.

209
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:53,318
Yeah, I mean, she may be cute,

210
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,706
but she's never fact-checked
a thing a day in her life.

211
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,293
She's doing something
right... She has three times

212
00:09:57,295 --> 00:10:00,167
as many followers on her app
as you do on your blogs, so...

213
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,015
I'm going to get something to eat.

214
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:07,612
Ooh, wow.

215
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:10,889
- Ah, come on, Allen!
- Oh, honey.

216
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,024
Oh.

217
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:27,873
- Cecile? What's wrong?
- Something's not right.

218
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,258
Something's not right.

219
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:34,746
Is that Jonesy?

220
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:37,683
Hey, somebody stop him!

221
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,718
Everybody move!

222
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,422
Hey, hey!

223
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:58,804
- Nora, hey.
- Huh? What?

224
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,572
What happened?

225
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:02,407
You just saved everybody.

226
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:22,322
Bomb squad finished their sweep.

227
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,216
- They said it's all clear.
- Okay.

228
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,486
Nora, how did you know
what was happening?

229
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:29,022
I don't know.

230
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:30,624
One minute I was going to get food,

231
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,160
and the next I was in
the outfield with Dad.

232
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:35,128
And you don't remember anything else?

233
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,233
What's that?

234
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:42,469
A notification from Spyn Zone.

235
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:46,974
Already? That was fast.

236
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:48,709
Allen, CSI time.

237
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:50,768
Uh, we're up. We'll meet
you back at S.T.A.R. Labs

238
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:53,312
- as soon as we can.
- Yeah.

239
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:56,408
Iris, if Cicada sees that post...

240
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,013
Yeah, he may pick Nora
as his next target.

241
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:11,164
Well, you have brought
us to the location

242
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,877
you first encountered Cicada.

243
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,501
That's right. How did you know that?

244
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:16,335
I know everything.
I'm a master detective.

245
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,105
Look, I looked at the
CSI file of Barry Allen.

246
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:20,643
There is no evidence
of Cicada DNA, right?

247
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:23,335
And moreover, look at
this location, right?

248
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:24,411
All the traffic through here...

249
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,046
You can never pull DNA from here.

250
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,581
It's a good thing
we're not here for DNA.

251
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,869
What we are here for, then?

252
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:31,039
We're here to find out
why Cicada wears that mask.

253
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,814
Oh, encore with the mask!

254
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:34,720
Do you think he's allergic to fresh air?

255
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:37,682
- No.
- No, he wears that mask for a reason.

256
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,235
All right, look, 37
times I've caught Cicada.

257
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:42,450
Not once, not one time was the mask

258
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,563
- a key part of the evidence.
- Yeah, that's true.

259
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,566
But you said this Cicada is
different than all the others,

260
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,802
so why wouldn't his
mask be different, too?

261
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:51,238
Maybe it's just a mask
to... You know what?

262
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,073
You want to pursuit
mask angle, be my guest.

263
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:55,042
What do you expect to find here?

264
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,965
When I was getting my ass kicked,

265
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,844
I noticed that the
more he exerted himself,

266
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,340
the heavier his breathing got.

267
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:02,315
- That's what happens.
- So, I thought...

268
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:04,951
if one of those breaths
was strong enough...

269
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:07,788
We might just get lucky.

270
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,956
How we are going to get lucky?

271
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,159
Barry found traces of
fluoropolymers here.

272
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:13,827
- So?
- So the Internet told me

273
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,162
they're prone to flaking.

274
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:17,043
I'm here to get some of them.

275
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,466
The Internet also tell you to
contaminate your crime scene?

276
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:21,101
Very good, master detective.

277
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,805
Turns out industrial respirators use

278
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,173
a protective coating around the nostrils

279
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:27,457
that are made from this.

280
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,276
And when this exposed
to another compound,

281
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,478
dimethyl sulfate,
fluoropolymers tend to emit

282
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,746
a very distinct odor

283
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:33,947
Burnt onions.

284
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:36,550
Right.

285
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,954
We find out where this is used,

286
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,989
we're going to find our man.

287
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:45,158
- Elementary.
- Elementary.

288
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,095
No shrap, Sherlock.

289
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:53,033
It's Sherloque.

290
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,375
Spencer?

291
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,177
Iris West, wow.

292
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:05,979
Long time. How are you?

293
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,148
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm good. And you?

294
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,184
Good. Married that CSI
guy you were dating, huh?

295
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,519
Uh, yeah.

296
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:15,655
- Any kids yet?
- Um, no. Not...

297
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,457
Uh...

298
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:18,825
No.

299
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,504
You know, I followed your lead.

300
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:22,829
Started my own blog, left CCPN.

301
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:25,907
- Now we are both Charleine Foster Kanes.
- Right.

302
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,801
BTdubs, those Professor
DeVoe stories... respect.

303
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:30,871
Metas are clickbait right now, right?

304
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:33,940
Yes, which is why I wanted
to talk to you, actually,

305
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,208
off the record, of course.

306
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,643
Yeah, for sure. What's up?

307
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:39,746
So, uh, I recently
found a source who thinks

308
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:41,285
that metas are being targeted.

309
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:43,716
Ooh, juicy. Who?

310
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:46,820
Well, no one knows, not even CCPD.

311
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:48,471
But these metas, including speedsters

312
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:51,857
like The Flash and XS,
they are all in danger.

313
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,562
XS. That new lady
speedster has a code name.

314
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:58,765
Oh, like her size!

315
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,734
Right, extra small.

316
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,503
- Did you coin that?
- No, no.

317
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:06,485
Look, the point is,
writing articles about XS

318
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,308
could make her a target.

319
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,043
Or it could make her famous.

320
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:12,245
I mean, people are already
obsessed with her...

321
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:13,713
and my app even more.

322
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:16,238
Besides, a little
threat never stopped you

323
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:18,841
from writing about The
Flash back in the day.

324
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:20,878
That was different.

325
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:25,624
Because it was your blog?
What... do as I say, not as I do?

326
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:28,329
Look, please stop, okay?
Before someone gets hurt.

327
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:31,064
The only one who's
going to get hurt is you

328
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:33,433
when I make your blog irrelevant.

329
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:40,307
What is this for, Allen?

330
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,543
Just trying to get some answers, Jonesy.

331
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,278
Would you send that to Caitlin?

332
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,814
I told everyone everything
I know, which is nothing.

333
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,650
- You don't remember a thing?
- No.

334
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:55,522
Okay, God's own truth, Allen...
All I remember is waking up,

335
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:57,591
getting ready for the
game, leaving my house,

336
00:15:57,593 --> 00:16:00,760
and the next thing I know,
I wake up in the field

337
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:02,762
after that bomb went off.

338
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:05,732
I mean, where would I even get a bomb?

339
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:08,268
The evidence lockup.

340
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,936
It was part of the inventory we seized

341
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:11,496
from the Jansen-Moretti case.

342
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:14,940
The cameras in the lockup
show you stuffing that bomb

343
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:17,677
in your backpack this morning.

344
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:23,450
- Joe, no one got hurt.
- They could've.

345
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:27,153
The woman I love, my baby...
You could've killed them.

346
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:32,826
I watched you come up, man.

347
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:35,495
I'm sorry, Joe...

348
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:38,798
but I swear, I don't
know how this happened.

349
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:44,504
Move, move!

350
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:47,340
- How many we got?
- Hey, what is it?

351
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:50,877
Fire at CCPN. First
responders are across town.

352
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,712
We got to go.

353
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,605
Finally.

354
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,426
Okay, the building's
already been evacuated.

355
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:07,994
Fire trucks are on their way.

356
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:10,030
Okay, let's just get
inside and put the fire out.

357
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:11,899
I've never done this before.

358
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:14,334
Come on. Seriously, move!

359
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,303
That's okay. We're just
going to create a vacuum.

360
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,634
Fine. I will make you move.

361
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:24,344
Enjoy this news, Flash.

362
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:29,983
All right, I'll walk you
through it. Once we're inside...

363
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:35,755
What? Where... Where are you going?

364
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:39,326
- Nora, what's wrong?
- He just ran away and left.

365
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:42,662
His suit's GPS has him west, way west.

366
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:44,998
Barry? Barry.

367
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:47,734
He's not listening.

368
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:50,621
Uh, guys, what do I do here?

369
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:53,005
Okay, Nora, you're going to
have to do this by yourself.

370
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,441
Okay? But I'm going to help you.

371
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:55,480
Okay.

372
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,278
Okay, you need to get
to the heart of the fire

373
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,014
and extinguish it from there.

374
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:02,462
- I got it.
- Rotate your arms

375
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:04,217
in tight circles.

376
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:05,719
You need to move them
in opposite directions,

377
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,220
creating twin vacuums.

378
00:18:07,222 --> 00:18:09,656
Come on, Nora.

379
00:18:09,658 --> 00:18:11,825
Dad's done this a thousand times.

380
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:13,393
You can do this.

381
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:20,767
I'm doing it!

382
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,635
Keep going.

383
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,484
Whoa.

384
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:46,593
Great job, Nora.

385
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:48,461
Thanks, Mom.

386
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:54,634
Hey... hey, did you find Dad?

387
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,019
What the hell?

388
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,347
I'm glad you were there to put that out.

389
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:15,215
- It could've been a lot worse.
- Thanks, Dad.

390
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:19,052
Don't thank me. Your mom
walked you through it.

391
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:22,156
You were really great out there.

392
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:25,223
So there was some weird
activity with your scan,

393
00:19:25,226 --> 00:19:27,827
but everything looks fine.

394
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,296
Hmm.

395
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,230
What's the last thing you remember?

396
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,563
Standing outside CCPN with Nora.

397
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,369
Next thing I know, I'm in Vegas.

398
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:38,205
That's exactly what happened
to me and Officer Jones.

399
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:39,673
So maybe the abnormal activity

400
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,832
was some sort of hypnotic induction?

401
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,100
I don't know. I mean,
I feel like one of us

402
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:45,003
would've noticed somebody
trying to hypnotize me.

403
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,547
Yeah, and why would someone
hypnotize us to save people?

404
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,519
Publicity.

405
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,552
Spencer Young wants to get
famous by making you famous.

406
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:53,854
You don't know that.

407
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:55,446
She admitted it when we talked.

408
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,257
Why would you go talk to her?

409
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,795
Hold on, look at the
timestamp on the post.

410
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:04,965
7:52 p.m.? Nora and I
were still with Jonesy,

411
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:07,767
and the fire at CCPN hadn't
even been reported yet.

412
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,627
I guess you'll always be
the first one to the scoop

413
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:11,171
if you're the one making it.

414
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:13,373
So she's some sort of early edition meta

415
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,613
who creates stories?

416
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:16,877
Fake news taken to a whole new level.

417
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,745
Maybe she's some kind of meta psychic

418
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:20,414
who predicts the news.

419
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,516
That still doesn't
mean she hypnotized us.

420
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:24,518
Yeah.

421
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,720
Caitlin, can you download
the cortical biometrics

422
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:29,056
from Nora's suit and
run it against my scans?

423
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:30,958
- On it.
- Thanks.

424
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,427
What are you thinking?

425
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,196
We need to figure out if
Spencer's responsible for this.

426
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,310
Google for the win on finding out

427
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,423
- where Cicada's mask is from.
- Google for the win.

428
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:54,114
So you think Cicada's hiding out here,

429
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:55,682
just lurking behind those doors.

430
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:56,973
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do,

431
00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:59,118
because my search also
told me that Szrek Chemicals

432
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:01,455
uses dimethyl sulfates
in most of their products.

433
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:04,301
So guess what. I'm
gonna take down Cicada.

434
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,959
Oh, well, we shall see, giraffe.

435
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:10,816
May I help you?

436
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:14,087
- Hi, how are you? I'm...
- Elongated Man. I know.

437
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,169
Sherloque Wells, yes, master detective.

438
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:19,673
You know, we'll sign autographs
later... we have some business.

439
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,575
Uh, we just want to
know if we can ask you

440
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:22,943
some questions, please.

441
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:24,144
About?

442
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,586
What about our masks?

443
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:34,554
Do any of your employees wear them?

444
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,192
Follow me.

445
00:21:56,345 --> 00:22:00,280
Yep. Every worker,
every plant wears one.

446
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:01,815
How many plants?

447
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:03,650
Three in Central City and Keystone.

448
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:07,020
- Mm.
- 14 in the Midwest alone.

449
00:22:07,022 --> 00:22:09,489
So probably thousands?

450
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:12,759
Yeah, and we're not the
only facility that uses them.

451
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:16,590
Thank you for your time.

452
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:18,289
Hey, I, uh...

453
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:21,200
Love that pear meme going
around the last few weeks.

454
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:24,832
Classic.

455
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:27,874
Mm, classic. I have
a suggestion for you.

456
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:30,110
Maybe the next time
you do a Google search,

457
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:32,212
advance to page two.

458
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:33,547
Hmm?

459
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,203
So here's the meta-watch,

460
00:22:56,205 --> 00:23:00,374
Press that button. If
Spencer's a meta, it'll beep.

461
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:01,973
And if she's meta...

462
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:04,043
It means she could be
dangerous, so come right back.

463
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,410
Yes. One of us would go with you,

464
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:08,988
but she knows both
me and your dad, so...

465
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:10,519
I got it.

466
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,785
Okay, We're here if
you need us, all ri...

467
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:15,422
Um...

468
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,082
I see her.

469
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:21,394
All you need to do is get
within five feet of her,

470
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:22,729
hit the button, in and out.

471
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:24,898
I know!

472
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,533
You see what I mean?

473
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:30,504
Half-step forward, six steps back?

474
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:33,440
I mean, you guys did great
with the fire, though.

475
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:35,340
Thank you.

476
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:37,269
You should totally
name one of your drinks

477
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:39,806
after that new female speedster, XS.

478
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,384
- Hey.
- Whoa. Hi.

479
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,916
Hi. Sorry, Spencer.

480
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,820
That's okay. Do I know you?

481
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:49,423
- Uh-oh.
- Uh, Nora...

482
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,918
you have to press the button.

483
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:53,959
Um, no. No, you don't know me.

484
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:55,527
- But you know me.
- Yes, I do.

485
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,030
Uh, sorry. You're Spencer Young.

486
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:00,133
I read all your stuff on Spyn Zone.

487
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:01,340
It's a really good app.

488
00:24:01,343 --> 00:24:03,316
It's fantastic stories
and really good writing.

489
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,852
I'm a... I'm a really big fan.

490
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:07,440
- Nora..
- I always enjoy meeting a fan.

491
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:12,779
Especially when they're
as adorable as you.

492
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:14,648
What's happening?

493
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,350
She's flirting with our
daughter. I'll be back.

494
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:20,654
- What?
- Hold down the fort.

495
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:22,489
Iris, wait.

496
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,993
Huh.

497
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:31,631
- Do you have a name?
- Nora, hey.

498
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:35,035
- Wait, y-you know her?
- Uh, I do.

499
00:24:35,037 --> 00:24:37,037
Well, she's actually...

500
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,306
This is, actually...

501
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:42,848
Did you want to check your watch?

502
00:24:42,851 --> 00:24:46,112
I think we're running a little bit late.

503
00:24:46,114 --> 00:24:49,282
- Right, yes. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

504
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:53,553
All right, well, I'm going to peace out.

505
00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:59,720
But I hope to meet
cute you again sometime.

506
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:02,662
Nora.

507
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,833
Well, I guess she's not meta.

508
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:09,169
I guess not.

509
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:14,608
Oh, no. No, no, no.

510
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,337
Nora... look, I don't care
that you think she's cute.

511
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,281
She's dangerous, okay? You
need to stay away from her.

512
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:23,283
She could be dangerous.

513
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:26,152
Nora, I am trying to protect you here.

514
00:25:26,154 --> 00:25:28,955
Has that been your thing my whole life?

515
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:31,858
What does that even mean, honestly?

516
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,927
I mean, is that why
you've been so cold to me,

517
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,695
why you don't want to
spend any time with me?

518
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:37,831
I'm... I'm just trying
to get to know you.

519
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,449
- Just drop it.
- Nora, I don't under...

520
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,619
Look, you lied to me!

521
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:45,771
I would never lie to you.

522
00:25:45,774 --> 00:25:48,899
Yeah? What do you call that?

523
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:54,548
You put a power-dampening
chip inside me

524
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,949
to take away my speed.

525
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:57,317
And until six months ago,

526
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,286
I didn't even know I had powers.

527
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:01,388
My whole life has been a lie

528
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,089
because you have been
trying to protect me.

529
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:06,526
Well, guess what. I
don't need you to do that.

530
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,041
- Hey.
- Hey.

531
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,643
- What you doing?
- Well, Nora blocked me.

532
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:25,612
So I'm trying to use
the quantum computer

533
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:28,401
to access her phone and
force her to accept my calls.

534
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:30,784
But I am no...

535
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:32,819
hacker.

536
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:34,797
Don't you think that's a little extreme?

537
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,039
Yes, Barry, it's very extreme...

538
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,893
and crazy and desperate, but
I am feeling extremely crazy

539
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,861
and desperate, okay?

540
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:44,998
I thought giving her
space would, you know,

541
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,499
have her eventually come around,

542
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:49,336
but it turns out she's
not the problem. I am.

543
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:51,477
I mean, I don't know
how I could do something

544
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,605
like that to her, Barry.

545
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,316
Iris, you didn't do anything to her.

546
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,495
You can't blame yourself for
something future-you might do.

547
00:26:57,498 --> 00:26:59,987
Yes, I can, Barry, and it's not a might.

548
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,358
I suppressed our daughter's powers.

549
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:06,052
I kept a huge part of
who she was a secret

550
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:07,187
for her entire life.

551
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:08,888
I did that.

552
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,605
Look, she'll forgive you.

553
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:12,726
What if my dad did
something like that to you

554
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:15,595
after the particle accelerator exploded?

555
00:27:15,597 --> 00:27:17,530
See?

556
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:21,636
I don't understand how I could
do something like that to her.

557
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,473
Look, I don't know why you do it,

558
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,843
but I don't need to.

559
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:30,309
I know that anything you do for
our family, it's out of love.

560
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:33,203
So, whatever reason
future-you has for doing this,

561
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:35,415
I have faith that it's
the right thing to do,

562
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,650
and so should you.

563
00:27:37,652 --> 00:27:39,452
Yeah, well, I'm having a realy hard time

564
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:40,722
believing that.

565
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,969
Well, then it's a good thing
I have enough faith in you

566
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,605
for the both of us.

567
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:47,508
All right?

568
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:55,068
That's unusual.

569
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,347
Dr. Snow.

570
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,659
Aah!

571
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:02,474
Oh, Dr. Snow.

572
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:04,344
I have frightened you, Dr. Snow.

573
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:06,746
I assume you came here
for some other reason

574
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:07,881
than murdering me?

575
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:10,250
Oof...

576
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:11,885
If I was to murder you, Dr. Snow,

577
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:13,987
I would not do it in
such an obvious fashion.

578
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:17,991
Look, I have a theory on
the identity of Cicada.

579
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:19,793
I request your assistance.

580
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:22,456
Uh, okay. I was just finishing up.

581
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:25,264
Not your expertise, your assistance.

582
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:28,168
I need you to punch me in the chest.

583
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,503
What?

584
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:32,304
Right here, above the... um,
dee-aphragm. How do you say?

585
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:33,503
Diaphragm?

586
00:28:33,506 --> 00:28:34,546
Diaphragm, right.

587
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,242
In the solar plexus as
hard as you can. Allé.

588
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:39,112
Listen, Sherlock...

589
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:40,814
- Ugh.
- Loque.

590
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:42,508
So this is one of those things

591
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:45,350
where you are just the
brains and not the brawn?

592
00:28:45,353 --> 00:28:47,654
You don't have the guts.
You lack the courage.

593
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:48,797
You're soft.

594
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,557
Probably you couldn't
even hit me in the spot.

595
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:55,728
For the record, I
know what you just did.

596
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,730
- And?
- And it worked.

597
00:28:57,732 --> 00:29:01,000
TrÃ¨s bien. Then... allé.

598
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:04,537
Ooh!

599
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:10,376
Oh, uh, are you okay?

600
00:29:19,154 --> 00:29:21,421
You sound just like...

601
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:25,525
Cicada.

602
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:29,429
What do we got?

603
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,498
CCPD is getting bombarded
with calls from people

604
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,211
at the soccer game at
Central City Stadium.

605
00:29:33,214 --> 00:29:34,544
It's all over the news, too.

606
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:35,608
Okay, I'm going to get over there.

607
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,250
CCPD already cleared out the stadium.

608
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:38,887
Find the bomb, and
we'll help you disarm it.

609
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:40,805
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you on the way.

610
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:42,190
Come on.

611
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:53,476
- Nothing, you?
- No.

612
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:57,022
Iris, there's no bomb.

613
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:05,098
Guys, look at the
timestamp on Spencer's post.

614
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,265
11:05 a.m.

615
00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:08,226
Yeah, and now look at the time that CCPD

616
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:10,351
got the first call
about the bomb sighting.

617
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:11,773
It was five minutes later.

618
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,006
Hey, can you bring up
Officer Jones' brain scan?

619
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,101
I'm going to run the code

620
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,104
of Spencer's post
through the decompiler.

621
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:22,448
Let's see what's underneath.

622
00:30:27,355 --> 00:30:28,721
Got it.

623
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:34,411
- Done.
- The brain scan.

624
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:36,229
The code is an exact match.

625
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:41,634
- Barry, it's the headlines.
- What?

626
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:43,351
That's how Spencer's hypnotizing people.

627
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:47,189
They're reading her
headlines! Don't look at them.

628
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:49,125
Aah! Too late!

629
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,843
Nora's been hypnotized.

630
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:12,433
She's trying to kill me.

631
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:15,170
Nora, you got to snap out of this.

632
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:18,673
What I have to do is kill you.

633
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,221
Caitlin, take over.

634
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:36,892
- Where are you going?
- To get my family back.

635
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,561
Hurry up and kill him already.

636
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:26,575
Time to bounce.

637
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,703
Hey, you're going to be okay. All right?

638
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:34,639
Nice shot!

639
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:37,651
Guys, do we know where Spencer is?

640
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:40,622
I can't ping her phone. CCPD
disabled all the cell towers

641
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:42,824
in the area to prevent
a remote bomb detonation.

642
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:44,860
She must be local in order
to put those headlines

643
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,648
up on that big screen, right?

644
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:49,363
- She's at the stadium.
- She's here.

645
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,400
Looks like you'll be trading
this cell in for another.

646
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:03,010
All right, Spencer's all
locked up in Iron Heights.

647
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:04,913
- The Mayor's resigning.
- What?

648
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,649
I'm surprised she lasted this long.

649
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,518
Luckily, I was able
to get a quote from her

650
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:10,822
exonerating Officer
Jones for my article.

651
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:13,058
Post will go up tomorrow.

652
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:15,595
Papa Joe will be relieved
his friend's in the clear.

653
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:17,198
Yeah.

654
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:18,934
Well, at least now,
with Spencer behind us,

655
00:33:18,937 --> 00:33:21,804
we can concentrate on bigger fish.

656
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:24,108
Yes, we can.

657
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:26,200
- So...
- Uh, Sherlock...

658
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:30,005
- Sherloque.
- He thinks he's found a key

659
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,218
to Cicada's identity.

660
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:33,718
A crucial clue to help us
solve our little mystery.

661
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:36,825
So we all know the distinctive
sound of Cicada's breathing

662
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,484
due to the respirator in the mask.

663
00:33:38,487 --> 00:33:42,371
But not just that, because
also his lungs are injured.

664
00:33:42,374 --> 00:33:44,274
But injured from what?

665
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:47,388
Historically, there is an
event that causes David Hersch

666
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:50,031
to always become Cicada,
but not this time.

667
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:51,828
There's a different Cicada because...

668
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:54,665
Because Nora helped me
destroy the satellite.

669
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,535
Monsieur Allen, Nora's
strike through the satellite

670
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,106
changed the trajectory of
the debris, and now the debris

671
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,809
has hit a new person and injured...

672
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:06,912
our new Cicada.

673
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:09,076
Okay, but how did that
give him his powers?

674
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,434
DeVoe flooded the
satellite with dark matter.

675
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:14,562
It makes sense that the
pieces would be saturated.

676
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:17,348
So Cicada and the dagger were created

677
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:19,469
the night of the Enlightenment.

678
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:23,241
Acquired powers together.

679
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:25,326
Well, listen, Sherloke...

680
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,896
- Sherloque.
- I got to hand it to you.

681
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,631
That's very impressive.

682
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:33,401
It's quite a breakthrough,
right, Monsieur Dibny?

683
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:36,471
One that I cannot take any credit for.

684
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:39,240
No, all the credit, all the praise

685
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:41,218
goes to you, Monsieur Dibny.

686
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:44,222
It was your instincts to
follow the mask, right?

687
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:47,793
Well, you were right, and I was...

688
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,450
less right.

689
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,155
I apologize.

690
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,843
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.

691
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,609
The dagger part still
doesn't make sense.

692
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:03,672
I mean, things cannot
become metas, right?

693
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,036
I don't know about that.

694
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:17,234
Our satellite didn't
just create new metas.

695
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:20,204
It created meta-tech.

696
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:24,042
Which puts meta-human
abilities in the hands of...

697
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:25,387
anyone.

698
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,108
Hey.

699
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:45,745
Caitlin says you're going to be fine.

700
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:52,924
I'm sorry for suppressing
your powers, but...

701
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:55,826
I think it was the right thing to do.

702
00:35:55,828 --> 00:35:58,029
Yeah. No, I-I...

703
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,098
I get it. I mean, I
was trying to kill Dad.

704
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,268
I would've done the same thing, too.

705
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,304
No, that's...

706
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,973
That's not what I mean.

707
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:11,442
I'm talking about in the future.

708
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,745
What?

709
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:17,548
I know that you're upset and angry.

710
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,622
And honestly, I...

711
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:23,053
Before today, I couldn't
even imagine a situation

712
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,390
where I would do
something like that to you.

713
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:30,301
But after seeing the
choice that I just made...

714
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:32,832
I know that whatever reason I would have

715
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:37,037
for keeping your powers a secret, it...

716
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,309
it must have been a good one, Nora.

717
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:43,612
It must have been to protect you.

718
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:46,516
No.

719
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,087
What happened today...

720
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,543
has nothing to do with
what happens in the future.

721
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:57,121
You didn't suppress my
abilities my whole life

722
00:36:57,123 --> 00:37:01,959
because I was brainwashed
or attacking people.

723
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:05,663
You did it to control me.

724
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,911
My whole life I felt
like I was different

725
00:37:10,914 --> 00:37:15,117
than everybody else,
but I didn't know why.

726
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,353
You took a choice away from me

727
00:37:17,356 --> 00:37:20,357
that I didn't even know that I had...

728
00:37:22,563 --> 00:37:26,699
A choice to be a hero, like my dad.

729
00:37:29,155 --> 00:37:30,821
What's going on?

730
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:36,192
- Nothing, we're just talking.
- No.

731
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:39,829
Mom thinks that she had good
reason to suppress my powers

732
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:44,368
in the future, but she doesn't
know what that reason is.

733
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:51,197
I'm sure it's a good one.

734
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,014
Look, Nora, I don't
have to visit the future

735
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:59,517
to know what kind of
mother Iris is going to be.

736
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,554
She cares about family more
than anyone I've ever met.

737
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:05,356
Okay? And...

738
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,559
I support her decisions...

739
00:38:07,562 --> 00:38:10,463
past, present, and future.

740
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:19,002
Then I guess I need to
rethink what the meaning

741
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,706
of family is.

742
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,559
Nora, wait.

743
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:25,529
Do you know what hurt the most

744
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:27,498
about learning I had powers?

745
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:32,189
Not hearing it from my mom.

746
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,328
It's all right.

747
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,840
- Hi.
- Nora, hi.

748
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:59,143
Um, it's kind of a long story,

749
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:01,612
but can I stay here?

750
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,082
Get in here, kid.

751
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:09,004
Are you sure it's not too much trouble?

752
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:12,623
It's fine. Maybe talk
about the reason later?

753
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:16,527
But for now, there's some fresh
pillows and blankets upstairs.

754
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:18,796
Thanks, Papa Joe.

755
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,529
Aah!

756
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:36,601
