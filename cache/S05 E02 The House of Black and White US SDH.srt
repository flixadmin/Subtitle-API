In the old times,
whenever Braavos
stood in danger,

4

the Titan would step
with fire in his eyes.

5
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,844
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

6
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,472
He's just a statue.

You are becoming
an observant young lady.

My mother used to say,
"Dark wings, dark words."

60
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,417
An old saying.
Inaccurate in this case.

Sansa Stark.
Don't look.

You sure?

71
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,610
She's dyed her hair,
but it's her.

72

She's sitting

Littlefinger?

74

A bunch of knights

What's a bunch, Podrick?
Six? 20?

Too many.

00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,204
My lady, I don't think
this is the right--

78

- Ready the horses.
- We only have one horse.

Why do men

It gives some men courage.

85

Does it give you courage?

<i>My name is Brienne of Tarth.</i>

We've met

<i>What did he say about you?</i>

91
00:08:54,743 --> 00:09:00,999
He said, "Your loyalty
came free of charge."

92
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,543
Someone appears
to have paid quite
a bit for it since then.

Lady Sansa,

94
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,811
before your mother's death,

95
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,231
I was her sworn sword.

96
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,442
I gave my word I would
find you and protect you.

97
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,737
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

98
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,281
and give my life
for yours if need be.

99
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,661
I swear it
by the old gods
and the new.

100
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,663
Please, Lady Brienne,

101
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,665
no need
for such formality.

102
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,167
You were Catelyn Stark's
sworn sword?

103
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,336
- I was.
- Strange.

104
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,171
<i>I knew Cat from the time</i>
<i>we were children.</i>

105
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,673
She never mentioned you.

106
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,758
It was after
Renly's murder.

107
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,009
Ah, yes.

108
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,719
You were accused
of killing him.

109
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,514
- I tried to save him.
- But you were accused.

110
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,766
By men who didn't see
what happened.

111
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,351
And what did happen?

112
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,983
He was murdered
by a shadow.

113
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,986
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

114
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,114
A shadow?

115
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:18,493
With the face--

<i>This woman swore</i>
<i>to protect Renly.</i>

<i>She failed.</i>

118
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,542
She swore
to protect your mother.
She failed.

119
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,504
Why would I want somebody
with your history of failure
guarding Lady Sansa?

120
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,007
Why should you have
any say in her affairs?

121
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,800
Because I am her uncle.

122
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,053
I married her Aunt Lysa
shortly before my beloved's
untimely death.

123
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,848
We're family now
and you are an outsider.

124
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,852
Forgive me, Lady Brienne,
but experience has made me
wary of outsiders.

125
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,230
Lady Sansa, if we can
have a word alone--

126
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,481
No.

127
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,275
Please, my lady.
If I could explain--

128
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,777
I saw you at Joffrey's
wedding bowing to the king.

129
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,406
Neither of us
wanted to be there.

130
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,241
Sometimes we don't
have a choice.

131
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,368
And sometimes we do.

132

<i>You should leave.</i>

133
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,250
We don't want
our new friend wandering
the countryside alone.

134
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,419
The roads in these parts
aren't safe.

135
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,379
Why don't you stay?

136
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,973

00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,178
Wary of strangers,
as she should be.

166
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,764
I saw her riding
on the East Road
with Littlefinger.

167
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,390
We'll follow them.

168
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,520
My lady,
if both Stark girls
refused your service,

169
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,146
maybe you're released
from your vow.

170
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,148
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

171
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,691
But if they don't want
your protection--

172
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,902
Do you think she's safe
with Littlefinger?

173
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,864
No, my lady.

174
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,783
Get your horse.

175
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,917
-<i> ( door closes )</i>
-<i> ( footsteps )</i>

176
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,253
A summons from the queen.

177
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,190
Cersei:
<i>There are only two</i>
<i>like it in the world.</i>

178
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,859
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

179
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,821
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

180
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,156
Our daughter's
alone in Dorne

181
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,994
surrounded by people
who hate our family.

182
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,247
"It's a threat."

183
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,748
No note?

184
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,668
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

185
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,171
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their
cursed country.

186
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,465
I will burn
their cities to the ground
if they touch her.

187
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,009
- Softer.
- What?

188
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,011
Not so loud.

189
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,597
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm
speaking too loudly?

190
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,183
The world can't know
she's our daughter.

191
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,185
Then don't call her
your daughter.

192
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,313
You've never been
a father to her.

193
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,773
If I was a father to any
of my children, they'd be
stoned in the street.

194
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,235
And what has
your caution brought?

195
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,363
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

196
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,034
Our only daughter
shipped off to Dorne.

197
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,619
Our baby boy set to marry

198
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,705
that smirking whore
from Highgarden.

199
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,632
I'm going to make
things better.

200
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,717
You've never made
anything better.

201
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,926
I'm going to Dorne

202
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,720
and I'm bringing
our daughter home.

203
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,598
( scoffs )
You can't just
ask Prince Doran

204
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,725
to give her back.

205
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,143
She's promised to his son.

206
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,021
I'm not going
to ask him anything.

207
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,273
You go down
there with an army,
it's an act of war.

208
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,900
No army.

209
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,235
Do you know where
they're keeping her?

210
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,491
Oberyn mentioned
the Water Gardens.

211
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,409
I'll find her.

212
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,914
Is there anything else,
Your Grace?

213
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,544
( chuckles )
You're going to Dorne?

214
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:48,216
A one-handed man alone?

215
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,343
I never said
I was going alone.

216
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,853
No sunflowers.
I don't like yellow.

217
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,356
Roses are very nice.
Definitely roses.

218
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,108
And music.
I adore music.

219
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,026
But no flutes.
I hate flutes.

220
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,112
We can have
a harp if you like,
but no flutes.

221
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,489
Then there's the food.
Food is the most
important thing.

222
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,158
Don't you agree?
We're going to need
pigeon pies.

223
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,704
That's what they eat
in the capital,
don't they?

224
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,372
Don't they?

225
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,958
Don't who?

226
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,003
People eat
pigeon pie
in the capital.

227
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,964
They certainly do,
my dear.

228
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,383
They certainly do.

229
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,760
It's a fine place,
isn't it?

230
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,429
A fine place.

231
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,472
I never thought
I'd end up

232
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,392
settling down
in a place like this.

233
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,645
- You won't.
- Pardon?

234
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,647
We won't get to live
at Stokeworth.

235
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,483
When Mother dies,
my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

236
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,986
- Oh.
- She hates me.

237
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,988
She calls me mean names
and sometimes even still

238
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,199
she pulls my hair
when Mother's not looking.

239
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,411
You know what I think?

240
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,621
I think you're
a good person.

241
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,999
And your sister
is a mean person.

242
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,542
She is.

243
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,212
I've been all over
the world,

244
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,339
and if there's one thing
I've learned,

245
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,509
it's that meanness
comes around.

246
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,344
People like your sister,

247
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,765
they always get what's coming
to them eventually.

248
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,892
One way or another.

249
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,063
Who's that?

250
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,027
Jaime fucking Lannister.

251
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,449
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

252
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,076
I was very sorry
to hear about your father.

253
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,787
Thank you.

254
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,915
This is
my betrothed Lollys.

255
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,085
A pleasure.

256
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,255
Run along, love.

257
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,555
Beautiful young bride
you've chosen.

258
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,557
When were you planning
on getting married?

259
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,893
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

260
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,978
What you're here for.

261
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,731
There's no way this little
visit could possibly mean
anything good for me.

262
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,983
It's very good for you.

263
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,540
Lollys will be marrying
Ser Willis Bracken.

264
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,874
Mmm.

265
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,585
We made a deal,
your sister and I.

266
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,255
- I would have
advised against that.
- How is this good for me?

267
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,424
'Cause you're going to come
with me and help me with
something important.

268
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,011
And when we return,
I'm going to give you
a much better girl

269
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,930
and a much better castle.

270
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,060
Return from where?

271
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,479
As far south
as south goes.

272
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,454
Trystane:
<i>My future queen.</i>

273
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,124
( speaking softly )

274
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,558
The prince does not wish
to be disturbed.

275
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,476
Remove yourself
from my path

276
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,604
or I'll take that longaxe
and I'll shove it--

277
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,023
Doran:
<i>Captain.</i>

278
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,275
<i>Let her pass.</i>

279
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,406
Your brother was murdered

280
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,617
and you sit here
in the Water Gardens

281
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,660
staring at the sky
and doing nothing.

282
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,747
Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat.

283
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,332
By law,
that is not murder.

284
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,667
- Your brother.
- You don't have
to remind me.

285
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,670
He was my brother long before
he was anything to you.

286
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,631
What will you do
about his death?

287
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,300
I will bury him.
I will mourn for him.

288
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,011
- And then?
- You would
have me go to war?

289
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,638
The whole country
would have you go to war.

290
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,974
Then we are lucky
the whole country
does not decide.

291
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,603
The Sand Snakes
are with me.

292
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,313
They have the love
of their people.

293
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,941
They will avenge
their father while
you sit here

294
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,235
in your chair
doing nothing.

295
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,366
Oberyn is dead

296
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,286
<i>and this Lannister girl skips</i>
<i>about the Water Gardens</i>

297
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,374
eating our food,
breathing our air.

298
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,460
How many of your
brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

299
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,672
Let me have her.

300
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:43,135
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

301
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,889
I loved my brother.

302
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,975
And you made him
very happy.

303
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:53,062
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

304
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,941
But we do not
mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

305
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,276
Not here.

306
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,070
Not while I rule.

307
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,615
And how long
will that be?

308
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,675
Daario:
<i>The Unsullied</i>
<i>are too conspicuous.</i>

309
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,678
Anyone can see you coming
from a mile off.

310
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,055
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

311
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,266
You haven't, have you?

312
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,517
( grunts )

313
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,812
My Second Sons,
on the other hand,

314
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,065
they drink,
they whore,

315
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,942
fight in the streets,

316
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,360
they blend in.

317
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,612
They overhear
things in taverns,

318
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,450
follow people
from the taverns
to nice, quiet alleys,

319
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,702
break a few fingers,

320
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,662
overhear
a few more things.

321
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,041
Before you know it...

322
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,604
No one here.

323
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,064
We go.

324
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,941
In a hurry?
You're afraid?

325
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,069
Unsullied fear nothing.

326
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,029
Right.

327
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,781
That's your problem.

328
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,158
You understood fear
once long ago,

329
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,910
but you've forgotten
what it means.

330
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,747
Someone who's
forgotten fear

331
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,457
has forgotten how to hide.

332
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,836
<i>( man screams )</i>

333
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,005
( grunts )

334
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,965
( groans )

335
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,635
Fear is useful
that way.

336
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,972
<i>( man groaning )</i>

337
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,480
( screaming )

338
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,037
Sons of the Harpy,
they want to put a collar
back on my neck.

339
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,622
On all of our necks.

340
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,582
Please, Your Grace,
you must kill him.

341
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,292
It would send a message.

342
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,753
I think you should
exercise restraint,
Your Grace.

343
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,798
- Why?
- For one thing, he may have
valuable information.

344
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,884
The Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable
information.

345
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,219
How do you know that?

346
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,179
Because I questioned him.

347
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,014
Hizdahr:
And the information
you did get,

348
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,850
- he is young and poor.
- He is born free.

349
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,227
Why should he want
to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

350
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,812
Perhaps the only thing
that gave him pride

351
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,730
was knowing
that there was someone
lower than he was.

352
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,399
They pay him.

353
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,817
Great families
afraid to do a thing.

354
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,610
They pay poor man
to do it for them.

355
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,529
- And how do you know this?
- Mossador: Everyone know this.

356
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,614
I don't know it
and I'm the head
of a great family.

357
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,117
Barristan:
<i>We do not know what</i>
<i>this man did or didn't do.</i>

358
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,163
Give him a trial at least.
A fair trial.

359
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,039
Show all the citizens
of Meereen

360
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,208
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

361
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,835
Teach them a better way.

362
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,087
I do not know
the place from where
Old Ser comes.

363
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,757
Things maybe are
different there, I hope.

364
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,676
But here in Meereen,

365
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,596
before Daenerys Stormborn,
they own us.

366
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,890
So we learn
much about them

367
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,267
or we do not live long.

368
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,561
They teach me
what they are.

369
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:24,940
Mercy, fair trial--
these mean nothing to them.

370
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,359
All they understand
is blood.

371
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,617
Daenerys:
<i>Thank you all</i>
<i>for your counsel.</i>

372
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,377
Your Grace,
a word, please,
I beg you.

373
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,047
- About what?
- About your father.

374
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,299
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

375
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,926
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

376
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,302
Consider me reminded.

377
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,389
Your Grace, I served
in his Kingsguard.

378
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,391
I was at his side
from the first.

379
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,936
Your enemies did not lie.

380
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,231
Go on.

381
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,485
When the people rose
in revolt against him,

382
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,030
your father set their towns
and castles aflame.

383
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,492
He murdered sons
in front of their fathers.

384
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,827
He burned men alive
with wildfire

385
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,747
and laughed
as they screamed.

386
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,251
<i>And his efforts</i>
<i>to stamp out dissent</i>

387
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:29,922
led to rebellion
that killed every
Targaryen except two.

388
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,383
I'm not my father.

389
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,678
No, Your Grace.
Thank the gods.

390
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:40,099
But the Mad King gave
his enemies the justice
he thought they deserved.

391
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:44,937
And each time,
it made him feel
powerful and right.

392
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,814
Until the very end.

393
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,821
I will not have the Son
of the Harpy executed

394
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,739
without a fair trial.

395
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,370
Your Grace.

396
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,872
- ( neighing )
- ( bleating )

397
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,047
There's a bug.

398
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,507
Yes, best be careful.

399
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,093
You might accidently
consume some solid food.

400
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,095
When I agreed
to come with you,

401
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,348
did I misrepresent
my intentions?

402
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,397
Besides, what else
is there for me to do

403
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,274
inside this fucking box?

404
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,359
- You don't like it?
- I want to take a walk.

405
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,527
<i>You can't.</i>

406
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,029
Cersei has offered
a lordship

407
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,239
to the man
who brings her
your head.

408
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,907
She ought to offer
her cunt.

409
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,327
Best part of her
for the best part of me.

410
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,622
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place
for me as anywhere.

411
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,876
Are we really going
to spend the entire
road to Volantis

412
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,919
talking about
the futility of everything?

413
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,088
You're right.
No point.

414
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,215
<i>The road to Volantis?</i>

415
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,218
You said we were
going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

416
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,095
The road to Meereen.

417
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,390
And what do you hope
to find at the end of
the road to Meereen?

418
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,601
I told you.
A ruler.

419
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,561
We've already got
a ruler.

420
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,272
Everywhere has already
got a ruler.

421
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,233
Every pile of shit
on the side of every road

422
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,777
has someone's banner
hanging from it.

423
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,239
You were quite good,
you know, at ruling.

424
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,784
During your brief
tenure as Hand.

425
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,952
I didn't rule.
I was a servant.

426
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,121
Still, a man of talent.

427
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,790
Managed to kill
a lot of people.

428
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:32,044
Yes, but you showed
great promise in other
areas as well.

429
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,133
She wanted me
to leave King's Landing.

430
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,260
She begged me.

431
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,845
I wouldn't go.

432
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,305
Why?

433
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,516
'Cause I liked it.

434
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,311
Power.
Even as a servant.

435
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,314
People follow leaders.

436
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,441
And they will never
follow us.

437
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,360
They find us repulsive.

438
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,694
I find us repulsive.

439
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,488
And we find them repulsive,

440
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,200
which is why we surround
ourselves with large,
comfortable boxes

441
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,160
to keep them away.

442
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,204
And yet,

443
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,373
no matter what we do,

444
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,836
people like you and me
are never really satisfied
inside the box.

445
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,463
<i>Not for long.</i>

446
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,549
You're right.

447
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,843
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

448
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,971
How many dwarves
are there in the world?

449
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,224
Is Cersei going
to kill them all?

450
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,811
<i>( fly buzzing )</i>

451
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,604
Not him.

452
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,523
Are you trying
to deceive your queen?

453
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,109
Shall I throw them
in a cell, Your Grace?

454
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,069
That won't be necessary,
Ser Meryn.

455
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,738
I don't want to dissuade
the other hunters.

456
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,407
Mistakes will be made.

457
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,284
- Thank you,
Your Grace, thank you.
- Your Grace, thank you.

458
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,077
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

459
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,163
I would take it
if you don't mind.

460
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,999
It could prove useful
for my work.

461
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,584
Very good.

462
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,715
Over there
will be fine.

463
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,468
You heard the man.
Over there.

464
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,553
<i>( door closes )</i>

465
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,580
You're the Hand
of the King?

466
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,998
No, Uncle.

467
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,500
Clearly it would not
be appropriate

468
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,668
for a woman
to assume that role.

469
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,754
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

470
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,589
and chooses a Hand
for himself.

471
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,051
Your Grace, I would
be willing to serve
provisionally

472
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,261
as the King's Hand
until he becomes
old enough--

473
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,804
You're a good man,
Lord Tyrell,

474
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,057
but I don't imagine
you'll have the time.

475
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,184
In addition to being
Master of Ships,

476
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,187
the king
has appointed you
Master of Coin.

477
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,606
Oh, Your Grace.

478
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,233
He called your experience
and wisdom

479
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,109
in financial matters
unparalleled.

480
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,987
He said he would
be honored to have you

481
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,906
represent the crown's
interests in the same.

482
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,950
The honor is all mine,
Your Grace.

483
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,119
Your Grace, in the past
on several occasions,

484
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,914
a Grand Maester has served
as the King's Hand.

485
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:19,086
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

486
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,048
Your Grace, him?
This-- this man?

487
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,635
This embarrassment
to the Citadel?

488
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,888
Your Grace,
what qualifications

489
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,807
can he possibly have
for this post?

490
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,518
The qualification
of loyalty, Grand Maester.

491
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,645
That's far more
than the eunuch ever had.

492
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,314
Far more than many
ever have.

493
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,900
I must say,
I cannot see--

494
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,319
Uncle Kevan, in light
of your position

495
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,321
as commander
of the Lannister armies,

496
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,825
it would please the king
if you would serve as his
Master of War.

497
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,078
No man living
better deserves
the title.

498
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,330
That is kind
of you to say.

499
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,541
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

500
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,293
The king is very busy
at this moment.

501
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,920
He should be here
learning what it means
to rule.

502
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,338
He is learning.

503
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,632
On this occasion,
in his capacity as ruler,

504
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,926
he's asked me to speak
on his behalf.

505
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,513
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects
to my brother.

506
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,891
And to you.
And to serve the king.

507
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,019
I did not return
to the capital

508
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,687
to serve as your puppet.

509
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,357
To watch you stack
the small council
with sycophants.

510
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,401
Sending your own brother
away so he wouldn't be--

511
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,612
My brother has left
the capital to lead

512
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,530
a sensitive
diplomatic mission.

513
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:29,740
What mission?

514
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,701
That is not your concern
as Master of War.

515
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,912
I do not recognize
your authority

516
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:39,249
to dictate what is
and is not my concern.

517
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:43,003
You are the Queen Mother,
nothing more.

518
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,259
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

519
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:52,721
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

520
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,890
At Casterly Rock.

521
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,938
<i>( door closes )</i>

522
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,900
Shireen:
<i>Come on, you know</i>
<i>this one.</i>

523
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,153
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>an animal.</i>

524
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,532
Snake.

525
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,951
Sssnake. S.

526
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,621
- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

527
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,498
Huh!

528
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,000
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history

529
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,503
Osric Stark was elected
at the age of 10?

530
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,006
I know S.

531
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,092
You'll learn,
I promise.

532
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,220
I taught Ser Davos,
and old people are terrible
at learning new things.

533
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,348
Well, you're
a wonderful teacher.

534
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,100
Very patient.

535
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,477
I only said
that the more time
that you spend practicing,

536
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,145
<i>the faster</i>
<i>you'll be able to read.</i>

537
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,023
That's all right.
We're doing just fine.

538
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:47,734
I'm sure you
and "Ostrich" Stark

539
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,320
<i>have a lot to talk about.</i>

540
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,866
How old were you
when you learned
how to read?

541
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,535
- Three.
- Three?

542
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,036
Who taught you,
your mother?

543
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,581
No, old Maester
Cressen did.

544
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,375
I had a lot of time
to practice.

545
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,752
My mother kept me
inside because...

546
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,881
What do you call it
in the south,

547
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,883
what happened
to your face?

548
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,635
Greyscale.

549
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,680
What do you call it
north of the Wall?

550
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,807
I don't know.

551
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,600
But two
of my sisters had it.

552
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,310
They both died.

553
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,812
How did they cure you?

554
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,355
I don't remember.

555
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,690
I was a baby.

556
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,984
Lots of people came
and tried, I think.

557
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,361
Whatever they did,
it went away.

558
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,823
What happened
to your sisters?

559
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:41,663
My father made them
move out of the keep
into the huts outside.

560
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,957
None of us were allowed
to go near them.

561
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,336
But we heard them,
especially at night.

562
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,591
They started to sound
not like themselves.

563
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,927
Did you ever see them?

564
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,305
Only once
at the end.

565
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,017
They were covered
with it.

566
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,021
Their faces,
their arms.

567
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,732
They acted like animals.

568
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,360
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

569
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,863
What did he do with them
in the woods?

570
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,534
<i>( footsteps )</i>

571
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,870
Mother.

572
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,622
Leave us.

573
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,584
Your Grace.

574
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,837
You need to stay
away from that girl.

575
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,422
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

576
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,424
Her name is Gilly.
She's nice.

577
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:35,759
I'm teaching her
to read.

578
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,177
She's a wildling.

579
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,887
Your father defeated
her people.

580
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,598
He executed their king
for treason.

581
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,643
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

582
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,895
Gilly wouldn't do that.

583
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,066
You have no idea
what people will do.

584
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,902
All your books
and you still don't know.

585
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,827
Stannis:
<i>I ordered Mance Rayder</i>
<i>burned at the stake.</i>

586
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,579
<i>You prevented that order</i>
<i>from being carried out.</i>

587
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,290
<i>You showed mercy</i>
<i>to Mance Rayder.</i>

588
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,584
A king's word is law.

589
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,962
Perhaps you should ask
Ser Davos how much mercy

590
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,047
<i>I show to lawbreakers.</i>

591
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,469
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

592
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,596
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

593
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,473
With respect,
Your Grace,

594
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:27,143
the free folk
will never follow you
no matter what you do.

595
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,187
You're the man who burned
their king alive.

596
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,481
Who, then?

597
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,151
You?

598
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,069
No.

599
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,238
Only one of their own.

600
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,742
Do you know
this wretched girl,

601
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,160
Lyanna Mormont?

602
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,787
The Lord Commander's niece.

603
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:50,667
Lady of Bear Island
and a child of 10.

604
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,962
I asked her to commit
her house to my cause.
That's her response.

605
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,215
"Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

606
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,718
whose name is Stark."

607
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,553
That amuses you?

608
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,807
I apologize, Your Grace.

609
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:10,312
Northerners can be
a bit like the free folk.

610
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,356
- Loyal to their own.
- Stannis:<i> I know.</i>

611
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,650
My brother Robert
went on often and loudly

612
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,528
about how difficult
it was to control them.

613
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,574
Even with
your father's help.

614
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,955
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elect a new Lord Commander.

615
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,999
Ser Alliser Thorne
is going to win.

616
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,418
- Most likely.
- Unpleasant man.

617
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,754
He thinks
you're a traitor.

618
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,924
What's your life going
to be like here at the Wall
with Thorne in command?

619
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,592
Unpleasant, I expect.

620
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,720
Your bravery
made him look weak.

621
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,555
He'll punish you for it.

622
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,474
I don't punish men
for bravery.

623
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,309
<i>I reward them.</i>

624
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,270
I don't doubt it,
Your Grace.

625
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,314
But I'm a brother
of the Night's Watch.

626
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,691
<i>I pledged them my life,</i>
<i>my honor, my sword.</i>

627
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,944
I don't know what
I have left to give you.

628
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,696
You can give me
the North.

629
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,866
I can't.

630
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,703
Even if I wanted to,
I'm a bastard, a Snow.

631
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,831
Kneel before me.
Lay your sword
at my feet.

632
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:15,293
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again
as Jon Stark,

633
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,253
<i>Lord of Winterfell.</i>

634
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,761
He'll make you a Stark
with the stroke of a pen?

635
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,640
It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

636
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,559
I'd daydream that my father
would ask the king

637
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,729
and just like that,
I would never be the bastard
of Winterfell again.

638
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,107
You deserve this.
You do.

639
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,859
I couldn't be
happier for you.

640
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,237
I'm going to refuse him.

641
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:47,701
But you'd be
Lord of Winterfell.

642
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,078
I swore a vow
to the Night's Watch.

643
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,663
If I don't take
my own word seriously,

644
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,416
what sort of Lord
of Winterfell would I be?

645
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,799
Alliser:
Crowded. You'd think
we were serving venison stew.

646
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,718
( laughter )

647
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,012
( groaning )

648
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,264
( clears throat )

649
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:14,060
Does anyone wish
to speak for candidates

650
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,771
before we cast our tokens

651
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:21,443
for the 998th
Lord Commander

652
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,944
of the Night's Watch?

653
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,115
Ser Alliser Thorne
is not just a knight,

654
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,117
he's a man
of true nobility.

655
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,953
<i>He was acting commander</i>
<i>when the Wall came</i>
<i>under attack</i>

656
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,456
- and led us to victory
against the wildlings.
- Men: Hear, hear.

657
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,416
Slynt:
<i>He's a veteran</i>
<i>of 100 battles</i>

658
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,794
and has been a defender
of the Watch and the Wall
almost all of his life.

659
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,379
Man:<i> Aye.</i>

660
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,964
He's the only true choice.

661
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,760
<i>( men cheering,</i>
<i>pounding table )</i>

662
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,804
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

663
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:53,433
and has served loyally
longer than any other ranger.

664
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,644
Through 10 winters
he served.

665
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,229
As commander
of the Shadow Tower,

666
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,773
he kept
the wildlings away.

667
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,483
<i>We could do no better.</i>

668
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,569
( men cheering,
pounding table )

669
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,822
Aemon:
<i>If there is no one else,</i>

670
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,532
<i>we will begin the voting.</i>

671
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:12,535
<i>The triangular</i>
<i>tokens count</i>

672
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,996
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

673
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,000
The square tokens
for Ser Denys Mallister.

674
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,128
-<i> Each brother will--</i>
- Maester Aemon.

675
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,758
Aemon:
<i>Samwell Tarly.</i>
<i>Go on.</i>

676
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,136
- Slynt: Sam the Slayer.
- ( men laughing )

677
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,181
Another wildling lover
just like his friend
Jon Snow.

678
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,100
How's your lady love,
Slayer?

679
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,894
- ( men laughing )
- Her name is Gilly.

680
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,771
<i>Brother Slynt</i>
<i>knows her quite well.</i>

681
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,191
They cowered together
in the larder during
the battle for the Wall.

682
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,068
- ( men laughing )
- Slynt: Lies!

683
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,987
A wildling girl,
a baby,

684
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,531
and Lord Janos.

685
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,408
I found him there
after the battle was over

686
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,827
in a puddle
of his own making.

687
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,912
( men laughing )

688
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,625
Whilst Lord Janos
was hiding

689
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,294
with the women
and children,

690
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,755
Jon Snow was leading.

691
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,007
Ser Alliser
fought bravely,
it is true.

692
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,885
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

693
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,971
He took charge
of the Wall's defense.

694
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,390
He killed the Magnar
of the Thenns.

695
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,725
He went north to deal
with Mance Rayder

696
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,937
knowing it almost
certainly meant
his own death.

697
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,860
Before that,

698
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:30,321
he led the mission to avenge
Lord Commander Mormont.

699
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,617
Mormont himself chose Jon
to be his steward.

700
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:38,496
He saw something
in Jon and now we've
all seen it, too.

701
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,207
He may be young,

702
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,585
but he's the commander
we turned to

703
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,961
when the night was darkest.

704
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,173
<i>( men cheering,</i>
<i>pounding table )</i>

705
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,432
I can't argue
with any of that.

706
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,059
But who does Jon Snow
want to command?

707
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:03,521
Night's Watch

708
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,981
or the wildlings?

709
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,776
<i>Everyone knows he loved</i>
<i>a wildling girl</i>

710
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,862
<i>and spoke with</i>
<i>Mance Rayder many times.</i>

711
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,699
What would have happened
in that tent between
those two old friends

712
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,910
if Stannis's army
hadn't come along?

713
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:21,456
We all saw him put
the King-beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.

714
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,710
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>choose a man who has fought</i>
<i>the wildlings all his life</i>

715
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,171
or a man who makes
love to them?

716
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,555
It is time.

717
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,688
It appears to be
a tie, Maester.

718
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,499
( cheering )

719
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,545
( men chanting )
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

720
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,214
( chanting continues )

721
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,479
( cooing )

722
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,743
( laughing )

723
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:24,746
You. You.

724
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:30,585
What have you
got there?

725
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,919
( laughs )

726
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,881
- I said--
- Turn around and go.

727
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,219
Turn around and go.

728
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:41,763
That's a nice
little sword.

729
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,223
Worth 100 pieces,
a sword like that.

730
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,519
Nothing's worth
anything to dead men.

731
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,982
Thug:
<i>Come on.</i>

732
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:54,692
Quickly, go! Go!

733
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,457
Who are you?

734
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,167
Why were they
scared of you?

735
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,294
You lost this.

736
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,599
You said there was
no Jaqen H'ghar here.

737
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,142
There isn't.

738
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,812
A man is not
Jaqen H'ghar.

739
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,608
Well, who are you, then?

740
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,318
No one.

741
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:40,363
And that is who
a girl must become.

742
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,705

743

Mhysa!

750
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,400
She should have cut off
the traitor's head

751
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,235
in the Great Pyramid
and been done with it.

752
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,738
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.
