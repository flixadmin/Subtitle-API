WOMAN:
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,170
I have some questions
regarding Wayne Enterprises'

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,605
business affairs.

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,342
Where's Jim?

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,848
Don Falcone thinks you don't
know how to run a club.

00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,649
(whistles)
Hi.

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,084
He'll help you out.

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,219

00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,955

Alfred, can you teach me
how to fight?

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,860
Yes, I can.

What the hell is that?

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,264
I made it. Yeah.
You made it?

20
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,199
So what is it?
It's a hood.

21
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,201
Thought it would, uh,
you know, spice things up.

22
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,669
When did we start
wearing hoods?

23
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,038
We didn't.
W-Was I supposed to get one?

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,107
No!

We're here for the bank's money!

29
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,556
So just stay cool

30
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,857
and no one will get hurt!

31
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,693
Don't be brave!

32
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,562
Don't be frightened!

33
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:37,996
Just do
what you're told!

34
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,731
This will all be over
quicker than that time

35
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,834
I hooked up with a cheerleader
on prom night!

00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,536
What are you doing up there?!

38
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,238
Getting 'em fired up.

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,306
90 seconds.

40
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,842
Nice and easy,
ladies and gentlemen!

41
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,744
You know, banks like this one--
who are insured

42
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,815
to death, by the way--
steal from us every single day!

43

'Bout time a few of us returned
the favor, don't you think?

00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,736

Not a scratch!

56
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,655
Did you see that?

57
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,124
That guy missed me
with, like, six shots.
He was, old, nervous.

58
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,126
(sirens wailing)
No, no, no, it's the hood.
I'm telling you.

59
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,595
Damn it.
We're cooked.

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,669
Attention, citizens of Gotham!

62
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,937
What the hell are you doing?!

63
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,772
There you go, everybody!

64
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,307
(cheering, shouting)

65
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,608
Take back

66
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,043
what's yours!

67
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,879
(cheering, shouting)

68
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,050
Follow me! Come on.

69
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,619
(clamoring)

70
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,465
(indistinct chatter,
cameras clicking)

71
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,210
BULLOCK:
Well,

72
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,579
we'll never know
how much cash was lost,

73
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,515
but I just saw a bum
eating oysters at Madeline's.

74
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,785
Another freak in a mask.
Awesome.

75
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:43,622
Is that guard blind or wasted?

76
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,791
Clyde refused
to wear his glasses.

77
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,593
Said they made him look old.

78
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,229
Missing a man standing 20 feet
in front of you with six shots

79
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,597
makes you look old.

80
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,265
Who tripped
the alarm?
I did.

81
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,801
Why aren't you out there,
Detective?

82
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:59,238
This brazen audacity
cannot be tolerated.

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,074
They didn't go for the vault...
just the cash

84
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,076
in the registers.
And the crew was in and out

85
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,978
in under two minutes.

86
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,779
The red-hooded man seemed nice.

87
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,147
Nice?

88
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,984
He wasn't stealing our money...
just the bank's.

89
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,518
Then he gave
a lot of it

90
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,554
back to people in the street.
Like...

91
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,323
...Robin Hood.

92
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,993
Oh, great.
This bank hires Communists.

93
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,528
Robin Hood stole from the rich
and gave to the poor.

94
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,864
These armed thieves
only threw cash away

95
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,366
to guarantee
their escape.

96
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,201
It's very different, ma'am.

97
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,736
The thief

98
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:34,006
in the back here, was he always
checking his watch?
Yes.

99
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,274
He was counting down.

100
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,109
They knew what our
response time was.

101
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,343
They'd done their homework.

102
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,345
Has the alarm been triggered
for any other reason recently?

103
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,381
No.
Well,

104
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,750
there was that time
with the smoke bomb.

105
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:45,817
Smoke bomb?

106
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,287
A week or so ago,
a small flare or firework,

107
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,821
or something, was set off
by the Mortgages desk.

108
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,557
It tripped the alarm.
We thought

109
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,626
it was just a kid's prank.

110
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,461
We're gonna need you
to find the surveillance footage

111
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,796
from that incident.

112
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,867
(thunder crashing)
(knocking on door)

113
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,903
(knocking continues)

114
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,750
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

115
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,955
Reggie?

116
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,491
Sorry for calling
so late.

117
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,593
Forgive me.

118
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,996
Oh, my God, mate.
How long's it been?

119
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,066
20 years.

120
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,070
I got picked up by the GCPD
last night

121
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:41,340
for trying to sleep
under the Westbury Bridge.

122
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,608
Here, mate.
Cheers, mate.

123
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,512
One of the officers
was a Marine, back in the day,

124
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,681
so we got to talking.
I told him

125
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,684
I was with Her Majesty's Special
Air Service back in the day.

126
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,152
So he took pity on me.

127
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:58,056
He says, "Why don't you look up
some of your old regiment,

128
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,059
you know, see if one of the guys
can... help you out."

129
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,195
Well, you know...

130
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,932
I'm pleased
you looked me up, Reg.

131
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,934
If anyone
would've told me

132
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:12,237
this is where I'd find you,
I wouldn't have believed them.

133
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,574
I like it here.

134
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,709
It's good for me.

135
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,978
I can see that.

136
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,514
I've missed you,
mate.

137
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,816
Missed your ugly mug.

138
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,120
Cheers.

139
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,124
What happened, Reggie?

140
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,060
Vanessa died.

141
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,796
11 years ago now.

142
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,799
I just couldn't find the energy

143
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:44,469
to get back out there
after that, you know?

144
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,439
A year later, I lost the house.

145
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,608
Moved back
to Gotham.

146
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,877
I've had a few jobs.

147
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,780
Nothing I'm proud of.

148
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,918
It was the drink, Alfie.

149
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,189
It was the drink.

150
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,757
BRUCE:
Alfred?

151
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,428
Um, Master Bruce.

152
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,196
This is, uh,

153
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,998
Reginald Payne.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We served together, sir.

155
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,904
Very pleased
to meet you, sir.

156
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,572
You were caught in the storm?

157
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,841
Reggie's had a run of
bad luck, Master Bruce.

158
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,177
I-I don't wish to be a nuisance.
I just...

159
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,447
I hadn't seen Alfie
in a very long time.

160
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,050
N-No, I'm glad you found us,
Mr. Payne.

161
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,619
Please, feel free to stay
with us a few days.

162
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,756
That's very kind of you, but...

163
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,890
I insist.

164
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,326
Please.

165
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,599
MOONEY:
Where are you taking me?

166
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,801
MAN:
This way, Miss Mooney.

167
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,870
(moaning, shouting in distance)

168
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,032
Who chose these people?

169
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,101
Where'd you get them from?

170
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,981
(door shuts)

171
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,617
(lock clicks)

172
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,254
Sit, please.

173
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,627
Sit.

174
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,971
There you are, Mr. Red Hood.

175
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,973
Armed robbery perps
dating back ten years.

176
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,309
I took out the dead ones
and the ones in prison.

177
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,644
A who's who
of scumbags.

178
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,213
They were casing the place
a week before they took it down.

179
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,782
Set off the alarm
then timed the response.

180
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,351
He looks pretty young.
He might not be in here.

181
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,592
You see that?

182
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,794
No, 'cause you took my glasses.

183
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,629
Right there,
underneath his coat.

184
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,098
He's wearing a work shirt.

185
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,167
"Kleg's Auto."

186
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,105
Idiot.
(chuckles)

187
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,174
(music blaring)

188
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,179
(chuckles)

189
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,348
"The Red Hood Gang"!
(chuckles)

190
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,183
It's got a ring to it.

191
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,851
No, it doesn't.
See those people?

192
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,153
They loved me.

193
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,621
They loved the money
you threw at 'em.

194
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,289
Thanks for that,
by the way.

195
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,791
Shall we take it out
of your share?

196
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,192
You guys don't get it.

197
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,861
We're not just five mooks
with shotguns anymore.

198
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,530
We're the Red Hood Gang.

199
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,999
Taking from the rich
and giving back to the poor.

200
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,867
Mark my words,

201
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,403
the people in this town,
they're gonna get me.

202
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,473
Us.
Will you shut up?

203
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,375
All that prancing around
could have gotten us killed.

204
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,644
You're wrong. That guard,
he was 20 feet away from me.

205
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,012
Not one shot got close.

206
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:14,913
Luck!

207
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,415
He looked
r-real nervous.

208
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,316
It's the hood!

209
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,018
It's good luck.
I'm telling you.

210
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,020
I feel like a totally
different person with it on.

211
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,388
Eh, sit down, will ya?

212
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,889
We need to go over
tomorrow's score.

213
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,058
Nah, this sets us apart.

214
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,528
It's a piece of cloth--
two holes cut out of it.

215
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,131
It's a symbol!

216
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,400
Whoever wears
the hood

217
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,801
should lead!
(gunshot)

218
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,169
(grunts)

219
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,342
(grunting)

220
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,884
He's right.

221
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:56,221
Any objections?

222
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,164
So...

223
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,568
you're the one causing
all of the fuss.

224
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,871
The one with
the knife now.

225
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,939
This is your facility?

226
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,141
I manage it, yes.

227
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,309
But do you own it?

228
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,045
The doctor owns it.

229
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,815
Where are you going?

230
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,551
Back to the basement.
We're done here.

231
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,552
Miss Mooney...

232
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,993
Take a seat.

233
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,962
I will talk to the doctor
and the doctor only.

234
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,665
He's away on a consultation
in Gotham.

235
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,467
Then call me when he returns.

236
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,803
He expressly asked<i> me</i>

237
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,005
to attend to your demands.

238
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,575
His name.

239
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,177
I'm sorry?

240
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,113
The doctor. His name.

241
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,317
Dulmacher.

242
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,457
You tell Dr. Dulmacher

243
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,059
that the basement is mine.

244
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,261
No one will leave

245
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,131
unless I say so.
It will remain that way

246
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,400
until he sits with me

247
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,569
and negotiates terms.

248
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,012
Perhaps...

249
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,648
you and I got off
on the wrong foot, Miss Mooney.

250
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,317
When was the last time

251
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,620
you had a shower?
A new set of clothes? Hmm?

252
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,989
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

253
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,090
(door opens)

254
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,960
Take Miss Mooney to
my private bathroom,

255
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,162
and then pick up
some fresh clothes for her

256
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,463
from storage.

257
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,132
Freshen up.

258
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,800
Come back to me.

259
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,402
And then perhaps we'll talk
some more.

260
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:57,675
COMEDIAN:
<i>So the mortician says</i>

261
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,144
to the waitress... No, the
waitress says to the mortician,

262
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,147
(clears throat)
"He was always stiff."

263
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,348
MAN 2:
That's it.

264
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,617
Let's go.
Wait. No.

265
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,554
Have a good night.
See you next week, sir. Okay.
(patrons groaning, moaning)

266
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,425
It's fine. We got, uh...
What do we have? We got, um...
MAN 3: Check, please.

267
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,761
(whispering)
COMEDIAN: ...cards.

268
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,229
Oh, okay. Um...

269
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,764
What's wrong?

270
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,033
Ah, Mr. Penguin.
I mean the Penguin. I mean...

271
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,068
I...
What is it?

272
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,637
We're out of booze.

273
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,107
What? Hello? Behind you,
there's a wall of booze.

274
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,576
Just colored water, sir.
Always has been.

275
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,714
We keep the real stuff
down here, but we're out.

276
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,583
So, duh, order more.
We did.

277
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,751
It's just that...

278
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,421
GILZEAN:
It's Maroni's booze.

279
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,490
And he's a little grumpy
with you these days.

280
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,629
He was hardly a fan
of Fish, either.

281
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,632
Why did he sell her booze?

282
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,966
Business is business.

283
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,469
But he hates you with a passion.

284
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,872
But he can't kill you, so...
That's...

285
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,408
This is ridiculous. There's
a thousand places to buy booze.

286
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,410
That's where
it gets complicated.

287
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,914
See, Maroni, he supplies
this whole side of town.

288
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,817
No one would dare cross him
to help you.

289
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,851
(patrons booing,
glass shattering)

290
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,852
Help...

291
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,020
WOMAN:
Get outta here!

292
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,022
Thank you.
Bye. Sorry.

293
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,724
MALE PATRON:
You're not funny.
(patrons murmur, catcall)

294
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,194
(snickering): You must take
great pleasure watching me fail.

295
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,929
On the contrary.

296
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,864
I was with Fish

297
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,368
when we took this place off
a Chinese bookie nine years ago.

298
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,503
It was used for cock fighting.

299
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,705
Took forever
to get the smell out.

300
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:39,043
My blood, sweat, and tears
are in this dive.

301
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:43,481
Well, if you'll excuse me,

302
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,650
it seems as though I need
to procure some alcohol

303
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,754
for my dwindling clientele.

304
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:53,224
Be careful.

305
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,660
You've seen what happens
when you cross Maroni.

306
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,939
GCPD!

307
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,949
Looks like they were here
last night.

308
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,151
Hey.

309
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,819
Your hot doctor friend,
Thompkins...

310
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,754
Leslie.
Whatever.

311
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,057
Give me the double D--
"dirty details."

312
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,193
Don't leave anything out.

313
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,728
(chuckles)

314
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,796
Gotta hand it
to you, partner.

315
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,097
You don't sit
around moping.

316
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,800
You got right back up
on the hobby horse.

317
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,501
Let's just hope you can
keep your head straight

318
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,503
whilst up there.

319
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,671
You had the purse.

320
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,139
Now you got yourself a nurse.

321
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,442
(chuckles)

322
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,446
Well, looks like I found
our friend Floyd.

323
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:57,354
What? If I don't drink it,
Forensics will.

324
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,126
GORDON: All right. This was
the guy with the hood.

325
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,794
He's wearing
the same coat.

326
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,797
I wonder what he did to
piss off the rest of his crew.

327
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,999
Maybe they knew
we'd catch up to him.

328
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,135
Well, he was the leader,
so it looks like we've seen

329
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,205
the last of the
Red Hood crew now.

330
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:18,509
(people screaming)

331
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,345
Good morning, everyone!

332
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,782
(grunting)

333
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,118
Get off me! I got it.

334
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,620
Okay.
We're not here

335
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,288
for your money.

336
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,390
We're here for the insurance!

337
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,160
I mean the bank's insured money!

338
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,628
60 seconds.

339
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,597
MAN: Hey! You gonna
share a little bit

340
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,831
of that cash with us, Hood?

341
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,832
(others agreeing)

342
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,368
Th-Thirty seconds.

343
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,271
(grunts)
MAN:
Come on. A lot of us

344
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,372
are hurting here.

345
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,507
(others agreeing)

346
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,975
Ten seconds. L-L...

347
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,376
L-Let's go!

348
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,544
Aw, fine.

349
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,281
(laughs)

350
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,583
(cheering, shouting)

351
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,020
So long, Gotham!

352
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,155
Sayonara!

353
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:12,729
(indistinct chatter)

354
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,731
And then there were four.

355
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,200
People are gonna hang out
in banks waiting for handouts

356
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,701
from these idiots.

357
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:20,870
We're never gonna catch a crew
no one wants us to catch.

358
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:21,971
Call me old-fashioned,
but when crooks

359
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,107
become more popular
than cops,

360
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,442
that's anarchy.
Think about it.

361
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,745
As long as somebody's willing
to put that red hood on,

362
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,446
this gang can go on forever.

363
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:31,714
ALVAREZ:
Hey, guys.

364
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:33,516
Got somebody here
you might want to meet.

365
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,251
This is Mister...
Chaing.

366
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,587
Chaing, right.
He's an eyewitness.

367
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,155
From the bank?

368
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:40,823
I work at a restaurant
a block away.

369
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:43,159
The Red Hood Gang parked
their van there this morning.

370
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,794
I was throwing out
the trash

371
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:46,129
when they ran back to it.

372
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,330
You see their faces?

373
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,465
Just one-- the fat
one with the hood.

374
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,034
He took it off to drive.

375
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,337
I'll get the sketch artist.
Well, wait a minute.

376
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,073
Got the armed robbery
files already opened.

377
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:59,676
Maybe he can look through them,
see if he recognizes someone.

378
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,211
Maybe that someone is
a known associate of Gus Floyd.

379
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,948
Only problem is records are
kind of old-- he might
look different now.

380
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,350
We could pull a few based
off Chaing's description.

381
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,552
Get ourselves a good
old-fashioned lineup.

382
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:12,755
Wait. Wait a second.
What's in it for me?

383
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,425
I got all these parking tickets

384
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,760
because my ex-wife
is a crazy bitch.

385
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:20,363
We'll see what we can do.

386
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:29,939
(panting)

387
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,977
Training
for a fight?

388
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,948
Just training.

389
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,583
Who's helping you?

390
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,852
Alfred.

391
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,187
Good choice.

392
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,589
Show me your stance.

393
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:55,865
Good.

394
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,333
Hit me.

395
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,002
(grunts)

396
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,504
Again.

397
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,341
(grunts)
And don't hold back.

398
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,043
You have a go at me, son.

399
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,711
(grunting)

400
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:09,545
(shouts)

401
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,181
Come on.

402
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,183
It should take more than that
to piss you off, son.

403
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:15,852
Come on.

404
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,120
Again.

405
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,688
Come on.

406
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,622
(grunts)

407
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:20,556
(shouts)

408
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:22,792
(Reggie laughing)

409
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,293
(grunting)

410
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,796
Now, now.
Never lose your cool.

411
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,331
It'll get you killed.

412
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,900
Now, you want to hit me, right?
You want to hit me, right?

413
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,036
Okay. Take a swing.

414
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,271
Take a swing.
Go on. Do it.

415
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:37,640
(grunts)

416
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:39,308
Somebody gives you
a free shot,

417
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,743
you got to make it count.

418
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,245
You hit me
as hard as you can.

419
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,913
(grunts)
Oh. Better.

420
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:45,048
Put your shoulder behind it.

421
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,649
Put your full
body weight behind it.

422
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:47,817
Go on. Do it.

423
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:48,384
(shouts)
(grunts)

424
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,486
Harder. Again.

425
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:52,689
(shouts)
(grunts)

426
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:56,159
Again.

427
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,593
Come on.
Do it again.

428
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,729
Put me on my back, son.
Come on, you can do it.

429
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,030
Come on. Again.

430
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,265
You're so much bigger than me!

431
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,599
Then use that to your advantage!

432
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:04,534
You hit me low.

433
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,769
Hit me in the knee, the ankle.

434
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:08,204
Forget
about the gloves!

435
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,572
Use whatever's around you.

436
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:12,041
Here. Here.

437
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,078
Go on.
ALFRED:
Right!

438
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,613
That's enough
of that.

439
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,251
Perhaps a shower's
in order, Master Bruce.

440
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,423
M-Mr. Payne was just showing me
some alternative methods.

441
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,258
Yeah, I can see
that, can't I?

442
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,795
Not methods that fit into our
curriculum, though, are they?

443
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:34,797
No, they're not;
but they're effective.

444
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,899
Discipline, skill,

445
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,335
and hard work are effective.

446
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,808
How 'bout I start that shower
for you, sir?

447
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:49,846
No.

448
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,122
(door opens upstairs,
then shuts)

449
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,491
You ever raised
a child before, Reg?

450
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,493
No.

451
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,728
Me neither.

452
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,665
Hardest job
I've ever had to do in my life.

453
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,502
Nothing prepares you for it.

454
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,504
Listen, I'm sorry
if I overstepped the mark.

455
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,205
I was just...

456
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:18,174
It was obvious
how much you've helped him s...

457
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,942
No, he helped me.

458
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:25,615
I'm a better person
for knowing him, Reg.

459
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,587
Let's keep our past
where it belongs.

460
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,424
In the past.

461
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,245
(snickering):
That's it? Just two workers?

462
00:21:57,548 --> 00:21:59,115
This'll be easy.

463
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,416
Make it quick, guys.

464
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,852
(sirens wailing)

465
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,459
Well, this is inconvenient.

466
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:12,094
WORKMAN:
Whoa, Officer.

467
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,095
Nothing going on here.

468
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,797
That so?

469
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,632
Eh, your liquor license
is out of date.

470
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,534
We're gonna be
confiscating the shipment.

471
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,269
Hey, does Don Maroni
know you guys are here?

472
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:23,840
Walk away...
before I run you downtown.

473
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,145
This town is truly
going to the dogs.

474
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,346
Evening, fellas.
(Oswald gasps)

475
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,681
(gun cocks)

476
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,682
(mutters indistinctly)

477
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,017
(panting)

478
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,652
Why the smile, Butch?

479
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,154
First Maroni blocks
our liquor,

480
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,689
and now the cops?

481
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,257
Oh, who, them?

482
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,458
They're with me.

483
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,294
I always keep a few
uniforms in the closet.

484
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:48,497
A lot cleaner than going in
guns blazing, don't you think?

485
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,968
You're welcome, Oswald.

486
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,870
(chuckles)

487
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,938
(siren wailing in distance)

488
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:57,840
Nice work there.

489
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:58,841
How you doing,
Mr. Gilzean?

490
00:22:58,843 --> 00:22:59,842
GILZEAN:
This over here, this...

491
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:01,644
OFFICER:
Nothing to worry about.

492
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,787
(music playing over headphones)

493
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:30,237
You okay?

494
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,042
Of course.

495
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:38,045
Thank you for
letting us stay here.

496
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:39,380
Sorry it got
a little messy.

497
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:40,648
I was just about to go.

498
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,918
I like having
you guys here.

499
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:48,489
(coughs)

500
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:49,556
Selina...

501
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,459
Come here.

502
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:58,666
You know, you're turning into
quite the beautiful woman.

503
00:23:58,668 --> 00:24:01,568
No, I'm not.

504
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,471
Remove the dirt...

505
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:06,073
that old hood...

506
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:08,075
these ratty clothes...

507
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:11,679
I bet we find
a princess undernea...

508
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,952
I have an idea.

509
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,124
Holy moly.

510
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:26,427
Take anything that
fits you guys.

511
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,429
This is all stuff you've worn?

512
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:31,198
Most of it.

513
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,334
You sure must go out a lot.

514
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:34,902
I used to.

515
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:45,679
Come with me.

516
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:01,996
You're a true beauty.

517
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:06,633
Something you can use
to your advantage.

518
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:10,771
Your appearance
can be a weapon,

519
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:14,842
as powerful
as any knife or gun.

520
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,848
Yeah?

521
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,821
What good's it done you?

522
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:33,527
(door opens)

523
00:25:40,902 --> 00:25:43,170
BULLOCK (over speaker):
All right, backs to the wall.

524
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:44,772
Hold your numbers up.

525
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:46,840
No talking.

526
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:51,545
I thought they were going
to be similar types.

527
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:52,546
They are.

528
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:54,481
Uh-huh.

529
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:56,250
Look closely, Mr. Chaing.

530
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:57,584
I know how this works.

531
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:02,823
There, number four--
the short, fat one.

532
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:04,391
You're sure?
That's your Red Hood.

533
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:07,761
Threw all that money away,
and I didn't get a cent.

534
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:10,431
Clyde Destro,
47 years old, conviction

535
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,332
for assault and armed robbery
of a convenience store

536
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:13,400
three years ago.

537
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:15,235
Let's book him.
Wait a minute.

538
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:17,504
All we have is one witness
outside of the crime scene,

539
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:18,505
that's it.

540
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:19,640
Now, Floyd was killed,

541
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:21,241
so we know they're
turning on each other.

542
00:26:21,243 --> 00:26:22,676
Let Destro go?

543
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:23,777
And tail him.

544
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:25,279
He takes us to the
other gang members.

545
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:26,847
We use them
against each other.

546
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:28,949
We catch the Red Hood Gang
red-handed.

547
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:30,084
That's right.

548
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:31,552
Can I get a ride home?

549
00:26:32,454 --> 00:26:33,754
My girlfriend will freak out

550
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:35,522
if I turn up in a patrol car.

551
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:39,593
(door opens)

552
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:43,230
Well...

553
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:45,899
don't you look lovely?

554
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:47,000
(door closes)

555
00:26:47,002 --> 00:26:49,670
There's still business
to discuss.

556
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:51,105
Of course.

557
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:52,606
The basement.

558
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,608
How do I resume operations?

559
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,277
We do have a business to run.

560
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,714
Yes, you're stealing body parts.

561
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:01,949
For who?

562
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:02,950
Oh!

563
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:05,052
We have clients...

564
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:08,355
all over the world in
need of such things.

565
00:27:08,357 --> 00:27:12,292
Also, there's the doctor's

566
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:14,361
personal experiments.

567
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,567
You have such
a presence,

568
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:23,604
Miss Mooney.

569
00:27:25,373 --> 00:27:27,441
Such a gaze.

570
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:31,178
Your eyes...

571
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,614
will fetch quite a penny.

572
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:38,185
You will take nothing from me.

573
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:39,286
Really?

574
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:40,687
Because the way I see it,

575
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:42,689
you have two choices: One...

576
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:45,626
we kill you and your little
friends in the basement.

577
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:49,296
That's an inconvenience
but an acceptable one.

578
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:51,365
Or, two...

579
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,435
...we take your eyes now

580
00:27:55,437 --> 00:27:59,406
and see how long a blind girl
can survive in the basement.

581
00:28:03,311 --> 00:28:05,312
You forgot option three.

582
00:28:05,314 --> 00:28:06,213
(grunts)

583
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:07,681
Stop her!

584
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,249
(both scream)

585
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:18,859
No!

586
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:20,260
(spoon clinks)

587
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:22,296
(thud)

588
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,701
(thunder rumbles; Alfred and
Reggie converse quietly)

589
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:30,637
I picked something out
from the cellar.

590
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,539
I hope that's okay.

591
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,274
Well, that's, uh,
extremely kind of you,

592
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:36,409
Master Bruce,
but I don't think that we...

593
00:28:37,912 --> 00:28:40,613
...that I'll be, uh,
drinking this evening.

594
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:42,048
I'm sure it's perfectly fine
to have

595
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,017
a glass of wine occasionally,
Alfred.

596
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:46,019
I-I picked an old one.

597
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:48,321
Seems a shame to let them
gather dust down there.

598
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,693
Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

599
00:28:56,764 --> 00:29:00,300
It's a rather nice Burgundy,
actually, it's 1966.

600
00:29:01,502 --> 00:29:03,169
Yeah.

601
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:05,038
It's one of your
father's favorites.

602
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,407
(chuckles)

603
00:29:10,277 --> 00:29:11,845
Why not, eh?

604
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:12,912
Take a pew.

605
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:17,684
That's very kind of you.

606
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:18,685
There you go.

607
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:19,986
Cheers, mate.

608
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:26,559
Now, the idea,
of course,

609
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:30,230
is to let it breathe
for at least an hour.

610
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:35,235
Or not.

611
00:29:35,237 --> 00:29:36,202
(slurps)

612
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:37,337
(laughs)

613
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:38,838
Ah.

614
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,839
Delicious.

615
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:41,641
(laughter)

616
00:29:41,643 --> 00:29:43,777
So he eventually
opened his backpack

617
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:45,178
and he found the
bloody snake.

618
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,247
We'd been waiting
for it all night.

619
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:48,815
He didn't even flinch.

620
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:50,750
What'd you do?
Oh, you know,

621
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:53,419
I chopped its head off
and we ate the bloody thing.

622
00:29:53,421 --> 00:29:54,354
(laughter)

623
00:29:54,356 --> 00:29:55,722
He did.

624
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:56,856
What did it taste like?

625
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,191
ALFRED:
Uh, a bit like, um,

626
00:29:58,193 --> 00:29:59,425
fast food.

627
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:00,827
(all laugh)

628
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,128
ALFRED:
It was horrible.

629
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,263
It was horrible.

630
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:04,764
It was disgusting.

631
00:30:04,766 --> 00:30:06,466
BRUCE:
So, um...

632
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:08,434
so, Mr. Payne,
you were in the Air Force?

633
00:30:08,436 --> 00:30:11,271
Special Air Service-- SAS.

634
00:30:11,273 --> 00:30:12,839
Best soldiers
in the world,

635
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:15,008
if I'm being honest.

636
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,410
So that means covert missions?

637
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:19,546
That's right.

638
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:21,281
Before a conflict,
they dropped us

639
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:23,249
behind enemy lines.

640
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:24,350
We were quiet,

641
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:27,387
precise, and deadly.

642
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:29,088
We never lost a man

643
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,157
and we always completed
our missions.

644
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:34,561
Except that once, I guess.

645
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:35,862
Yeah, well,

646
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:38,531
that's enough
of the old war stories, eh, Reg?

647
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,567
What one time?

648
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:43,536
REGGIE:
There was a sandstorm.

649
00:30:43,538 --> 00:30:45,872
We got separated.

650
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:48,274
Two of us were captured.

651
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:50,410
You?

652
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:55,148
He fought 12 of them off
before they cut him down.

653
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,617
Didn't you, Alf?

654
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,654
I'm here now, aren't I?

655
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:03,022
That's all that matters.

656
00:31:03,024 --> 00:31:04,490
(sniffs)

657
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:05,825
All right, gents,
while I have to say

658
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:06,826
this has been

00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:35,592
(sniffs)

825
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:46,270
I need a Danish.

826
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:51,375
(phone ringing)

827
00:40:52,343 --> 00:40:54,411
Yeah.

828
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:00,017
Which hospital?

829
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:06,056
(monitor beeping steadily)

830
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:21,572
(voice breaking):
I can't lose him.

831
00:41:22,507 --> 00:41:25,576
He's all I have.

832
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:32,449
(crying)

833
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,098
REGGIE:
He has nothing concrete.

834
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,369
Just faces, some dates,

835
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,371
some newspaper articles.

836
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:57,307
There's no grounds
for an investigation.

837
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,977
Just... suspicions...

838
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:03,146
some cobbled-together
theories...

839
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,816
Nothing.

840
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,985
WOMAN:
Has he had outside counsel?

841
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:10,120
I don't think so.

842
00:42:10,122 --> 00:42:13,323
WOMAN: And his caretaker,
Mr. Pennyworth?

843
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:15,993
He's in the hospital.

844
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:18,395
WOMAN:
For how long?

845
00:42:18,397 --> 00:42:20,397
If he lives,

846
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:24,334
a few weeks, give or take.

847
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:28,739
Now's the time
to make a move on the kid.

848
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:44,855
Thank you for your service,
Mr. Payne.

849
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:48,458
I doubt we'll meet again.

850
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,193
He's just a kid.

851
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:53,997
A good kid.

852
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:59,336
Good-bye, Mr. Payne.

853
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:22,859
(mimics gunshot)
