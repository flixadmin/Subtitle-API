Then I found out what was
being carried in this case.

A bleeding-edge beryllium core

the Royal Flush Gang

480
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,415
kidnapped a prisoner
named Jared Haywood.

481

Had any luck
tracking them down?

that chip's so cutting edge,

it has, like, a thousand
different applications, so...

to still be with Ray?

I am--I'm so sorry.

I shouldn't have said that.
