1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,760
Nancy!

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,300
Nancy!

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,760
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,430
Nancy!

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,640
Where are you?

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,770
Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,940
Jonathan!

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,360
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,190
Nancy!

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,740
Nancy!

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,410
Jonathan, where are you?

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,120
Jonathan!

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,910
Jonathan!

14
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,120
Jonathan, I'm right...
I'm right here!

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,040
Where are you?

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,750
- I'm right here!
- Jonathan!

17
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,210
I'm right here! Nancy!

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,510
- Just follow my voice!
- Jonathan!

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,840
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,180
Nancy!

21
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,130
Nancy?

22
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,720
Nancy.

23
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,850
Nancy!
Follow my voice!

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,770
Nancy?

25
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,280
- Jonathan!
- Nancy!

26
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,500
I got you.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,816
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

28
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,090
- She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
- That's... that's not it.

29
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,850
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

30
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,600
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.

31
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,600
So what?
Like, you're worried about her?

32
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,100
- What?
- Aw, you are.

33
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,900
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Would you just... Stop.

34
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,626
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Would you just shut up?

35
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,990
- Who knew?
- Shut up!

36
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,400
Jeez.

37
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,410
Damn. Sorry.

38
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,210
So this is it, huh?
Princess' castle.

39
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,960
I'll just be a minute.

40
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,386
Look, we gotta
go through this again.

41
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,200
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

42
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,620
- Upstairs or downstairs?
- Upstairs.

43
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,830
There was a laboratory.

44
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,800
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

45
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,130
There was this kid's room.

46
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,880
- How do you know it was a kid's room?
- More like a prison.

47
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,390
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

48
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,850
Because, I told you,

49
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,696
the size of the bed, there was a drawing,
there was a stuffed animal...

50
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,406
You didn't say
there was a drawing.

51
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,326
Yeah, there was a drawing of a...
an adult and a child.

52
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,690
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good?

53
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,020
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.

54
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,780
Wasn't Will.

55
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,960
Earl...

56
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,840
The night that Benny died,

57
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,220
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

58
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,050
Now, I pressed him,
he said it might be Will, but maybe...

59
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,930
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

60
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,350
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

61
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,520
she claims to have lost
her daughter, Jane.

62
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,020
She sued Brenner,
she sued the government...

63
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,480
Now, the claims came to nothing,
but what if...

64
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,690
I mean,
what if this whole time I've been...

65
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,450
I've been looking for Will...

66
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,490
I've been chasing after some other kid?

67
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
Nancy!

68
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,240
Better?

69
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,200
Yeah.

70
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,080
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.

71
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,760
- I can go home.
- I just figured...

72
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,750
- Yeah, no. I...

73
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,130
I don't wanna be alone.

74
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,260
- Do you?
- No. Uh... no.

75
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,210
Can you just come up here?

76
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,800
Yeah.

77
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,650
- Do you want the lights off, or...
- On.

78
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,150
Yeah.

79
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,370
You know, it...

80
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,200
it can't get us in here.

81
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,170
We don't know that.

82
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,700
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives. That's with a "Y."

83
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,700
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.

84
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,660
Mmm-hmm.

85
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,330
Mmm-hmm.

86
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,580
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.

87
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,670
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?

88
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,720
Did you get it?

89
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,720
- I got it.
- Okay.

90
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,700
Oh...

91
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,790
Hey.

92
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,290
Hey.

93
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,500
Couldn't sleep?

94
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,920
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

95
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,550
keep seeing that... thing.

96
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,060
Wherever I was, that place...

97
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,730
I think that it lives there.

98
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,650
It was feeding there.

99
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,780
Feeding on that deer.

100
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,240
That means that if...

101
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,740
if Will and Barbara...

102
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,830
Hey.

103
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,580
My mom said she talked to Will.

104
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,000
If he's alive,
there's a chance Barbara is, too.

105
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,090
That means that she's trapped...

106
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,510
in that place.

107
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,260
We have to find it again.

108
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,310
You wanna go back out there?

109
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,180
Maybe we don't have to.

110
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,560
When I saw it,
it was feeding on that deer.

111
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,770
- Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
- Right.

112
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,940
And it seems to hunt at night, like a...
a lion or a coyote.

113
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,740
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

114
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,990
It's always alone, like...

115
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,120
like a bear.

116
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,540
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

117
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,210
- And then, last night, the deer...
- Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

118
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,500
One sec.

119
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,960
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

120
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,010
That's one drop of blood in a million,

121
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,340
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

122
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,090
So you're saying it can detect blood?

123
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,180
It's just a theory.

124
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,180
We could test it.

125
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,400
But if it works...

126
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,270
At least we'll know it's coming.

127
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,070
Honey, are you up?

128
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,660
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

129
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,280
I, uh, made
some blueberry pancakes.

130
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,040
I'll be down in a second.

131
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,590
Your mom doesn't knock?

132
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,110
- Hi. Scott Clarke?
- Uh, yes.

133
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,230
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

134
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,546
- at Hawkins Middle?
- The very same.

135
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,820
Oh, wonderful.

136
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,410
...and we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

137
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,410
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

138
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,410
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

139
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,910
Oh, that's neat.

140
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,646
What we're really trying to do here,
Mr. Clarke...

141
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,290
Uh, please, call me Scott.

142
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,920
Scott.

143
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,920
What we're trying to do here, Scott,
is to connect kids from all over the state

144
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,010
and give them
the support and encouragement

145
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,090
to pursue careers in technology.

146
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,946
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

147
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,520
I agree, yes.
Completely.

148
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
So, you know any kids
you think might wanna participate?

149
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,400
Oh, I have a few in mind.

150
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,870
I just...
I can't believe she didn't come back.

151
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,016
- She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

152
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,636
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

153
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,830
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.

154
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,226
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

155
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,840
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.

156
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,040
It wasn't his fault, either.

157
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,220
- It wasn't his fault?
- No.

158
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,010
So you're saying
he wasn't way out of line?

159
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,640
- Totally, but so were you!
- What?

160
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,400
- And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break!

161
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,670
No, Mike, you give me a break!

162
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,190
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

163
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,810
I was the only reasonable one.

164
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,560
But the bottom line is...
you pushed first.

165
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,520
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

166
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,360
No! No way!
I'm not shaking his hand.

167
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
- You're shaking his hand!
- No, I'm not.

168
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,110
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

169
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,990
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished?

170
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,950
- No.
- Good.

171
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,580
Where are we going?

172
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,960
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

173
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,960
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

174
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,650
Today is a very special day.

175
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,440
Do you know why?

176
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,200
Because today, we make history.

177
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,280
Today, we make contact.

178
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,960
Here you go.

179
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,090
Ah... yum.

180
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,510
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

181
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,640
Where is Nancy?
I thought she was coming down.

182
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,930
She is.

183
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,060
Uh, she was.
I don't know.

184
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,520
Nancy, what's taking so long?

185
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,230
Nancy?

186
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,980
Nancy, come on.

187
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,170
Nan...

188
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,150
What do you want?

189
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,280
I drew first blood, so...

190
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Okay, I'll shake.

191
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,300
On one condition.

192
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,430
We forget the weirdo
and go straight to the gate.

193
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,930
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine!

194
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,720
- Fine!
- No, no, not fine!

195
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,100
Guys, seriously?

196
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,440
Do you even remember
what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

197
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,360
We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

198
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,360
and those trolls took us out one by one.

199
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,160
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

200
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,120
So we stick together, no matter what!

201
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,120
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party,
right here in this room.

202
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,130
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

203
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,460
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor...

204
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,340
She was just trying to keep us safe!

205
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,026
She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident!

206
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,260
An accident?

207
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,300
All right, accident or not...

208
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,430
- admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome?

209
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,430
Yeah, she threw you in the air
with her mind!

210
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,230
I could have been killed!

211
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,100
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!

212
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,416
Do you seriously wanna fight
the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

213
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,730
That's like R2-D2
going to fight Darth Vader.

214
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,690
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

215
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,860
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

216
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,240
'cause I'm not spending my time
on her anymore. No way!

217
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,710
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

218
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,556
<i>It's okay, Eleven.</i>

219
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,040
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

220
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,210
They're just here to watch.

221
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,090
Don't focus on them.

222
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,710
Stay in here, like before.

223
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,380
Yes, Papa.

224
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,850
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.

225
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,520
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.

226
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,730
It's reaching out to you...

227
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,650
'cause it wants you.

228
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,360
Hmm?

229
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,650
It's calling you...

230
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,490
so don't turn away from it this time.

231
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,910
I want you to find it.

232
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,080
Understand?

233
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,080
Yes.

234
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,740
<i>Are you lost?</i>

235
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,540
Is your mom here?

236
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,210
Your dad?

237
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,170
Mouth breather.

238
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,310
- What should we do?
- Uh...

239
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,770
Call the police.

240
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,820
Excuse me. Young lady!
You know you have to pay for those!

241
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,610
Hey! Stop right...

242
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,110
Please.

243
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
You have to pay for those!

244
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,870
Stop right there!
Thief! Thief!

245
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,480
Can I help you?

246
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,640
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here?

247
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,650
- Who's asking?
- The Hawkins chief of police.

248
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,370
And you want to talk to my sister?

249
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,290
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives,
then, yeah, we do.

250
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,960
Okay, well, you can come in,

251
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,170
but if you want Terry
to tell you anything,

252
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,340
you're about five years too late.

253
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,800
Terry, you have some visitors.

254
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,430
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.

255
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,560
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.

256
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,020
Um, you see, uh, my son...

257
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,360
he's been missing for almost a week now,

258
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,610
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

259
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,320
about your daughter, Jane?

260
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,410
If there's anything that you could tell us
about when she was taken...

261
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,200
What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

262
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,490
You guys keep in touch?

263
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,210
This is, uh... this is him.

264
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,750
This is Will.

265
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,590
Uh, you may have seen him on...
on the news.

266
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,920
- Uh...
- What's wrong with her?

267
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,720
I told you, you're wasting your time.

268
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,920
This is weird without Lucas.

269
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,880
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.

270
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,930
What are you talking about?

271
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,560
Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

272
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,440
He's your best friend, right?

273
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,520
- Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine. I get it.

274
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,110
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.

275
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,530
But none of that matters.

276
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,280
What matters
is that he is your best friend.

277
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,756
And then this girl shows up
and starts living in your basement,

278
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,716
and all you ever want to do
is pay attention to her.

279
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,250
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. And you know it.

280
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,920
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything

281
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,460
until you both start punching
and yelling at each other

282
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,000
like goblins
with intelligence scores of zero.

283
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,760
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.

284
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,510
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, he is, but so are you.

285
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,010
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.

286
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,810
- Says who?
- Says logic.

287
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,480
Well, I call bull on your logic,
because you're my best friend, too.

288
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,520
Okay.

289
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,150
Whoa.

290
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,530
You don't think...

291
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,030
Uh... definitely.

292
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,210
<i>Are you ready?</i>

293
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,050
She was a part of some study
in college.

294
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,510
- MK Ultra?
- Yeah, that's the one.

295
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,350
Was, uh, started in the '50s.

296
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,850
By the time Terry got involved,

297
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,140
it was supposed to be ramping down,
but the drugs just got crazier.

298
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,770
Messed her up good.

299
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,190
This was the CIA that ran this?

300
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,900
You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M."

301
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,450
They'd pay... you know,

302
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,490
a couple hundred bucks
to people like my sister,

303
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,250
give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.

304
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,120
And then they'd strip her naked
and put her in these isolation tanks.

305
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,040
- Isolation tanks?
- Yeah.

306
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,170
These big bathtubs, basically,

307
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,880
filled with salt water,
so you can float around in there.

308
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,630
You lose any sense of, uh...

309
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,510
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

310
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,890
They wanted to expand
the boundaries of the mind.

311
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,350
Real hippie crap.

312
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,076
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

313
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,350
The thing is, though, is that

314
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,520
she didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

315
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,110
Jane.

316
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,990
Do you have any pictures of her?

317
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,080
I don't think you guys understand.

318
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,370
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

319
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,590
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

320
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,680
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

321
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,560
like she's gonna come home someday.

322
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,100
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

323
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,980
Abilities?

324
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,650
You read any Stephen King?

325
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,280
You guys look scared, actually.

326
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,200
I mean, it's all make-believe.

327
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,120
What... what kind of abilities?

328
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,920
Telepathy, telekinesis...

329
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,800
You know, shit you can do with your mind.

330
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,840
That's why the big, bad Man
stole Jane away.

331
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,390
Papa!

332
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,470
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

333
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,730
You know, the doctors all say
it's a coping mechanism.

334
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,520
You know, to deal with the guilt.

335
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,570
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

336
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,940
About having had the kid.

337
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,820
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

338
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,990
Doctors and nurses
all confirm that she miscarried.

339
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,240
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right?

340
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,250
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

341
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,360
Oh, man.

342
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,120
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

343
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,000
What you kids doin' with all this?

344
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,420
Um...

345
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,300
- Monster hunting.
- Huh.

346
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,680
"Monster hunting"?

347
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,060
You know, last week...

348
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,980
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

349
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,900
It took me and Barb all weekend.

350
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,860
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now...

351
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,490
You're shopping for bear traps
with Jonathan Byers.

352
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,530
Yeah.

353
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,030
What's the weirdest part?

354
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,370
Me or the bear trap?

355
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,620
You.
It's definitely you.

356
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,960
Hey, Nance!

357
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,550
Can't wait to see your movie.

358
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,010
What the hell was that?

359
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,800
I don't know.

360
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,560
What?

361
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,770
What?

362
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,440
Hey! Where are you going?

363
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,770
Nancy, wait!

364
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,650
Nancy!

365
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,210
- I can't believe it.
- These kids!

366
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,620
Jesus.

367
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,050
Wow.

368
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,340
Wait!

369
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,076
Tommy,
you write like a three-year-old.

370
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,116
- Shut up!
- I didn't know you could spell.

371
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,110
Aw, hey there, princess!

372
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,780
Uh-oh! She looks upset.

373
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,320
- Oh!
- Damn!

374
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,740
What is wrong with you?

375
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,176
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

376
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,740
I was worried about you.

377
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,966
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you.

378
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,250
- What are you talking about?
- I wouldn't lie if I were you.

379
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,500
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

380
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,790
Speak of the devil.

381
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,130
Hi.

382
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,970
You came by last night?

383
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,550
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Does she get a prize?

384
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,390
Look, I don't know what you think you saw,
but it wasn't like that.

385
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,850
What, you just let him into your room
to... study?

386
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,520
Or for another
pervy photo session?

387
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,206
- We were just...
- You were just what?

388
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,820
Finish that sentence.

389
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,780
Finish the sentence.

390
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,290
Go to hell, Nancy.

391
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,500
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

392
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,186
You know what, Byers?
I'm actually kind of impressed.

393
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,806
I always took you for a queer,
but I guess you're just

394
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,840
a little screw-up like your father.

395
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,590
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.

396
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,236
You know, I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

397
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,526
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

398
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,776
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom...

399
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,696
I'm not even surprised
what happened to your brother.

400
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,760
Steve, shut up!

401
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,906
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you,

402
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,330
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire...

403
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,270
Steve!

404
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,020
Oh!

405
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,690
Steve.

406
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,530
Stop! Steve!
Knock it off, you guys!

407
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,756
- Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!

408
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
Get off! Stop!

409
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,556
- Get in there, he's going to hurt himself!
- Easy, easy!

410
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,330
Hey. Hey! Get out of here!
Get out of here! Get out of here!

411
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,750
Jonathan, stop!
Stop! You're going to hurt him!

412
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,800
Jonathan, stop!

413
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,040
- Cops!
- Guys... Jonathan, get off of him!

414
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,260
- Stop it!
- Cops! Come on!

415
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,260
- Stop it! Come on!
- Cops!

416
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,510
- You have to stop!
- Just go, Carol!

417
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,060
Stop it!

418
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,826
Hey, he's had enough, man!
I said he's had enough!

419
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,600
- Kids! All right!
- Stop it!

420
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,690
Oh! My nose!

421
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,560
Calm him down!

422
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,230
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

423
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,200
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Come here, little guys! Come here!

424
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,860
- Get off!
- I got this one!

425
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,870
Get back here!
Get back here, you little punks!

426
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,920
<i>Good gift for a college student...</i>

427
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,106
Well, thank you for your time.
We appreciate it.

428
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,330
Hmm, yeah,
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

429
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,480
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

430
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,280
Hey...

431
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,900
What?

432
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,030
We're gonna find him.

433
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,240
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

434
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,120
We're close.

435
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:04,210
Twelve years?
Twelve years she's been looking for her...

436
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,026
And then she shows up
at Benny's five nights ago,

437
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,290
which means we've got a chance.

438
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,050
You know what I would give?

439
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,340
For a chance?

440
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,140
You know what I would give?

441
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,656
<i>Hey, Chief, you there?</i>

442
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,850
<i>- Hey, Chief?</i>
- Yeah, go ahead.

443
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,730
<i>Yeah, a fight broke out here and...</i>

444
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,020
- Cal, I don't have time for this.
<i>- It's Jonathan Byers.</i>

445
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,150
<i>You haven't seen Joyce, have you?</i>

446
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,960
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

447
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,170
You, yes. Him, no.

448
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,500
He assaulted a police officer.

449
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,896
Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

450
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,090
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

451
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,380
He's not my boyfriend.

452
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,970
I think you better tell him that.

453
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,720
What?

454
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,560
Only love makes you that crazy,
sweetheart.

455
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,480
And that damn stupid.

456
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,320
Found some ice.

457
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,870
Thanks.

458
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,960
Everything okay?

459
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,840
Yeah.

460
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,550
Everything's fine.

461
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,480
El!

462
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,400
Eleven!

463
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,740
- Eleven! El!
- El!

464
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,620
Eleven!

465
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,910
Eleven!

466
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,800
- Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
- What?

467
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,960
El!

468
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,010
El?

469
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,800
Hey, there, Frogface.

470
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,760
Toothless.

471
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,720
Shit! Run, Mike!

472
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,850
- What?
- Run! Come on!

473
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,100
You're dead, Wheeler.

474
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,900
Move, Mike!

475
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,570
Mike, come on, run!

476
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,730
Cramp!

477
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,480
Just keep going!

478
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,730
Keep going!

479
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,320
Shit!

480
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,200
- Stay back!
- Don't come any closer!

481
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,410
Nice throw, numbnuts.

482
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,420
Get off! Get off me!

483
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,380
Let him go! Let him go!

484
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,420
- Stay back, or I cut him!
- What do you want?

485
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,720
I want to know how you did it!

486
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,156
How I did what?

487
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,470
I know you did something to me.

488
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,430
Some nerdy science shit
to make me do that.

489
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,770
You mean piss your pants?

490
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,430
Our friend has superpowers,

491
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,940
and she squeezed your tiny bladder
with her mind.

492
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,400
Shut up!

493
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,820
I think I should save Toothless here
a trip to the dentist.

494
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,610
Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.

495
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,530
Let him go.
Let him go!

496
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,820
I'll let him go, sure.

497
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,200
But first... it's your turn.

498
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,410
My turn for what?

499
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,120
Wet yourself.

500
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,960
- What?
- Jump...

501
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,500
or Toothless here
gets an early trip to the dentist.

502
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,920
Stop! No!

503
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,710
I'll cut him right now!

504
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,680
All right, just hold on!
Hold on!

505
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,100
Mike, don't do it.
I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!

506
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,060
Mike, seriously, don't!

507
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,830
Mike, don't do it!

508
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,750
Seriously, don't do it, man!
Seriously, don't!

509
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,710
Troy, I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

510
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,170
Mike, don't!

511
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,880
Dentist's office opens in five...

512
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,380
Four! Three!

513
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,260
- Two!
- Mike!

514
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,350
One!

515
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,110
Holy shit.

516
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

517
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,860
She broke my arm! My arm!

518
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,980
Go.

519
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,910
- Let's get out of here! Let's go!
- Go!

520
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,910
Yeah, that's right!
You better run!

521
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,120
She's our friend and she's crazy!

522
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,580
You come back here and she'll kill you!

523
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,630
You hear me?
She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!

524
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,750
She'll kill you, you hear me?

525
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,160
<i>El, are you okay?</i>

526
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,830
El?

527
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,670
Mike... I'm sorry.

528
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,210
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

529
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,670
The gate...

530
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,970
I opened it.

531
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,060
I'm the monster.

532
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,150
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

533
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,810
You saved me.

534
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,780
Do you understand?
You saved me.

535
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,320
I have eyes on 'em now.
They're heading home.
