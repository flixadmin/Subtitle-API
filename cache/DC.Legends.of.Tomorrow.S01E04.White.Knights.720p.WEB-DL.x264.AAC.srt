00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:05,035
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:07,739
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,709
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,110
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,680
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,749
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,185
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,920
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:25,622
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,261
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

12
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,729
<i>His name is Chronos.</i>

13
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,464
<i>He works for the council
of Time Masters.</i>

14
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,366
Chronos was clearly sent
to bring me in.

15
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,402
<i>The Lazarus Pit
brought me back,</i>

16
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,503
<i>but it left me
with this need to kill.</i>

17
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,039
Sara! Sara, don't!

18
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,775
I'm dangerous.

19
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,777
Up until two months ago,
I was a barista,

20
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,113
Not some damn
winged demigoddess.

21
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,581
Be the person, the woman,

22
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,883
The warrior
you were meant to be.

23
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,995
That wasn't so bad, was it?

24
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,398
Walk in the park.
So where are we now?

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,434
Washington, D.C.
The year is 1986.

26
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,670
We've landed at the height
of the cold war

27
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,740
In a world poised
for nuclear annihilation.

28
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,641
<i>We've traveled here
because I have a new lead</i>

29
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,843
<i>on Vandal Savage's location.</i>

30
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,144
Yes.

31
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,179
Gideon managed to intercept
this telefax concerning

32
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,447
Savage's last known whereabouts.

33
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,682
Tele-what?

34
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,117
It's like an email...

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,385
On paper.

36
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,520
Wow,
that's totally useless.

37
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,888
Dude,
this whole thing's crossed out.

38
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,523
Yeah, redacted
by the U.S. Government,

39
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,158
Which is why we are here
to steal the original file

40
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,495
On Savage back from those
who are tracking him.

41
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,533
Uh, that's the...

42
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,701
Now, now...

43
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,137
Don't worry.
We are cloaked.

44
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,539
You want us to break in
to the pentagon?

45
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,607
Sounds awesome.

46
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,875
It sounds crazy.

47
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:50,876
What's the plan?

48
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,444
Oh, the fabricator
will fashion you

49
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,012
The necessary
pentagon credentials.

50
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,682
Ooh, and don't forget
our g-man disguises.

51
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,618
I always wanted
to be a spy.

52
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:16,268
Now, the file we're after is
kept in a secure records room.

53
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,171
In order to gain access,
we're going to need to, uh,

54
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,806
Borrow a magnetic key card.

55
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,175
Because this is so much easier
than just shrinking down

56
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,676
And stealing it.

57
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,612
Let me show you
how it's done...

58
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,481
Old school.

59
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,451
You okay, ma'am?

60
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:36,021
I wasn't watching
where I was going.

61
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,022
Thank you.

62
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,223
Just doing my job.

63
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,863
That's a nifty
little trick.

64
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,465
Really?

65
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,900
We're trying to save the world
and you're lifting wallets?

66
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,669
It's called multitasking.

67
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,622
The records room
has closed-circuit cameras.

68
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:11,823
We need a diversion.

69
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,459
<i>Someone call my name?</i>

70
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,127
<i>Yeah! Whoo-hoo!</i>

71
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,908
Double or nothing
says I put this punk

72
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,109
On the pinewood.

73
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,711
Yeah, I'll take a piece
of that action.

74
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,647
<i>We got the file.</i>

75
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,048
<i>Okay, now
for the tricky part.</i>

76
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,117
<i>All personnel
are subject to search</i>

77
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,653
<i>Upon exiting the pentagon.</i>

78
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:46,258
<i>Firestorm will divert the power
long enough for you to exit.</i>

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,260
Ready when you are.

80
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,331
<i>All clear.</i>

81
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,235
<i>What did you do, Jefferson?</i>

82
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,937
<i>I warned you about
the electromagnetic pulse.</i>

83
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,372
<i>Now you've touched
a neutral wire,</i>

84
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,940
<i>Causing the power
to pass through us.</i>

85
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,675
You mean,
"pass through me".

86
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,077
<i>If you knew anything about
alternating current power...</i>

87
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,612
- Gray?
<i>- Yes, Jefferson?</i>

88
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,613
Shut up.

89
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,555
The alarm!

90
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,723
This is a restricted exit.

91
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,358
Sorry, we must have
gotten lost.

92
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,460
I'm going to need to see
your key card, ma'am.

93
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,632
We have a code seven violation.

94
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,409
We have a slight problem.

95
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,247
It's been fun, fellas.

96
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,248
Back!

97
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,120
Where is that smoke
coming from?

98
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,288
Ah!

99
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,756
We've got the file.

100
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,478
What the hell does Kendra
think she's doing?

101
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,095
Good question.

102
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,566
All right, wonderful,
we've got a demigoddess

103
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:02,834
who's gone
completely berserk.

104
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,636
Abort.
I repeat, abort.

105
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,104
Get back to ship right now.

106
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,973
<i>Roger that.</i>

107
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,843
I meant, "use the door",

108
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,578
but while you're at it,
can you help return

109
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,614
our winged avenger
to her cage?

110
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,058
Instead of dwelling
on what went wrong,

111
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,260
Let's focus on the positive.

112
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,062
What are you talking about?
It was awesome.

113
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,897
In the same way that
tsunamis, earthquakes,

114
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,699
And other natural disasters
are "awesome".

115
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,668
We got the file on Savage.

116
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,303
Despite the hiccup
with the alarm?

117
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,904
Oh, so it's my fault now?

118
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,840
You know, maybe if you
weren't always yammering away

119
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,475
In my head,
I could actually focus.

120
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,644
You have access to 60 years
of knowledge and experience.

121
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,312
Why not just take advantage
of that?

122
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,748
Because it's my body on
the line out there, not yours.

123
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,449
Hey, it's not your fault.

124
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,718
Everything would have been fine
if big bird over here

125
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,953
Hadn't freaked out.

126
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,221
- Excuse me?
- Enough.

127
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,957
There is plenty of blame
to go around.

128
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,793
Now, fortunately, Gideon was
able to generate a low-end EMP,

129
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,795
which erased all the pentagon's
magnetic media.

130
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,463
Like security footage?

131
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,198
Look, you're just lucky
that the department of defense

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,867
Likes to keep incidents
like this under wraps.

133
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,636
Gideon, any luck
with our purloined secret file?

134
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,405
- Please say yes.
- <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

135
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,874
<i>According to the pentagon,
Savage has defected</i>

136
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,877
<i>to the soviet union.</i>

137
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,446
So the most powerful evil
the world has ever known

138
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,448
has just gone red
at the height of the cold war.

139
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,517
And now he's gonna help them
cook up something

140
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,652
that kills the future.

141
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,422
Gideon, set a course...

142
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,557
for the soviet union.

143
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,097
<i>Captain, we've just crossed
into soviet airspace.</i>

144
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,332
Don't worry, Jefferson,
we are moving far too fast

145
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,101
for anyone to track us.

146
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,870
<i>I'm afraid that's not true.
Someone is tracking us.</i>

147
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,543
I thought
this ship was cloaked.

148
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,645
<i>It is.</i>

149
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,846
Boba Fett's back.

150
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,181
Chronos must have
followed us

151
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,083
when we made the jump
from the '70s.

152
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,518
Sir, we have a lock
on the Waverider.

153
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,820
Prepare to fire.

154
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,254
<i>He's closing fast.</i>

155
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,823
<i>Captain,
what would you like me to do?</i>

156
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,057
Slow down, drop our cloak,

157
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,559
and make as much noise
as possible.

158
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,794
Whoa, that's, like,
top three on the list of things

159
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,162
we definitely shouldn't do.

160
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,664
Just trust me.

161
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,937
We run out of gas
or something?

162
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,105
<i>Chronos is still
in pursuit.</i>

163
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,639
<i>Weapons systems tracking.</i>

164
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,241
Look, if this is your idea
of trying to lose him, then, m...

165
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,310
Uh-huh.

166
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,078
The soviet air force
to the rescue.

167
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,480
Now, let's see how badly
Chronos wants to follow us.

168
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,600
Wow, it's a MIG-21.

169
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,362
No one's ever been this close
to one before.

170
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,370
Are you quoting "Top Gun"?

171
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,672
Maybe.

172
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,997
<i>I've got
heat-seeking missiles</i>

173
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,499
<i>Closing at a distance
of less than a mile.</i>

174
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,231
Which is why I need you
to cut the engines.

175
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:52,936
Whoa, wait,
don't we need those to land?

176
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,739
I said, "cut them", Gideon.

177
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
<i>Missiles are now targeting
something else.</i>

178
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:01,622
Chronos.

179
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,600
I suggest you all
strap yourselves in.

180
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,560
It's going to be a bit
of a bumpy landing.

181
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,689
<i>Initiating
emergency landing protocol.</i>

182
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,687
How's it going, Gideon?

183
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,062
<i>There's not much more
I can do.</i>

184
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,864
<i>Elevation is 5,000.
4,000. 3,000.</i>

185
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,266
When I said, "bumpy",

186
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,869
I meant, "prepare
for crash landing".

187
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,819
<i>Good news, Captain.</i>

188
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,253
<i>Despite our rough landing,</i>

189
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,255
<i>The ship is
still fully operational.</i>

190
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,524
Welcome to the U.S.S.R.,
gentlemen.

191
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,895
If it were up to me,
they would revoke

192
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,130
your pilot's license.

193
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,265
"They" are
more than welcome to,

194
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,067
considering I don't have one.

195
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,170
Did you get anything on Savage
from the pentagon file?

196
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,905
It appears our friend
has been quite busy

197
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,973
since we last saw him.

198
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,241
Svarog?

199
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,610
God of fire
in Slavic mythology;

200
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,112
A secret project
the soviets are working on.

201
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,981
Considering
Savage's involvement,

202
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,717
Most likely some sort of weapon.

203
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,085
Valentina Vostok.

204
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,054
Graduated top
of her physics program

205
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,622
And then just dropped out
of academia.

206
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,191
To help develop
Savage's new weapon, no doubt.

207
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,826
The cold war's up for grabs,

208
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,461
And Miss Vostok
is the linchpin.

209
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,530
I say we put two
in the back of her head

210
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,298
And call it a day.

211
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,867
We have no idea
who this woman is

212
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,535
Or what her effect may be
on history.

213
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,437
She may be the next madame curie
for all we know.

214
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,539
She's working for Savage.
That's all we need to know.

215
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,508
She probably has no idea
who's backing her research.

216
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,577
Just let me approach her
as a scientist,

217
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,146
And we'll see what she knows
about Savage's weapons program.

218
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,249
It's 1986, you're American,

219
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,950
And you don't speak Russian.

220
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,286
She'll have you pegged
as a spy in a second.

221
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,587
Perhaps I can help
with that.

222
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,293
Ingestible translators.

223
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,328
They attach to your larynx
via neural interface.

224
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,097
Swallow them;
you can speak and understand

225
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,065
Any language spoken to you.

226
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,203
How... how do you turn it on?

227
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,438
Gideon?
Switch them into Russian.

228
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,476
Go on.
Say something.

229
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,715
Wait, I'm still
speaking English.

230
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,157
I'm speaking Russian now,
aren't I?

231
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,992
Now you're annoying
in multiple languages.

232
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,828
Gideon, switch him
back to English.

233
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,797
Now, according
to Vostok's file,

234
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,998
She's a big fan
of the ballet.

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
She has box seats
at the Bolshoi

236
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,168
And attends every performance.

237
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,469
<i>It seems
the final performance</i>

238
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,305
<i>Of "le roi candaule"
is today.</i>

239
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,906
Dr. Palmer,
you will engage Vostok

240
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,175
At the ballet,
whilst you, Mr. Snart...

241
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,576
You're going to be
his wingman.

242
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,844
Oy.

243
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,613
Better go bone up
on Vostok's CV.

244
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,581
I guess I'll bone up
on the ballet.

245
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,984
Gideon, bone me.

246
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,220
We have a problem.

247
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,756
Right, you're going to have to
be a little bit more specific.

248
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,325
It's Kendra.

249
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,161
She's completely unstable;
you saw her at the pentagon.

250
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,063
That psycho priestess Chay-Ara
took over

251
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,297
And clawed a guard's eyes out.

252
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,367
Perhaps Kendra just needs
a bit of time.

253
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,568
Remember, it was
her first time out in the field

254
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,337
Since Carter's death.

255
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,272
Well, Carter's not going to be
the only dead body on our hands

256
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:18,810
If someone doesn't get her
under control.

257
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,745
You know,
perhaps you're right,

258
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,580
And it just so happens

259
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,783
I have the perfect candidate
for the job.

260
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,985
No.

261
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,786
No, I was not talking
about me.

262
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,923
And yet, I can think of no one
better suited to the task.

263
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,491
I'm not a fan of feelings.

264
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,960
If Kendra needs someone
to talk through her grief with...

265
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,195
Kendra needs someone
to help her

266
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,230
Get her warrior side
under control.

267
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,732
I imagine you,
above anyone else,

268
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,734
Know how to do that.

269
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,337
This is a bad idea.

270
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,254
I got eyes on Vostok.

271
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,156
She's headed straight for you,
lover boy.

272
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,524
All right, gentlemen.

273
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,993
Everything's looking good
from my end.

274
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,829
Proceed.

275
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,698
Ms. Vostok.

276
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,867
Simon Huntsberger,
university of Moscow

277
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,970
Physics department.

278
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,139
I'm not interested
in talking to student.

279
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,041
If you want lecture,
come by office hours.

280
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,709
I'm actually
a fellow scientist.

281
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,244
I read your paper
on applied physics

282
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,612
And nuclear fusion.

283
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,447
Perhaps, if you allow me
to take you to dinner,

284
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,915
We can discuss in detail.

285
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,655
Damn, that was cold,

286
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,592
Even by Russian standards.

287
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,727
Heads-up.

288
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:45,997
What the hell is this?

289
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,365
Warriors train every day.

290
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,735
Sorry,
but I'm not in the mood.

291
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,204
"Sorry" is not gonna help
that guard that you defaced

292
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,305
At the pentagon.

293
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,707
Two months ago,
I was a barista.

294
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,177
I had no idea
I had some psycho hawk goddess

295
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,445
Inside of me,

296
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,246
And then I meet Carter,
and he convinces me

297
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:06,818
To let her out,
and now that he's gone...

298
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,920
I can't control it,

299
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,655
So thanks for the offer,

300
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,458
But I won't risk
letting that monster out again.

301
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,461
That monster inside you
is not gonna go away.

302
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,298
You have to learn
how to control her.

303
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,400
And how, exactly,
do you expect me to do that?

304
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,839
Let's find out.

305
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,714
<i>Temporal anomaly detected.</i>

306
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,915
Chronos.

307
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,417
<i>The Russian jet
damaged his ship.</i>

308
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,119
He's still alive?

309
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,888
<i>He went down just outside
Moscow city limits.</i>

310
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,056
Mr. Rory,

311
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,324
How would you like
to accompany me

312
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,625
On a little mission?

313
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,026
Will I get to use my gun?

314
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,828
A near-certain likelihood.

315
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,330
Lead the way, Captain.

316
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,801
<i>You struck out, Raymond.</i>

317
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,836
<i>Maybe I should
take a crack at her.</i>

318
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,874
I think we may have
gotten off on the wrong foot.

319
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,276
- I don't mean to bother you...
- Too late.

320
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,778
But, as an investor,
I'm in a position

321
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,413
to fund your research.

322
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,415
That is why
I wanted us to meet.

323
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,552
Easy, Raymond,
you're gonna spook her.

324
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,323
I think it's important to know
who's funding your research,

325
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,825
Don't you think?

326
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,193
For instance...

327
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,561
Project Svarog.

328
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,601
Sorry,
is this man bothering you?

329
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,404
Don't trouble yourself.
I'm not a damsel in distress.

330
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,240
Good,
because I'm not a white knight.

331
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,745
Seems intermission is over.

332
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,814
You wouldn't want to miss
Queen Nisia dancing naked

333
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,283
with the nymphs.

334
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:49,153
My favorite part
of the ballet,

335
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:52,857
but I've seen it
so many times.

336
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:56,994
Perhaps, you wouldn't mind
walking me home instead.

337
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,676
- I hate nature.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

338
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:15,580
Thirty meters.

339
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,915
Chronos must be hiding out
in the trees.

340
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,521
Is that any way
to treat an old friend?

341
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,159
Time master Druce,

342
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,594
How on earth
did you find me?

343
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,262
You haven't exactly
been subtle.

344
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,630
Can I waste this guy?

345
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,198
Could you give us a moment?

346
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,435
You said I'd get
to use my gun.

347
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,839
Hmm.

348
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:45,376
What a colorful team
you've assembled for yourself.

349
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,611
I thought that you were...

350
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,446
Chronos?

351
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,348
He was killed in the crash,
I'm afraid.

352
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,650
I was sent to scuttle
his time ship,

353
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,385
Lest it be discovered
by the soviets.

354
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,254
And you left
a temporal anomaly.

355
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:59,457
To lure you
out of the cold, as it were.

356
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,126
You've turned your back
on the very institution

357
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,328
You were meant to serve.

358
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,331
Our job is to protect time,

359
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,133
Thereby protecting
all life.

360
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,469
I am trying
to save the world

361
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,471
From complete destruction.

362
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,273
You and your band
of rogues have run rampant

363
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,607
Throughout history.

364
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,442
This is why
we work alone, Rip.

365
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,945
A team is a liability;
you've proven that.

366
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,747
They keep you from making
the tough choices.

367
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,849
I am here
because the council refused

368
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,751
To make that tough choice.

369
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,820
Well, they can sometimes
be slow to realize the obvious,

370
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,458
But I've been authorized
to offer you a deal.

371
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,160
End this foolish crusade;
return with me

372
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,662
To the vanishing point.

373
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,032
You'll be acquitted
of all charges, and in...

374
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,668
A few hundred years,
we may even be able to fix

375
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,269
The damage you've caused.

376
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,804
And what about my team?

377
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,507
They will be returned
to their own timelines unharmed,

378
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,477
Which is more than I can say
for Carter Hall.

379
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,479
You were one
of my brightest pupils

380
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,249
And by far my favorite.

381
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,085
Will you at least
consider my offer?

382
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,856
I'll consult
with my comrades.

383
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,625
Please do, Rip,

384
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,093
And then meet me here
in an hour.

385
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,832
And if I don't?

386
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,770
Then you're beyond my help.

387
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,881
That's a pretty sweet deal

388
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,650
"time cop" offered you
back there.

389
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,485
Well, I see we can add
"eavesdropping"

390
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,087
To your criminal resume.

391
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,690
Maybe you should start
thinking more like a crook.

392
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,892
Your friend's planning on
killing you.

393
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,863
Time master Druce is one
of my most trusted friends;

394
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,665
Besides, if he wanted
to do me any harm,

395
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,633
Why didn't he do it just now
when he had the chance?

396
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:53,237
Because he wants you to
bring the whole team with you,

397
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,705
And that's not gonna happen,

398
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,041
Because I'm taking a pass.

399
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,921
Are we done here yet?

400
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,423
If you want
to harness your power,

401
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,958
You need to learn
to control your fear.

402
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,026
Yeah, well, you've
been training for half your life

403
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,962
To be some
cold-blooded assassin,

404
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,064
So I really don't think
you understand what it's like.

405
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,266
Before you can control it,

406
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,201
You have to accept
that it's part of you.

407
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,705
Ease up, will you?

408
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:31,575
You've got to
channel your anger.

409
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,743
Sara, stop.

410
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,513
Push down your emotions.

411
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,148
Focus on your opponent.

412
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,254
Kendra?

413
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,894
Sara!

414
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,562
Sara, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry...

415
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,635
Sara, what are you doing?
It's me!

416
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,126
Are you sure
you don't want your coat back?

417
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,094
I can't believe
how you're not freezing.

418
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,597
Oh, I love the cold.

419
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,098
And ballet.

420
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,636
So what is it about the ballet
that you love, Valentina?

421
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,606
The combination
of grace and strength,

422
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,275
Pushing the body
to its breaking point.

423
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,311
It's a thing of beauty.

424
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,313
My apartment.

425
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,815
You know,
this time of night,

426
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,517
It's colder
than a Siberian winter.

427
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,152
It sounds perfect.

428
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,154
You know, I'm sure we could
heat it up.

429
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,324
Sadly, I have business
elsewhere this evening.

430
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:56,460
Well...

431
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,529
If this is good-bye...

432
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,117
You enjoy the show,
Raymond?

433
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,553
I think I've got frostbite
in some not-so-fun places

434
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,088
From waiting out here.

435
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,589
Did she tell you
what kind of weapon

436
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,590
Savage is building?

437
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,158
Didn't come up.

438
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,462
Such a romantic evening;
I didn't want to spoil the mood.

439
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,897
So other a steamy
good night kiss

440
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,032
And a possible case of
hypothermia,

441
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,033
We've got nothing.

442
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,568
I wouldn't say that.

443
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,137
It's Valentina's security badge
for a place called

444
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,906
Luskavic labs.

445
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,108
Whatever weapon she's building
for Savage,

446
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,743
We'll find it there.

447
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,245
I guess I should just be happy
you didn't swipe her wallet.

448
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,621
So, uh, what happens?

449
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,156
You hand over the ship
and turn yourself in

450
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,958
To the Time Masters,
and the rest of us just...

451
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Will be returned
to your former lives

452
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,728
In January 2016.

453
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,163
It will be
as if you never left.

454
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,966
Aside from the fact that
Starling City might be part

455
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,701
Of the U.S.S.R.,
thanks to our efforts.

456
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,269
All the more reason
to consider the offer.

457
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,605
The time council will do
everything within their power

458
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,106
To correct the mistakes
that we've made.

459
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,875
But they still haven't
changed their mind

460
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,143
About stopping Savage?

461
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,678
Well,
according to them, he's part

462
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,446
Of the natural course
of history,

463
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,481
Terrible as that course may be.

464
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,883
Look, I'm not saying
that this offer

465
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,118
Is without its downsides.

466
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,087
If we abandon our plan now,
then I still lose

467
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:30,888
My wife and son.

468
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,523
So why throw in the towel?

469
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,992
I thought you said this mission
was bigger than any one of us.

470
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,161
Yes, but if you'll remember,
when I first recruited you,

471
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:40,664
I wasn't entirely forthright
about my motivations

472
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,868
Or about how dangerous
this mission would be.

473
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,207
Carter hall knew the risks
before he signed on.

474
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,010
Hmm.

475
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,912
Well, for the rest of you,
it's now time to decide

476
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,181
Whether the future
is worth fighting for.

477
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,761
I cannot tell you

478
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:14,965
How pleased I am
to see you, Hunter.

479
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:18,569
I finally came
to my senses.

480
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,170
You were right, as always.

481
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,772
I've risked the lives
of my team;

482
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,875
I've endangered the very fabric
of time itself.

483
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,844
I only hope
you can forgive me.

484
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,581
All will soon
be made right again.

485
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,650
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

486
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,518
I'm so sorry
it had to turn out this way,

487
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,356
But the council cannot risk
keeping you alive.

488
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,792
Such a shame.

489
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,527
I won't be able to tell Mick
he was right.

490
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,862
Mick?

491
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,197
My colorful friend,
who was convinced

492
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,766
You were planning on
killing me.

493
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,402
Your friends
seem to have abandoned you,

494
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,436
But no matter.

495
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:53,704
Chronos will track them down.

496
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,372
Can't believe
you brought this stooge

497
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,940
To do your dirty work.

498
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,076
I never had you pegged
as a coward, Druce.

499
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,478
In that case,
I promise to stay here

500
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,848
To ensure that your punishment
is carried out properly.

501
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,850
I wouldn't want you
to die alone.

502
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:10,087
Who says I'm alone?

503
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,660
What a wuss.

504
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,401
<i>This is not the time
to show off.</i>

505
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,470
<i>It's best if we attack
from a covered position.</i>

506
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,771
I'm through playing it safe.

507
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,207
This time,
we do things my way.

508
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,519
Run, punk! Run!

509
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,088
Jefferson!

510
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,690
Where is he? Chronos' blast
forced us to separate...

511
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,325
I... I didn't see where
he landed.

512
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,793
Jax!

513
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,228
Jefferson!

514
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,797
All right, no need to shout;
I'm right here.

515
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,365
There you are;
thank god you're okay.

516
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,034
Why didn't you answer
when I called you?

517
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,769
Did it not occur to you
that I'd be worried?

518
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,339
Look, I just got a...
Little lost.

519
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,479
We need to get him
to the med bay now.

520
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,286
Oh, gentlemen,
I trust everything went

521
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,755
According to plan
at the Bolshoi?

522
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,123
Piece of cake.

523
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,991
Made contact with Vostok
and swiped her badge.

524
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:24,962
Thanks to me. Pretty boy
just froze his ass off.

525
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,433
What happened to him?

526
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:30,701
Chronos.

527
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,803
- Jax here was...
- almost got himself killed.

528
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,404
And we need to get you
to the med bay.

529
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,506
Ah, the med bay,

530
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,442
Where a morphine drip awaits me.

531
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:39,943
Now just try
and take it slowly.

532
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,512
Don't bother telling him
what to do;

533
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,213
He'll just do the opposite.

534
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,116
Oh, yeah, it would be
my fault that I got hurt,

535
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,519
Because I didn't listen to you
in your infinite wisdom.

536
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,553
I am sorry, Professor.

537
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,188
Exactly.

538
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,958
It seems this... Partnership
of ours has become untenable.

539
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,959
Partnership?

540
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,461
No, this is a dictatorship,

541
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,196
One in which you get
to call all the shots

542
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,398
And I get to take
all the shots.

543
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,166
Do you think I like
seeing you hurt?

544
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,501
Don't act like you actually
care about me, man.

545
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,203
I'm just a life-support system.

546
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,071
I didn't even want to come
on this stupid trip.

547
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,706
- You kidnapped me.
- Oh, this old tune.

548
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,576
Did you ever stop to think
that I actually had a life

549
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,710
Back in 2016?

550
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,913
I almost forgot:
A promising career

551
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,014
As an auto mechanic.

552
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,616
I had a mom,

553
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,518
A widow.

554
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,554
What happens to her
if something happens to me

555
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,555
In 1986?

556
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:25,923
Huh?

557
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,624
She's just gonna think
that I left her

558
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,092
Without even saying good-bye.

559
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,028
Man, do you have any idea
what that does to her?

560
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,430
We've all made sacrifices.

561
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:36,633
But can't you see that
this mission, stopping Savage,

562
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,935
Is bigger than any one of us?

563
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,504
I am so sick
of you using that tone.

564
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:44,007
When are you gonna learn
you are not my father?

565
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,377
I'm sorry you lost him
at such a tender age,

566
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,714
But if your father were here,
right now,

567
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,649
He'd be saying
what I'm saying.

568
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,651
Just grow up, Jefferson.

569
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,987
The future of the world
is at stake,

570
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,622
And if you insist
on getting yourself killed,

571
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:02,192
As terrible as that might be
for your mother, or me,

572
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,429
Who, incidentally,
would also die,

573
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,965
I am more concerned
with the billions of people

574
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,700
Who will die
because of your...

575
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,102
Arrogant adolescent ego!

576
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,140
Okay.

577
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,783
Please don't... don't...
don't say it.

578
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,151
I was cruel

579
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:32,022
And unjustified, and I...
I said those things

580
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:36,193
Just for the sake
of hurting him.

581
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,295
Why aren't you telling that
to Jax?

582
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:42,032
I had to hurt him, Raymond;
it's the only way

583
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,166
I can get through to him.

584
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,835
I've tried everything else.

585
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,203
Well, he's just a kid.

586
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:51,808
So was Ronald,
and look what happened to him.

587
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,478
Your former half
of firestorm.

588
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,913
Yes.

589
00:26:55,915 --> 00:27:01,485
I can't... I...
I can't go through this again.

590
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,922
I can't lose another.

591
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,491
The reason I'm constantly
lecturing Jefferson

592
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:10,027
Is because I'm the one
who brought him along,

593
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:13,063
And if something happens,

594
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm the one who has
to go back to 2016

595
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,436
And tell his mother
that her little boy

596
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:22,306
Is never coming home,

597
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,374
And I would rather die
than do that.

598
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,117
That looks sore.
What happened?

599
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,886
Maybe you should ask
the lunatic

600
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,388
you put in charge
of training me.

601
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,091
I... actually, I was hoping
that the arrangement

602
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,727
between you and Sara
might be, uh...

603
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,195
mutually beneficial.

604
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,665
You mean you knew
about this bloodlust thing?

605
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,568
It's the Captain's job
to know everything on his ship.

606
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,272
Look, Sara went through hell
when she was resurrected,

607
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:58,041
And I was hoping
that you'd be able to...

608
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,777
Coax out her human side
from the darkness

609
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,479
Of the Lazarus Pit.

610
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,547
Why me?

611
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,083
Well, after 4,000 years
of reincarnation,

612
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:09,419
Surely you know a thing or two
about rebirth.

613
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,293
Heads up!

614
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,565
Let's go.

615
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:25,402
"A warrior trains
every day", remember?

616
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,038
I'm not a warrior,
and I tried to kill you

617
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,240
The last time we did this,
remember?

618
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,776
"Tried"
being the operative word.

619
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,882
Look, you want to know
my theory?

620
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,317
No.

621
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,853
I think your problem
is the opposite of mine.

622
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:46,256
I need to learn to embrace
my inner hawk goddess,

623
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:50,560
But you... you need to learn
to embrace your human side.

624
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,296
And what if that side of me
is gone?

625
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,499
What if she
doesn't exist anymore?

626
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,736
Well, only one way
to find out.

627
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,071
What, are you baiting me?

628
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,973
No,

629
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,674
I'm training you.

630
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,212
Come on.

631
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,115
Are you scared?

632
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,693
Here we are, Luskavic labs,

633
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,395
The secret facility
where Vostok works.

634
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,531
- So what's the plan?
- Simple.

635
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,332
We use Vostok's credentials
to enter the lab

636
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,401
And find out what she's building
on behalf of Savage.

637
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,903
Reconnaissance
in a laboratory.

638
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,104
Finally, my kind
of mission.

639
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,605
No, no, no,
hang on a minute;

640
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,607
Jefferson's still recovering
from his injuries.

641
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,143
This is hardly a job
for firestorm;

642
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,578
Let him rest.

643
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,437
I'm Dr. Gregor Gavrilov
of the state council of science,

644
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,574
And I'm here
to inspect the facility.

645
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,809
<i>I'm in
and heading to the basement.</i>

646
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,185
Here's hoping the key
that Mr. Snart stole

647
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,121
Off Valentina works.

648
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,605
Oh, my god.

649
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,316
I know what Vostok
is working on.

650
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,719
She's trying
to build... Me.

651
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,053
What do you mean?

652
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,422
<i>I mean, Savage has spent
the last decade trying</i>

653
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,258
<i>To level the arms race
against our team.</i>

654
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,327
Operation Svarog.

655
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,496
Slavic god of fire,
of course.

656
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,466
He and Vostok are building

657
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,502
A soviet firestorm.

658
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,450
They've already
built a thermal core.

659
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,652
Professor,
need I remind you,

660
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:31,454
This is
a reconnaissance mission.

661
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,523
It's only a matter of time
before Vostok figures out

662
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:37,227
How to stabilize
a soviet firestorm.

663
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,598
I'm not leaving without it.

664
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,266
It's the key
to building others just like me.

665
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,403
Yes, but perhaps you should
wait for the rest of the team.

666
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,737
<i>They're on their way.</i>

667
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,306
Are you familiar
with ultra-high-energy

668
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,007
Cosmic rays, Captain?

669
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,076
The radiation released
inside this chamber

670
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,111
Will kill anyone
other than me.

671
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,246
Look, despite
your impermeability

672
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,647
To nuclear energy,

673
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,516
You're still
quite vulnerable to bullets.

674
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,351
I just need someone
to take the core offline,

675
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,620
So I can remove it safely
and shield it.

676
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,988
<i>I'm all over it, Professor.</i>

677
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,126
<i>We're</i> all over it.

678
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,028
<i>Remember, Dr. Palmer,
that shutting down the core</i>

679
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,930
<i>Incorrectly can lead
to the creation of...</i>

680
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,799
Strangeness, black holes,
and uncontrolled

681
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,867
Fusion reactions
that consume the universe?

682
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,237
See? I was listening
during class, Professor.

683
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,848
How we doing, boy scout?

684
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,384
Uh, point of fact,
I completed all 21 merit badges,

685
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:37,454
Including nuclear science,
so I'm an eagle scout.

686
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,191
Uh-oh.
We got a problem.

687
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,526
Valentina's headed toward
the core containment unit.

688
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,262
The radiation
Stein's about to unleash...

689
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,696
I... if she opens the door...

690
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,398
We're here to stop Savage
from building

691
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,267
A nuclear-powered superhero.

692
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:53,003
Saving some commie broad
ain't on the agenda.

693
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,105
Even if the radiation
doesn't kill her, Savage will,

694
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,340
The second he finds out
the lab's been sabotaged.

695
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,875
Look, we gotta get her out
of here.

696
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,144
Well, who's gonna shut down
the core, Raymond?

697
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,612
I skipped that merit badge.

698
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,247
Raymond, why
is the thermal core

699
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,749
Still running
at full power?

700
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,584
I'll handle the core.
You handle Valentina.

701
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,352
You're willing
to risk the mission

702
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,955
For a woman you barely know?

703
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,957
Be helpful to others.

704
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,025
It's the scout motto.

705
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,393
30 seconds.

706
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,828
I'll get Vostok,
you kill the power for Stein,

707
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,363
And, Raymond,

708
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,766
Promise me.

709
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,076
Bad idea.

710
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,444
What are you doing here?

711
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,046
Believe me,
I've been asking myself

712
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:38,481
The same question.

713
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,517
That night at the Bolshoi.

714
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,885
It was you
who stole my keys.

715
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:45,855
And your wallet,
but it was nothing personal.

716
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,290
What the hell
is that man doing?

717
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,992
He has no idea
what the core is capable of.

718
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,193
Relax.

719
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,730
He's the one
who invented it.

720
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,673
I'm the first person
to have ever seen

721
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,676
Cosmic radiation
with his own eyes.

722
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:07,944
You know, let's keep it
that way.

723
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:09,512
Snart, you better
keep Valentina out

724
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,880
Of the core containment unit.

725
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,382
You used me.

726
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,717
You work
for American government.

727
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,452
I'm wanted
by the American government.

728
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,520
Does that count?

729
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,423
Look, I may be your white knight
just this once,

730
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,759
But that weapon
Savage has you building?

731
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,995
He's creating
a nuclear-powered monster.

732
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,834
I know.

733
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:32,402
It was sweet of you
to think of me

734
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,371
As a damsel in distress,

735
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,506
But...

736
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,575
I'm not the one
who needs rescuing.

737
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,444
Don't flatter yourself,
sweetheart.

738
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,012
I'm not
the sentimental type.

739
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,781
No, but your partner,

740
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,350
The physicist
with the big brown eyes,

741
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:48,651
Is.

742
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,688
<i>Turn the core back online.</i>

743
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,490
You will turn it back on,
or I will put a bullet

744
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:54,491
In your friend's head.

745
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:55,859
Don't you dare.

746
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:58,561
She's gonna shoot me
whether you do it or not.

747
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,463
That may be true,

748
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,098
And you can take that gamble
if you like.

749
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,168
<i>It's only his life
you wager.</i>

750
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,203
Almost there.

751
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,772
<i>I'm not joking, Raymond.</i>

752
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,040
Don't you dare
push that button.

753
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,616
Raymond, what's going on?

754
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,984
The core just went
back online.

755
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,519
Sorry, Professor,
I had to do it.

756
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,422
You idiot.

757
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,794
I... I can still remove it.

758
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,897
I just hope I can absorb
the excess power.

759
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,166
No. Do you have any idea
the kind of energy that...

760
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,704
Should have listened
to your friend.

761
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,306
<i>What the hell
are you doing, gray?</i>

762
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,874
Jefferson?

763
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,877
You are not firestorm;
you're just a stubborn old man

764
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,946
<i>Who's about to make
a really stupid decision.</i>

765
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,381
Wait, I... is this
what it's like

766
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,049
When I'm in your head?

767
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:56,119
I... I apologize, dear boy,
because it's rather distracting.

768
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:59,155
<i>Your body
cannot handle this alone.</i>

769
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,257
Appreciate your concern.

770
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,460
You were right.

771
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,962
I've risked your life
enough times.

772
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,964
Now, it's my turn.

773
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,233
No!

774
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:32,956
He's too weak.

775
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,158
<i>He'll never get out of there
alone.</i>

776
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,333
Professor Stein,

777
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,368
Your comrade here tells me
you know quite a bit

778
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,036
About this project of mine.

779
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,438
Very good.

780
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,974
You and I
have much to discuss.

781
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,354
What are you waiting for?

782
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,056
You forget how
to use that thing?

783
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,158
My employer, Mr. Savage,
would very much like

784
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,662
To meet you
and the rest of your friends.

785
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,764
Careful what you wish for.

786
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,299
This where the party's at?

787
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,413
Aah!

788
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,881
Mr. Snart,
can you hear me?

789
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,350
Do not let Vostok leave
with that thermal core.

790
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,522
Get the hell out of here!

791
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:40,557
What are you waiting for?

792
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,958
Go, go!

793
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,876
Now might be a good time
to send in reinforcements.

794
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,011
Mick and Stein just got pinched
by the Russkies.

795
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,913
You're gonna have to
get out of there right now.

796
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,982
They're hanging us out to dry,
Rip; I need backup.

797
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,151
I'm afraid our only option
is retreat.

798
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,552
What about my partner?

799
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,020
Well, until we devise
our next move,

800
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,922
Mr. Rory will have to
fend for himself.

801
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,223
<i>Remember the mission.</i>

802
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,959
If the Soviets get that
thermal core back,

803
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,361
Your partner will not be
the only one who dies.

804
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,513
You better kill me now.

805
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,282
If I ever get my hands on you,

806
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,818
I'm gonna get all "Rocky IV"
on your ass.

807
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,257
I'm gonna remember that,
comrade.

808
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,863
We must leave now, colonel.

809
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,365
There's still
one more intruder,

810
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:56,633
And he has the thermal core.

811
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,034
We don't need it now.

812
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,371
We have something far better.

813
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,114
Ugh,

814
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:13,082
Thank god you managed
to grab it.

815
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,718
Where was my backup,
Captain?

816
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Half the team is gone...

817
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,490
Because of you.

818
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,792
Only if I'd have sent
the other half in to save them,

819
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,628
They'd be captured too,
and where would we be,

820
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,929
Hmm?

821
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,731
Savage would have both halves
of firestorm,

822
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,833
A dead Kendra
on top of a dead Carter,

823
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,336
Everything he wants.

824
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,405
It would be the end
to our little crusade,

825
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:36,507
And, most likely, the world.

826
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:40,576
So before you
pull that trigger,

827
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,346
Ask yourself:

828
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,148
What would you have done?

829
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,288
That is
a pretty cold calculation, Rip.

830
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,290
Almost criminal,

831
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,160
Except we criminals
have a code:

832
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:58,995
"you never leave
one of your own behind".

833
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:02,865
We will get them back.

834
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,535
Now, if Savage even hopes
to create a firestorm,

835
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:09,672
First, he's going to need
a new one of these.

836
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:10,673
A thermal core?

837
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,041
Let me get this straight.

838
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:15,011
You had Kendra and I
training for the next mission,

839
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:16,913
When we should have been
out there helping them.

840
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,615
We will help them,
and our next mission

841
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,451
Is to get our compatriots back
from Vostok.

842
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:23,386
Who is to say
they're not already dead?

843
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:24,887
Vostok needs
the Professor alive

844
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,456
In order to rebuild
the thermal core.

845
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,557
And Ray and Rory?

846
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,825
Savage will
keep them alive too.

847
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:30,359
As leverage.

848
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,929
He'll torture them
if Stein tries to hold out.

849
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,764
Well, we'll have to pray
that he does.

850
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,266
If Savage's goal is
to create his own firestorm,

851
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,503
Then Stein himself is the key,
the missing piece of the puzzle.

852
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,872
And if Vostok figures out
how to turn Stein's powers

853
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:45,241
Against us, then...

854
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,880
I'm afraid the world
is beyond saving.

855
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,082
Stein's a lot tougher
than he looks.

856
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,651
I mean, it will take a lot
to break him.

857
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,954
That's the good news.

858
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,255
<i>The bad news</i>

859
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,924
<i>Is that our compatriots
are being held</i>

860
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,293
<i>In an impenetrable
soviet gulag.</i>

861
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,502
Get a good night's sleep.

862
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,937
You and Dr. Vostok
have much work to do

863
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,038
In the morning.

864
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,142
My companions
from the lab...

865
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,444
What did you do with them?

866
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,745
Don't worry.

867
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,781
They're alive.

868
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,250
Whether they remain that way

869
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:31,921
Is entirely up to you,
Professor.

870
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:02,985
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
