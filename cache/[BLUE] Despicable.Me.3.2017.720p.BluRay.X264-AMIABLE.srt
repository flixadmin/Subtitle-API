<font color="#00ffff">Ma'am?
You're making me nervous.</font>

138
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,963
<font color="#00ffff">How could you let
Balthazar Bratt,</font>

139
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,215
<font color="#00ffff">the AVL's most
wanted villain,</font>

140
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,550
<font color="#00ffff">just get away?</font>

141
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,885
<font color="#00ffff">That is the opposite
of what we do here!</font>

142
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,095
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, okay.</font>

143
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,098
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, maybe
he got away. Again.</font>

144
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,892
<font color="#00ffff">But he didn't
get the diamond.</font>

145
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,937
<font color="#00ffff">And I am this close
to bringing him in.</font>

146
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,231
<font color="#00ffff">This close.</font>

147
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,066
<font color="#00ffff">Huh. Interesting.</font>

148
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,443
<font color="#00ffff">You're fired!</font>

149
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,861
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

150
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,572
<font color="#00ffff">That's totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent!</font>

151
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,990
<font color="#00ffff">You know what?
If you fire him,</font>

152
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,409
<font color="#00ffff">you're gonna have to
fire me, sister-sister.</font>

153
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,453
<font color="#00ffff">And do you
really wanna do that?</font>

154
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,079
<font color="#00ffff">Do ya?</font>

155
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,206
<font color="#00ffff">No, no, no!</font>

156
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,839
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I guess
she did.</font>

157
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,513
<font color="#00ffff">Honey, you didn't
have to do that.</font>

158
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,265
<font color="#00ffff">I know how much
you love your job.</font>

159
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:23,601
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I love
other things more.</font>

160
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,856
<font color="#00ffff">You know, we're gonna
have to tell the girls.</font>

161
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,691
<font color="#00ffff">Can you do it?</font>

162
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,444
<font color="#00ffff">The whole "mom" thing
is still kind of new to me.</font>

163
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,945
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, sure.</font>

164
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,157
<font color="#00ffff">Huh?</font>

165
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,951
<font color="#00ffff">Psst!</font>

166
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,003
<font color="#00ffff">Hello?</font>

167
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,182
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Aloha!</i></font>

168
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,309
<font color="#00ffff">Oh!</font>

169
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,521
<font color="#00ffff">This is unexpected.</font>

170
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,940
<font color="#00ffff">Well, you never got to
go on a honeymoon, so...</font>

171
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,358
<font color="#00ffff">We made you dinner!</font>

172
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,567
<font color="#00ffff">It's a luau!</font>

173
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:16,445
<font color="#00ffff">We got pineapples and
coconuts and ukuleles!</font>

174
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,280
<font color="#00ffff">Oh! Yay!
Yay!</font>

175
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,422
<font color="#00ffff">The soup of the day.</font>

176
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,048
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Madame</i> and <i>Monsieur.</i></font>

177
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,384
<font color="#00ffff">The gummy bears
were my idea.</font>

178
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,350
<font color="#00ffff">Mmm! Looks too good
to even eat.</font>

179
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,726
<font color="#00ffff">Am I right?</font>

180
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,604
<font color="#00ffff">But I made it
for you. Oh.</font>

181
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,775
<font color="#00ffff">Mmm-mmm-mmm!</font>

182
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:58,487
<font color="#00ffff">Good soup!
I love the combination</font>

183
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,322
<font color="#00ffff">of gummy bears</font>

184
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,657
<font color="#00ffff">and meat.</font>

185
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,206
<font color="#00ffff">I'm gonna hold it
in my mouth.</font>

186
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,173
<font color="#00ffff">'Cause it's so good,
I don't wanna swallow it.</font>

187
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,793
<font color="#00ffff">So, how was work?</font>

188
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,130
<font color="#00ffff">Ooh, did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?</font>

189
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:18,757
<font color="#00ffff">Well, actually,</font>

190
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:23,429
<font color="#00ffff">today, Lucy and I were
invited to not work</font>

191
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,389
<font color="#00ffff">at the AVL anymore.</font>

192
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,892
<font color="#00ffff">No!</font>

193
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,312
<font color="#00ffff">You got fired?</font>

194
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,647
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no!
No, no, no.</font>

195
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,859
<font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

196
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,736
<font color="#00ffff">But don't worry.</font>

197
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,489
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sure we'll get
new jobs. Real soon.</font>

198
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,866
<font color="#00ffff">Even better ones.</font>

199
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,660
<font color="#00ffff">What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?</font>

200
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,664
<font color="#00ffff">Ooh, I know!
You could gamble online!</font>

201
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,666
<font color="#00ffff">That's what
Katie's dad does.</font>

202
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,711
<font color="#00ffff">Okay. We will definitely
look into that.</font>

203
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,546
<font color="#00ffff">That's a good
suggestion.</font>

204
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:01,342
<font color="#00ffff">And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.</font>

205
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,094
<font color="#00ffff">Hmm?</font>

206
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,518
<font color="#00ffff">Guys! Shh! I don't think
you heard me right.</font>

207
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,810
<font color="#00ffff">No, no, no.</font>

208
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,563
<font color="#00ffff">This does not mean that we are
going back to being villains.</font>

209
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,735
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, all right.
I get it.</font>

210
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,446
<font color="#00ffff">Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately.</font>

211
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:27,701
<font color="#00ffff">Especially with Dr. Nefario accidentally
freezing himself in carbonite.</font>

212
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,083
<font color="#00ffff">But our life of crime
is over!</font>

213
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:38,504
<font color="#00ffff">Mel! Mel, you're
with me on this, right?</font>

214
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:00,609
<font color="#00ffff">Guys, listen to me!
Read my lips!</font>

215
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:08,993
<font color="#00ffff">What? What?</font>

216
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,745
<font color="#00ffff">Oh... What did I say?
It's not "comquit"?</font>

217
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,539
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, okay.</font>

218
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,626
<font color="#00ffff">Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

219
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,172
<font color="#00ffff">Don't take that tone with me!
We're not going back to villainy.</font>

220
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,510
<font color="#00ffff">Yes! And I don't want to
hear another word about it.</font>

221
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,269
<font color="#00ffff">Look, if you guys don't stop right now,
there will be consequences.</font>

222
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,898
<font color="#00ffff">Hey! Don't say anything
you're going to regret.</font>

223
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,030
<font color="#00ffff">What? You quit?</font>

224
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,158
<font color="#00ffff">You're serious?
Come on!</font>

225
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,499
<font color="#00ffff">Dave! Jerry!</font>

226
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,045
<font color="#00ffff">Great news, guys.
You have been promoted.</font>

227
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,256
<font color="#00ffff">You're in charge now.
Huh? Not bad.</font>

228
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,642
<font color="#00ffff">Jeesh!</font>

229
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,913
<font color="#00ffff">Ah,
<i>Monsieur</i> Pompeux!</font>

230
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,166
<font color="#00ffff">To what do we owe
the presence</font>

231
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,252
<font color="#00ffff">of the world's
foremost gem expert?</font>

232
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,421
<font color="#00ffff">The chief of police
sent me.</font>

233
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,508
<font color="#00ffff">He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,</font>

234
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,969
<font color="#00ffff">the Dumont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.</font>

235
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:09,822
<font color="#00ffff">Ooh, la-la!</font>

236
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,366
<font color="#00ffff">You have been duped!</font>

237
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,118
<font color="#00ffff">What? We have?</font>

238
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,452
<font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

239
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:16,954
<font color="#00ffff">By me!</font>

240
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,625
<font color="#00ffff">But, what is...</font>

241
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,255
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no! Help!</font>

242
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:43,981
<font color="#00ffff">Ooh!</font>

243
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,152
<font color="#00ffff">I've been a bad boy!</font>

244
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,653
<font color="#00ffff">Or should I say...</font>

245
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,172
<font color="#00ffff">Oh!</font>

246
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,279
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, Gru.</font>

247
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,198
<font color="#00ffff">What you doing
down here?</font>

248
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,992
<font color="#00ffff">In the dark. Alone.</font>

249
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,203
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, nothing.
Just thinking.</font>

250
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,330
<font color="#00ffff">You okay?</font>

251
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,041
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.</font>

252
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,043
<font color="#00ffff">It's just...</font>

253
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,922
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know.
I guess I just feel like</font>

254
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,632
<font color="#00ffff">a failure.</font>

255
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,301
<font color="#00ffff">Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.</font>

256
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,429
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.</font>

257
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,933
<font color="#00ffff">If only I could
have nailed Bratt.</font>

258
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,436
<font color="#00ffff">So many times,
I almost had him.</font>

259
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,231
<font color="#00ffff">But now I'll never
get the chance,</font>

260
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,733
<font color="#00ffff">'cause I have been
kicked to the curb.</font>

261
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,318
<font color="#00ffff">Gru, you've got
to let this go.</font>

262
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,070
<font color="#00ffff">It's time to
look forward.</font>

263
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,405
<font color="#00ffff">Things will get
better. I promise.</font>

264
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,346
<font color="#00ffff">Excuse me.</font>

265
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,516
<font color="#00ffff">Pardon me, young people?</font>

266
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,686
<font color="#00ffff">Would you tell me
how to get to this address?</font>

267
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,025
<font color="#00ffff">I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.</font>

268
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,498
<font color="#00ffff">Idiots.</font>

269
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,712
<font color="#00ffff">No! Kyle!</font>

270
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,755
<font color="#00ffff">Stop! Kyle, let go!</font>

271
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,094
<font color="#00ffff">No! No!</font>

272
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,138
<font color="#00ffff">You've got to be kidding me!</font>

273
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,222
<font color="#00ffff">Lucy, did you...</font>

274
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,986
<font color="#00ffff">He helps you if
you have nightmares.</font>

275
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,435
<font color="#00ffff">And he's really
good to snuggle with.</font>

276
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,978
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no, no, no.
Agnes! Agnes!</font>

277
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,147
<font color="#00ffff">So
take good care of him.</font>

278
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,940
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you!</font>

279
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,234
<font color="#00ffff">Agnes, what are
you doing?</font>

280
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,403
<font color="#00ffff">You sold your unicorn?</font>

281
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:41,074
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I just wanted to help,
since you don't have a job.</font>

282
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,993
<font color="#00ffff">I got two whole
dollars for it.</font>

283
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,706
<font color="#00ffff">Uh, excuse me?</font>

284
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,917
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry, buddy,
the sale's over.</font>

285
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,710
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, but this will
only take a...</font>

286
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,338
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, eyebrows,
get off the lawn.</font>

287
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,589
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, but...</font>

288
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,882
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, could you...</font>

289
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,842
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, uh, of course.</font>

290
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,386
<font color="#00ffff">Now, as I was
saying, I...</font>

291
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,596
<font color="#00ffff">Uh... Oh.</font>

292
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,139
<font color="#00ffff">Goodbye!</font>

293
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,690
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, Agnes, you don't need to worry.
We're going to be fine.</font>

294
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:14,858
<font color="#00ffff">For real?</font>

295
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,026
<font color="#00ffff">For real.</font>

296
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,320
<font color="#00ffff">Now, come on,
let's pack this stuff up.</font>

297
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,197
<font color="#00ffff">Ow! Ow!
Seriously?</font>

298
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,658
<font color="#00ffff">Buddy, you're not
getting the hint.</font>

299
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,494
<font color="#00ffff">Excuse me, Mr. Gru,</font>

300
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,747
<font color="#00ffff">but I really must
have a word with you.</font>

301
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,415
<font color="#00ffff">How do you know my name?</font>

302
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,961
<font color="#00ffff">Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Fritz.</font>

303
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,754
<font color="#00ffff">Ow!</font>

304
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,047
<font color="#00ffff">Good puppy.</font>

305
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:41,593
<font color="#00ffff">And I am inquiring on behalf
of your twin brother, Dru.</font>

306
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,178
<font color="#00ffff">He needs your help.</font>

307
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,888
<font color="#00ffff">What? Twin brother?</font>

308
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,015
<font color="#00ffff">Twin brother?</font>

309
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:48,392
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, <i>ja.</i></font>

310
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,645
<font color="#00ffff">He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.</font>

311
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,690
<font color="#00ffff">Your father has recently
passed away and...</font>

312
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,775
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, cuckoo.</font>

313
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,820
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sorry, but my dad
died when I was a baby,</font>

314
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,489
<font color="#00ffff">and I don't have any brother.
You got the wrong guy.</font>

315
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:07,285
<font color="#00ffff">Really? Well, then,
how do you explain this?</font>

316
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,795
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Bellissimo!</i></font>

317
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,340
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, hello, Gru.</font>

318
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:21,508
<font color="#00ffff">Hi, Mom.</font>

319
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,554
<font color="#00ffff">It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.</font>

320
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,222
<font color="#00ffff">Oh!</font>

321
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,808
<font color="#00ffff">There you are,
you cutie, you.</font>

322
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,435
<font color="#00ffff">Oh!</font>

323
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,689
<font color="#00ffff">Uh, these are my
diving instructors.</font>

324
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,109
<font color="#00ffff">Vincenzo <i>und</i> Paolo.</font>

325
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,695
<font color="#00ffff">Ciao, boys.</font>

326
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,448
<font color="#00ffff">So, what do you want?</font>

327
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,701
<font color="#00ffff">Mom, do I have
a twin brother?</font>

328
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,954
<font color="#00ffff">Ah! How did you find out?
Who told you?</font>

329
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,539
<font color="#00ffff">Wait, what? It's true?</font>

330
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,583
<font color="#00ffff">You never told me
I had a brother!</font>

331
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,170
<font color="#00ffff">And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born.</font>

332
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:01,423
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Ja, ja</i>.
That was the agreement.</font>

333
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,468
<font color="#00ffff">Agreement?
What are you talking about?</font>

334
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,891
<font color="#00ffff">Shortly after you and
your brother were born,</font>

335
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,185
<font color="#00ffff">your father and I divorced.</font>

336
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:16,563
<font color="#00ffff">We each took one son
to raise on our own</font>

337
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:20,025
<font color="#00ffff">and promised never to
see each other again.</font>

338
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,612
<font color="#00ffff">Obviously,</font>

339
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,655
<font color="#00ffff">I got second pick.</font>

340
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,452
<font color="#00ffff">I have a brother!</font>

341
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,003
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, girls!
How are things in Row B, huh?</font>

342
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,631
<font color="#00ffff">I put together some fun
activities for the trip!</font>

343
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,717
<font color="#00ffff">Who is up for
some gin rummy?</font>

344
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,677
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, um...</font>

345
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,638
<font color="#00ffff">We're good.</font>

346
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,598
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, okay.</font>

347
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,017
<font color="#00ffff">I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.</font>

348
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,519
<font color="#00ffff">I hope I win.</font>

349
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,272
<font color="#00ffff">I wonder what Dru
will be like. Ooh!</font>

350
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,941
<font color="#00ffff">Maybe we'll
have the twin thing</font>

351
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,027
<font color="#00ffff">when you can read
each other's minds, no?</font>

352
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,779
<font color="#00ffff">How cool would that be?</font>

353
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,531
<font color="#00ffff">Um, super cool!</font>

354
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,583
<font color="#00ffff">Ooh!</font>

355
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:28,885
<font color="#00ffff">Freedonia!
Freedonia! Freedonia!</font>

356
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,054
<font color="#00ffff">Hi, piggy, piggy!</font>

357
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,182
<font color="#00ffff">Whoa!
Look at that house!</font>

358
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,226
<font color="#00ffff">It's like a castle!</font>

359
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,896
<font color="#00ffff">I can't wait to
meet my brother!</font>

360
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,649
<font color="#00ffff">Ugh. What's with
all the pigs?</font>

361
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,110
<font color="#00ffff">This is
the family business.</font>

362
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:48,488
<font color="#00ffff">The largest pig farm in
the whole of Freedonia.</font>

363
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:52,033
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, nice pig.</font>

364
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,578
<font color="#00ffff">No! That's my
private part!</font>

365
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,541
<font color="#00ffff">This pig has issues!</font>

366
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,002
<font color="#00ffff">Please, come in.</font>

367
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,514
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, this is amazing!</font>

368
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:18,560
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel!
But with pigs.</font>

369
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,109
<font color="#00ffff">My brother!</font>

370
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,407
<font color="#00ffff">My brother!</font>

371
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,617
<font color="#00ffff">Gru!</font>

372
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:34,951
<font color="#00ffff">Dru!</font>

373
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,167
<font color="#00ffff">Oh!</font>

374
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,088
<font color="#00ffff">Brother! I am hugging you!</font>

375
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,757
<font color="#00ffff">I'm so happy!</font>

376
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:53,136
<font color="#00ffff">After all of these years,
finally I'm meeting you!</font>

377
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,013
<font color="#00ffff">Yup. All right.
Good.</font>

378
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,390
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, look at that.</font>

379
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,935
<font color="#00ffff">You must be
the beautiful wife.</font>

380
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,895
<font color="#00ffff">Beautiful?
Oh!</font>

381
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,980
<font color="#00ffff">Stop it.
Sweet talker.</font>

382
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,107
<font color="#00ffff">How is my brother
finding a wife like you</font>

383
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,901
<font color="#00ffff">when he is so bald?</font>

384
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,527
<font color="#00ffff">I'm joking!</font>

385
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:15,116
<font color="#00ffff">These
must be my nieces!</font>

386
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,204
<font color="#00ffff">You're Agnes!
You are small with big eyes.</font>

387
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,289
<font color="#00ffff">And it makes me wanna
put you into my pocket.</font>

388
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,916
<font color="#00ffff">You can't do that!</font>

389
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,834
<font color="#00ffff">I'm too big.</font>

390
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:29,714
<font color="#00ffff">Edith! I can tell that you
are a little mischievous.</font>

391
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:32,092
<font color="#00ffff">We're gonna have to make
a little trouble later.</font>

392
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,344
<font color="#00ffff">I already have!</font>

393
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,930
<font color="#00ffff">Ow! Ow! Please!</font>

394
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,182
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you
doing that? Ow!</font>

395
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:43,061
<font color="#00ffff">Fist bump for
mischievous behavior!</font>

396
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,189
<font color="#00ffff">And Margo.
Oh, you are so mature!</font>

397
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,817
<font color="#00ffff">I'm guessing...
Mmm... 15?</font>

398
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,360
<font color="#00ffff">15?</font>

399
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,863
<font color="#00ffff">She's 12. She looks 12
and will always be 12.</font>

400
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,033
<font color="#00ffff">So, Dru, this place
is amazing!</font>

401
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,452
<font color="#00ffff">I mean, you just walk through
the doors and you're like...</font>

402
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,456
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, it's nice,
I guess, sure.</font>

403
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,834
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not really into things.</font>

404
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,131
<font color="#00ffff">- This is so cool!
- Look at that!</font>

405
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,508
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my gosh!
He's even got a helicopter!</font>

406
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,926
<font color="#00ffff">This is the best!</font>

407
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,846
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, the best!</font>

408

00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:12,612
<font color="#00ffff">Yes! Thank you, Margo.
Thank you!</font>

543
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,282
<font color="#00ffff">Bam! I am a great mother!</font>

544
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,910
<font color="#00ffff">Did you see that, girls?
I laid down the...</font>

545
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,954
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no! Where are they?</font>

546
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,749
<font color="#00ffff">Oh... Agnes? Edith?</font>

547
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:28,753
<font color="#00ffff">Hello.</font>

548
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,424
<font color="#00ffff">Look!
A unicorn horn!</font>

549
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,514
<font color="#00ffff">My little brain is
going to explode!</font>

550
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,891
<font color="#00ffff">Agnes, that's fake.</font>

551
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,228
<font color="#00ffff">It's real,
all right.</font>

552
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,524
<font color="#00ffff">That horn came from
the Crooked Forest.</font>

553
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:54,445
<font color="#00ffff">The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.</font>

554
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,202
<font color="#00ffff">Huh!</font>

555
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,412
<font color="#00ffff">Laugh, laugh, all of you.</font>

556
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,915
<font color="#00ffff">They all think
I'm crazy.</font>

557
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:09,252
<font color="#00ffff">But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.</font>

558
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,170
<font color="#00ffff">With my own eye.</font>

559
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,841
<font color="#00ffff">Wait, wait, wait.
You saw a for-real live unicorn?</font>

560
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,175
<font color="#00ffff">What did it look like?</font>

561
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,261
<font color="#00ffff">Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?</font>

562
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:21,264
<font color="#00ffff">Was it fluffy?</font>

563
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:23,266
<font color="#00ffff">It was so fluffy,</font>

564
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,935
<font color="#00ffff">I thought
I was gonna die.</font>

565
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,272
<font color="#00ffff">Mmm! Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?</font>

566
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,358
<font color="#00ffff">Oh! They say if a maiden
pure of heart</font>

567
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,527
<font color="#00ffff">goes into
the Crooked Forest,</font>

568
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,447
<font color="#00ffff">the unicorn will
come and be hers.</font>

569
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:39,782
<font color="#00ffff">Forever.</font>

570
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,118
<font color="#00ffff">Hmm...</font>

571
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:47,874
<font color="#00ffff">Agnes!</font>

572
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:54,797
<font color="#00ffff">Goal!</font>

573
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,675
<font color="#00ffff">Excuse me.</font>

574
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,427
<font color="#00ffff">Girls, don't worry.
I'm here.</font>

575
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,345
<font color="#00ffff">Are you okay?</font>

576
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,598
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, we're fine.</font>

577
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:05,099
<font color="#00ffff">Are you?</font>

578
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,642
<font color="#00ffff">Unicorns are really real!</font>

579
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,979
<font color="#00ffff">And I'm gonna find one!</font>

580
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:14,066
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry. Went a little
mama bear on ya.</font>

581
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,902
<font color="#00ffff">You know,
I heard a scream and...</font>

582
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,867
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, okay, have a good one.</font>

583
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,659
<font color="#00ffff">Wait for me here.</font>

584
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,120
<font color="#00ffff">Stop that!
Ah! You kicked me.</font>

585
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,917
<font color="#00ffff">Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?</font>

586
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:34,337
<font color="#00ffff">Did you just steal candies?
Yes!</font>

587
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,672
<font color="#00ffff">That's a lot of effort
for two lollipops.</font>

588
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,096
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no! The police!</font>

589
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,598
<font color="#00ffff">What do we do?
What do we do?</font>

590
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:48,768
<font color="#00ffff">Come on!
This is gonna be fun!</font>

591
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,405
<font color="#00ffff">The police are gonna get us!
I'm freaking out!</font>

592
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:02,615
<font color="#00ffff">Pigs!</font>

593
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,411
<font color="#00ffff">Cops!</font>

594
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:24,053
<font color="#00ffff">Whoa! They're back!</font>

595
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:27,348
<font color="#00ffff">All right!</font>

596
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:51,163
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, man,
that was crazy!</font>

597
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:52,748
<font color="#00ffff">We were so close
to getting busted.</font>

598
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:53,916
<font color="#00ffff">Tell me about it.</font>

599
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,085
<font color="#00ffff">I thought you were going
to pee your pants.</font>

600
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:58,129
<font color="#00ffff">I did!</font>

601
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,672
<font color="#00ffff">You did!</font>

602
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,944
<font color="#00ffff">Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!</font>

603
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,826
<font color="#00ffff">Hey! What are
you doing?</font>

604
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,454
<font color="#00ffff">Intruders! Intruders!</font>

605
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,919
<font color="#00ffff">There they are! Stop!</font>

606
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,296
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, you, don't move!</font>

607
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,547
<font color="#00ffff">Halt!</font>

608
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,971
<font color="#00ffff">Call for backup!</font>

609
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,069
<font color="#00ffff">Ooh, uh...</font>

610
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:52,868
<font color="#00ffff">Get 'em! Go! Go!</font>

611
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:33,284
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, you!
Freeze! Don't move!</font>

612
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,245
<font color="#00ffff">Hands in the air!</font>

613
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,714
<font color="#00ffff">Face it, Gru. Villainy
is in your blood.</font>

614
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,426
<font color="#00ffff">You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush. A little?</font>

615
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:52,011
<font color="#00ffff">Uh...</font>

616
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,762
<font color="#00ffff">Eh, maybe a little.</font>

617
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,599
<font color="#00ffff">And now you've got the
chance to get back on top.</font>

618
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:57,808
<font color="#00ffff">Get your mojo back.</font>

619
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,687
<font color="#00ffff">Become Gru again.
How awesome would that be?</font>

620
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:03,856
<font color="#00ffff">Hmm.</font>

621
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,610
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, please, come on.
Just one heist.</font>

622
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:12,156
<font color="#00ffff">There's got to be something
out there, somewhere</font>

623
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:15,576
<font color="#00ffff">that you still wanna steal.</font>

624
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:18,370
<font color="#00ffff">Huh.</font>

625
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,289
<font color="#00ffff">There is something.</font>

626
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:23,375
<font color="#00ffff">How about we steal</font>

627
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:26,670
<font color="#00ffff">the largest diamond
in the world?</font>

628
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:29,215
<font color="#00ffff">Yes! I love it!</font>

629
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,592
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, thank you, brother!</font>

630
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:34,470
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you from
the bottoms of my heart.</font>

631
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:39,683
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, you know what? We should
do something to celebrate!</font>

632
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,310
<font color="#00ffff">Oh!</font>

633
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,938
<font color="#00ffff">I've got
the perfect idea.</font>

634
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:50,152
<font color="#00ffff">Fritz, my good fellow, could you
get me another napkin, please?</font>

635
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,488
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, yes.
Of course, Miss Edith.</font>

636
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:00,829
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, where are
Gru and Dru?</font>

637
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,998
<font color="#00ffff">Here we are!</font>

638
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,251
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, how's it going?</font>

639
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,254
<font color="#00ffff">It's me! Gru.</font>

640
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,089
<font color="#00ffff">And me, Dru.</font>

641
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:14,927
<font color="#00ffff">I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.</font>

642
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:17,513
<font color="#00ffff">Why are they pretending
to be each other?</font>

643
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:22,685
<font color="#00ffff">Ah! What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.</font>

644
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:25,854
<font color="#00ffff">I'm so grumpy
all the time. Hmm.</font>

645
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:30,192
<font color="#00ffff">I laugh a lot.
And I'm kind of an idiot!</font>

646
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,288
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, I'm busting a gut!</font>

647
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:45,833
<font color="#00ffff">Look at them!
They had no idea!</font>

648
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:47,876
<font color="#00ffff">Total burn.</font>

649
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,129
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, look, it's me, Gru!</font>

650
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:53,090
<font color="#00ffff">And I'm Dru!
We switched places!</font>

651
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,843
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, it's so nice to see
you two are getting along.</font>

652
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,929
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, we're getting...
Along perfectly.</font>

653
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,015
<font color="#00ffff">Wait. Did we...
Just finish...</font>

654
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:02,141
<font color="#00ffff">Each...
Other's...</font>

655
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,475
<font color="#00ffff">Sentences?
Sentences?</font>

656
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,104
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.</font>

657
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:08,748
<font color="#00ffff">And you're gonna stop
now though, right?</font>

658
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,733
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry, it's
a twin thing.</font>

659
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:12,192
<font color="#00ffff">Uh-huh...</font>

660
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:15,237
<font color="#00ffff">So, uh, what did
you guys do today?</font>

661
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:18,073
<font color="#00ffff">Nothing.</font>

662
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:19,658
<font color="#00ffff">Okay.
What does it...</font>

663
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:21,493
<font color="#00ffff">All done!</font>

664
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,079
<font color="#00ffff">Pardon me! Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!</font>

665
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:26,832
<font color="#00ffff">Hey! Hey! Put the brakes on.
What's the rush?</font>

666
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,668
<font color="#00ffff">I need to get to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!</font>

667
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:30,919
<font color="#00ffff">Good night!</font>

668
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:34,173
<font color="#00ffff">What was that about?</font>

669
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:38,177
<font color="#00ffff">Agnes thinks she's gonna find a
real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.</font>

670
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:40,054
<font color="#00ffff">She's totally
freaking out.</font>

671
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:42,681
<font color="#00ffff">I feel like someone's
gotta tell her the truth.</font>

672
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:43,766
<font color="#00ffff">Not it!</font>

673
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:48,187
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, don't worry.
Parenting 101. I got this.</font>

674
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:51,690
<font color="#00ffff">Um...</font>

675
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:53,942
<font color="#00ffff">And please bless that
when I find the unicorn</font>

676
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,653
<font color="#00ffff">he'll want to come home with me,
and sleep in my room.</font>

677
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:59,698
<font color="#00ffff">And that I can ride him
to school every day.</font>

678
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:03,786
<font color="#00ffff">And he'll use his magical
powers to help me do math.</font>

679
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,037
<font color="#00ffff">Amen.</font>

680
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:09,124
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, hi, Gru.</font>

681
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:13,962
<font color="#00ffff">Hey. So, big day tomorrow.</font>

682
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:17,966
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, I'm finally gonna get
to see a unicorn. For reals.</font>

683
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:21,637
<font color="#00ffff">If I do, can I bring it home?
Please?</font>

684
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:23,889
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, yeah. Sure.</font>

685
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:28,477
<font color="#00ffff">Tell you what, every unicorn you find,
you can bring it home.</font>

686
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:31,313
<font color="#00ffff">I'd better build
a big pen, right?</font>

687
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:34,983
<font color="#00ffff">But, you know,</font>

688
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:38,153
<font color="#00ffff">there's a chance that
you might not find one.</font>

689
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:40,239
<font color="#00ffff">Huh?</font>

690
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:46,328
<font color="#00ffff">It might not be good
unicorn-finding weather.</font>

691
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:52,334
<font color="#00ffff">Um... They're tricky
to find them.</font>

692
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:56,588
<font color="#00ffff">And I don't know.
Maybe...</font>

693
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:59,842
<font color="#00ffff">Maybe unicorns</font>

694
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,303
<font color="#00ffff">don't really</font>

695
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:09,518
<font color="#00ffff">explore that part of the woods.</font>

696
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:17,025
<font color="#00ffff">But the man said a maiden could
find one if she was pure in heart.</font>

697
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,653
<font color="#00ffff">And I'm pure
in heart, right?</font>

698
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:22,072
<font color="#00ffff">The purest.</font>

699
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:30,038
<font color="#00ffff">Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.</font>

700
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:31,373
<font color="#00ffff">Good night, sweetie.</font>

701
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:33,083
<font color="#00ffff">Good night, Gru.</font>

702
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:36,545
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Unicorns, I love them</i></font>

703
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:39,214
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Unicorns, I love them</i></font>

704
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:42,217
<font color="#00ffff">Huh!</font>

705
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,220
<font color="#00ffff">I'm okay.</font>

706
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,689
<font color="#00ffff">Hey! Give
that back!</font>

707
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:01,945
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no! Run!</font>

708
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,766
<font color="#00ffff">We've been waiting
a long time. Can we...</font>

709
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,184
<font color="#00ffff">No!</font>

710
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:34,186
<font color="#00ffff">No, please!</font>

711
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,605
<font color="#00ffff">Gru?</font>

712
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:38,857
<font color="#00ffff">Uh-oh!</font>

713
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:52,371
<font color="#00ffff">Ha!</font>

714
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,310
<font color="#00ffff">Huh?</font>

715
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:40,836
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Because
I'm training for the big day</i></font>

716
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,255

719
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:51,346
<font color="#00ffff">What's today's
plan, boss?</font>

720
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,932
<font color="#00ffff">What's the plan?
Silly robot.</font>

721
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:55,434
<font color="#00ffff">I'll show you
the plan!</font>

722
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:58,645
<font color="#00ffff">Time to watch a very special
episode of <i>Evil Bratt</i></font>

723
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:02,065
<font color="#00ffff">to see exactly what I'm gonna
do to stupid Tinseltown.</font>

724
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:06,320
<font color="#00ffff"><i>This week on</i> Evil Bratt...</font>

725
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:11,450

734
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,478
<font color="#00ffff">Seriously, how did this
show never win an Emmy?</font>

735
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:46,234
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And now, it's your turn

00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:12,135
<font color="#00ffff">Come on!
Let's make it a reality!</font>

740
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:19,434
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Here we are, in the dark

745
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,445
<font color="#00ffff">You're gonna scare
away the unicorn.</font>

746
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,614
<font color="#00ffff">If, somehow,
we actually find a unicorn,</font>

747
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:34,741
<font color="#00ffff">I'm gonna film it

749
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,453
<font color="#00ffff">Whoa!</font>

750
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,163
<font color="#00ffff">This is it!</font>

751
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:41,623
<font color="#00ffff">This is where we're
gonna see it.</font>

752
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,960
<font color="#00ffff">Unicorns, here we come.</font>

753
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:46,627
<font color="#00ffff">What's that for?</font>

754
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,588
<font color="#00ffff">Bait! Duh.</font>

755
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:49,673
<font color="#00ffff">Come on!</font>

756
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:54,177
<font color="#00ffff">Now, all we have
to do is wait.</font>

757
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:01,393
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, this is Bratt's lair.
It may not look like much,</font>

758
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,270
<font color="#00ffff">but this place is
armed with some of</font>

759
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:05,230
<font color="#00ffff">the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.</font>

760
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,982
<font color="#00ffff">It's considered
impenetrable.</font>

761
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:10,527
<font color="#00ffff">But a piece of cake
for us, right, brother?</font>

762
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:14,239
<font color="#00ffff">Yes. This is not
like stealing lollipops.</font>

763
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,325
<font color="#00ffff">Whoa!</font>

764
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:24,124
<font color="#00ffff">His security system can detect an
air assault from any direction.</font>

765
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:29,171
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Ouch! No! Ouch!</i></font>

766
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,506
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Please, stop! Ouch!</i></font>

767
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:36,511
<font color="#00ffff">So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.</font>

768
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:38,847
<font color="#00ffff">Next. Ah...</font>

769
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:41,641
<font color="#00ffff">Then there are
these deadly spikes.</font>

770
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,019
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Geronimo!</i></font>

771
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:48,356
<font color="#00ffff">Covered with enough
poison to blow your mind.</font>

772
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:49,566
<font color="#00ffff">Literally.</font>

773
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:51,067
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Ouch!</i></font>

774
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,861
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, good to know.</font>

775
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:56,698
<font color="#00ffff">So here's the plan.
You're the getaway driver.</font>

776
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,867
<font color="#00ffff">So you'll
wait in the boat...</font>

777
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:01,161
<font color="#00ffff">Wait, hold on!
Wait in the boat?</font>

778
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:04,206
<font color="#00ffff">But I wanna be
in on the actions!</font>

779
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:09,294
<font color="#00ffff">Dru, the getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.</font>

780
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,797
<font color="#00ffff">Do you know how hard it is</font>

781
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,007
<font color="#00ffff">doing nothing,
touching nothing</font>

782
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,052
<font color="#00ffff">when all of that adrenaline
is coursing through your veins</font>

783
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,720
<font color="#00ffff">and you must wait?</font>

784
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:20,180
<font color="#00ffff">Can I count on you?</font>

785
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:21,723
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

786
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,558
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, I guess so.</font>

787
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:27,312
<font color="#00ffff">So, I'll climb up to
the cube and enter here.</font>

788
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,898
<font color="#00ffff">Then once I'm inside,
find the diamond.</font>

789
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:34,027
<font color="#00ffff">I've underestimated Bratt before.
It's not going to be easy.</font>

790
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,238
<font color="#00ffff">I think we can handle it.</font>

791
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:42,410
<font color="#00ffff">Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable!</font>

792
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,621
<font color="#00ffff">Whoa! <i>Ay, chihuahua!</i></font>

793
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,832

801
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:17,612

Uh, remember little boots?</font>

802

Whoa, hey!</font>

804
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,663
<font color="#00ffff">What? We're
not engaged.</font>

805
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:30,959
<font color="#00ffff">Look, Niko, you seem like a very
nice boy with a very nice pig.</font>

806
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,420
<font color="#00ffff">Uh... But you're
not engaged.</font>

807
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:36,256
<font color="#00ffff">Okay? It's not
happening.</font>

808
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,341
<font color="#00ffff">I understand.</font>

809
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:40,385
<font color="#00ffff">Who was I kidding?</font>

810
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:43,388
<font color="#00ffff">A dumpling like me
with a goddess like you.</font>

811
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:47,684
<font color="#00ffff">But I promise, I will
never forget you, Margo.</font>

812
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:49,603
<font color="#00ffff">Never.</font>

813
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:53,815
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, I'm pretty sure I won't
forget you either.</font>

814
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:55,400
<font color="#00ffff">Bye. Bye, Niko.</font>

815
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:58,653
<font color="#00ffff">Wow! That was crazy.
Whoa!</font>

816
00:53:58,737 --> 00:54:00,906
<font color="#00ffff">That was totally
humiliating.</font>

817
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:03,992
<font color="#00ffff">Taking a bite of that cheese was the
stupidest thing I've ever done.</font>

818
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,493
<font color="#00ffff">Why did I listen
to you?</font>

819
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,495
<font color="#00ffff">Right. But it's over
now, so...</font>

820
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:10,707
<font color="#00ffff">Oh! Here we go.
Niko...</font>

821
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:15,003
<font color="#00ffff">You refuse my
son's engagement pig?</font>

822
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,171
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

823
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:18,840
<font color="#00ffff">May you and your
daughter die a slow death</font>

824
00:54:18,924 --> 00:54:20,425
<font color="#00ffff">and be buried
with onions.</font>

825
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:24,596
<font color="#00ffff">All right, lady,
that's it!</font>

826
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:25,680
<font color="#00ffff">Nobody...</font>

827
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:29,976
<font color="#00ffff">Nobody curses my daughter!
Ya got that?</font>

828
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:33,438
<font color="#00ffff">Because if you mess with Margo,
you mess with me!</font>

829
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:37,567
<font color="#00ffff">And I promise, you do
not wanna mess with me.</font>

830
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,945
<font color="#00ffff">Do you understand me?</font>

831
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:41,196
<font color="#00ffff">Yes. Yes.</font>

832
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:43,615
<font color="#00ffff">Good.
Now get!</font>

833
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:49,704
<font color="#00ffff">Look, Margo, I think
we just need to... Oh.</font>

834
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:54,876
<font color="#00ffff">Yes!</font>

835
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,212
<font color="#00ffff">I have to tell Gru!</font>

836
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:14,729
<font color="#00ffff">Can we go back now?</font>

837
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:17,816
<font color="#00ffff">Already? Just
a couple more hours.</font>

838
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:19,859
<font color="#00ffff">We have to be home
before it gets dark.</font>

839
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:23,238
<font color="#00ffff">I don't understand.</font>

840
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:25,573
<font color="#00ffff">I did exactly
what the man said.</font>

841
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:28,952
<font color="#00ffff">You mean that one-eyed scar-faced
man that everybody laughed at?</font>

842
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:31,371
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, it makes
no sense.</font>

843
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:32,747
<font color="#00ffff">Look, Agnes,
maybe we're not...</font>

844
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:48,138
<font color="#00ffff">Ooh, my whole life has been
building to this moment.</font>

845
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:55,854
<font color="#00ffff">Um... It's a...</font>

846
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,647
<font color="#00ffff">Unicorn!</font>

847
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:01,151
<font color="#00ffff">I can't believe it!</font>

848
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:04,154
<font color="#00ffff">I'm gonna name
you Lucky!</font>

849
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,115
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, Lucky, stop it!</font>

850
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,953
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, I'll let someone
else burst her bubble.</font>

851
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:21,963
<font color="#00ffff">Look at us!
Two brothers pulling a heist!</font>

852
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,841
<font color="#00ffff">And that diamond will
make us the richest,</font>

853
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:27,552
<font color="#00ffff">most powerful
villains in the world!</font>

854
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:28,887
<font color="#00ffff">Right, brother?</font>

855
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:32,974
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, right. Yep, yeah.</font>

856
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:38,313
<font color="#00ffff">Bravo! <i>Bravissimo!</i></font>

857
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,981
<font color="#00ffff">You're amazing!
I'm so sorry.</font>

858
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:41,608
<font color="#00ffff">I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.</font>

859
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,544
<font color="#00ffff">And you were always such a gentleman.
You did it!</font>

860
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:45,820
<font color="#00ffff">You did it!
You got our jobs back!</font>

861
00:56:51,743 --> 00:56:54,412
<font color="#00ffff">What?
Oh, yeah, right. Sure.</font>

862
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,955
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, look.
We're here!</font>

863
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:05,840
<font color="#00ffff">I'm going in.
Take the wheel.</font>

864
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:07,967
<font color="#00ffff">I still don't see why
I can't go with you.</font>

865
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:09,677
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, hey!
We discussed this.</font>

866
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:12,180
<font color="#00ffff">Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.</font>

867
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:13,431
<font color="#00ffff">Fine.</font>

868
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:26,986
<font color="#00ffff">Ha-ha!</font>

869
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:28,822
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, brother!</font>

870
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:31,741
<font color="#00ffff">What? I told you, you are
supposed to stay with the boat!</font>

871
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:34,911
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, I didn't think you
meant that literally.</font>

872
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:36,913
<font color="#00ffff">What other way
could I have meant it?</font>

873
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:40,458
<font color="#00ffff">All right. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.</font>

874
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:42,877
<font color="#00ffff">Got it.</font>

875
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:44,420
<font color="#00ffff">Whoa!</font>

876
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,631
<font color="#00ffff">Help me!</font>

877
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:48,133
<font color="#00ffff">Ow, ow, ow!</font>

878
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:50,218
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no! The poison spikes!</font>

879
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,011
<font color="#00ffff">I'm gonna be impaled!</font>

880
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,599
<font color="#00ffff">I'm okay.</font>

881
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:59,352
<font color="#00ffff">I miss the minions.</font>

882
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:00,520
<font color="#00ffff">Come on!</font>

883
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:07,902
<font color="#00ffff">Coming.</font>

884
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,076
<font color="#00ffff">Coming.</font>

885
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:20,623
<font color="#00ffff">Come on.</font>

886
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:28,603
<font color="#00ffff">It's a scanning device.</font>

887
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:30,133
<font color="#00ffff">Quick!
Camouflage mode.</font>

888
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:32,510
<font color="#00ffff">Freeze!
And close your eyes!</font>

889
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:34,512
<font color="#00ffff">And cover your mouth!</font>

890
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:42,228
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, take my hand.</font>

891
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:08,379
<font color="#00ffff">Ha-ha! Follow me.</font>

892
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:26,606
<font color="#00ffff">Ha-ha!</font>

893
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:33,571
<font color="#00ffff">Look out!</font>

894
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:40,995
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, you were right. I should
have stayed in the boat.</font>

895
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:43,873
<font color="#00ffff">My stomach feels all queasy.</font>

896
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:46,751
<font color="#00ffff">I shouldn't have
eaten that pot pie.</font>

897
00:59:48,336 --> 00:59:52,507
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, hey, relax.
You're gonna be just fine.</font>

898
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,841
<font color="#00ffff">I got your back.</font>

899
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,100
<font color="#00ffff">Come on. This way.</font>

900
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:39,137
<font color="#00ffff">Huh?</font>

901
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:43,808
<font color="#00ffff">Hmm?</font>

902
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,526
<font color="#00ffff">Looks like
it's right above us.</font>

903
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:38,237
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, what do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?</font>

904
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:39,781
<font color="#00ffff">No, come with me.</font>

905
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:54,629
<font color="#00ffff">Dru, get off the bed!</font>

906
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:57,632
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, I'd like to
thank the Academy...</font>

907
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:01,636
<font color="#00ffff">I can help.
No, no, no.</font>

908
01:02:01,803 --> 01:02:03,238
<font color="#00ffff">What? I can do it.
Don't! Don't! Don't!</font>

909
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:04,263
<font color="#00ffff">Why, yes.</font>

910
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,100
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, Molly Ringwald, I will take
you to the prom.</font>

911
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:10,436
<font color="#00ffff">What? Who? Where? What?
Who's there? Who is there?</font>

912
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,780
<font color="#00ffff"><i>99 of red balloons</i></font>

913
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,323
<font color="#00ffff">Whoops! Almost forgot!</font>

914
01:02:33,543 --> 01:02:35,503
<font color="#00ffff">Over here.</font>

915
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:38,840
<font color="#00ffff">Stay close.</font>

916
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:42,802
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

917
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,595
<font color="#00ffff">Dolls.</font>

918
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:46,597
<font color="#00ffff">Looks like Bratt
was the only one</font>

919
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,599
<font color="#00ffff">stupid enough
to buy this junk.</font>

920
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:51,519
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, I used to have
one of these!</font>

921
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:58,484
<font color="#00ffff">Ow!
Hey! Shh! Come on.</font>

922
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:09,120
<font color="#00ffff">All right.
We're getting close.</font>

923
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,539
<font color="#00ffff">From now on,
every move must be made</font>

924
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:13,875
<font color="#00ffff">with total
precision and purpose.</font>

925
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:17,128
<font color="#00ffff">Gum!</font>

926
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:18,379
<font color="#00ffff">Focus!</font>

927
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:21,591
<font color="#00ffff">We're after the diamond,
not the bubblegum.</font>

928
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:22,884
<font color="#00ffff">Got it!</font>

929
01:03:25,303 --> 01:03:26,679
<font color="#00ffff">Mmm. Yum.</font>

930
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:29,849
<font color="#00ffff">This way!</font>

931
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:33,478
<font color="#00ffff">And now, to put this
where it belongs.</font>

932
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:35,730
<font color="#00ffff">What...</font>

933
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:39,066
<font color="#00ffff">Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!</font>

934
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:47,450
<font color="#00ffff">Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us!</font>

935
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:53,414
<font color="#00ffff">Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!</font>

936
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:59,670
<font color="#00ffff">Intruders!
Intruders! Intruders!</font>

937
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:04,300
<font color="#00ffff">Freeze, dipsticks!</font>

938
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,677
<font color="#00ffff">Gru? There's two
of you now?</font>

939
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:09,514
<font color="#00ffff">Then this will be
twice as much fun.</font>

940
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,098
<font color="#00ffff">Gru.</font>

941
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:18,397
<font color="#00ffff">Give me back
my diamond!</font>

942
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:19,941
<font color="#00ffff">Total lockdown!</font>

943
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,276
<font color="#00ffff">Oh!
Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!</font>

944
01:04:31,118 --> 01:04:33,246
<font color="#00ffff">They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!</font>

945
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,208
<font color="#00ffff">Run!</font>

946
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:49,178
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no!</font>

947
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,097
<font color="#00ffff">What does that mean?</font>

948
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:53,683
<font color="#00ffff">Are we gonna die?
Are we gonna die?</font>

949
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:55,768
<font color="#00ffff">We're gonna die!
Dru!</font>

950
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:06,487
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

951
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:09,156
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, guys. Hold on!</font>

952
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:10,950
<font color="#00ffff">Lucy!</font>

953
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,793
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you for saving us.
Whoo!</font>

954
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,170
<font color="#00ffff">Look! We got the diamond
and we're going to...</font>

955
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:26,507
<font color="#00ffff">Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back.</font>

956
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:27,842
<font color="#00ffff">Wait!</font>

957
01:05:28,009 --> 01:05:29,635
<font color="#00ffff">What? Oh,
that's amazing!</font>

958
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:31,721
<font color="#00ffff">And the best part is,
you'll never...</font>

959
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:33,806
<font color="#00ffff">...ever go behind
my back...</font>

960
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:37,268
<font color="#00ffff">...ever again,
right, honey bear?</font>

961
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:39,562
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah! Yeah, right.</font>

962
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:41,105
<font color="#00ffff">Lesson learned.</font>

963
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:55,933
<font color="#00ffff">I'll get the girls
and start packing.</font>

964
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,075
<font color="#00ffff">And tell them
the good news!</font>

965
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,124
<font color="#00ffff">Ah! We're getting
our jobs back. Yeah!</font>

966
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,375
<font color="#00ffff">Yes! Yes!
Go tell the girls.</font>

967
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:03,336
<font color="#00ffff">Dru...</font>

968
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:06,631
<font color="#00ffff">No! No way! We can't
give the diamond back!</font>

969
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:07,965
<font color="#00ffff">I have to.</font>

970
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,092
<font color="#00ffff">No, you don't!
Yes, I do.</font>

971
01:06:10,176 --> 01:06:11,594
<font color="#00ffff">- Give it!
- No!</font>

972
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:13,054
<font color="#00ffff">Give it!
Ow!</font>

973
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:14,639
<font color="#00ffff">What is wrong with you?</font>

974
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:15,848
<font color="#00ffff">What is wrong with you?</font>

975
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:17,099
<font color="#00ffff">You kicked me!</font>

976
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:18,351
<font color="#00ffff">You... You lied to me!</font>

977
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:20,269
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, I would have
told you the truth.</font>

978
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:23,147
<font color="#00ffff">But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.</font>

979
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,523
<font color="#00ffff">That's it.
I'm out of here.</font>

980
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:27,735
<font color="#00ffff">You have no right to take that.
We stole it together.</font>

981
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:29,654
<font color="#00ffff">Together?</font>

982
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:31,072
<font color="#00ffff">You got to be
kidding me.</font>

983
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,366
<font color="#00ffff">You did nothing but screw up
the whole time.</font>

984
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:34,700
<font color="#00ffff">I got this in spite of you.</font>

985
01:06:35,076 --> 01:06:38,871
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, yeah? At least I didn't
get fired from my job</font>

986
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,414
<font color="#00ffff">like a total loser.</font>

987
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:42,249
<font color="#00ffff">At least I had a job.</font>

988
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,335
<font color="#00ffff">What have you accomplished
that was so great?</font>

989
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:47,046
<font color="#00ffff">I'll tell you what. Nothing!</font>

990
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,591
<font color="#00ffff">No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.</font>

991
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:55,012
<font color="#00ffff">We are no
longer brothers.</font>

992
01:06:55,096 --> 01:06:56,889
<font color="#00ffff">That's fine with me.</font>

993
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:42,518
<font color="#00ffff">Gru! I found
a unicorn!</font>

994
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:46,522
<font color="#00ffff">My life is complete!</font>

995
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:51,026
<font color="#00ffff">Honey, that's...</font>

996
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,738
<font color="#00ffff">That's not actually
a unicorn.</font>

997
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,281
<font color="#00ffff">Huh?</font>

998
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:59,452
<font color="#00ffff">But, but, he has one horn.</font>

999
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:02,663
<font color="#00ffff">I'm...
I'm sorry, sweetie...</font>

1000
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:05,166
<font color="#00ffff">but he's just a goat.</font>

1001
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:08,711
<font color="#00ffff">Life is just
like that sometimes.</font>

1002
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:12,715
<font color="#00ffff">We're hoping for a unicorn,
and we get a goat.</font>

1003
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:17,303
<font color="#00ffff">Well, you know what?</font>

1004
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:21,432
<font color="#00ffff">Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!</font>

1005
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:25,144
<font color="#00ffff">Look at that face!
I just want to squeeze it.</font>

1006
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:26,353
<font color="#00ffff">Mmm!</font>

1007
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:30,107
<font color="#00ffff">Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!</font>

1008
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:31,776
<font color="#00ffff">I'll take this.</font>

1009
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:34,695
<font color="#00ffff">You've been
a bad boy, Gru.</font>

1010
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:36,509
<font color="#00ffff">Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?</font>

1011
01:08:37,031 --> 01:08:38,657
<font color="#00ffff">Come on, girls.
Let's go!</font>

1012
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:42,369
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Let's get physical, physical</i></font>

1013
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:51,420
<font color="#00ffff">Change of plans, girls.</font>

1014
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:53,839
<font color="#00ffff">Instead of going home...</font>

1015
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:56,008
<font color="#00ffff">Eyebrows! Ow!</font>

1016
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,636
<font color="#00ffff">We're going to Hollywood!</font>

1017
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:03,098
<font color="#00ffff">Now, that's what
I call acting.</font>

1018
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:06,769
<font color="#00ffff">Let's go, Clive!
We've got a giant robot waiting!</font>

1019
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:11,565
<font color="#00ffff">Huh?</font>

1020
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,527
<font color="#00ffff">Lucy?</font>

1021
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:16,362
<font color="#00ffff">But...</font>

1022
01:09:16,445 --> 01:09:17,780
<font color="#00ffff">Bratt! He took the girls!</font>

1025
01:09:24,954 --> 01:09:27,373
<font color="#00ffff">Go away!
I don't wanna talk to you.</font>

1026
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:29,583
<font color="#00ffff">Bratt has the girls!</font>

1027
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:39,343
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, brother.
About what I said...</font>

1028
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:40,761
<font color="#00ffff">No, I'm the one...</font>

1029

1034
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:52,982
<font color="#00ffff">What is that?</font>

1035
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,783

Thank you so... Oh!</font>

1096
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,520
<font color="#00ffff">Look at what we have here.</font>

1097
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:05,771
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry, Gru. This is going to
be a total burn!</font>

1098
01:16:11,193 --> 01:16:13,654
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no! No, no, no!</font>

1099
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,994
<font color="#00ffff">I've been a bad boy!</font>

1100
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:32,506
<font color="#00ffff">Nobody messes
with my brother!</font>

1101
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:46,061
<font color="#00ffff">What? What's happening? No!</font>

1102
01:16:59,074 --> 01:17:00,075
<font color="#00ffff">Dru!</font>

everything!</font>

1105
01:17:10,294 --> 01:17:12,462
<font color="#00ffff">And now,
it's time to die.</font>

1106
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:14,840
<font color="#00ffff">Any last words, Gru?</font>

1107
01:17:15,716 --> 01:17:17,175
<font color="#00ffff">You know what?</font>

<font color="#00ffff">I am going to enjoy this.</font>

1112
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:49,624
<font color="#00ffff">Enough!</font>

1113
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:51,918
<font color="#00ffff">My turn!</font>

1114
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:13,315
<font color="#00ffff">Uh-oh.</font>

1115
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:18,779
<font color="#00ffff">Game over!</font>

1116
01:18:21,031 --> 01:18:23,742
<font color="#00ffff">Is this what
you're looking for?</font>

1117
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,160
<font color="#00ffff">No!</font>

1118
01:18:35,212 --> 01:18:37,047

1119
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,470
<font color="#00ffff">Curse you, Gru!</font>

1120
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:45,222
<font color="#00ffff">Curse you!</font>

1121
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:56,316
<font color="#00ffff">Dru? Dru?</font>

1122
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:06,326
<font color="#00ffff">Hey! We did it!</font>

1123
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,829
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, we did, brother.</font>

1124
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:10,534
<font color="#00ffff">- Gru!

1125
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:12,582
<font color="#00ffff">Gru!
Girls!</font>

1126
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:27,222
<font color="#00ffff">Gru!</font>

1127
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:29,558
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, Mel. Welcome back.</font>

1128

1130
01:20:09,139 --> 01:20:10,474
<font color="#00ffff">I'm a mom.</font>

1131
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:13,018
<font color="#00ffff">I'm a mom!</font>

1132
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:30,494
<font color="#00ffff">Boys, time for bed!</font>

1133
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,245
<font color="#00ffff">We're back at work
in the morning.</font>

1134
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:34,372
<font color="#00ffff">I'm coming, sweetie.</font>

1138
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:41,922
<font color="#00ffff">So no villainy tonight,
huh? Got it?</font>

1139
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:45,300
<font color="#00ffff">I make no promises.
Love you!</font>

1140
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:47,594
<font color="#00ffff">Uh-huh. Right.</font>

1141
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:48,762
<font color="#00ffff">I love you, too.</font>

1142
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:50,597
<font color="#00ffff">Aw!</font>

What is happening?</font>

1146
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:22,170
<font color="#00ffff">It's coming
from outside!</font>

1147
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:28,134
<font color="#00ffff">Hey! I thought we
said no more villainy!</font>

1148
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:29,386
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry, brother!</font>

1149
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:33,390
<font color="#00ffff">Somebody's gotta keep the
family tradition alive, right?</font>

1150
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:45,569
<font color="#00ffff">Let's get him.
Ugh.</font>

1151
01:21:45,652 --> 01:21:47,946

five-minute head start.</font>
