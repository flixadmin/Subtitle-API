1
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:09,552
<i>Missing my girl
has me feeling so low</i>

2
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:14,224
<i>I think I could've loved her
In this world or another</i>

3
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:19,187
<i>But now I'm stuck
Looking up from below</i>

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,151
<i>Space girl floating away
Space girl...</i>

5
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,489
What are you doing here?
How are you even alive?

6
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,200
What a fantastically boring question.

7
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,410
Kayla downloaded me
from the cloud onto your printer.

8
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:37,080
A better question would be why?

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,460
Why shouldn't I just slit your throat
and watch you bleed out on my carpet?

10
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:44,003
Oh.

11
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:47,966
Because then you wouldn't have
any more of your questions answered.

12
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,926
Until you print yourself out again.

13
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:54,931
Alas, you're looking at the last gen me.

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,308
My data was corrupted

15
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:01,437
when a certain someone blew up my lab
before my upload was complete.

16
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,982
But that's cool. I forgive you.

17
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,858
You kidnapped me.

18
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,861
You manipulated me
in every possible way.

19
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,238
True.

20
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,449
But I also saved you... No, no.

21
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,410
Not going to make this about me.

22
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,288
You see, I've changed.

23
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:21,541
You've changed?

24
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,419
And why should I believe you?

25
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,045
Let me prove it to you.

26
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:30,383
Come on, what do you say, Sara Lance?

27
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,219
Is there room for
one more mixed-up outcast

28
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:35,847
on this zany little ship of yours?

29
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:42,228
Actually, I think we have a room
that would suit you perfectly.

30
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:47,567
That's Bishop?

31
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:49,319
Not at all what I was expecting.

32
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:51,946
For a psychotic supervillain,
the guy's got a great look.

33
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,656
Yeah, they always do.

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,326
So, shall we start
with the introductions?

35
00:01:57,243 --> 00:02:00,872
You are, of course, Ava.

36
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,832
Not just any Ava.

37
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,250
The Ava.

38
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,835
Congratulations, by the way.

39
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:07,837
Your engagement ring.

40
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,506
So, do you two kids
have a date yet? Or...

41
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,633
All right, that is enough.

42
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,760
Don't listen to him.
Don't even talk to him.

43
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,470
He's just trying to get into our heads

44
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:19,807
so that he can do whatever it is
he came here to do.

45
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,434
Where the hell is she?

46
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:23,685
You...

47
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:28,316
My colleague Kayla had very strong
thoughts about you ceasing to exist.

48
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,734
What happened, I wonder.

49
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,612
She changed her mind.

50
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,572
Is that so?

51
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,533
Well, speaking of changes,
love the new do.

52
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:39,661
Everybody out. Let's go.

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,246
Everybody out. Except for Spooner.

54
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,915
Keep an eye on him.

55
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,376
If he tries to escape,
shoot him in the face.

56
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,878
You got it, <i>capitán.</i>

57
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:53,841
Why would I want to escape
when I feel like I am finally home?

58
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:09,607
Something's missing.

59
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,026
What do mean, something's missing?
Like his moral compass?

60
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,903
No, like, 6% of who Bishop is,

61
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,989
we destroyed his compound before
he could finish uploading himself.

62
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,533
You know what, guys?

63
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,868
A true psychopath
wouldn't want to just murder

64
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:22,262
the woman who destroyed his life work,

65
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,664
he'd really want to take some time
torturing her, you know?

66
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,541
Thanks, babe, that's very reassuring.

67
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,460
But if Bishop wants to play chess,
he has chosen the wrong opponent.

68
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:33,423
Uh, no. No, no, no. Absolutely not.

69
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,425
Please, come on, babe.

70
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,528
I've always wanted to get inside
the mind of an evil genius.

71
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,220
Who, technically speaking, created you.

72
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,889
- Both of you, actually.
- Not helping, Nate.

73
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,225
Look, babe, I'll just go in there

74
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,744
and try to find a way
to connect with him.

75
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,229
That way we can figure out
why the hell he's here.

76
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,605
- You sure?
- Yes.

77
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,941
Okay. All right.

78
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,068
Just don't let him
get into your head, okay?

79
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,369
Bloody hell.

80
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,205
Ah...

81
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,791
Yeah, it's all coming back to me now.

82
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,379
Really made a dog's dinner
of that parlor game, didn't I?

83
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,760
- I take it the Beast got me.
- No, John, that was me.

84
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:25,892
I stabbed the Beast in the back,
and somehow you woke up with a scar.

85
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,728
- Look, I can explain...
- Oh, can you?

86
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,857
Can you explain
how you nearly killed all of us?

87
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,359
How you lied to me yet again?

88
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,154
Lying was part of Gary's game.
I didn't make up the rules, love.

89
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,991
Don't call me "love" and don't pretend
like this was all a game.

90
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,410
You know,
my brother was right about you.

91
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,663
- You're different, John.
- Yeah, I'm different.

92
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,415
How many people do you know have drunk

93
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,293
from the Fountain of bloody Imperium?
But don't worry, all right?

94
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:57,089
I just need a bit of time
to get a handle on my newfound power.

95
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,134
Maybe I should woodshed
my magic by myself. Eh?

96
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,261
Yeah, I think that's best.

97
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,013
Oh, come on, don't be like that.

98
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,391
Come on, love... my love.

99
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,686
Damn it, Johnny.

100
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,543
John's lying to me. Again.

101
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,443
Glad he's feeling like his old self.

102
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,569
No, he's... he's trying to

103
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,863
blame his behavior on the Fountain,
but I don't buy it.

104
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,574
Can't you whip up some kind of
truth serum or whatever?

105
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,076
Yeah, it's called Scotch.

106
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,578
Hey, I'm serious.

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,082
You would still be stuck in that game
if it weren't for me.

108
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,165
Please.

109
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:36,546
Look, if you want to find out
what happened with John at the Fountain,

110
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,714
it is not my help you need.

111
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,968
Spoons.

112
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,929
That is a great idea.
She can help us. Come on.

113
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,765
I guess my life could use
a little more drama.

114
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:53,062
I was hoping
we'd have a chance to <i>kibitz.</i>

115
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,189
Get to know each other,
just you and me.

116
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,983
But you already know me.

117
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,694
You had a planet full of me's,
didn't you?

118
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,904
Don't sell yourself so short.

119
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,574
Sara could have had her pick of my Avas,

120
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,202
yet she turned over the heavens
to get back to you.

121
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,495
So what makes you so special?

122
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,083
Sara said you'd do this,
try to get in my head.

123
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,044
Like she isn't interested
in getting into mine.

124
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,213
I knew this was a mistake.

125
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,090
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

126
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,426
Please, don't go.

127
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,803
We've hardly broken the ice.

128
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,057
Mmm. Thatagirl. You see that?

129
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,018
Making Bishop think

130
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,186
- that she's the vulnerable one.
- Mmm.

131
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,374
You know what?
You can play nice all you want,

132
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,667
but it still doesn't excuse the fact

133
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,484
that you kidnapped the woman
that I love.

134
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,487
But the fact that I did so
in order to save all of humanity...

135
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,323
changes nothing. You're right.

136
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,618
I was an arrogant, egomaniacal...

137
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,370
meanie.

138
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:55,958
And so what now? Hmm?
You come here to turn over a new leaf?

139
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,752
Is that what we're all
supposed to believe?

140
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,171
Where else would I go?

141
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,214
What else would I do?

142
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:05,676
Look, I know this is going
to sound perverse, but...

143
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,014
But what?

144
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,518
You and Sara are the closest thing
I have left to family.

145
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,272
I know, it sounds insane.

146
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,523
No, I get it, actually.

147
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,443
You're a clone, I'm a clone

148
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,737
and it's not like
I have any real family.

149
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,864
So, sure.

150
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:31,911
I guess in some perverse way,
we are like family.

151
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,791
Playing him like a fiddle.

152
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,460
Bishop's not gonna let himself
be manipulated that easily.

153
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,254
Can I tell you a secret?

154
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:46,759
You were always my favorite Ava.

155
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:50,054
Not you personally, of course.
Your model.

156
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:53,140
You mean "bossy Ava?"

157
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:56,018
Ugh. A moniker our marketing department
came up with.

158
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,354
I wanted to call you "Boss Ava."

159
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,023
People were afraid of a clone
that would tell them what to do,

160
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,484
except that is precisely
what you were designed for.

161
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:07,530
But you have exceeded my wildest dreams.

162
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,741
You're getting married.

163
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,369
Didn't see that one coming.

164
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,079
Why not?

165
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,164
I lowered the oxytocin levels
on all the clones,

166
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,582
the so-called "love hormone."

167
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,627
I didn't want you falling in love.
It hurts productivity.

168
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:27,008
Maybe that's why I'm having such
a hard time planning this damn wedding.

169
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,884
Productivity is usually my strong suit,

170
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,429
and I can't even put together
a seating arrangement.

171
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,847
Maybe I can help.

172
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,725
Not like I have anything else to do.
It'll be fun.

173
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,561
If Sara even knew I was talking to you...

174
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,397
Oh, come on. It'll be our little secret.

175
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,818
How do I know you're not doing this
to get me to let my guard down?

176
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,987
I am doing this so that
you'll let your guard down.

177
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:51,657
I want to get to know you, Ava.

178
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,701
I have to go.

179
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,580
I can also help your friend Rory.

180
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,625
What? What's wrong with Rory?

181
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:06,964
Nothing... yet, but those babies
in his head are getting hungry.

182
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,258
- How the hell did you know...
- Kayla letting him live.

183
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,819
The fact that
he's experiencing headaches,

184
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,261
that luxurious hair.

185
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:16,057
Doesn't take a genius to realize
he mated with a Necrian.

186
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,809
I spent eons trying to meld
humans and aliens

187
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,312
and never thought to do it
the old-fashioned way.

188
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,606
I can help you save Rory

189
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,025
by giving his spawn
the proper nutrients.

190
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,863
It's either that or... his brain.

191
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:40,664
Mmm.

192
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,211
Mmm-hmm.

193
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,630
Oh. I guess it worked.

194
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,549
Of course it did. I made Bishop think
that I needed something from him

195
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,802
and he proved himself
to be trustworthy for now.

196
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:56,931
But believe me, this is just the
opening move of our little chess match.

197
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,059
What does that make me? The pawn?

198
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,435
Hmm.

199
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,937
It's not that bad.

200
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,062
Oh!

201
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,233
What? I have alien taste buds,
what can I say?

202
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,194
Are you sure it's okay we leave
Spooner in there alone with Bishop?

203
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,404
There's no way
he's getting in her head.

204
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,955
Spoon, we need to talk about Spain.

205
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,543
What about Spain?

206
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:27,378
Did someone say Spain?

207
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:31,173
I spent a week in Ibiza once,
didn't sleep a wink.

208
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,675
Last thing I remember, I was...

209
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,177
- That's Bishop, huh?
- ...disco sunrise.

210
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:38,264
That turtleneck is doing him no favors.

211
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,266
Anyways...

212
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,894
Hey, what happened when John
drank from the Fountain of Imperium?

213
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,106
Uh, I was with him and the kid
Fernando in the cave.

214
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,275
The fascists were coming and...

215
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,069
Spoons, you okay?

216
00:10:53,696 --> 00:11:00,077
The... the fascists were coming and...

217
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,666
Whoa, okay, that was weird.

218
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,669
It's like something's missing,
like a blank spot in my memory.

219
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,880
Like something's been erased.

220
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,299
You think John put a spell on me?

221
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,133
I'm going to kill him.

222
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:18,470
Just not until we find out
what he wanted you to forget.

223
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:21,348
Which means I'm going to have
to put another spell on you.

224
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,809
Look, I'd love to help you out, but...

225
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:26,145
- Ah, Aves, perfect timing.
- Hey.

226
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,730
What do you guys...

227
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,732
Anyway, I need a moment with Bishop.

228
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:33,485
- He is all yours.
- Just in case somebody gets out of line.

229
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,739
- Thanks.
- Right this way.

230
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,538
So? How's our pregnant friend feeling?

231
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,250
Better. Thank you for the advice.

232
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,756
Perhaps there's some way
I could assist your friend John.

233
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,008
What's wrong with John?

234
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,593
Oh, I don't know. Just...

235
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,887
Your friends seemed concerned about him,

236
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,599
that maybe he drank something
he shouldn't have?

237
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,517
I am a doctor.

238
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,562
No, John's fine.

239
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,443
Why do you do it to yourself?

240
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,784
Oh, nice. You're wearing
my clothes now, are you?

241
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,246
Well, someone's
got to pick up the mantle,

242
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,957
and you're in no shape for it.

243
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,793
But you don't have to suffer,
Johnny.

244
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,548
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Another snort of the Scarlett Lady

245
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,509
and I'll be right as rain, is that it?

246
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,097
You know it's not the first time
I've gotten clean.

247
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,723
Then why haven't you dumped it?

248
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,310
You'll never be clean, Johnny.

249
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,647
You know, you're not even real.

250
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,774
You're just a figment of my imagination.

251
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,694
Some damn junkie hallucination.

252
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,239
And without magic, you're just
a pathetic ex-smoker in a trench coat

253
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,992
who lies to the people he loves.

254
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,660
At least I'll be rid of you.

255
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,079
Have it your way, then.

256
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,792
No, no, no, no. Stop!

257
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,213
Can't you see, John,

258
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,257
you'll never be rid of me.

259
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,093
I am you.

260
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:34,398
You think that that's his real name?

261
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,899
- Bishop?
- Mmm-hmm.

262
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,401
Does feel a little on the nose.

263
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,028
Gideon, how we doing with the scan?

264
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,280
I'm still analyzing
his genetic code.

265
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,491
What are you hiding?

266
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,702
Ten bucks Ava gets it out of him first.

267
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,954
I don't bet against my girl.

268
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:58,797
I spy with my little eye
a wedding binder!

269
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,135
Oh!

270
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,386
It's thorough.

271
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,056
Yes, I've heard that.

272
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,933
Sara put me in charge because
usually I'm the decisive one,

273
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,978
and I can't seem to choose
a single thing.

274
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,521
Okay.

275
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,857
Let's start simple.

276
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,942
What's the coolest wedding
you've ever been to?

277
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,527
What kind of vibe are we talking?

278
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:21,737
Um...

279
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,240
- I've never actually been to a wedding.
- Hmm?

280
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:29,828
Yeah, I was sort of known as the
party pooper at the Time Bureau, so...

281
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,914
Hey, look, it's tough being the boss.

282
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,749
- I know. Thank you.
- Hmm?

283
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,102
Now, look, you're just putting
too much pressure on yourself.

284
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,711
Just go with your gut.

285
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,672
I can't. I don't...
What if I choose something weird?

286
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,758
Who cares? Speed round.

287
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,927
- What's your favorite flower?
- Is cactus a flower?

288
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,136
- Color?
- Grey.

289
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,100
- Appetizer?
- See, this thing about appetizers.

290
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,408
I don't understand why people
have to eat before they eat.

291
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:54,686
Okay, so the ceremony
will be unconventional,

292
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,438
but it's all you.

293
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,732
Admit it.

294
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,025
I'm weird.

295
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,152
Why the hell did you have
to make me so weird?

296
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,405
Look. First off, I didn't make you.

297
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,366
Yes, I designed you.

298
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,744
But everything you've done in your life,
that's your accomplishment, not mine.

299
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,913
And you not knowing

300
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:16,708
whether you want a vegan cake or not
doesn't matter.

301
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,169
I'm going to take that back.
Vegan cakes are disgusting.

302
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:26,718
Thank you for trying to help.
I really appreciate it.

303
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,763
Hey, don't forget, I'm a clone too.

304
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,518
A clone of a clone of a clone
of a clone.

305
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,353
So how many times?

306
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,398
I lost track somewhere around
my 200th reiteration.

307
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,481
Two hundredth?

308
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,026
And every one of them was different?

309
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,821
You know me. I like to tinker.

310
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:51,910
So, how exactly is this you different
from the you Sara knew?

311
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,330
Hmm! Good question.

312
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,041
Oh, come on, you psycho son of a bitch.

313
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,918
Tell her what you're hiding.

314
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:05,340
There was something missing from the me
that Sara met on Pliny X19.

315
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,593
Took me a long time to find it.

316
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,345
You want to know what it was?

317
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,268
Humility.

318
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,857
What a lying piece of crap.

319
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,901
- Humility?
- Hmm.

320
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,486
Wow.

321
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,529
All right, you ready?

322
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,157
Mmm-mmm.

323
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,410
I don't want to bite my tongue off.

324
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,786
You're such a baby.

325
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,502
Tortured mind with secrets hidden,
show me that which is forbidden.

326
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,593
<i>You give me back
my bloody magic.</i>

327
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,266
The fountain.

328
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,809
The fountain didn't want John.

329
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,603
It decided he wasn't worthy.

330
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,396
Then how did he get his magic back?

331
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,148
He took a sip of something.

332
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,359
Look, I don't know what it was,
but when he drank it,

333
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,986
that's when he killed the soldiers
who were attacking us.

334
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,155
Where the hell are you going?

335
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,325
I'm just going to break up with my
lying, dumpster fire of a boyfriend.

336
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,536
A juiced-up warlock
who likes to kill people?

337
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,619
I don't think so.

338
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,792
First, we need to figure out exactly
what John's been dosing himself with.

339
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,298
Your betrothed has good taste
in music and in love.

340
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,176
Found it.

341
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,013
Lou Reed, 1972.

342
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,226
- Looks punky.
- Mmm-hmm.

343
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,188
Well, I guess Sara and I
got engaged at a punk show, so...

344
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,692
Same night that you kidnapped her,
actually.

345
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,738
You want to know the even crazier thing?

346
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,783
If you hadn't kidnapped her,
she may never have proposed.

347
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,286
Wasn't until we all went back
that same night a second time

348
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,955
that she, uh, popped the big question.

349
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,750
- A real mind-bender, huh?
- Yeah.

350
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,839
What do you think?

351
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,384
It's, um, unconventional.

352
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,845
I like it.

353
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,889
So I'm not sure how you...
How do you dance to it?

354
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,558
Let me show you.

355
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:23,687
It'll be our father-daughter dance.

356
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,732
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

357
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,151
You mean with Sara watching?

358
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,153
You knew?

359
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,952
<i>Just a perfect day</i>

360
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,914
That can't be good.

361
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:46,335
Ava's just making Bishop think
that she is playing into his hand.

362
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,588
Like I am doing to you.

363
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,426
<i>Oh, it's such a perfect day</i>

364
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,892
I'm sorry I pried before about John.

365
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,936
No, it's... it's okay.
It's nice of you to try and help.

366
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,522
It's just he's a little more
complicated than Rory.

367
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,192
Mmm. Tormented by demons
of his own making?

368
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,152
- Yes, literally.
- Hmm.

369
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,115
<i>Just a perfect day</i>

370
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,117
- This song...
- Mmm.

371
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,327
Sara is going to love it.

372
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,623
It makes me want to smile
and cry all at the same time.

373
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,792
Yes, I know exactly how you feel.

374
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,959
Why?

375
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,754
Did you design me to feel that way?

376
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,506
What difference does it make?

377
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,427
All of us are just a jumble
of neurons and synapses.

378
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,888
A tiny electrical storm in our head.

379
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,352
Why should your feelings be
any less real than anyone else's?

380
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,773
I'm proud of you, Ava.

381
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,320
I only wish we could have
a dance of our own on your special day.

382
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,616
I can't...

383
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,993
<i>Oh, such a perfect day</i>

384
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,709
<i>You just keep me hanging on</i>

385
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,879
<i>You just keep me hanging on</i>

386
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,437
A-ha!

387
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,897
Bravo. Babe, that was masterful.

388
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,151
The way you played Bishop off of me
to make him think that you trust him.

389
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,986
- Hmm.
- I mean, what a performance.

390
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,157
- That was a performance, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

391
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:47,581
Gideon's scan came back.
He's 100% human. So we know what he is.

392
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,125
You have any theories on why he's here?

393
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,712
Honestly, I think he wants
to get to know us.

394
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,214
I think he sees us as family.

395
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,887
I... I know it's part of his act
or whatever,

397
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,389
but doesn't mean it isn't true, right?

398
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,644
Yeah. Actually,
I think you found his angle.

399
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,482
He is going to use you guys
to get to me, which is smart.

400
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,900
Or maybe this isn't about you.

401
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,693
Maybe the guy's just lonely,
you know.

402
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,154
Not everybody has a family
that they can call their own.

403
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,122
Oh, hey.

404
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,792
Are you checking up on me?

405
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,252
Checking in.

406
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,838
You see, that's what girlfriends do.

407
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,006
Yeah.

408
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,301
I'm sorry. This magic,
it's got a bit of an edge, you know?

409
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,053
Yeah. Yeah, I see that.

410
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,806
Are we okay?

411
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,059
I don't know, John. You tell me.

412
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,271
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

413
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,775
I love you.

414
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:01,196
I just... I hate to piss you off,
you know.

415
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,660
You look tired.

416
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,705
Why don't you go upstairs,
take a bath?

417
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,542
We'll just have
a quiet night at home together.

418
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,126
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

419
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,129
Thanks, love.

420
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,132
Old habits die hard.

421
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,676
Yeah, I know.

422
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,848
- And I'll take a bath.
- Mmm.

423
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:39,526
Three, four, five.

424
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,861
What the hell was that?

425
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,153
A contraction.

426
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,656
A six-second contraction, to be exact.

427
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,033
You are officially in labor.

428
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:50,036
Sooner than expected, but, you know,
we are in uncharted waters here.

429
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,496
When does my head explode?

430
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,791
Your head's not going to explode.
Not with Uncle Gare here.

431
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,044
Although, once you hit the second week
of labor, you might wish it had.

432
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,296
Is it going to hurt?

433
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:03,842
Well, my father describes it
like eating a handful of hot peppers

434
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:07,137
and then passing 50 large pointy rocks
through his Necrian head hole.

435
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,847
Which, for you, will be your ears.

436
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,974
Ears?

437
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,893
I can't do this.

438
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:14,895
I can't do this.

439
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,148
It's totally normal
to feel this way, Mick.

440
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,735
You know, this is just you
facing the reality of these babies.

441
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,362
Soon, you're going to be a daddy.

442
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,407
Single dad, 48 babies.

443
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,492
I didn't sign up for this.

444
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,578
I mean, you're not gonna be alone.

445
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,330
You got me.

446
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,040
You got all the Legends.

447
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,752
Right, yeah. You can be the Godfather.

448
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,463
Yeah.

449
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,383
Yeah, sure.

450
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,676
Whatever.

451
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,805
Who are you trying
to impress? Her?

452
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,934
Or is there another voice,

453
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,770
something more primal?

454
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,730
Will you just shut up, all right?

455
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,732
I don't need you.
I got this under control.

456
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,652
You believe that, do you?
She certainly doesn't.

457
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,906
What the bloody hell are you on about?

458
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:09,950
Check your pocket, John.

459
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,832
- What is it?
- Astra?

460
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,172
It's blood.

461
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,092
In Hell, we call this a Scarlett Lady.

462
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:28,885
What does that mean?

463
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:32,472
It means John has tapped into some
very volatile, very dark magic.

464
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,183
If he doesn't stop using it,
it will kill him.

465
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:36,977
Okay. What if we confront him?

466
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,603
Zari!

467
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,855
Sounds like he'll kill us.

468
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,899
- Where is it?
- John, don't do this.

469
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,485
Now, you stay out of this.
You give it here now.

470
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,532
It's this or me, John.
You can't have both.

471
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:08,925
I'm sorry.

472
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,886
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

473
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,352
I thought I had control of this thing.

474
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,815
But I don't.

475
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,401
I don't.

476
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,445
Is it done?

477
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,072
That was the last of it, yeah.

478
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,492
Now, look.

479
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:40,165
I'm going to lock myself in that manor.
I am not coming out

480
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,209
till this is out of my system,
all right?

481
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,962
I promise you that.

482
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,172
John.

483
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,261
I'm coming with you.

484
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:58,933
Hey.

485
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,230
Look, I'm sorry.
This whole thing is my fault.

486
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,733
I never should have
sent you in there alone.

487
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:10,695
You didn't send me in, Sara.
It was my idea to interrogate him.

488
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,740
Yes. Yeah, you're right.

489
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,829
Babe. I'm sorry, okay?

490
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:24,042
And I'm sorry if I was putting too much
pressure on you to plan the wedding.

491
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,293
I... I didn't...

492
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,378
I thought that it was
what you wanted, and I...

493
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,089
No, I did.

494
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:34,928
I think focusing on dresses
and seating arrangements

495
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:38,306
was reassuring
that things can be managed.

496
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,894
But what can't be managed is that I have
no idea how I'm supposed to be feeling.

497
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:51,820
You know, I never saw my parents
kiss or laugh or fight even.

498
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:56,574
I never had a mom to hug me
after a heartbreak

499
00:26:56,658 --> 00:27:00,328
or just a dad to tell me
that he was proud of me.

500
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,413
I've just never had a family

501
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:04,874
to love me.

502
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,798
And I really don't know that I'm gonna
know how to love ours, that's all.

503
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,090
Babe.

504
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,303
You do not need to learn how to love.

505
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:20,348
Everything about you is love.

506
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,434
And it doesn't matter
where you came from.

507
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,854
You made yourself into who you are.

508
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:29,399
And I'll tell you what, that chick?

509
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,485
She is the most intelligent

510
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:38,491
and funny and loving person
that I have ever met.

511
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,244
I love you.

512
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:44,873
Thank you.

513
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,794
Okay. Will you come and show me
what you've been planning?

514
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,963
- No.
- Come on. I wanna see.

515
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,507
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Start with something good.

516
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:55,592
Here we go.

517
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:57,719
Is that a lemon butter cream cake

518
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,929
topped with maraschino cherries?
Perfect.

519
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,890
Well, the cherries were
Bishop's idea, but...

520
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:04,767
Ooh, I love whatever these are. Yeah.

521
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,895
Actually, that was all Bishop.

522
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,398
Tapas. Yes, that's perfect.
I love that idea.

523
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:14,068
Oh. Well, I was actually thinking a more
traditional, you know, meal service.

524
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,362
But then he suggested tapas
'cause they're more fun,

525
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:19,490
- they encourage...
- ...conversation, and help out people

526
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,256
- stuck...
- ...at the boring table.

527
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,744
Yeah. Wow.

528
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:23,995
Bishop is, uh...

529
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,164
He's pretty good at wedding planning,
I guess.

530
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,583
It's like he's reading my mind
or something.

531
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,668
This? Yes.

532
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,379
Uh, babe, it's not like that.

533
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,340
It is that.

534
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,635
The 6% that's missing. It's...

535
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,386
It's you.

536
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,347
He's 6% me?

537
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,849
What the hell does that mean?

538
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,602
Spaniel, Broad, Tricycle.

539
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,897
System override.
Your orders, Captain?

540
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,233
Shut down electromagnetic barrier.

541
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,500
Twelve, 13, 14...
Your contractions are getting longer.

542
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,252
Your water could break any time now.

543
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,503
Wait, Mick, you're in labor?

544
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,672
I'm going to be a Godfather, Nate.

545
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,508
Wait, do you need anything,
like a Q-tip or something?

546
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,678
Because there's disgusting ooze
coming out of your ear.

547
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:24,347
- Whoa!
- Your hair is already falling out.

548
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,683
- No!
- This is all happening so fast.

549
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,518
Go, go, go, go, go!

550
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,811
I'll get Sara and Ava.

551
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,479
It's happening.

552
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:32,855
Mick's water broke.

553
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,358
I know, it sounds weird to say it.
Come on.

554
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:36,567
Wow, okay. It's go time.

555
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,071
Wait, wait, wait. How did he get out?

556
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,823
I let him out. Sorry.

557
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,157
He knew the override code.

558
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:46,077
Damn it, he got the 6%
with all the useful stuff.

559
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,788
Gideon, be a peach,
and lock down the hallway.

560
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:50,707
Rory.

561
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,171
You're not getting to Rory
without getting through me.

562
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,549
And let's be real,
that's not gonna happen.

563
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:03,094
Sara, you've got this all wrong.
I don't want to hurt him.

564
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,178
I want to help him.

565
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,264
And why would I trust you?

566
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,808
Because I am you.

567
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:12,687
You wish.

568
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,022
You want to fight?

569
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,898
What can I say?

570
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,484
I do too.

571
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,111
Gideon,

572
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,404
set the mood.

573
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,954
This music isn't helping.

574
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,831
Dork.

575
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:41,049
<i>Baby, let's dance
And show me your moves</i>

576
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,134
You know,
they say when you fight yourself,

577
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,469
you're destined to lose.

578
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,599
Destiny is so last season.

579
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,986
Hear the good news?
I'm going to be a Godfather.

580
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,989
Why is the door locked? Rory needs me.

581
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:09,494
I knew you were twisted,

582
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,830
but merging my DNA with yours,
that is next level.

583
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,709
You blew up my lab
before I could finish my upload.

584
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,796
I needed a few more A, C, G and T's
to complete my genome.

585
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,297
Yours were in the system,

586
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,173
so I took them.

587
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,595
Now, I know everything you know.

588
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,350
Unfortunately for you,

589
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,311
that's all you know too.

590
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,780
Lock her up, Gigi.

591
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,157
Get out of my delivery room.

592
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,410
And miss all the fun?

593
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,080
Just in time.

594
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,999
Looks like that first little guy
is about to crown.

595
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,340
He's after the eggs.

596
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,760
- He's hijacked Gideon.
- It's jammed.

597
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,138
- We gotta do a system reboot.
- On it.

598
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,101
Oh, boy!

599
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,855
Yeah. That does not look good.

600
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,314
What doesn't look good?

601
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:27,404
They're breech.

602
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,575
Gideon, lubricate his sinus cavity.

603
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:30,615
What?

604
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:34,412
We're going to have to deliver
these babies... nasally.

605
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:35,913
The reboot's gonna take 30 minutes.

606
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,207
Apparently, Gideon's calendar
needs to be updated.

607
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,332
Damn it!

608
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,711
Spooner, do you have anything
that can shoot through metal?

609
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,423
Now, breathe.

610
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,538
They're coming fast now.

611
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:18,622
How many more?

612
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,166
Just 45 to go,

613
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,543
and then I'll have them all.

614
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,593
- What happened?
- Bishop locked himself in there.

615
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,719
With Mick.

616
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,471
We've got you.

617
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:34,972
All right. Stand back.

618
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,940
Meet the newest Legends!

619
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,871
Look at them. So peaceful.

620
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,457
Lita is going to be so happy.

621
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,172
As much as it pains me to say this,
thank you.

622
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:10,216
Rory would have been dead without you.

623
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,260
Friends?

624
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,513
Don't push your luck.
You should be happy that I thanked you.

625
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,848
Well, you can thank me
by taking me back to my cell.

626
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,977
You're volunteering to go back
into your cell?

627
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
Please.

628
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,944
We would've just let you out if you had
explained what you were doing.

629
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:34,532
I see now how bad it looked
from your end. Hindsight is 20/20.

630
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,412
Look, I get it. I messed up.

631
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:45,668
I've been alone so long,
I forgot what it means to be a friend,

632
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,504
what it's like to be part of a family.

633
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,715
I know I've got a lot of work to do.

634
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,759
I just hope you'll give me a chance
to earn your trust.

635
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,262
We'll see.

636
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,264
Ciao-ciao for now.

637
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:14,113
So, I guess this is it, then,
end of the bloody road.

638
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:20,077
Exorcist, demonologist,
master of bloody bull... squat.

639
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,455
- John?
- Yeah. Yeah.

640
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:23,581
Listen to me.

641
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:29,337
Hey, I know it doesn't feel like
it at this moment,

642
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,466
but this could be a new beginning.

643
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:37,261
You know I meant what I told you,
when I said I loved you?

644
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:41,140
Because I do. I've got to end this.
I've got to end...

645
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,308
John, that...

646
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,101
That doesn't fix anything.

647
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,605
Look, you deserve someone
who is bloody fantastic, all right.

648
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:50,358
Not some pathetic has-been, honestly.

649
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:56,572
I have spent my whole life
trying to be somebody for everyone else.

650
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,911
When I'm with you,
I can just be myself.

651
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,665
That is the greatest gift.

652
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:11,796
I love you.

653
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,173
Not your magic,

654
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,049
you.

655
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:17,884
Hey.

656
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,179
I'm not an idiot.

657
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,974
You've told me so many lies.

658
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,395
I need the truth. The truth.

659
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,482
The truth is, I don't know.

660
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,653
I don't know who I am without magic.

661
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:39,990
I don't know how the hell
I'm going to get through this.

662
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:41,075
I mean, I want to.

663
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,410
But...

664
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,539
If you'll still have me after everything
that I've put you through,

665
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,918
then I want to do it with you.

666
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,892
I am...

667
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:09,687
going to get you a cup of tea.

668
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:12,565
Okay.

669
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,358
All right. Yeah.

670
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:16,902
Oh, yeah.

671
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:19,989
The kettle, it's in the back
of the cupboard somewhere.

672
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,908
Sorry. I mean,
Gidget is going to make the tea,

673
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:26,495
but I'm going to walk all the way there
and back with the tea.

674
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,081
I'm a right lucky bastard.

675
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,417
I know.

676
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,343
<i>Greetings, Mr. Constantine.</i>

677
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:42,970
Who's this?

678
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,638
An old friend

679
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:46,640
you just met.

680
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:47,933
<i>Bishop.</i>

681
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:51,020
You and I have a lot in common,
it seems,

682
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,981
<i>and, perhaps, if you'll trust me...</i>

683
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,691
Yeah, that's not likely, mate.

684
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:02,323
Ever notice
how people romanticize humility?

685
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:04,658
Ironic,

686
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,620
since it's power that changes the world.

687
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,247
<i>I can help you get yours back.</i>

688
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,750
<i>If you do me one...</i>

689
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:17,046
I told Sara
these things were a bad idea.

690
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,111
What?
You thought I just vanished?

691
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,613
Poof!

692
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:45,032
Think I'll stick around, mate.

693
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,910
Yeah, like hell you will.

694
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,165
You see, you're just
my own personal demon.

695
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,001
I should have faced you a long time ago.

696
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,294
Oh!

697
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,964
The gallant hero.

698
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,174
Now, this Bishop bloke,

699
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,093
what was he on about, eh?

700
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:05,761
I don't care.

701
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:07,680
You heard me, I'm done.

702
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,306
Done with magic.

703
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,308
And I'm done with you.

704
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,729
Is that funny to you, is it?

705
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,357
Hilarious.

706
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,201
Ooh!

707
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,002
What? Did you think
I'd just stand idly by

708
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,671
and watch you throw away
all of our power

709
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,630
for a woman?

710
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,480
Oh, Johnny boy.

711
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,943
You need the sense knocked into you,
don't you?

712
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,614
Johnny boy, what a disappointment.

713
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,121
I told you, John.

714
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,751
I'm not just some bloody side-effect

715
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,337
you can get rid of
by tossing your flask.

716
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:23,464
No.

717
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:28,677
I am you.

718
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:31,805
How's the proud papa?

719
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:34,850
Is that mushroom and...

720
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:36,851
- Okay.
- ...ginger?

721
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,812
Yeah, it's Bishop's pregnancy smoothie.

722
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,106
We poured it down Rory's ears,
but I like to drink it.

723
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,190
Oh.

724
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:45,737
That explains
why Mick delivered so quickly.

725
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:49,406
Necrians use ginger to induce labor.

726
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:51,866
What?

727
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,620
Why would Bishop want
to induce Rory's labor?

728
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,122
It's not like he wanted the babies.

729
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,667
Maybe he wanted something else.

730
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,586
Not the ears.

731
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,255
He induced Rory's labor so that
he could get access to his comms.

732
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,757
With comms, he can talk to anyone.

733
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,342
God! He's been studying us this time,

734
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:10,386
trying to see who is vulnerable,
who he can crack.

735
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,346
Figuring out who would help him.

736
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:50,959
<i>Hello, John.</i>

737
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,553
Now,

738
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:57,057
what was it you were saying
about getting my powers back?
