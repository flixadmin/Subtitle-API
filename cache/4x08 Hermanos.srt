1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,918
- Are we done?
- Listen, I -

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,033
This attack on my brother-in-law, I don't know what it means.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,912
Please.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,195
I fear for my family.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,795
I'm sure they'll be fine.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,636
I'm told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,751
It's doubtful he'll live.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,478
Now, thank me and shake my hand.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,712
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,636
Guys, guys, hurry up.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,673
- Can we go now?
- Upstairs, come on.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,272
What's happening?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,194
Eight forty-three.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,437
Time of death, 20:43.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,635
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,076
One of the gunmen died at the scene.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,352
The second succumbed to his wounds earlier this evening.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,118
Agents with the DEA and FBI...

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,074
...in conjunction with APD are working
with Mexican law enforcement...

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,989
...in an attempt to identify the deceased suspects. Both -

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,235
I can give you the highlights.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,997
Your nephews grew impatient.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,636
They continued to press me for my permission to kill Walter White.

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,277
When I wouldn't give it, they settled
instead for DEA Agent Schrader.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,231
But a phone call was placed...

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,000
...to Agent Schrader moments before the attack.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,634
Thus giving him the upper hand.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,673
Marco was shot in the face and died instantly.

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,792
Leonel lingered for several hours.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,673
The warning call to the DEA agent...

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,393
...Juan Bolsa may have some insight...

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,591
...into who placed it.

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,916
Yesterday, federales raided his hacienda.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,032
And in the confusion, Juan was shot dead.

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,755
An accident, perhaps.

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,352
A mistake made by his own men.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,916
Though we may never know.

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,632
At any rate, I thought you should hear it from me.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,919
This is what comes of blood for blood, Hector.

40
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,796
So is this the loud one?

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,309
What?

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,511
I can never remember.

43
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,349
Is this the loud machine with the magnets?

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,074
No. This is the PET/CT scan.

45
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,477
Positron emission tomography.

46
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,878
They've paired that with computed x-ray tomography.

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,028
Quiet. No magnets.

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,952
Right, okay.

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,354
Yeah, thanks.

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,071
I'm still pretty new at this.

51
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,636
One minute, I'm starting a new business...

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,910
...my wife and I are thinking about kids.

53
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,588
Walk into a doctor's office and suddenly...

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,951
- I mean, life as I know it -
- Excuse me.

55
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,433
Yes. I'm waiting to hear a progress report...

56
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,155
...on the thing we discussed, so call me.

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,911
Anyway, so for me, that's been the biggest wake-up call.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,918
Letting go, giving up control.

59
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,954
You know, it's like they say, "Man plans and God laughs."

60
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,713
That is such bullshit.

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,394
Excuse me?

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,989
Never give up control.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,798
Live life on your own terms.

64
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,915
Yeah, no, I get what you're saying...

65
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,156
...but cancer is cancer, so...

66
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,271
To hell with your cancer.

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,393
I've been living with cancer for the better part of a year.

68
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,309
From the start, it's a death sentence.
That's what they keep telling me.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,112
Well, guess what?

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,471
Every life comes with a death sentence.

71
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,832
So every few months, I come in here for my regular scan...

72
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,715
...knowing full well that one of these times -

73
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,195
Hell, maybe even today.

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,914
I'm gonna hear some bad news.

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,991
But until then...

76
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,198
...who's in charge?

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,999
Me.

78
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,910
That's how I live my life.

79
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,678
This residue here is why we descale with cool water...

80
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,269
...from the walk-in and not water from the tap.

81
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,232
Do it again, please.

82
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,237
Pollos Hermanos, where something delicious is always cooking.

83
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,477
Yes, detective.

84
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,069
Yeah.

85
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,796
- Gustavo, thanks for coming.
- Pleasure.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,389
- How's Kathi?
- Much better, thank you.

87
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,160
- And you know Hank Schrader?
- Yes, indeed.

88
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,669
- And Steve Gomez?
- How was your meal?

89
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,952
Agent Schrader and I had a chance to
catch up at one of my restaurants.

90
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,357
I'd eat there every day but I wouldn't fit through the door.

91
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,477
- Well, should we get started?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,351
- I'd like to record this conversation.
- Of course.

93
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,514
The DEA is working on an investigation
which may overlap with my own...

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,358
...so I've asked them to sit in.

95
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,030
Gus, we all appreciate your coming in here to talk to us...

96
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,993
...but you have the right to have an attorney present.

97
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,272
Oh, well, I can't see how that would be necessary.

98
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,391
But then, I have no idea why I'm here.

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,113
So you wish to continue?

100
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,836
Please. I'm very anxious to find out what this is all about.

101
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,516
Sir, your fingerprints were found at a crime scene.

102
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,838
Really? That's surprising.

103
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,554
A drug-related homicide.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

105
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,152
So you knew the victim?

106
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,117
Fifteen years ago, I established a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

107
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,880
I named it after Maximino Arciniega...

108
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,116
...a dear friend of mine who died young.

109
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,749
Gale was a recipient of this scholarship.

110
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,919
He was perhaps one of three dozen.

111
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,758
I see.

112
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,279
And Mr. Boetticher graduated in...

113
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,153
- 1999.
- That sounds right.

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,158
And you kept in contact with him over all this time?

115
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,717
Oh, no. I hadn't seen Gale for years
until I ran into him a few weeks ago.

116
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,798
- Ran into him where?
- At the restaurant.

117
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,592
Well, "ran into" isn't quite accurate, as I assumed...

118
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,588
...he came by to re-establish contact
with me. We caught up briefly.

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,349
He invited me to dinner the following night and I accepted.

120
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,679
It was perhaps a week later when I read about him in the paper.

121
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,553
- Drug related, you said?
- It's a good possibility.

122
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,910
The paper made no mention of that.

123
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
I assumed that it was a random crime.

124
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,873
So after years with no contact, he shows up in your restaurant...

125
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,277
- ...and invites you to dinner?
- He wanted money.

126
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,278
- Gale Boetticher asked for money?
- He didn't say that.

127
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,191
He spoke in terms of a vague investment opportunity.

128
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,234
But it was my suspicion, yes,
as to why he invited me into his home.

129
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,514
He was a very, very talented chemist,
but for reasons I never understood...

130
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,632
...he was more interested in taking shortcuts...

131
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,389
...than what would or could have been a very promising career.

132
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,636
Personal shortcomings notwithstanding...

133
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,910
...he was a warm, gentle person...

134
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,395
...and I thought a lot of him.

135
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,319
At any rate, I declined his business offer...

136
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,717
...and after what was a very pleasant meal, left.

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,998
Can you tell us where you were...

138
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,636
...on the night of Wednesday the 23rd at around 8 p.m.?

139
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,311
- Not an accusation, just a question.
- No, I understand. Let's see.

140
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,958
Twenty-third.

141
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,834
I was at a fundraiser at Presbyterian Hospital.

142
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,600
I was there from 7 to about 10.

143
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,631
Anyone else?

144
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,199
Sorry, yeah. Just one other thing.

145
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,148
Is Gustavo Fring your real name?

146
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,992
Is it my real name?

147
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,715
I know you're a Chilean national...

148
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,957
...but there are no records of you ever living there.

149
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,073
Really?

150
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,871
I mean, records show that you immigrated to Mexico in 1986...

151
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,278
...and years later, you were granted
an entry visa to the United States.

152
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,271
But there's no record of Gustavo
Fring ever having existed in Chile...

153
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,358
...which I find, I don't know, strange.

154
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,831
Well, no, really, it isn't.

155
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,954
Pinochet's government was guilty of many sins.

156
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,390
First and foremost were human rights abuses.

157
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,310
But it was also notoriously unreliable at keeping records.

158
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,358
I'm sure if you keep digging, you'll find me.

159
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,594
Okay, I think that's it, Gus. Thank you.

160
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,234
I hope that I was of some small help.

161
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,830
- You were, absolutely. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

162
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,598
Good to see you again. Oh, no.

163
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,155
- No, please, please. Don't get up.
- Thanks.

164
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,753
Gentlemen.

165
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,396
So are we buying?

166
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,795
This thing with his name? What are you thinking?

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,958
Sure, the record-keeping in South America's hit or miss.

168
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,515
I mean, we run into that all the time, right?

169
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,269
But we usually find something. Before '86 this guy's a ghost.

170
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,314
If State Department wasn't satisfied,
they wouldn't have naturalised him.

171
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,830
Well, maybe, but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.

172
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,191
State just wasn't as tough on background checks pre-9/11.

173
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,472
I don't know what this has to do with the case at hand.

174
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,275
I was curious when his print showed up at Boetticher's apartment.

175
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,436
For me, the scholarship explains it.

176
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,790
I'll admit to a certain degree of bias.

177
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,798
This man has been a longtime friend of DEA.

178
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,710
But that being said, I thought his story was credible.

179
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,554
Well, I agree. I think it was a good story.

180
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,830
Still, why are we hearing it now?

181
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,995
What do you mean?

182
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,637
Well, like you said, he's a-
This man is a big law enforcement booster.

183
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,469
He's reading the newspaper and sees
that someone he had dinner with...

184
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,148
...someone he thought a lot of was murdered.

185
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,033
He reads this and he doesn't make a phone call?

186
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,439
Didn't call you or one of his other cop friends...

187
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,394
...to share his connection with the
case or ask about the investigation?

188
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,558
We can't predicate a criminal investigation...

189
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,796
...on a person not making phone calls.

190
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,118
What do you think, Tim?

191
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,995
Well, I wanna follow up on the scholarship, the alibi...

192
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,077
...but my overall impression?

193
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,395
I believed him.

194
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,596
Nice touch. Birdbath.

195
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,400
- Hey, tiger, how's it hanging?
- Good.

196
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,192
Yeah, so very nice.

197
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,436
What's the damage?

198
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,519
Twelve hundred a month. I did a lot of research.

199
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,190
- That's a pretty good deal.
- You kidding me? That's a great deal.

200
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,197
Speaking of which...

201
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,511
...that's for the week.

202
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,349
Plus there's a little extra in there
for any move-related incidentals.

203
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,549
Thank you.

204
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,998
- Hey, champ, how's the new school?
- Good.

205
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,031
I loved school when I was your age.

206
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,710
Seesaws, story time, chasing girls with sticks.

207
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,597
It wasn't until the fifth grade
that I found out she liked me too...

208
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,549
...but by then her family had moved to Scottsdale, so...

209
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,995
- Carpe diem, okay?
- Okay.

210
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,633
All right. Good boy.

211
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,991
So you'll thank Jesse again from both of us?

212
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,474
You got it.

213
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,151
- So is he- How's he doing?
- Jesse?

214
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,036
He's good. He's busy.

215
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,434
How is it?

216
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,270
Space, lots of light. It's - Little garden out back. It's nice.

217
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,551
And Brock? How's he doing?

218
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,992
Hey, look, I don't mind dropping cheques off every week...

219
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,553
...like Ed McMahon...

220
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,035
...but if you wanna know how they're doing...

221
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,879
...why don't you go see for yourself?

222
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,999
I'll catch you later.

223
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,828
- Hey, you gonna need a ride home?
- No.

224
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,634
Great.

225
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,314
Anyway, I'm proud for not losing my cool.

226
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,239
Plus, it shows our crew that I will support them...

227
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,192
...if a customer's being rude.

228
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,676
You're really taking to this whole be-your-own-boss thing.

229
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,197
Yeah. I guess I am.

230
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,352
Actually...

231
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,396
...I'm thinking about making the move up to management.

232
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,397
Jesus. Corporate America, look out.

233
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,160
Excuse me, I would be a vast improvement.

234
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,114
No one in Kleinman's entire front
office knows about giving an x-ray...

235
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,878
...which is just...

236
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,874
Hey, Dad, whatever happened with your scan?

237
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,071
Did you get the results back?

238
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,271
Yeah, I did...

239
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,550
...and I'm still in remission.

240
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,072
So you're all gonna have to be stuck with me for a while longer.

241
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,269
Cheers, buddy.

242
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,160
What about you, Hank? How you feeling these days?

243
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,271
You know, getting there.

244
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,792
The other day, he had a big powwow with all the DEA muckety-mucks.

245
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,352
What was that about?

246
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,473
Nothing. Just a dead-end.

247
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,318
He won't tell me, either.

248
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,511
Apparently, it's all very hush-hush.

249
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,553
Hey, Walt, do me a favour?

250
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,877
Marie's working tomorrow and there's a gem and mineral show...

251
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,358
...opening at the fairgrounds.
I wondered if you could give me a lift?

252
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,276
Yeah. Sure.

253
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,995
I had a collection of my own in high school.

254
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,636
I mean, nothing fancy. Just entry-level beryls and garnets...

255
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,149
...one passable black tourmaline.

256
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,952
- Turn right here.
- Okay.

257
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,837
But I did have one piece of morganite that was very special.

258
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,279
It'd been heat-treated, so it had that classic cast to it.

259
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,029
That rose, almost salmon hue, you know?

260
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,708
Hey, Walt, there's no rock show, okay?

261
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,909
I just said that so Marie wouldn't freak. Here. Take a right here.

262
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,831
Freak about what?

263
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,277
Hank, where are we going?

264
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,991
Are you hungry?

265
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,511
We're not here for the chicken.

266
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,158
Kill the engine.

267
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,276
All right.

268
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,314
You ready for your mind to be blown?

269
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,439
Sure.

270
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,349
Gustavo Fring, remember him?

271
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,877
He came to the hospital after the shooting. Put up the reward?

272
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,312
He sponsors the DEA Fun Run every year. You've met him?

273
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,469
Yeah, the Fun Run guy. Yeah. That guy, yeah. What about him?

274
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,958
Well, I suspect- I can't prove it, mind you, but I suspect...

275
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,030
...the man's a drug dealer.

276
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,955
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

277
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,277
I mean, honest to God, I really believe...

278
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,950
...that this guy may be one of the
biggest movers in the southwest.

279
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,434
Remember Gale Boetticher?

280
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,029
- That sad sack from the karaoke tape?
- Yeah.

281
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,994
And you said that he didn't strike you as being the boss-man type?

282
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,111
That there was a bigger guy out there.

283
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,598
- Hank, that was just speculation.
- Doesn't matter. It made me keep at it.

284
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,597
And guess what I find?

285
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,157
Chicken Man's fingerprints at Boetticher's murder scene.

286
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,115
- So we bring him in -
- You think that Gustavo Fring...

287
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,753
...killed Gale Boetticher?

288
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,109
Probably not.

289
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,312
These guys usually get a dunce to pull the trigger, right?

290
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,273
But his fingerprints being there
was enough to bring him in. So I -

291
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,397
So you brought him in to the police?

292
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,192
Right. He sits down to talk with us, the problem is that -

293
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,311
What did you ask him? What did he say?

294
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,750
Walt, will you let me finish my story here?

295
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,714
Sorry, I'm just interested, you know?

296
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,675
All right. Whatever. So we bring him
in and he proceeds to kick our asses.

297
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,713
Okay? He's got an explanation for the fingerprints.

298
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,549
He's got an alibi for Gale's murder.
He's got reasons for everything.

299
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,957
This guy is Terms of Endearment convincing.

300
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,957
So he's not guilty?

301
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,038
Yeah. As far as DEA and APD are concerned, he's not.

302
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,118
Officially, Fring's not a suspect.

303
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,199
But I'm telling you...

304
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,877
...something deep down says he's my guy.

305
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,117
Just gotta prove it.

306
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,076
Hank, why are you telling me this?

307
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,911
I need a favour.

308
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,195
What favour?

309
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,677
You see that Volvo station waggon over there?

310
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,079
The guy drives a 10-year-old Volvo. It's brilliant.

311
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,232
Anyway, listen...

312
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,633
...what I need for you to do...

313
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,791
...stick this on it.

314
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,512
GPS tracker.

315
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,918
Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around
on her but she wants to be sure?

316
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,237
Stick this on the car - This part here, it's a magnet.

317
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,998
And see where he goes.

318
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,269
Cool, huh?

319
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,074
Two eighty-nine from SkyMall.

320
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,279
It's not live-view, so we gotta come back later...

321
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,074
...and take it off and stick it in the computer.

322
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,113
Still, a pretty amazing time we're living in.

323
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,594
Hank, isn't that illegal?

324
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,713
I mean, isn't there some sort of unlawful search and something -

325
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,392
It's known as extralegal. But trust me, it's our little secret.

326
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,028
Look, it's easy, okay? Here's what you do.

327
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,437
You untie your shoelace and you head toward the restaurant.

328
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,198
You're walking past the car...

329
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,153
...look down and, "Hey, darn, my shoe's untied. " Okay?

330
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,352
Now, when you bend down to tie your shoe...

331
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,551
...you stick this into the wheel well.

332
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,151
- Then you go inside and I don't know -
- Hank, I don't feel good about this.

333
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,511
I know that this kind of thing is outside your comfort zone -

334
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,029
No, I mean it. This is a mistake.

335
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,115
Walt, I need you to help me out here, okay?

336
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,958
This is really important to me.

337
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,311
Are you gonna make me beg? Come on. Just stick it in there.

338
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,468
Yeah.

339
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,071
Just act normal.

340
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,479
May I help you?

341
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,388
I-I -

342
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,114
Sir, may I help you?

343
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,189
I didn't do it. See?

344
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,834
- I didn't do it.
- Do it.

345
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,832
Do it.

346
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,190
May I help you with your order?

347
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,599
What the hell is he...?

348
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,033
Just made sure it was secure.

349
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,756
Hey, where's my soda?

350
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,670
Just kidding. Let's go. Let's go.

351
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,352
Yes, that one.

352
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,189
I swear to God, I thought I was driving
the man to a gem and mineral show.

353
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,358
All of a sudden he has me pulling into your restaurant...

354
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,994
...and telling me that he's investigating you.

355
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,919
Look, you and I, we've had our differences...

356
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,951
...but I would never -

357
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,314
Look, my brother-in-law, evidence-wise, has nothing.

358
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,715
He's operating on pure conjecture.

359
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,514
And no one, not one person that he works with...

360
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,316
...thinks that you are anyone other
than an owner of a fast-food chain.

361
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,676
But if something were to happen to Hank?

362
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,317
That would only draw their attention
to you and therefore, to me, as well.

363
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,753
We have a mutual interest in resolving this without violence.

364
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,430
I will make sure that he discovers nothing.

365
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,635
Jesse!

366
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,232
What? Oh, hey. Don't wait to be, like, invited.

367
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,078
Are we alone?

368
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,599
- So where do we stand?
- Where do we stand on what?

369
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,554
Where do we stand with the thing that you were supposed to do?

370
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,239
I assume you haven't done it.

371
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,909
You didn't lose it, did you?
You would tell me if you lost it, right?

372
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,678
Oh, Jesus.

373
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,836
Asshole. You're creaming to get it done, go do it yourself.

374
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,191
If he didn't see me coming like he's some kind of...

375
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,719
All right, look. Our timetable has advanced.

376
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,470
You have got to make this meeting happen this week.

377
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,511
Tomorrow. Tonight, if possible.

378
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,474
Oh, tonight. What are you, high?

379
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,435
My brother-in-law, my DEA agent brother-in-law?

380
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,876
He's onto Gus.

381
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,756
Did you hear what I just said? My brother-in-law is onto Gus.

382
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,953
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it,
your brother-in-law. Okay, I'm thinking.

383
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,235
Look. So, what if this is like math or algebra?

384
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,558
We add a plus douche bag to a minus douche bag...

385
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,149
...and you get, like, zero douche bags.

386
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,396
I've got some math for you.

387
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,036
Hank catching Gus equals Hank catching us.

388
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,513
Hank, he's relentless, all right? He won't quit.

389
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,632
Yeah, well, he's got nothing, is all I can say.

390
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,877
- How would you know that?
- Because he's still above ground.

391
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,631
Think a dude like Gus would let your boy anywhere near him?

392
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,673
He'll break out his box cutter on his sorry gimp ass.

393
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,356
So you haven't even seen him since that time at the diner?

394
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,318
Okay.

395
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,719
Think. All right.

396
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,469
They've got to be figuring that we've talked.

397
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,517
So you need to tell Mike that you are
worried about Hank's investigation.

398
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,917
Okay? Hank already knows who you are, by the way.

399
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,796
And besides, you actually did kill Gale, so there's that.

400
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,834
This is all good fodder for you to request a sit-down with Gus...

401
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,316
...so you can discuss what you would say for questioning.

402
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,478
Okay? Now, you just say that you want to be -

403
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,468
No, that you need to be able to be properly coached.

404
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,671
Then, when you're near him...

405
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,314
...you put this to use.

406
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,551
Mike's just gonna tell me to shut my mouth if I get busted.

407
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,355
- He ain't gonna set up no meeting.
- Well, then insist on it, damn it!

408
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,232
Act panicked.

409
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,317
Gus' ass is on the line.

410
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,193
He'll meet with you if he thinks you're a liability.

411
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,188
No. He will waste me if he thinks I'm a liability.

412
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,874
You know what?

413
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,672
Whatever, man.

414
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,995
I'm gonna take a piss.

415
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,157
I think you got a phone call.

416
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,559
Anything important?

417
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,834
- Yes?
- I did some digging around.

418
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,474
- And?
- Neither the DEA...

419
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,592
...nor the APD considers you a person of interest.

420
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,519
Schrader is looking into you totally on his lonesome.

421
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,393
- A voice in the wilderness.
- Does he have resources?

422
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,751
Just him, his credit card and his chauffeur Walter.

423
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,238
He'd be committing career suicide if he
were to mention you to Merkert again.

424
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,796
- No warrant for that tracking device?
- No.

425
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,709
The guy has gone totally maverick.
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

426
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,639
We watch our backs, we don't throw him any bones.

427
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,159
He'll never make a case.

428
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,155
- What about Chile?
- If I can't find any trace before '89...

429
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,635
...I seriously doubt Schrader can.

430
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,638
Seems to me the bigger problem is the cartel.

431
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,469
Now, we can handle them if that's all we've got on our plate.

432
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,311
But dealing with both Schrader and the Mexicans at the same time?

433
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,594
If he happens to be watching when they make a move...

434
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,599
...it could be the perfect storm.

435
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,274
Thank you.

436
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,311
I'll be in touch.

437
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,077
I don't know how many grandmas and grandpas we got.

438
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,396
Is there a couple of them in viewing land?

439
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,070
Well, it's "The Grandparent's Polka."

440
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,752
Hello, Hector.

441
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,435
The cartel has given me its ultimatum.

442
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,676
To which I've said no.

443
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,037
DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.

444
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
He's looking into my past.

445
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,072
Is today the day, Hector?

446
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,152
Gustavo, sit down. You're making me nervous.

447
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,275
It's a good plan. Trust yourself.

448
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,198
Everything is going to be okay.

449
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,913
Are you crazy?

450
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,391
The boss is gonna rip your balls off!

451
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,671
What, you gonna tell?

452
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,794
And you?

453
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,236
They ain't gonna say nothing.

454
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,596
They like what they see.

455
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,755
You're not going to offer our guests anything?

456
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,230
Who says they're guests?

457
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,030
If the boss wants them to drink...

458
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,552
...they drink.

459
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,553
So... the Chicken Brothers.

460
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,072
I like your restaurant.

461
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,999
Dark meat and white meat?

462
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,630
Don't look like no brothers to me.

463
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,155
At last!

464
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,873
The master chefs!

465
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,559
You two...

466
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,435
That chicken you cook...

467
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,157
I swear, it has got to be the tastiest chicken in all of Mexico.

468
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,795
Thank you, Don Eladio.

469
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,469
It's a great honour.

470
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,835
Max is the chef.

471
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,632
The compliments are all his.

472
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,269
Gustavo is too modest.

473
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,317
There'd be no restaurant without him.

474
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,633
Well, however you two do it, keep it up.

475
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,953
Your chicken, it's so... zesty.

476
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,199
Piquant.

477
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,233
But it does not taste like a Mexican style.

478
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,437
It's a recipe I learned in Chile...

479
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,313
...which I've modified a bit for the Mexican palate.

480
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,037
I bet we like a little more chilli than you Chileans.

481
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,838
We Mexicans like a good hard kick!

482
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,877
So... if your partner is the chef...

483
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,279
...then who are you?

484
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,678
Don't tell me you are just the taster!

485
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,116
I handle the business operations.

486
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,914
Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.

487
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,838
Es el businessman.

488
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,589
Good, good.

489
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,792
But tell me something.

490
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,515
That chicken, so fabulous...

491
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,351
...so excellent...

492
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,069
Besides that, what else do you have on your menu?

493
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,479
We have several side dishes.

494
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,672
Rice. Beans.

495
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,350
Sometimes we prepare a carnitas entrée...

496
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,240
...if we come across fresh beef in the market.

497
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,475
Anything else?

498
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,033
Come on, be honest.

499
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,799
There is nothing else you offer? A little taste of something else?

500
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,639
Something on the side?

501
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,433
Because when I send my men to your restaurant...

502
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,552
...they come back with more than just chicken.

503
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,236
They come back with drugs.

504
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,958
Regresan high.

505
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,194
You are selling them narcotics.

506
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,074
Methamphetamine.

507
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,191
With all due respect, Don Eladio.

508
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,833
I didn't sell it to them.

509
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,758
I gave them samples.

510
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,073
Samples.

511
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,309
Some businessman.

512
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,912
I gave them samples to give to you.

513
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,992
To introduce you to our product.

514
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,236
Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offence.

515
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,359
But he... that is to say we...

516
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,473
...could think of no other way to get your attention.

517
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,596
We want to work with you, Don Eladio.

518
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,156
I know all about methamphetamine.

519
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,677
That's poor man's cocaine.

520
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,274
Only bikers and hillbillies use it.

521
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,153
There's no money in it.

522
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,953
May I, Don Eladio...

523
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,271
I am a biochemist by training.

524
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,909
The methamphetamine we make is much superior...

525
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,272
...to the so-called biker crank you know of.

526
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,153
It is crystallised, like glass.

527
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,675
Purer.

528
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,916
And the chirality of the molecule...

529
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,350
...its very structure, is different.

530
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,391
The narcotic effect is far more potent.

531
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,592
This product is the drug of the future.

532
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,432
It'll triple your profits.

533
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,629
Perhaps quadruple.

534
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,357
They're not only good cooks...

535
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,437
...they're great at shovelling manure.

536
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,390
Right now, you deal almost exclusively with cocaine.

537
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,591
But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico.

538
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,709
You are no more than middlemen...

539
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,797
...for the Colombians.

540
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,353
They cut you a percentage for smuggling across the border.

541
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,230
But the lion's share of the profits goes to them...

542
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,029
...despite your assumption of all the risk.

543
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,677
This new crystal methamphetamine...

544
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,556
It's stronger, more addictive than cocaine...

545
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,998
...which means it will move in higher volume.

546
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,033
But most importantly, it's completely artificial.

547
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,431
We can show you how to manufacture it...

548
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,709
...right here in Mexico.

549
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,000
And you keep all the profits.

550
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,518
My men do like your product.

551
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,872
Hector, what is wrong with you?

552
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,356
Why did you not get glasses for our guests?

553
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,317
Go on.

554
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,238
You are quite the talent.

555
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,073
I bet you learned cooking from your mama. Isn't that true?

556
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,836
But... what about the chemistry?

557
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,994
I studied at the University of Santiago.

558
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,310
Gustavo paid for my education.

559
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,509
Oh, really?

560
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,155
I have degrees in both biochemistry and chemical engineering.

561
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,715
With minimal capital investment...

562
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,235
...we can set up a factory-grade laboratory for you.

563
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,512
Train your own people to manufacture large quantities...

564
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,472
...of highly pure methamphetamine.

565
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,835
Fantastic!

566
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,988
Tell me one thing, though.

567
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,556
If you're the cook...

568
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,796
Why do I need him?

569
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,595
Señor?

570
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,949
You.

571
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,639
Businessman.

572
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,516
Why should I negotiate with someone who doesn't respect me?

573
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,871
Who insults me by dealing under my nose without my permission?

574
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,758
Who manipulates me into a meeting...

575
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,197
...in front of my own men?

576
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,475
What do I need you for?

577
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,038
Don Eladio. Please.

578
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,798
I didn't sell anything.

579
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,071
I apologise if you are offended...

580
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,317
...by my method of obtaining this meeting.

581
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,752
I merely took the initiative.

582
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,548
I meant no insult.

583
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,831
Don Eladio, Gustavo didn't mean to offend.

584
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,639
I know Gustavo like a brother.

585
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,068
He's an honourable man.

586
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,874
The most loyal man I have ever known.

587
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,231
He rescued me from the Santiago slums.

588
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,953
He made me the man I am today!

589
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,790
Gustavo is a genius. He will make you millions!

590
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,357
Just find it in your heart to forgive him this one small mistake.

591
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,155
Please...

592
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,835
He's my partner.

593
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,674
I need him! I swear to God!

594
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,635
Look at him.

595
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,273
You did this to him.

596
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,157
Now, look at him.

597
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,839
Listen to me.

598
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,911
The only reason you are alive and he is not...

599
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,237
...is because I know who you are.

600
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,035
But understand...

601
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,597
You are not in Chile anymore.

602
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,634
My advice...

603
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,797
Stick to chicken.

604
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,351
Look at me, Hector.

605
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,717
Look at me.

606
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,791
Maybe next time.
