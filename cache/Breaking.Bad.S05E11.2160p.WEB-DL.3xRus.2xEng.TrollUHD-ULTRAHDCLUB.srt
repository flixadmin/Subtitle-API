1
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,692
Hey, Mr. White. It's me.

2
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:30,155
I know you're probably
real busy with retirement,

3
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,199
but I got some news I think
you should maybe know about.

4
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,577
Me and Declan had some
differences of opinion,

5
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,287
and it got a little

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,164
messy.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,042
It's all straightened out now,

8
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,504
but just a heads-up, there's been
a kind of change in management.

9
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,757
Anyway, just thought you should know.

10
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,593
Feel free to give me a call
if you want the details,

11
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,804
but, you know, it's cool, so whatever.

12
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,640
Okay, then. Thanks. Bye.

13
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,768
<i>Right, so there I am,
I'm on top of the train</i>

14
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,437
pumping the water in, he's watching
to make sure we put in

15
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,815
exactly what he'd calculated.

16
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,485
We gotta be real precise because
water and methylene weigh different,

17
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,029
and he figured it all out to,
like, milliliter.

18
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,638
I'm up there with my hose

19
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,617
we're going as fast as we can.
We only got a few minutes.

20
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,912
At the crossing, we got this guy
who's smooth-talking the engineer.

21
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,596
And it's all just going great

22
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:24,334
until this other dude shows up
in this monster truck,

23
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,170
so we're pretty much screwed,
because he can just push

24
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,798
the entire dump truck off the tracks,
which, you know, is what he does.

25
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,282
Wait. What's your guy doing?

26
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,010
- You can't stop him?
- Yeah, but what's he gonna say?

27
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:39,641
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends
are still stealing cargo back there."

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,560
So I'm looking all around,
because I know we're not done,

29
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,729
but the gallons are slowly ticking away.

30
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,648
And finally Mr. White
tells me to cut it.

31
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,026
So I fling the hose, I'm grabbing the cap,
I'm screwing in the bolts.

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,070
Just, like, busting ass, you know?

33
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:57,576
And then I feel the train start moving
and I'm...

34
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,494
- You're...
- I'm on top.

35
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,122
- Did you piss your pants?
- Yeah, right?

36
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:06,585
So the thing starts speeding up,
so I jump off the moving train.

37
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,143
Like, total stuntman stuff.

38
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,464
It's like <i>Hooper. </i>You ever see <i>Hooper?</i>

39
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,622
Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds.
Good movie.

40
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,592
He jumped out of a helicopter,
not a train.

41
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,326
Whatever, man. It's a good movie.

42
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,078
This guy Jesse, he's underneath,
and the train just drives right over him.

43
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,517
And luckily he's this skinny little guy.

44
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,604
Damn. That's a tight operation.

45
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,398
It was perfect.

46
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,694
No one even knew they got robbed,
just like we planned.

47
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,615
Mr. White told me it was, like,
the biggest train heist ever

48
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,617
like, potential money-wise.

49
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,994
So that's how that happened.

50
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,588
Can I get you anything else?

51
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,840
Nope. Thanks, darling.

52
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,093
I'm ready for the check.

53
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,235
You feeling good about cooking?

54
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,862
Yeah.

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,825
You'll be able to run your own lab?

56
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,828
- Do it up right?
- Yeah. For sure. I got this.

57
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,958
All right.

58
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,462
Let's make some money, then.
I gotta hit the head.

59
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,136
Ever been on a plane and find yourself

60
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,420
looking down at the armrest next to you

61
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:46,518
looking at the little plug
where the ashtray used to go?

62
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,230
I look at that and I say,
"What the hell happened to this country?"

63
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,773
Nanny state.

64
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,932
I see a kid with a bicycle helmet on

65
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,571
I wanna smack the shit out of him,
like, for his own good.

66
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,467
Mr. Pinkman.

67
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,053
How are you today?

68
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,265
Not so good, huh?

69
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:53,186
{\an8}Of course, I might be able
to help you out.

70
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,607
{\an8}I wanna talk to you about
your partner, Heisenberg.

71
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,570
{\an8}See, I know he's my brother-in-law, Walt.

72
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,825
{\an8}Oh, yeah. That's the look.

73
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:14,457
{\an8}Lucky for you,
I'm more interested in him.

74
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,835
So I got an offer.

75
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,005
{\an8}If you help me out here

76
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:26,553
{\an8}tell me all about you and him
and your little meth business

77
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,557
{\an8}maybe I talk to my friends
at the A.P.D,

78
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,767
{\an8}and make all this go away.

79
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,063
{\an8}I know he's the mastermind here.

80
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,316
{\an8}Plus

81
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,820
{\an8}I'm thinking,
based on your recent activities

82
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:48,450
{\an8}that maybe there's a little trouble
in paradise?

83
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,371
{\an8}Maybe you guys aren't
getting along so good?

84
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,917
I'm right, aren't I?

85
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,628
{\an8}Eat me.

86
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,174
Sure that's how you want to play this?

87
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,137
{\an8}Why don't you try and beat it out of me?

88
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,599
{\an8}That's your thing, right?

89
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,611
He really did a number on you, didn't he?

90
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,995
I don't know,

91
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,960
but happy people usually don't go around

92
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,713
throwing millions of dollars away.

93
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,300
{\an8}I don't think

94
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,221
{\an8}Walt's gonna be patting you
on the back for that.

95
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,933
But maybe that's the point.

96
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,145
But, you see, I get that.

97
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,856
My own brother-in-law

98
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,151
lying to me for over a year.

99
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,279
Using me.

100
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,992
Maybe you understand that feeling.

101
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,373
{\an8}Help me out here, Jesse,

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,793
and we can put him away.

103
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,588
I know you want that.

104
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,884
I think you wanna talk.

105
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,142
Not to you.

106
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,104
Agent Schrader,
beat any good suspects lately?

107
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,148
Tall and taller, ask him
about his history with my client.

108
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,193
He knocked the poor kid unconscious
last time they were alone.

109
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,327
So, what'll it be, a civil rights
lawsuit the size of Montana?

110
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,032
Because I'll oblige you.

111
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,201
{\an8}So long, Rocky. Keep your left up.

112
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,370
{\an8}Detectives, I'm inviting you to leave.

113
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,713
I'm gonna try to remain calm,

114
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,418
but will you do me a favor
and tell me what is up with you?

115
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,755
My guys are busting their asses

116
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,341
{\an8}trying to hide Walt's money
from the feds,

117
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,677
{\an8}and you're tossing yours out a window?

118
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:17,307
{\an8}And I have to hear about your little act
of philanthropy on the news?

119
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,267
Did you hit your head or something?

120
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,145
{\an8}Why didn't you call me
the second you got arrested?

121
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,022
{\an8}What did you say to Schrader?

122
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,107
Nothing. Jesus. Just chill out.

123
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,818
{\an8}Chill out? No.
No, I don't chill out right now

124
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,488
{\an8}because things have gone nuclear.

125
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:36,201
{\an8}I imagine Schrader shared
with you his recent discovery.

126
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,747
Okay, well, then you get
my complete lack of chill.

127
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,335
{\an8}Just use the money that I gave you.

128
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,295
{\an8}No, Saul. Saul, I...

129
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:52,008
Stop... Saul. Stop talking. I don't care.

130
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,678
Just... Just make it happen.
Work your magic.

131
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,972
And call me when he's out.

132
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,849
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

133
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,560
{\an8}Oh, okay. I'll be right out.

134
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,773
{\an8}Hey, you going to work today?
You were out late last night.

135
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,026
{\an8}I... Well, I...

136
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,238
{\an8}Yeah, I guess I just lost track of time.

137
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,433
Dad.

138
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,478
I'm gonna head out, okay?

139
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,691
- Where you going?
- Aunt Marie just called.

140
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,028
She wants me to help her
with some computer thing,

141
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,239
and asked me to stay for dinner.

142
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,991
That cool?

143
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,747
- I guess that...
- Cool. All right, see you later.

144
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,293
Wait, son?

145
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,336
- Junior. Hang on a second.
- Yeah?

146
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,423
- Oh, good. Come on back inside.
- What happened?

147
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,967
Oh, this? Nothing.
No, I'm fine. It's fine.

148
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,126
Really. I do wanna talk to you, though.

149
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,054
Okay. Are you okay?

150
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,348
Yeah. Here. Sit down a second.

151
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,772
I just don't wanna keep things
from you, okay?

152
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,817
I mean, you deserve to know
what's happening.

153
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,280
Yesterday, I passed out.

154
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,532
Briefly. Very, very briefly.

155
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,783
And I did this.

156
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,663
Why did you pass out?

157
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:50,126
Well, my latest scans

158
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:55,381
show a little shadow on my lung.

159
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,011
But my doctor put me right on
a new round of chemo

160
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,320
which is why I've been so tired lately.

161
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,182
But I was pushing myself too hard.

162
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,352
I know it.
I just don't want you to worry.

163
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,603
I learned my lesson.

164
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,232
Well, what's the...?

165
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,151
What now?

166
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,782
What now is that we go on,
like always. Right?

167
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,828
Hey, don't worry about this, okay?

168
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,998
I know that's hard, but I beat this once.

169
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,126
There's no reason to think I won't again.

170
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,505
And my doctor says I'm doing great.

171
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,424
I'm responding really well
to the treatment.

172
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,301
And I'm...

173
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,014
I'm feeling very...
Very good about this, all right?

174
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,809
And what would really help me out

175
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,062
is if we all stayed positive.

176
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,731
Can we do that?

177
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,985
Yeah?

178
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,655
Okay.

179
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,491
So why don't you go
and help your Aunt Marie,

180
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:09,497
- and we'll talk about this later.
- No. No. No way.

181
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:13,418
I'm staying. I'm not leaving.

182
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,887
- Flynn is not with you, is he?
- No.

183
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,931
No. Why would he be?

184
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,768
How'd it go?

185
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,812
That bad, huh?

186
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,775
How bad are we talking, Hank?

187
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,196
I didn't tell them.

188
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,948
Why not?

189
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,412
- It's just not time yet.
- No, it's past time.

190
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,081
Way past time. We talked about this.

191
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,749
You've got to tell them now.
It's gonna be worse

192
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,670
if they find out that
you've kept this from them.

193
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,090
Look, it's just I've got some things
I gotta chase down.

194
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,092
What? What things?

195
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,971
- Leads, you know.
- What leads? What? Something new?

196
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,015
I'm not keeping anything
from anybody, Marie, okay? Jesus.

197
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,226
Don't tell me how to do my job.

198
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,150
Walt.

199
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,737
Are you sure about this?

200
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,616
It's the only way.

201
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,455
Okay.

202
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,630
I'm ready.

203
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,677
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

204
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,263
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane

205
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,226
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

206
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,813
This is my confession.

207
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,554
They're here.

208
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:46,289
Thank you for coming.

209
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:55,799
Okay, I'll start.

210
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:58,635
- Skyler and I...
- Welcome to Garduño's.

211
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:01,043
My name is Trent.
I'll be taking care of you.

212
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,371
Can I start anybody off
with some beverages?

213
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,643
Margarita? How about some
of our tableside guacamole?

214
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:10,730
I think we're fine.
We need some time with the menu.

215
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:13,316
No worries.
Be right back with some water.

216
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,447
So you here to confess?

217
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,915
There's nothing to confess.

218
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,126
We're here to talk about Walter, Jr.

219
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:35,035
Flynn and Holly should be living
with us. End of story.

220
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:37,924
And while we respect your opinion

221
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,302
we think that your concern is misplaced.

222
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:46,558
Skyler and I feel, due to Marie's attempt

223
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:51,729
- to lure him to your house...
- I wasn't trying to lure him.

224
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:54,941
Regardless of what you might call it

225
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:58,903
Skyler and I would like to ask you

226
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:03,324
to please leave our children out of this.

227
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:07,453
Junior has been through
a lot already this year.

228
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:09,706
You are just...

229
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:12,000
This investigation, Hank

230
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,836
do you realize what this will do to him?

231
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:16,212
Hearing these things?

232
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:19,621
He's gonna hear it when I kick in
your front door and arrest you.

233
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:30,435
If that day ever comes, so be it.

234
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:34,022
You have no evidence
to support your claims.

235
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,567
Why tear this family apart?

236
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:42,697
So how about that guacamole?

237
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:47,911
We make it right here at the table.

238
00:17:52,665 --> 00:17:55,293
I'll just give you guys
a few more minutes.

239
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,799
How can you sit there and listen to this?

240
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:04,636
All we want is for those kids to be safe.

241
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:07,263
You're putting them in danger,
keeping them under the same roof...

242
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,140
They are safe, Marie.

243
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:13,394
- You yourself sent them out of the house.
- And I brought them back.

244
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:17,190
Look, whatever you think he did

245
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:19,943
this is not an ongoing situation.

246
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:21,319
- Skyler.
- No.

247
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:26,366
They need to understand.
It's in the past.

248
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:29,827
It's over.
There is nothing to go after here.

249
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:33,330
- There's nothing to accomplish.
- How can we believe anything you say?

250
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:36,125
There's no telling
where the lies begin and end.

251
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,670
That affair of yours,
did that even happen?

252
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:42,924
Please. Look, Junior just found out
that my cancer is back.

253
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:47,053
He's already facing the idea
of living without his father.

254
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:50,640
To put this on top of that?

255
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,851
It's just not right.

256
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,896
I swear to God, you start
throwing the word "right" at me...

257
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,398
- What I mean...
- Was it right to run a drug empire?

258
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,275
There is no drug empire.

259
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:03,152
Lying to your son,
to all of us, is that right?

260
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,386
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

261
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,532
Why don't you kill yourself, Walt?

262
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:11,119
- What?
- Just kill yourself.

263
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:14,330
This whole thing dies with you.
That's what you're saying here?

264
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:19,252
Is that Hank should just let it go
and wait for you to die.

265
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:22,878
Well, maybe you should just
go ahead and die, then.

266
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:29,220
- That is not a solution.
- No, it's not a solution.

267
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:32,598
- He's not getting off that easy.
- Jesus, Hank.

268
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,768
And the same goes for you
if you stick with him.

269
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,570
Both of you think you're just gonna
walk away from this thing?

270
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:42,358
Never gonna happen.

271
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,987
- That is not what we're saying.
- Enough with the bullshit.

272
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:51,701
You're not gonna negotiate
your way out of this thing.

273
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:55,788
There's only one solution: Step up,
be a man and admit what you've done.

274
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,666
That's it. There is no other option.

275
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,727
Let's go.

276
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,788
<i>My name is Walter Hartwell White.</i>

277
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:39,624
<i>I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane</i>

278
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:43,503
<i>Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.</i>

279
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,422
<i>This is my confession.</i>

280
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,008
<i>If you're watching this tape</i>

281
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:51,385
<i>I'm probably dead</i>

282
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:55,389
<i>murdered by my brother-in-law,
Hank Schrader.</i>

283
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:59,185
<i>Hank has been building a meth empire,</i>

284
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:03,147
<i>for over a year now
and using me as his chemist.</i>

285
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:06,025
<i>Shortly after my 50th birthday</i>

286
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:08,584
<i>he asked that I use
my chemistry knowledge</i>

287
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:12,865
<i>to cook methamphetamine,
which he would then sell</i>

288
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:17,954
<i>using connections that he made
through his career with the DEA.</i>

289
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:22,041
<i>I was astounded.</i>

290
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,712
<i>I... I always thought Hank
was a very moral man,</i>

291
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:29,924
<i>and I was particularly
vulnerable at the time</i>

292
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:34,011
<i>something he knew and took advantage of.</i>

293
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:37,723
<i>I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis</i>

294
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:41,602
<i>that was poised to bankrupt my family.</i>

295
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:44,938
<i>Hank took me on a ride-along
and showed me just how much money</i>

296
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:47,817
<i>even a small meth operation could make.</i>

297
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,153
<i>And I was weak.</i>

298
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:55,533
<i>I didn't want my family
to go into financial ruin,</i>

299
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:57,326
<i>so I agreed.</i>

300
00:21:57,702 --> 00:22:01,914
<i>Hank had a partner, a businessman
named Gustavo Fring.</i>

301
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:05,251
<i>Hank sold me into servitude to this man,</i>

302
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,754
<i>and when I tried to quit,
Fring threatened my family.</i>

303
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:10,965
<i>I didn't know where to turn.</i>

304
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:16,053
<i>Eventually, Hank and Fring
had a falling out,</i>

305
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:18,264
<i>and things escalated.</i>

306
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:22,268
<i>Fring was able to arrange</i>

307
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:26,480
<i>I guess...
I guess you call it a hit on Hank.</i>

308
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:29,567
<i>It failed,
but Hank was seriously injured,</i>

309
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:32,028
<i>and I wound up paying his medical bills</i>

310
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:36,282
<i>which amounted to a little over $177,000.</i>

311
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,745
<i>Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge.</i>

312
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:45,750
<i>Working with a man named Hector Salamanca</i>

313
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,835
<i>he plotted to kill Fring.</i>

314
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:51,839
<i>The bomb that he used was built by me.</i>

315
00:22:53,257 --> 00:22:55,801
<i>He gave me no option in that.</i>

316
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,847
<i>I have often contemplated suicide,</i>

317
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:02,308
<i>but I'm a coward.</i>

318
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:07,104
<i>I wanted to go to the police,</i>

319
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:10,233
<i>but I was frightened.</i>

320
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:15,154
<i>Hank had risen to become the head
of the Albuquerque DEA.</i>

321
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,574
<i>To keep me in line, he took my children.</i>

322
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:21,410
<i>For three months he kept them.</i>

323
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:28,042
<i>My wife had no idea
of my criminal activities</i>

324
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:31,170
<i>was horrified to learn what I had done.</i>

325
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,883
<i>I was in hell.</i>

326
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:40,346
<i>I hated myself for what
I had brought upon my family.</i>

327
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:45,893
<i>Recently, I tried once again to quit,</i>

328
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:50,189
<i>and in response, he gave me this.</i>

329
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:01,909
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

330
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:07,248
<i>I live in fear every day
that Hank will kill me,</i>

331
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,544
<i>or worse, hurt my family.</i>

332
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:19,010
<i>All I could think to do
was to make this video,</i>

333
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:24,682
<i>and hope that the world
will finally see this man,</i>

334
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:27,643
<i>for what he really is.</i>

335
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:40,489
Who do you think he's shown this to?

336
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:45,578
No one. It's a threat.

337
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:50,458
It's what he will do if I don't back off.

338
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,210
I think you should show this to Ramey.

339
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,463
Just get ahead of it.

340
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:59,467
That video is a bunch of lies, Hank.
Anybody who knows you will know.

341
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:02,887
A hundred and seventy-seven
thousand dollars?

342
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:08,768
Hell is he talking about?

343
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:15,232
Marie?

344
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:21,113
They told me it was gambling money.

345
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:25,576
What was gambling money?

346
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:32,333
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.

347
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:35,086
- Oh, God, no.
- How was I supposed to know?

348
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:37,144
How was I to know where it came from?

349
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:40,257
Why were they paying for my bills?
What about my insurance?

350
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:44,387
Insurance wouldn't have covered
the treatment you needed, and I...

351
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:47,222
- I wanted the best for you.
- Why didn't you tell me?

352
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,558
Because I knew that you would refuse it,

353
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,978
and without it, you may never
have been able to walk again.

354
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:54,772
Oh, Christ, Marie.

355
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:00,778
You killed me here.

356
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:03,989
I mean, it's the... It's the last nail.

357
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:06,200
That's the last nail in the coffin.

358
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,705
What do we do?

359
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,271
If I were you, I'd be more nervous.

360
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:38,566
Jesus.

361
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:40,276
It's always the desert.

362
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:40,252
I already checked it.

363
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:43,422
It's clean. I wouldn't have
driven it here if it wasn't.

364
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:46,717
Get one of these, by the way.

365
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:50,137
Reads radio signals. Much easier.

366
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:57,895
What does he know?

367
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:02,775
I mean, he knows you're Heisenberg.

368
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:04,944
But I figure not much else

369
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:07,279
otherwise, you know, you'd be locked up.

370
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:12,159
What did he say exactly?

371
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,455
He wants me to inform on you for him.

372
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:18,666
Tell him everything we did.

373
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,002
Anything else?

374
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:27,633
I don't think he's told
the rest of the DEA.

375
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:30,051
Why do you say that?

376
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:32,972
Just him being there all by himself,

377
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,725
and, plus, he was acting kind of shady.

378
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:39,395
Seemed like he didn't want the other cops

379
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:41,730
hearing what he had to say.

380
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:46,193
Are we gonna talk about the rain of caca
the kid brought down upon us?

381
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:49,362
Want to hazard a guess
what his little charity drive cost you?

382
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:51,532
Why don't you go take a walk, Saul?

383
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:04,378
Jesse, will you let me help you?

384
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:08,424
I don't like to see you hurting like this.

385
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:13,637
Maybe it's time for a change.

386
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:18,017
What kind of change?

387
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:21,270
I don't know.

388
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,693
I don't know, maybe...

389
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:31,655
Maybe it's time for you to just

390
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:34,950
leave all of this behind.

391
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,828
Just get out of town.

392
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,830
Don't look back.

393
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:47,963
Saul knows a man.

394
00:29:49,757 --> 00:29:54,386
He specializes in giving people
new identities.

395
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:59,141
He would move you someplace far away,

396
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,186
and set you up with a whole new life.

397
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:08,275
Yeah, I know, sounds a little extreme.

398
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:14,615
But maybe it's exactly what you need.

399
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,827
You know, I really think
that would be good for you.

400
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:20,788
A clean slate.

401
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:24,583
All right, just think about it.

402
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:29,296
You get a job, something legitimate,
something you like.

403
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:32,758
Meet a girl, start a family, even.

404
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:35,969
Hell, you're still so damn young.

405
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:40,349
And what's here for you now anyway?

406
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:47,731
I tell you, if I could, I'd trade places.

407
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:50,109
A whole lifetime ahead of you

408
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:53,237
with a chance to hit the reset button.

409
00:30:54,697 --> 00:30:56,740
In a few years

410
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,995
this might all feel like nothing more
than a bad dream.

411
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:16,927
Would you just, for once

412
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:19,430
stop working me?

413
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:22,266
What are you talking about?

414
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:27,229
Can you just stop working me for, like,
10 seconds straight?

415
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:29,356
Stop jerking me around?

416
00:31:29,982 --> 00:31:32,401
Jesse, I am not working you.

417
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:35,988
Yes. Yes, you are.

418
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:39,032
All right, just drop the whole
concerned-dad thing,

419
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,452
and tell me the truth.

420
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,037
I mean, you're acting like

421
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:46,707
me leaving town is all about me,

422
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:52,504
and turning over a new leaf,
but it's really... It's really about you.

423
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,673
I mean, you need me gone

424
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:58,844
because your dickhead brother-in-law
is never gonna let up.

425
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,971
Just say so.

426
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,724
Just ask me for a favor.

427
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,436
Just tell me you don't give a shit
about me,

428
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:09,396
and it's either this...

429
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:15,569
It's either this or you'll kill me
the same way you killed Mike.

430
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,782
I mean, isn't that
what this is all about?

431
00:32:20,949 --> 00:32:24,244
Us meeting way the hell out here.

432
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:28,540
In case I say no.

433
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:33,545
Come on.

434
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:37,633
Just tell me you need this.

435
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,138
Your change.

436
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:38,848
If you'll hand this
to your car wash professional,

437
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:41,018
and have an A-1 day.

438
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:50,027
Skyler?

439
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:57,409
Skyler, I've got my chemo
in about 45 minutes.

440
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,537
Can you take over the register for me?

441
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:04,708
Skyler?

442
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:14,301
It worked,

443
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:17,220
and we're fine.

444
00:34:18,972 --> 00:34:20,766
Okay?

445
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:24,519
We're fine.

446
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:01,113
So Palmer and Castanares

447
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:03,933
are sitting on that jerkoff
Saul Goodman's office

448
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:06,936
- keeping an eye on Jesse Pinkman.
- Yeah, I put them on it.

449
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,897
You wanna explain that to me?

450
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:12,150
Yeah. Right.

451
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:16,029
Why the hell should I know anything?
They're just my guys, after all.

452
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:20,617
You gotta tell me what's going on.
Pinkman is A.P.D.'s problem, not ours.

453
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,426
You got a history with this kid.

454
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:24,746
If he catches wind
that you're trailing him,

455
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,707
and this explodes, he could sue.

456
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:32,003
Look, if I can't explain this to Ramey,
I gotta pull my guys.

457
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:34,464
Fine. Take them off.

458
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:40,554
I said, take them off.
What else you want?

459
00:35:58,071 --> 00:35:59,740
I'm going out for a while.

460
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:02,159
You have that 3:00.

461
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:03,994
Will you be back?

462
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:07,748
You know what, it's gonna have
to be another day. Reschedule it.

463
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:14,087
Last chance. You sure there's nobody
you wanna say bye to?

464
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:16,047
Nobody at all?

465
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,716
No.

466
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:21,678
This is it. Once I make the call,
there's no take-backs.

467
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:29,811
I need a new dust filter,

468
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,398
for my Hoover Max Extract
Pressure Pro, model 60.

469
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:35,817
Can you help me with that?

470
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:37,152
Yeah, pickup.

471
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,448
He's hot. Not "hot" hot,
just a little hot.

472
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:43,116
Currently out on bail.

473
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:45,619
Yeah, he knows the rules.

474
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,872
One hour. Okay, he'll be there.

475
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:52,876
And done.

476
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:00,217
Okay, this guy's fee is 125.

477
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:02,511
Your benefactor

478
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,305
asked me to send you out
with something extra.

479
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,932
Get you started, you know?

480
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,892
Keep you sitting pretty

481
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,895
until you get into the groove
of your new life.

482
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:16,066
Provided, of course, you don't
toss it out the window on the way.

483
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:20,111
Seriously, this is the last of it,

484
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,156
so you might wanna think
about making a budget.

485
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:24,658
Hey, what are you doing?

486
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:27,661
You can't fire up a doob in here.
Put that out.

487
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:29,746
I mean it. Put it out.

488
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:33,166
Look, Mr. Natural, I'm not
gonna let you sabotage this thing.

489
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:36,378
This guy is not gonna take you
if you show up high,

490
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:39,965
so stop screwing around,
or it's both our asses.

491
00:37:44,052 --> 00:37:47,722
Right. Well, that's a start.
Now, give with the dope.

492
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:03,738
Christ.

493
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:07,117
Some people are immune to good advice.

494
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,110
I'm gonna get a bag for this cash.

495
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:13,456
Don't even think about lighting up again.

496
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,961
Francesca, we got any bags?

497
00:38:18,169 --> 00:38:20,881
For money. Money-sized bags.

498
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:27,844
Huell will drop you at the pickup spot

499
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:30,171
then he's gonna get
the hell out of there.

500
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:31,850
You got that?

501
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:35,020
Guy won't pick up the kid
if he's got company.

502
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,105
You got a phone?

503
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,899
Cops took it.

504
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:43,451
All right, in case something goes wrong

505
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,823
guy doesn't show, whatever,
you give me a call.

506
00:38:50,076 --> 00:38:53,163
Seriously? Hello Kitty?

507
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,831
Seriously, it's free.

508
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,418
We got a beggars-choosers situation here,
so stop busting my balls.

509
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,170
Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.

510
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:04,049
You, you're gonna sit and wait.
This guy's punctual with a capital P.

511
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:07,093
Okay? So don't move.
Don't get up and get an ice cream.

512
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:10,430
Just stay put like a good boy.
He'll pick you up, you pay him.

513
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,849
He'll take your ID,
he'll give you a new one.

514
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:17,312
Goodbye, Jesse Pinkman.
Hello, Mr. Credit to Society.

515
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:19,898
So do I get to pick where I go?

516
00:39:20,106 --> 00:39:22,359
Well, it's your life.
I imagine you get a say.

517
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,486
Want a suggestion?
How about Florida?

518
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:27,447
You get a tan,
meet the Swedish bikini team

519
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,406
you know, swim with the dolphins.

520
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:32,160
What about Alaska?

521
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:35,288
Alaska. Okay, well,
that's a different vibe.

522
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:37,624
I never figured you for a moose lover,

523
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:40,377
- but whatever floats your boat.
- Alaska.

524
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:42,420
Alaska's good.

525
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:46,013
Anywhere you can get
a fresh start is gonna be good.

526
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:47,509
You ready?

527
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:49,511
Yeah.

528
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:53,515
Take care, Jesse.

529
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,977
All right.

530
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:04,734
Excuse me.

531
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,470
Hey, man, you can't go in there!

532
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,556
He a no-show? Why didn't you call?

533
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,558
Why didn't you...?

534
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,311
Stop!

535
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,605
Code red!

536
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,902
- Huell!
- No! Hey!

537
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:10,404
- Hey!
- Get in here!

538
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,158
Back off!

539
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,994
You, stay where you are.

540
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,163
What? I don't know what happened here.
What did I do?

541
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,790
You stole it off me.

542
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:24,649
You and him, you took it
out of my pocket, didn't you?

543
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,171
Calm down. Yes.
Okay. I had Huell lift your dope.

544
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,830
I told you I couldn't risk
the guy not taking you.

545
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:34,469
No! Before. The cigarette.

546
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:37,264
You stole the cigarette.

547
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,308
- What?
- The ricin cigarette!

548
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,811
You had him steal it off of me!

549
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,397
And all for that asshole Mr. White!

550
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,733
He poisoned Brock!

551
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,611
He poisoned Brock, and you...
You helped him!

552
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,865
- Okay, Jesse, calm down.
- Say it again!

553
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,492
Tell me one more time
to calm down! Come on!

554
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,536
I'm sorry. Yes. Okay.

555
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:02,289
I had Huell lift your cigarette,
but Walt made me.

556
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,500
He told me he was helping you,
he was saving you.

557
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:08,795
I never would've agreed to it
if I'd known what he was gonna do.

558
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:12,507
Jesse, you gotta believe me.
I didn't want any of this!

559
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:24,561
Back up!

560
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,572
Get off me!
What do I pay you for?

561
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:41,286
Hey, it's me. We got a big problem.

562
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,955
...eighteen, 19 and 20.

563
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,708
Actually, you gave me a 5, not a 1.

564
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:49,920
Oh, I... I did. I'm... I'm so sorry.

565
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,006
Here you go.

566
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,716
Thank you for your honesty.

567
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:58,136
Oh, and please give this
to your car wash professional.

568
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,388
Have an A-1 day.

569
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,184
God.

570
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,190
- Hey.
- Hi.

571
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,610
- What's going on?
- Not much.

572
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,699
- Yeah? Nothing?
- Nope. Things are fine.

573
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,785
- Good.
- Why?

574
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,830
Oh, no reason.

575
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,258
You know what I found the other day

576
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:41,429
is that the... The...
The latch on the soda machine wasn't...

577
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,142
latching.

578
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,563
It's... It's catching every time
that I stock that darn thing.

579
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,984
So I thought I'd check it out.

580
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,445
Great.

581
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:29,811
Thank you.

582
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:36,860
Exact change.
I like that. Thank you very much.

583
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:40,614
Okay.

584
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,949
And

585
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:46,578
please give this
to your car-care professional,

586
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,289
- and have an A-1 day. Thank you.
- Thank you.

587
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,250
I just remembered
they gave me a prescription

588
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,710
to go pick up, so...
I forgot.

589
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,381
I'm gonna go head on over
to the drugstore, okay?

590
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,800
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.
