1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,908
Surprise!

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,210
Jade.
- Jade.

3
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,045
Mom, dad!

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:15,681
Hope you don't mind
us dropping in
uninvited.

5
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,383
Cousin Jackie.

6
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,518
It's so good
to see you again.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,688
You have been
such a wonderful
role model for Jade.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,290
Oh, well, thank you.
I--ow!

9
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,327
You take credit
for my good
influence?

10
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,928
Uncle!
- Uncle!
Uncle!

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,331
Is uncle
everyone's uncle?

12
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,366
He's actually
our cousin.

13
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,535
Aren't you?

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,005
What brings you all
to Hong Kong?

15
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,341
We've banished
the last demon.

16
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,909
Demon?!
- Demon?!

17
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,978
Uh...

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,246
Uh, right.

19
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,481
Uh, the demon is the name
of a roller coaster

20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,916
at the new Hong Kong
moose world.

21
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,985
Look at the cool watch
Jackie got me there.

22
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,155
Watch: Hey, hey, hey!
I'm Marlon moose.

23
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,724
Oh.

24
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,360
Please, have a seat.
We will make tea.

25
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:02,961
Wipe your feet.

26
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:06,398
Easy, t. If mom and dad
find out about all this
demon stuff,

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
there's no way they'll
let me stay with Jackie.

28
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,104
Ah, ancient history.
The portals are sealed,

29
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,739
the demons
have been banished...

30
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,707
Even shendu is no more.

31
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,411
Aah!

32
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,451
Stop!

33
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:28,620
What is it now,
shendu?!

34
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,523
Admittedly, I have
failed you, my siblings.

35
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,492
Aah!

36
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:36,395
But I may yet save you
as well.

37
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,530
We can all
regain our freedom,

38
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,534
and even reclaim
the centuries wasted
in this void,

39
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:47,239
if you allow me to pursue
one last recourse.

40
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,675
Ha! And that would be?

41
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:52,511
The <i> book of ages.</i>

42
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,779
(All gasp)

43
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,247
Ludicrous.

44
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,749
Even <i> we</i> never dared
to tamper with that.

45
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,953
You risk altering
the very fabric
of reality.

46
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:04,123
Am I to assume <i> this</i> reality
pleases you, sister?

47
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,659
Hmm. These are
desperate times.

48
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,930
Then I will
make things right.

49
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,067
All you need do is
allow me to once more

50
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,470
depart from this realm
and possess a human.

51
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,139
The right human.

52
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,276
More tea?

53
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,384
Oh.

54
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,086
Jackie?

55
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,946
(Gasps)
My tea cup!

56
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,647
Quickly, before it stains.

57
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,217
Shendu: A broken tea cup
is the least of--

58
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,484
a dem--

59
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,825
well, this was fun.
Gotta go.

60
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,694
You are leaving?
So soon?

61
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,196
We'll be back.
It's just, um,
Jackie's, um...

62
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,031
Allergic...
Yeah, uh--

63
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,033
(muffled threats)

64
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,069
Um, the tea makes
his eyes all red.

65
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,605
(Shendu struggling)
What is he saying?

66
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,074
Uh, thank you very much.
Good-bye!

67
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,376
Uhh!

68
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,311
Aah!
- Hey.

69
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,720
(Both gasp)
So reckless.

70
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,756
(Groans)
Quickly.

71
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,891
Jade...

72
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,361
You are not going anywhere
but to your room.

73
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:25,497
You are moving back home
with us immediately!

74
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,665
I am?

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,635
We are very sorry, Jade,

76
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,603
but it seems it is
unsafe for you

77
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,538
to remain
with cousin Jackie.

78
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,741
He is clearly
a troublemaker.

79
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,347
Jackie's not
a troublemaker...

80
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,950
But he is in trouble.

81
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,089
I could not find Jackie.

82
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,224
Me, neither.

83
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,925
(Sighs)
Same here.

84
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,730
Jade.
- Jade?

85
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,299
(Cell phone rings)

86
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,500
Hello?

87
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,934
Jade!
- Jackie?!

88
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,038
I'm at the airport.
Shendu's flying
to Australia.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,506
Australia? Why?

90
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,675
Unh. He--ooh--

91
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:11,743
shendu: You will
find out soon enough.

92
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,281
Jackie? Jackie!

93
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,521
Captain black,
requesting satellite
surveillance

94
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,057
to track Jackie.
Yeah, that's right,
Jackie.

95
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,759
And we're gonna
need a jet. A fast one.

96
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,007
The book is close at hand.

97
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,658
(Chanting)

98
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,632
Jackie!

99
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,704
Unh!

100
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,040
Whoa.

101
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,746
Don't know
what you're doin',

102
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,614
but it can't be good.

103
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,316
(Gasps)

104
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,453
Shendu: Ah, here we are.

105
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:32,090
The <i> book of ages,</i>
where all history
is magically recorded.

106
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,995
History lesson's over,
shendu!

107
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,966
Whoa--unh!

108
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,368
So it is written,
so it shall be.

109
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,373
(All gasp)

110
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,276
Jade.
- Jade.

111
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,578
Mom? Dad?

112
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,147
What are you doing here?

113
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,815
Uh, Hong Kong
moose world?

114
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,583
Why aren't you
at the palace?

115
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,386
And where did you find
those strange clothes?

116
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,722
I was gonna ask you two
the same thing.

117
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,791
And what do you have
in your hand?

118
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,026
(Musical fanfare plays)

119
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,395
Hurry. We must
pay our respects.

120
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,267
Respects? To who?

121
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,569
What's going...On?

122
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,975
Jade, it is forbidden.
Get down.

123
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,851
(Gasps)

124
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,654
Shendu!

125
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,209
Shendu's alive?

126
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,077
I gotta tell--
(Gasps)

127
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,681
Jackie?

128
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,817
Jackie, your hair.
What are you doing?!

129
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,952
Hmmph!

130
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,487
Your job.

131
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,822
Sweeping dragon doo-doo?

132
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,092
Where have you been,
Jade? Where is your
uniform?

133
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,662
Um, why, exactly, do we
have to wear uniforms?

134
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,265
Because it is required
of all servants

135
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,533
of the supreme ruler,

136
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,603
his majestic highness,
lord shendu.

137
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,272
Are you telling me
shendu rules the world?

138
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,773
Oh, of course not.

139
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,843
Each of the 8 emperors
has his or her own
domain.

140
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,944
Since when?

141
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,779
Since the Dawn
of history.

142
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,982
What is wrong
with you today?

143
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,219
History.

144
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,821
Uncle said that
<i>book of ages</i>

145
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,890
magically
recorded history.

146
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:48,326
When shendu wrote in it,
he must have rewrote
the past

147
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,396
so he was never
destroyed,

148
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,332
and the demons
were never banished
through their portals.

149
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,034
And now...
(Gasps)

150
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,703
I'm in demon world!

151
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,274
Jackie, we gotta talk.

152
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,523
Jackie?

153
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,625
Jackie? Where'd you--whoa!

154
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,297
Today you must scrub
master's bath chamber.

155
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,464
No way!

156
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,700
Then fill his tub
with fresh muck.

157
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,101
Eww!
(Gags)

158
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,338
And it's talonsday,

159
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,207
so don't forget to trim
master's toenails.

160
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,977
Jackie, listen to me!

161
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,680
I don't work for shendu,
and neither do you.

162
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,482
Demons don't rule the world,
humans do.

163
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,217
The demons were banished
into the netherworld

164
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,986
by the 8 immortals
a long time ago.

165
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,988
Then they got out,
and we banished 'em again.

166
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,624
But shendu possessed you,
found this magic book,
changed the past,

167
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,659
and now none of that
ever happened.

168
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,496
That's crazy, Jade.
You're crazy.

169
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,332
Humans ruling the world!

170
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,969
It's true. We built cities,
with cars and computers and--

171
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,472
my watch. Look at my watch.

172
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,808
What's a watch?

173
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,878
Watch: Hey, hey, hey!
I'm Marlon moose.

174
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,013
Aah!

175
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,052
Magic is outlawed.
You know that.

176
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,189
It's not magic,
it's technology.

177
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,791
<i>Human</i> technology.
And you gave
this watch to me.

178
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,593
But I guess you wouldn't
remember that.

179
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:33,665
Jade, if what you say
is true, why <i> don't</i> I
remember any of it?

180
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,867
I don't know. Maybe--
(Gasps)

181
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:43,975
"And Jade chan
became a wily accomplice
in the battle versus evil."

182
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,845
This is from the book,
and it's about me.

183
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,614
It didn't get rewritten,
so neither did I.

184
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,116
That's why I remember.

185
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:54,252
And that's why I'm still
wearing these clothes.

186
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,287
(Gong sounds)

187
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,290
The dinner gong. Quickly,
you must change into these

188
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,259
before master sees you.

189
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,198
(Sighs)
- Guess I don't exactly blend.

190
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,001
Better keep my life story
someplace safe.

191
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,005
Jackie, where'd you go?

192
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,676
Jackie?

193
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,187
Dance, my jesters. Dance!

194
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,524
Ow!
- Ooh!
Hot! Hot! Hot!

195
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,627
Shendu: Dance!

196
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,937
No way.

197
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,139
You!

198
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,941
Uh...

199
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,846
Heh heh.

200
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,648
Why do you not bow?

201
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,617
Uh--
- oh--uh--yes--

202
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,521
y-your scariness,
please excuse my
slow-witted niece.

203
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,758
Uh--unh!

204
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,962
If she were not excused,
she would be in flames.

205
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,797
Now fetch my dinner!

206
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,233
Yes, master.

207
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,970
Jackie.

208
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,574
(Clears throat)
Tasty treats for his
glorious excellence.

209
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,281
What a good slave you make,
Jackie chan.

210
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,018
My Joy is
to serve you, master.

211
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,122
Mmm.

212
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,961
Keeping one's enemies close
is not just wise,

213
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,231
it is gratifying.

214
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,367
Shendu remembers
the way things were,
too.

215
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,702
Child!

216
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,337
Uh, yes, master?

217
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,173
It's talonsday.

218
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,746
Gross!

219
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,849
(Sighs)
You forgot
master's clippings.

220
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:09,320
Jackie, there is no way
I am ever going near
his feet again!

221
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,923
And shendu treats you
like a dog on a leash.

222
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,224
I can't stand it.

223
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,026
Well, what can I do?

224
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,529
I'm just a food servant.
His slave.

225
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,133
The Jackie chan I knew
was nobody's whipping boy.

226
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,701
He was a hero.

227
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,436
He was?

228
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:29,107
And you can be again, Jackie.
Help me fix history.

229
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,176
Help me rewrite the book.

230
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,247
(Wheezing)

231
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,721
Which way?

232
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,291
But servants aren't
allowed in the library.

233
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,593
I told you,
we aren't servants.

234
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,330
Jade, be careful.

235
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,568
Whoa.

236
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,341
Ow!

237
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,043
Get out!

238
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,111
Uncle?

239
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:10,548
Only master's library
boys allowed in here.

240
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,417
Uncle, we need
your help.

241
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,618
We're looking
for a book.

242
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,487
Forbidden! These books
are filled with magic.

243
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,057
Even I am not allowed
to read them.

244
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,391
The <i> book of ages--</i>

245
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,459
never heard of it.

246
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,127
Are you sure?

247
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,495
Maybe it's over here.

248
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,997
No, it is not.

249
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,999
How about here?
Not there.

250
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,300
Well, maybe over here.

251
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,036
No. I have been
library boy
for 60 years.

252
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,372
I am sure.

253
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,207
Really?
- Really.

254
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,809
In that case...

255
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,714
(Gasps)
Forbidden magic!

256
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,782
Relax, it's just
an atlas.

257
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,720
If the book's not here
in shendu's library,

258
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,489
there's only one other
place it could be.

259
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,491
Australia.

260
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,360
Oi-ya! No man's land.

261
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,296
That continent is forbidden.

262
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,733
There is nothing there, Jade.
Just a fortress.

263
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,768
(Scoffs)
Fortresses are
usually built

264
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,904
to protect something.
Duh!

265
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:10,842
But it is said that all
who approach the fortress
will be destroyed.

266
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,443
Well, we have
to get inside it
somehow.

267
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,578
Why?

268
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,179
'Cause shendu used
the <i> book of ages</i>

269
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,681
to rewrite reality.

270
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,883
That is crazy.

271
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,786
You do not believe her,
do you?

272
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,089
(Sighs)
There is one thing
that I believe.

273
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,060
Demons ruling the world
is a bad thing.

274
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,131
Cool. Look, uncle,
I can prove I'm
telling the truth.

275
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,200
Watch: Hey, hey, hey!
I'm Marlon moose.

276
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,402
Ayah!

277
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,070
(Scream echoing)

278
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,010
Shh. You will alert the--

279
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,478
(wind howls)

280
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,256
(Whispering)
Shadowkhan!

281
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,297
She opened the book.

282
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,400
Heh. Get 'em, Jackie!

283
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,769
Get them?

284
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,172
You know, hah! Heeyah!
Hoowah! Huh! Hi-yah!

285
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,473
Huh! Hi-yah!

286
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,009
Oh! The martial arts
are outlawed.

287
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,777
I do not know
how to fight.

288
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,079
Serious?

289
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,652
But I do know
how to run!

290
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,188
Uhh!

291
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,090
Uhh! My hair!

292
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,126
You were due for a trim.

293
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,142
Wait!

294
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,124
This way!

295
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,663
Er, this way!

296
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,335
The front door.

297
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,770
(Both gasp)

298
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,443
Uh, the side door.

299
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,880
Don't suppose
there's a back door?

300
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,925
Jade: Wait for me!

301
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,031
Cool!

302
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,566
Master's magic chamber.

303
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,535
Entrance to this room
is punishable by--uhh.

304
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,206
(Uncle chanting)

305
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,816
Huh? Uncle!
(Gasps)

306
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,152
You saved our--ow!

307
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,988
What choice did I have?!
You are family.

308
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,623
A chi spell?

309
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,593
Thought you weren't <i> allowed</i>
to read the forbidden books.

310
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,262
I do not read.
I--I skim.

311
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,563
We must leave,
uncle.

312
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,966
It is only a matter
of time before
shendu discovers

313
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,100
you use magic to...

314
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,235
Kibosh his ninjas?

315
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:58,636
But where will we go?

316
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,105
All aboard the Jade express
to Australia.

317
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,307
Oh, we are doomed!

318
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,742
Even if we escape
from here,

319
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,578
we have no way
to journey
to no man's land.

320
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,747
The talismans
would sure help.

321
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,249
What talismans?
What talismans?

322
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,819
Uncle, let me reacquaint you
with a little magic trick

323
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,387
you once knew.

324
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,462
This'll let us grab
the 12 talismans

325
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,531
that give shendu
his magical powers.

326
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,466
There is
no such thing!

327
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,800
