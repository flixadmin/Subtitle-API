1
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,918
Ew!

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,494
"One more thing.

3
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:31,397
Go through archway,
then go 30 more paces."

4
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,880
Ah! The sorcerer's eye!

5
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,349
Just where uncle
said it would be.

6
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,787
And the inscriptions
are intact.

7
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,589
The museum will be
very pleased to--huh?!

8
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,099
Oh!

9
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,180
Aah! Bad day! Bad day!

10
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,518
Bad day.

11
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,353
Aah!

12
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,588
Who are you?!

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,791
The new owner
of that necklace. Give!

14
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,595
No! This artifact
belongs in a museum.

15
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,030
Heh, sorry.

16
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,698
Oh, you will be.

17
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,867
Aah!

18
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,220
Aah!

19
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,723
Ooh!

20
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,892
Whew. Aah!

21
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,860
Are we
having fun yet?

22
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:45,864
No, we are not.
Why are you doing this?

23
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,933
You seem like
such a nice lady.

24
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,536
Been called
a lot of things,

25
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:54,006
relic hunter,
mercenary, thief,

26
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,875
but Vanessa barone,
nice lady?

27
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,244
Ha ha! That is
a new one.

28
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,345
The necklace.

29
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,781
No. It belongs in a museum.

30
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,082
Ooh!
- Aah!

31
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,986
Oh! My leg!

32
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,156
Oh no. I better
call a doctor.

33
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,858
For you!

34
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,064
Return to pontello.

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,934
But I--you...

36
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,206
Gotta admit it, sal.
Venice is a nice change.

37
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,709
No street crime,
no weirdos, no--

38
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,418
heh heh.
Guide book was wrong.
No subway in venice.

39
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,256
Gondola rides!
All your favorite canals!

40
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,593
The divatello,
the monteleone,
the pontello...

41
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,895
Pontello!
It is a canal.

42
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,898
That's a-right.
So, how many
tickets you want?

43
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,733
¶ La la la ¶

44
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,169
know what I'm
holding here, <i> paisan?</i>

45
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:00,339
A key to all
- the riches in the world.

46
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,207
Uh, no speak English.

47
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,342
Ha ha ha!

48
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,943
(Gasps)

49
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,111
You?!

50
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,514
This belongs
in a museum.

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,383
Whoa!

52
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,718
Mama Mia!

53
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,321
Whoa!

54
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,927
(Cell phone rings)

55
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,495
Hello?

56
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,498
I suppose
you're having fun
without me, Jackie.

57
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,867
Fun? No, not really, Jade.

58
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,168
What is it you need?

59
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,337
I need to be
where the action is.

60
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,839
How come you didn't
take me with?

61
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,708
I told you! School
is too important, and--

62
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,278
ha! You missed!

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,445
Missed what?

64
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,547
Nothing!
Can we talk later?

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,784
Fine. Just
hurry back.

66
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,287
Uncle won't let me
do anything fun.

67
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,489
Believe me, Jade.

68
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,990
There is nothing
I would like more

69
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,592
than to return
to uncle's shop.

70
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,627
Hopefully, in one--wha?!

71
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,896
No!

72
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,003
"Uncle's shop."

73
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,073
(Gasps)

74
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:11,209
Jackie! How'd you
get here so soon?

75
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,612
You were in a taxi
when I called.

76
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,782
Yes, a water taxi. In Italy.

77
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,116
Come again?

78
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:21,386
Jackie! Did not
expect you
until tonight!

79
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,055
You and I both, uncle.

80
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,224
I believe this necklace
has magical powers.

81
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,060
Cool! Can
I check it out?

82
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,396
No, Jade. This necklace
could be very dangerous.

83
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,832
Everything
is very dangerous.

84
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,302
Traveling to venice,
digging for artifacts,
wearing jewelry.

85
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:40,572
Perhaps the inscriptions
from the mural
will help explain.

86
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,873
Uncle will look into it.

87
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,209
Meanwhile,
you fix your niece!

88
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,877
What do
you mean? Ow!

89
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,781
Open eyes! Jade turning
into a couch potato.

90
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:53,385
Watches TV all day, all night.
Young girl needs a hobby.

91
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,491
Hmm. I see
what you mean.

92
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,692
(Door opens)

93
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,927
Greetings, campers!

94
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,929
I'm a buttercup scout,
and my troop

95
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:07,666
is trying to raise money
by selling these
delicious boxes of--

96
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,967
cookies!

97
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,571
What kind
would you like, mister?

98
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:16,141
We have vanilla cream,
chocolate mint,
oatmeal raisin--

99
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,844
oh, may I...
Have them all?

100
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,446
You sure may!
Will that be check or--

101
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,815
cool!

102
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,326
I try to get out,
but they just keep
pulling me back in.

103
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,896
Hey! It was just
getting good!

104
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,565
I think I found you
a hobby, Jade.

105
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,267
Buttercup scouts.

106
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,404
This is a joke, right?

107
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,106
It's adventurous,
but not dangerous.

108
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,079
Oh, you look so cute!

109
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,282
(Muffled whispers)

110
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,085
Oh, I mean cool.

111
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,820
I look like an elf.

112
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,389
I have heard that
scouting builds character.

113
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:08,393
I have also heard
that scouts receive
a discount on cookies.

114
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,863
Jackie, I don't wanna be
a buttercup scout!

115
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,565
It's gonna be totally boring.

116
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,368
Please, Jade.
Just give it a chance.

117
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,403
You never know
until you try.

118
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,071
Wanna bet?

119
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,107
Uncle: Jackie! Come see!

120
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,212
Necklace has name.
The eye of Aurora.

121
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:31,183
Ah, Aurora was
an ancient Egyptian
Princess said to--

122
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,417
getting to that!

123
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,253
Aurora was ancient
Egyptian Princess.

124
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,522
Necklace given
to her by sorcerer.

125
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:41,059
Possesses magical powers
of teleportation.

126
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,529
Travel anywhere
in the blink of an eye.

127
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,598
But why would
Princess Aurora--

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,201
getting to that!
Princess was greedy.

129
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:53,305
Used necklace to travel world
and steal
treasure from rivals.

130
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,874
Ah, no wonder
Vanessa barone

131
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,909
is so eager to
get her hands on it.

132
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,144
Getting to--who?

133
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,580
A nice lady
I met in venice.

134
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,616
Where to, lady?

135
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,153
Chinatown.

136
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,956
(Door handle being turned)

137
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,491
Who is there?

138
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,501
Warning you!

139
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:26,004
Uncle may be thin,
but he is scrappy!

140
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,775
Aah!

141
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,778
Evil demons.
Must be the necklace.

142
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,348
It has released
a curse upon us.

143
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,658
Jackie!

144
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,793
(Snoring)

145
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,731
You must learn to use
a napkin, tohru.

146
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,842
Aah! Go away!
Demons, shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

147
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,115
Hiya!

148
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,183
Wha?

149
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:16,187
Chill, uncle,
it's just us...
Buttercup scouts.

150
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,656
We were gonna
build bird feeders,

151
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,091
but Jade talked us
into making masks.

152
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,426
Don't they
look scary?

153
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,428
Scary, no.

154
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,431
Uncle's heart
always pounds
like jackhammer!

155
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:30,068
(Sighs)
Just trying to whip up
a little excitement.

156
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,736
Why are you all here?

157
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,405
Don't you have
a camping trip today?

158
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,142
Uh-huh. Oh, gee!
Didn't I tell you, Jackie?

159
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,411
You're today's buttercup mom.

160
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:43,748
Me?! I can not
be a buttercup mom.

161
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,684
I'm not even a mom.

162
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,553
Actually, the rule book's
pretty gray on that subject.

163
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:52,724
A buttercup troop leader
can be a mom, dad,
uncle, whatever.

164
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,393
They even have a uniform
in your size.

165
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,964
Come on, uncle Jackie.

166
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:02,334
Just give it a chance.
You never know until you try.

167
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,271
How about it, Jackie?

168
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,106
You and me turn in
our buttercup
badges right now,

169
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,808
leave this whole
dopey idea behind,

170
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,076
head for the nearest
pyramid or--

171
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,045
no, Jade.
This camping trip
is a chance

172
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,516
for you and I
to have fun together.
Without bad guys.

173
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,820
I try to get out,
but they keep
pulling me back in.

174
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,089
And without any TV.

175
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,994
Ok, buttercup scouts!
All aboard!

176
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,536
Hmm...

177
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,873
Maybe there's
a way to spice up
this trip after all.

178
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,452
(Door handle turning)

179
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,154
(Door opens and closes)

180
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,891
No more buttercup scouts!
Too late, bus left!

181
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,797
Oh, I'm not interested
in transportation.

182
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,036
I'm looking for
the eye of Aurora.

183
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:14,272
(Gasps) Never heard of it.
Thank you, come again.

184
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,577
You never
heard of it, huh?

185
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,946
Where's the necklace,
old timer?

186
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,985
Uh, necklace gone.
Jackie took it, uh, to museum.

187
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,527
How long before
Jackie returns from
summit hill, sensei?

188
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,130
Summit hill, eh?
Thanks for the tip, tiny.

189
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,233
Grr.

190
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,436
What?

191
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,775
And that is how
you tie a bowline knot.

192
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,077
Who wants to try?

193
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,045
Scouts: Me! Pick me!
I wanna try!

194
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,781
All right,
- Tara and Dana first.

195
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,151
Isn't this fun?

196
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,619
Scouts: Yeah!

197
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,956
Gathering wood,
chasing butterflies,
and tying knots.

198
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,325
Oh, yeah. A real party.

199
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:11,763
Jade, the first
rule of scouting is
always be prepared.

200
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,399
You never know
when knot-tying
might come in handy.

201
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,168
I'll remember that
when I join the Navy.

202
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,740
Maybe I should give you
a special assignment.

203
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,743
Really? Cool!
What is it?

204
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,945
Canteens need refilling.

205
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,713
You want me to fetch water?

206
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,815
Yes, please.

207
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,953
There's a stream
behind those trees.

208
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,155
And please,
don't wander off!

209
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,827
(Scoffs) We're a mile
from a mall.

210
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,296
What's he think?
I'm gonna make a prison break,

211
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,466
hop in a getaway car
and return to Siberia--huh?

212
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,403
Whoa! Weird!

213
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,406
Siberia! This thing's awesome.

214
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,511
Doggies! Oh, they're so cute!

215
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,349
And hungry.
And <i> so</i> not dogs.

216
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,721
Wolves! Help!

217
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,559
Jackie! Answer phone!

218
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,262
(Cell phone rings)

219
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,131
Hello?

220
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,000
Jackie, you are in danger.

221
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,968
Bad lady coming your way.

222
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,303
Jackie is not here.

223
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,905
Huh? Who this?!

224
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,610
What are you doing
with Jackie's cell phone?

225
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,380
Um, speaking
with you, sensei.

226
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,082
Ah! Must go
to summit hill!
Warn Jackie!

227
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,085
Quickly! Find map of city!

228
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,554
How'd we do?

229
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,923
Very nice job.

230
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,693
Very thorough, too.

231
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,695
Scouts: (Gasping)

232
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,431
What is it? A Bear?

233
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,569
Oh, it is probably
just Jade playing a prank.

234
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,071
Aah!

235
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,208
(Gasps)
Vanessa barone!

236
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,946
Now that's a face
only a mummy could love.

237
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,781
The necklace, chan.

238
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,784
I don't have it.
Uh, scout's honor.

239
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:16,855
If you're lying, you're going
to need a lot more bandages.

240
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,024
A buttercup scout
never lies!

241
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,926
Charming.

242
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,029
Well, hop to it,
buttercup scouts.

243
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,166
I'm not leaving till you
find my eye of Aurora.

244
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,036
Honolulu! Miami!
Moose world!

245
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,138
Come on
and work all ready!

246
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,910
Whoa! Oof!

247
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,983
Oh.

248
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,192
Come on! Fly!
Activate! Power up!

249
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,527
Heh. N-nice wolfies.

250
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,197
I'd love to hang out
and play fetch,
but, see,

251
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,698
I--I really
gotta catch a cab

252
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,768
and return
to uncle's shop
before it gets too--

253
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,671
I found one!

254
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:07,739
A map?

255
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,374
A box of cookies.

256
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,476
I am still
- searching for a map.

257
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,112
Hurry! Jackie
is in big--aah!

258
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,713
Hey! It worked!

259
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,916
(Gasps) Where is Jackie?!

260
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,150
At the campsite.

261
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,618
I figured out
the necklace.

262
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,453
You just say
the word return to,

263
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,188
and whatever
you say next
is where you go.

264
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,658
Like this:
Return to uncle's side.

265
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,428
Wha! Do not
do that again!

266
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,196
Wait!
Do that again!

267
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,598
Must go
warn Jackie!

268
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,300
Bad lady
headed his way!

269
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,602
No prob.
Return to summit hill!

270
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,342
(Sighs) I did not
have a chance to ask her
for more cookies.

271
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,646
Ugh!

272
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:49,814
What?

273
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,451
Ah, express delivery.
How thoughtful.

274
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,389
Well, chan,
love to stay and rap,

275
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,758
but by the looks of it,
you're all wrapped up.

276
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,859
So ta-ta!

277
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:02,994
Kia!

278
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,645
Thank you for the lesson
in bandage removal,
miss barone.

279
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,947
See, girls?
Quick and painless.

280
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,018
Wha?!

281
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:34,392
Buttercup scouts!
Too violent!
Do not watch!

282
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,994
(Scoffs) As if!

283
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,301
Sayonara, all.
It's been a kick.

284
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,436
Return to Peru!

285
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,275
I travel solo, chan.
So, step off.

286
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,714
Both: Aah!

287
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,384
Return to Everest!

288
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,720
Both: Ooh!

289
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:06,324
M-m-mount Everest!
B-bad idea!

290
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,394
I wanted a soft landing.

291
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:13,998
Next time
pick a warm place.
Like...Sahara desert!

292
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,636
Uh, oh! Return
to Sahara desert!

293
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,510
Brilliant! You must have been
a real a-plus student, chan!

294
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,147
A-minus in school.

295
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,082
A-plus at the dojo.

296
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,552
Well, you're a complete
washout as a scout leader,
chan.

297
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,856
Leaving those sweet,
defenseless girls
all alone in the woods.

298
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,492
(Gasps)
You're right! Wha?!

299
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,494
Ha! Return
to aculp--

300
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,596
no, return to summit hill!

301
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,268
Jackie!
You're back!

302
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,337
Yes, but so is she.

303
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,741
And I have the necklace.

304
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,276
Return to venice!

305
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,978
Correction. You have
half the necklace.

306
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,118
Come on, Jackie.
Now's our chance
to get her.

307
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,354
Please, Jade.
Stay with the others.
I have a plan.

308
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,858
Ok, I give up!

309
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,460
No more fighting!

310
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,128
That's his plan?!

311
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,463
What's the catch?

312
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,566
No catch. As you said,
I am responsible

313
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,101
for the safety
of these girls.

314
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,469
If you promise to leave,

315
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,771
I will give you
the other half
of the necklace

316
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,841
and tell you
where to find
an amazing treasure.

317
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,109
I'm listening.

318
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,845
A small island
off the coast of Chile.

319
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,881
Very remote.
Uh, demolition island.

320
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,749
Uh, devotion island?

321
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,752
Desolation island.
Nice try, chan.

322
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,454
Thought you could
trick me into traveling

323
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,823
to one of the most
remote spots on earth.

324
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,592
No, really. I--

325
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,695
I'd wager you were
planning to alert
the authorities

326
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:54,298
to fly in and pick me up
the moment I got there.

327
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,634
(Sighs) Actually,
I was going to touch

328
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,670
the 2 necklace halves
together, then pull
my half back

329
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,373
so you would
be teleported,
then stranded.

330
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,342
But you were
too clever to say,

331
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,211
"back to
desolation island."

332
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,248
Oh, return to
desolation island.

333
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,516
(Gasps)

334
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,417
Get her!

335
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,221
Jade. The buttercups.

336
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,789
Jackie! Where are--

337
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,959
can't talk, uncle.
Must go to desolation island.

338
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,795
Desolation island?

339
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:35,973
Jackie!

340
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,309
Ooh! Where are
the others?

341
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,878
With little miss
globetrotter crook.

342
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,016
Scouts: Yeah!
We're saved!

343
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,853
Ah, you used
the first aid skills
I taught you.

344
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,722
Actually, a little something
I picked up watching TV.

345
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,724
<i>Robinson crusoe</i>
<i>goes Hawaiian.</i>

346
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,861
So how we gonna get home,
buttercup mom Jackie?

347
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,565
No way that'll hold us all.

348
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,869
Tohru?

349
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,672
I was hoping to purchase
some more cookies.

350
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,841
Once we are home,
I will buy you
all you can eat!

351
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,316
Hey, Jackie?

352
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,884
Do you cook?

353
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,987
My father is a big cook.

354
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,890
My father's a chef
but his son's the worst.

355
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,194
I even don't know
how to cook the rice.

356
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:33,231
The people tell me
it's the rice machine.

357
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,132
You put some rice in...

358
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,667
I broke the machine.

359
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,070
Somebody give me a rice,
already cook,

360
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,872
then I can put some oil,
with a pepper...

361
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,108
Only that one.

362
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,943
Jackie chan fried rice.
