3
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,210
This is a chimp.

4
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,710
He'll travel to Mars.

5
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:50,626
Mars.

6
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:52,793
We... are humans.

7
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,418
And we aren't going anywhere.

8
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:57,418
We'll stay right here
and suck on each other's blood.

9
00:01:57,793 --> 00:01:59,210
By the way, for your information,
I must tell you...

10
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,585
...that I was born
with this condition.

11
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:02,960
Not the one I'm having now.
I meant the Cerebral Palsy.

12
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,543
As a result,
I can speak fluently only in my mind.

13
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,293
Whereas in reality...

14
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,835
Don't force to me...

15
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:11,960
Aafia, give it to me.

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,793
I sound like this.

17
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,210
Was that funny?

18
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,585
Did you have a laugh?

19
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,043
Now can I get on with the story?

20
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:19,835
This gun is not for
blowing my own brains out.

21
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,460
It's for someone else.

22
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,460
But if they try to stop me,
I swear I will kill myself.

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,043
Which reminds me...

24
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:28,418
This stressed woman
that you see is my mother.

25
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,876
And that's my father.

26
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:32,418
Afghani on my mother's son,
and Punjabi from my father's side.

27
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:34,335
They all love me.

28
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:37,001
Although I didn't make
many mistakes in life...

29
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:39,960
...but no matter what I did,
they all stood by me.

30
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,043
Even though I had a condition,
they never let me lose courage.

31
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:45,085
They educated me and made me capable.

32
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,293
So capable that I am now the...

33
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:50,543
...senior mathematician in America's
most premiere space organization.

34
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:53,710
I made a zero-gravity
simulator on Earth.

35
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,668
And now I am planning the
world's first manned mission to Mars.

36
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:00,501
I'll be giving a seminar
before thousands of people today...

37
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:02,793
...for sending this chimp on Mars.

38
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,460
To raise money and to convince
the American Government to support us.

39
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:09,043
But there's going to be
another guest at this seminar.

40
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:13,751
I am far more eager to
see him then he is to come here.

41
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,085
Let him show up first.

42
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:19,918
By the way, this story
doesn't begin from where I did.

43
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:23,126
But it was important for
me to let you hear my voice.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,043
To warn you that with your
habit of laughing things away...

45
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:30,626
...you don't forget that
this story is as much as about me...

46
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,293
...as much as about that funny man.

47
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:35,710
I just want you to
take care of yourself.

48
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,001
Don't get lost in this crowd.

49
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:40,210
Or get out pocket picket.

50
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,293
Or let someone's cuteness fool you.

51
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:45,460
Like I was.

52
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,793
So, sorry for the interruption.

53
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,543
Now you can hear the story
from where it actually begins.

54
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,918
Please let me go.

55
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,793
Catch her.

56
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,043
Stop!

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,460
Where to, princess?

58
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:30,835
- Let me go.
- Scream if you want.

59
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:33,168
- Scream!
- Leave me.

60
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:38,335
Let the toughest man in all Meerut
save you from my clutches.

61
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,585
- Anyone there?
- Ashok!

62
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:16,626
May the good Lord forgive us!

63
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,501
Can't you speak French?

64
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:40,793
Ashok, didn't I hit you yesterday?

65
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,001
So what?

66
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:44,085
So what!

67
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,293
Times have changed, boy.

68
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:53,543
Your father must be "the boy."
They call me Bauua Singh.

69
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:56,751
Bauua!

70
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:00,876
Oh no! That same dream.

71
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,710
Did you save my honour again
in your dream?

72
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:07,335
- Yes.
- Bauua.

73
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:10,293
Your friends are here.

74
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:12,376
Your father is calling you
for breakfast.

75
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:15,168
Bring me tea. Wash your hands first.

76
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:18,043
- Bauua.
- Who's that?

77
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,835
Bauua. Bauua.

78
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:24,501
Bauua come out.

79
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:26,668
Your Majesty! Good morning.

80
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:28,793
Good morning, guys. What's up?

81
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:30,960
Look! The new iPhone.

82
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,918
Wow!

83
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,543
Sire, this jewel in rags...

84
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,751
...has brought great news for you.

85
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:40,085
Your heart will melt.
You'll singing devotional songs.

86
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:44,251
- The most delightful news ever.
- Read it out!

87
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,418
Yes.

88
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:50,293
"Babita Kumari's heart
has been broken again.

89
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:53,043
- Wow!
- "At director Imtiaz Ali's party...

90
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:57,168
"...the spat between Babita Kumari
and her boyfriend intensified.

91
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:00,585
"They were cast in Anurag Kashyap's
next film...

92
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:04,626
"...but Babita has refused
to work with her guy.

93
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:11,168
"At a party, her close friend
Shamina Khan let slip the reason why:

94
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:14,001
"He's with another actress.

95
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,085
"Has it happened again?

96
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:19,585
"Has Babita Kumari's heart been
broken by another flirt?"

97
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,126
Your bride has missed the wedding bus.

98
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,585
Bless you.

99
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:25,335
Guddu, that's terrific news.

100
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:31,876
Today is Eid. Give these guys
a 500-rupee bundle.

101
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,960
It'll make their day.

102
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,626
Wait!

103
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,460
Behave you guys.

104
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:38,001
- Is he up yet?
- No.

105
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:42,751
He'll only get up when my dead body
leaves this house.

106
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:47,501
Have your breakfast. Stop nagging him.
He's just a kid.

107
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,751
Only in height. He eats
like a full-grown man.

108
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:51,918
You're just...

109
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,626
I slave away while mister wants
fresh orange juice.

110
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:57,501
I am not his father...

111
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,835
...but a money printing
machine to him.

112
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:06,501
Keep them coming.

113
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:12,168
Hey, orphans! Enjoy biryani
in my bride Babita's name.

114
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,501
Hey, you!

115
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:15,668
Stop!

116
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:18,251
The whole neighbourhood's shown up.

117
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,335
You incompetent idiots!

118
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,418
Snatch the cash from him.

119
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:27,085
- Have your breakfast.
- I won't spare him today.

120
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,001
You...

121
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,668
Squandering my money.

122
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,001
- He's a kid.
- A kid, my foot!

123
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,876
You're an angel of death.

124
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:38,251
Don't talk nonsense, Ashok.

125
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,668
Your bad habits made me short.

126
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:42,835
So what if I spend your money?

127
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:44,543
My bad habits?

128
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,543
Is my height my fault?

129
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:49,501
- All that tobacco-chewing
stunted your genes. - Shut up!

130
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:53,126
- My genes?
- It's stunted. I've read about it.

131
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,835
Either I kill him or you kill me.

132
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:59,835
Try saying that when a cop's
twisting his stick inside you.

133
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:02,793
- Go on. Hit me.
- Go downstairs for my sake.

134
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,793
- I'll stop your merrymaking.
- Go!

135
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,876
- I'm taking your car.
- Be my guest!

136
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:10,918
Even your belt's too soft.

137
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,543
Bauua, why are you after him?

138
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:17,668
Look at my height. He owes me, Amma.

139
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,960
Son, it's God's will
that you're a dwarf.

140
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,335
Your God has had His way.
Now it's my turn.

141
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:27,460
OK. Give me my suit
and the "Dhoom 3" bowler hat.

142
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,710
I'm seeing my bride's new movie.

143
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:35,085
Amma, I've told you so many times...

144
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:36,918
...don't you cry.

145
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:43,543
- Found your perfect wife?
- Pandey is looking for girl.

146
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,585
- Nigaar cinema.
- How many passengers?

147
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:50,835
Just me, the small kid.
And my father.

148
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,793
Why are you joking, sir?
You're a grown man.

149
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,460
So why ask? Shall I...?

150
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:00,168
- I charge 20 rupees.
- It's 10 for Nigaar cinema.

151
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:03,918
Pay me 5 and pull
the rickshaw yourself.

152
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:06,668
10 rupees per passenger.
No matter how many.

153
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,918
- Can you pull us all?
- Yes.

154
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,293
Gimme five!

155
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,126
We're off to see
my bride's movie. Come!

156

Come one. Come all.
Come on.

Come and enjoy Babita's latest!

Two sexy item numbers.

160
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:32,043
He can pull us all.

161
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:33,168
Come on.

162
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:35,668
Guddu, should I call Junaid?

163
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,543
Forget it! He prefers the star Deepika
and Hollywood movies.

164
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:42,876
Come with us.
There's tons of room here.

Celebrate? Celebrate what?

177
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:44,085
Are you drunk?
I'll be there tomorrow.

178
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:48,835
- What is it?
- Nothing.

179
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,001
Come one.

180
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,793
Bring the three Khans with you.
Here I am, sweetheart.

181
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,793
Why did Pandey call you so early?

182
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:13,501
I have a bad feeling.

183
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:17,918
Mr. Singh...

184
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:21,876
...when's the wedding?

185
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,585
Rubbish!

186
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:27,335
Don't stick gum on my shoe
for your commission.

187
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:30,168
You've introduced me to many girls
for months.

188
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:31,585
I didn't like one.

189
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,751
What's so special about her?

190
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,835
I didn't care for active girls...

191
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,210
...why would an inactive girl
interest me?

192
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,293
- Inactive?
- Yes!

193
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:42,168
I told him, "Find me another bride."
Didn't I tell you?

194
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:43,751
- Yes.
- He's right.

195
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:46,293
I know what you were up to.

196
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:49,543
You should've told me before
hugging and kissing.

197
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:51,585
My God, what have you done?

198
00:12:51,793 --> 00:12:54,126
What's wrong with her?

199
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,168
She's pretty and educated.

200
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:58,501
Comes from a good family.
Has a great job.

201
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:00,043
But...

202
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,043
- ...a few mechanical problems.
- Like what?

203
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,085
Technical hiccups.

204
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,668
He's not exactly a catch!

205
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,126
When he sits, his feet can't touch
the ground and he wants a beauty.

206
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:12,251
Right.

207
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,376
You were having...

208
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:15,585
...a love affair.

209
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:17,251
No.

210
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,835
Will you betray her?
Turn your back on love?

211
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,293
Love?

212
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:24,001
You didn't tell me. God forgive us.

213
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:25,085
No, bro.

214
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:27,126
What do you mean "no?"

215
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:31,251
It started 5 months ago,
on 27th January...

216
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:34,418
...you were looking at photos
of prospective brides...

217
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:36,543
...and I entered through that door.

218
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,085
<i>It was a miserable day.</i>

219
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,251
You came all the way from Meerut
in this terrible storm?

220
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:46,960
Bachelors at 38...

221
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,460
...aren't scared of storms.

222
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:51,960
You've seen so many photos.

223
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,626
No girl in Asia is worthy of you.

224
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,085
Shut up!

225
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,960
You lied to me. You hid this diamond
in a coal mine.

226
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:02,876
This.

227
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,501
- Where did you find this?
- In your desk drawer.

228
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:11,710
She's unavailable. So I hid it.

229
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:16,543
I've paid you so much,
you should be available to me too.

230
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:18,543
- What are you saying?
- What?

231
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:21,085
Mr. Singh, she's not for you.

232
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:23,376
I think she is.

233
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:26,418
My friend, she shakes a lot.

234
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,043
So I'll shake along with her.

235
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:30,793
Introduce us.

236
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,543
Don't take this road.

237
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,251
But I will.

238
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,210
Mr. Singh...

239
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:41,876
...even people who love in secret
end up married.

240
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,085
Aafia Yusufzai Bhinder?
What kind of name is that?

241
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:50,376
Some people have the oddest names.
So does she.

242
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,835
Half Afghani, half Punjabi.

243
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,543
Blast! Then? What did you do?

244
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:57,960
Then?

245
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,001
I landed up at her address.

246
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:03,918
Amity Global School is proud
to Present our very own student...

247
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,668
...from the batch of 2001.

248
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:08,001
Apart from finding
water fossils on Mars...

249
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:11,835
...her latest achievement is creating
a zero gravity simulator on earth.

250
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,793
My dear students, please welcome NSAR
senior scientist...

251
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:17,251
...Miss Aafia Yusufzai Bhinder.

252
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,001
Good heavens!

253
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,418
There was no wheelchair in the photo.

254
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,376
Good morning, students.

255
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:40,793
- What?
- Girls only here. Scoot!

256
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:41,918
Fine, fine.

257
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,460
Stop!

258
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,918
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!

259
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:49,918
- Why are you in fancy dress?
- It's my birthday.

260
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:51,793
- And those doves?
- Which ones?

261
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,085
- Give them to me.
- Stop!

262
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:56,668
They cost 5000 for the pair, idiot.

263
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,251
Insulting me? What class are you in?

264
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:02,626
If I had married in time,
I'd have brats like you by now.

265
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:03,710
Don't pull my ear.

266
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,793
No pulling.

267
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,043
Let go. I'll bite you.

268
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,835
No organ pulling.

269
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:20,668
Did Pandey send you?

270
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,835
Bauua Singh?

271
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:27,126
Singh.

272
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:30,626
Singh.

273
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:33,210
Singh.

274
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:36,960
I didn't know my name had
a whistle in it. Say it again.

275
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,418
What's wrong? You're leaving?

276
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,043
Listen to me!

277
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:49,085
I brought a pair of doves for you...

278
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:52,251
...but those brats let them escape.
Please take this.

279
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:55,626
Like doves, thorns do not fear dying.

280
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:56,876
For you...

281
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,626
Isn't that a Dilip Kumar line?

282
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:03,918
You're no Madhubala either.
It's a compliment. Keep it.

283
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:15,210
The canteen here has great snacks.

284
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:17,793
Want some?

285
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:20,918
You want her autograph?
Queue up.

286
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:23,460
Aren't kids nasty?

287
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:32,251
What made you think you could
ever marry me?

288
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:37,335
Me? Marry?
Who pays for looking?

289
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:40,793
I was just window-shopping.

290
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:44,001
Do you know who I am?

291
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,751
You found water on Mars or something?

292
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,543
You should look for water in Meerut.
It's cut off for days there.

293
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:55,418
Looks like your brain's even smaller
than you are.

294
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:59,085
The way you're guzzling down
those pakodas...

295
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,960
...dipping them in chutney...

296
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,210
...I bet you haven't passed 7th grade.

297
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,460
10th grade, actually.

298
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,585
10th grade.

299
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:11,168
Students!

300
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:14,668
What should we do with this man?

301
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:18,835
Kill him!

302
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:21,543
Watch it!

303
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:24,835
May your mother elope with a barber!
Don't touch me. I'll hit you.

304
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:26,043
Wait.

305
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:30,876
Be polite and see
this uncle to the door.

306
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,085
Uncle? I'm only 38.

307
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:38,626
You...

308
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,751
- Then?
- Then what?

309
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,460
Chill, bro. I went home.

310
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,668
- Look! What is this?
- Shall I explain?

311
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:56,793
What...

312
00:18:58,751 --> 00:18:59,960
- Brother...
- Yes.

313
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,168
What is this?

314
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:03,501
A dance contest.

315
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,751
The winner will attend
a party with Babita Kumari.

316
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:08,085
- Really?
- Yes.

317
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:12,376
Add my name then. I can dance.

318
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:15,001
- Hey...
- Shall I make you dance?

319
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:16,626
So what happened next?

320
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:19,001
You're playing the innocent.
You must've done it!

321
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:20,001
The truth.

322
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:25,001
I first roasted
those cursed doves.

323
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,835
- This chicken is tiny.
- It's a dwarf.

324
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,168
God forgive us!

325
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:39,543
<i>As usual my father kept saying
I was a good-for-nothing.</i>

326
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,085
He's been sucking my blood.

327
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:42,251
<i>Exhausted, he fell asleep.</i>

328
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:44,751
5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0...

329
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,543
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

330
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:49,376
<i>That mean girl,
that Shahid Kapoor lookalike.</i>

331
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:52,626
<i>5000 angels of death swooped
past me.</i>

332
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:57,251
<i>I was so angry I shot down 200 stars
that night.</i>

333
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,960
<i>Dad stopped me.</i>

334
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Don't empty the sky.

335
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,376
You should sell tickets
for your magic show.

336
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:05,960
Lend me 500 rupees.

337
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,668
Shall I take my belt off?

338
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:11,085
What belt? Are you going to hit me
with your drawstring?

339
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,585
<i>It was pointless living
without taking revenge.</i>

340
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:17,543
<i>I wanted sweet revenge.</i>

341
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:20,168
We have decided to perhaps...

342
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,668
Hello... Hello...

343
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:23,918
Hello, hello, my loose cannon.

344
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:29,085
You may have found water on Mars
or tomatoes elsewhere, so what?

345
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,501
Did it help you?

346
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,960
Don't laugh too much!

347
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,793
You humiliated me in front of
5000 people yesterday. My turn now.

348
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:39,418
Brothers and sisters...

349
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:44,210
Sure, I could've been taller!
But she's no lanky Amitabh Bachchan.

350
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,335
I'm small in stature
but my limbs work.

351
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:50,251
All she can do is shake.

352
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:54,251
Give me that pen.
I'll show you something.

353
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:57,293
If this pen falls...

354
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,085
...I can pick it up.
But she can't.

355
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:08,168
Bauua Singh may be uneducated
and live off his father...

356
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,251
...but I can stand on my own two feet.

357
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:14,710
Let's see her pick up the pen.

358
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:15,960
Come on.

359
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,126
Keep watching her.
Look where you're going, mister.

360
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,418
"The kid-faced Devil"

361
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:12,293
"Nasty dwarf"

362
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:18,835
<i>She could not lift the pen
but she touched my heart.</i>

363
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:23,543
<i>I'm used to my father's insults,
so it wasn't her insulting me.</i>

364
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:27,251
<i>The problem was she didn't
even stare at me.</i>

365
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:32,501
<i>I'm a dwarf! People pay money
to see dwarves in a circus.</i>

366
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:36,001
<i>It would've cost her nothing.
But she didn't look twice.</i>

367
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:40,460
<i>For me, it was double or quits.</i>

368
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:45,001
<i>No more doves.
Time for a bouquet.</i>

369
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:07,376
Long live the Goddess!

370
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:10,085
- Great, yeah...
- True.

371
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,960
"Don't take me for a stone.
Don't turn away, my rose.

372
00:23:17,418 --> 00:23:22,085
"Like dew, I only caressed
your cheeks."

373
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:29,251
That line isn't Dilip Kumar's.
It's mine. I wrote it for you.

374
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:36,751
Aafia, till 3.30 last night,
I despised you.

375
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:39,543
At 3.45, I was in love with you.

376
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,751
Really?

377
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,043
Straight to love?

378
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:44,876
Yes.

379
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:48,460
I thought you were crushed.

380
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,960
Right word?

381
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,793
Yes! Crushed is the right word.

382
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:58,460
God has had His will.
No one on earth can help me now.

383
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,376
I came to apologise.

384
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:03,251
It's customary to bring flowers.

385
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,960
May I...?

386
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:13,126
Never mind, it's OK.

387
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:17,585
Size does not matter to dreams.

388
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,501
This small man has dreamed of you.

389
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:25,335
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Forgive me, Aafia.

390
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,793
Well... shall I go?

391
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,918
Whereabout...

392
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:33,793
Stop me from walking away.

393
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:37,626
O Goddess, will You crush me again?
Blast you, Pandey.

394
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:40,043
Nice girls for everyone.
And you find her for me?

395
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,168
She humiliated me again
in front of everyone.

396
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,918
"Don't take me for a stone.
Don't turn away, my rose.

397
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:51,251
"Like dew, I only caressed
your cheeks."

398
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,626
That's my line not Dilip Kumar's.

399
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,793
Till 3.30 last night, I despised you.

400
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,335
At 3.45, I was in love with you.

401
00:24:57,335 --> 00:25:00,918
God has had His will.
No one on earth can help me now.

402
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:05,001
Size does not matter to dreams.
This small man has dreamed of you.

403
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,168
I came to apologise.

404
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:08,376
This time I've brought you a plant.

405
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,043
Please accept it.

406
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,710
I'm off. I'm going.

407
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,085
I'm leaving. Promise.

408
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:22,376
Have some shame!

409
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,335
Stop me this time!

410
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,001
Get rid of your dimple.
Don't act over-smart.

411
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:34,043
Then I might talk to you.

412
00:25:34,043 --> 00:25:36,460
I didn't buy my dimples.

413
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,251
I was born with them.
God's gift, ma'am.

414
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,335
What do you want?

415
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:44,418
I've come from so far to meet you.

416
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:48,418
You could offer me tea, coffee,
a cold drink or wine.

417
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:58,126
Here. Drink up.

418
00:25:58,835 --> 00:26:02,126
If I had to drink alone...

419
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,585
...a Meerut bar would do.

420
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:05,793
Have one.

421
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:07,043
Go on!

422
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:14,168
Cheers! To your smile.

423
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:31,043
Aafia, if you're unlucky,
we'll meet again.

424
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:36,751
Won't you ask me
to pick up a pen today?

425
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:41,918
You'll take my life, Aafia.
What's a pen?

426
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:46,210
Can I be cheeky and request you
to dance with me?

427
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,085
I can't dance.

428
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:53,918
I used to think I could never love.

429
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:57,376
Give yourself a chance, my sweet lady.

430
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,710
DJ!

431
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,710
Yes, sir.

432
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,710
Play a Shammi Kapoor song.

433
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,501
Don't have any.

434
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,001
A Rishi Kapoor song?

435
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:10,210
Well...

436
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:13,626
Play a song by any one
of the Kapoor dynasty.

437
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,793
Yes.

438
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:17,335
A Shashi Kapoor number?

439
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:20,085
Play it!

440
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:25,210
<i>O my God!</i>

441
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:43,960
<i>This crazy heart of mine
has weaved such magic...</i>

442
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,126
<i>...that you have...</i>

443
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:53,668
<i>...fallen in love with me</i>

444
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:57,751
<i>...that you have...</i>

445
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:02,668
<i>...fallen in love with you</i>

446
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,918
<i>O my God!</i>

447
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:31,668
<i>My heart tells me</i>

448
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,960
<i>It's God's truth</i>

449
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:38,376
<i>My heart tells me</i>

450
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:41,043
<i>It's God's truth</i>

451
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:45,543
<i>The world does not believe it...</i>

452
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:52,210
<i>The world does not believe it...</i>

453
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,585
<i>...but I'm crazy about you</i>

454
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:57,335
<i>I'm not a garden, not a star...</i>

455
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,168
<i>...I'm not a dark cloud,
I'm only a shadow</i>

456
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:03,043
<i>You have...</i>

457
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:08,585
<i>...fallen in love with me</i>

458
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:11,335
<i>O my God!</i>

459
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:15,376
How is it?

460
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:20,793
Another drink?

461
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:27,293
The rover that went to Mars,
what's it called?

462
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,376
Goodness! I'm so drunk!

463
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:32,501
Yes... Sunil?

464
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,001
No.

465
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:38,543
- It's called...
- "Velocity."

466
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,376
- "Velocity."
- I knew that.

467
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:48,251
Who asked NSAR to send
a rover to Mars?

468
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:51,418
Velocity was sent by... whom?

469
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:54,293
- Who sent it?
- I did.

470
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,793
Is that so?

471
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,251
- I see...
- And...

472
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:04,876
...who told NSAR that Velocity
should dig...

473
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,043
...more than travel?

474
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:08,251
Who did?

475
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:10,085
I did.

476
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:12,460
Amazing.

477
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,376
Who told them...

478
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:20,501
...we should send a man to Mars now?

479
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:23,001
It's time.

480
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:25,210
- Who did?
- I did.

481
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,335
Who said...

482
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:37,793
...we should find cheaper ways
of doing it from India?

483
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:40,585
- That's why I'm here.
- Who?

484
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:43,251
Me. In India.

485
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:46,001
I came.

486
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,251
If you're here in India,
it must be you.

487
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:52,626
- Amazing. You came here...
- Excuse me.

488
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,918
Can you give me one
more drink, please?

489
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:57,751
Sorry, ma'am, the bar's closed.

490
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:03,835
She found water on Mars,
and you refuse her a drink?

491
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,751
Look at her!

492
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:10,126
OK. Don't look.
Aafia, shall I hit him?

493
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:23,168
The toilet is shaking.
Give me a sip.

494
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:28,085
Try some lemon.

495
00:31:31,668 --> 00:31:34,835
So who told...?

496
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,251
Enough, my friend.
Is NSAR all we can talk about?

497
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:43,626
Do I brag about saving Satish's shop
when the council came to destroy it?

498
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,293
- Who saved it?
- I did.

499
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,376
Right.

500
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:51,210
They came with bulldozers
to raze it to the ground.

501
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,918
Do I brag? I did this.
I did that. Doesn't sound good.

502
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,210
Are you making fun of me?
Naughty!

503
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,918
Acting over-smart again?

504
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:06,710
But no dimples this time!
It still worked, no?

505
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:12,168
Shut up! I need to take a leak.

506
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:14,210
Where's the leak?

507
00:32:15,918 --> 00:32:20,710
Duffer! I need the toilet, to pee.

508
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,543
Ohh...

509
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,710
What must I do?

510
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:31,126
You? I'm the one who has to do it.

511
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:35,085
I'll wait outside.
Call me when you're done.

512
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:38,168
Outside? You're my friend.

513
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,751
Stay put. Just turn around.

514
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,876
We're in the Ladies.
There may be some aunties around.

515
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,168
I'll deal with them.
Don't be mistaken.

516
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:49,793
I'm not your friend.

517
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:06,210
If I said I was your friend,
would you have let me stay?

518
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:09,793
- Oh my God!
- Come in, aunty. I'm only a kid.

519
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,126
I found water on Mars
and the rascal won't give me a drink.

520
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:19,960
- Come here.
- Now I'll look for alcohol on Mars.

521
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:40,543
You didn't answer me.

522
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,543
If I said I was your friend,
could I have stayed?

523
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:50,710
- You missed your chance.
- No way.

524
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:55,126
If I went for this chance,
I might lose other chances.

525
00:33:55,918 --> 00:33:58,793
God forbid I ever become your friend!

526
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,168
- Shut up!
- OK.

527
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:07,418
- And good night.
- OK. I'm gone.

528
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:12,668
Aafia, did anyone tell you...

529
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:16,335
...how pretty sweat looks
on your face?

530
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:19,543
Yes. Mummy did.

531
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,210
You'll look even prettier with colour
on you. It's Holi tomorrow!

532
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,585
Play Holi with me.

533
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:30,293
Money back if you don't have fun.

534
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:34,085
Don't forget your place, Bauua Singh.

535
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:37,960
I'm way out of your league.

536
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,793
That's really big of you, Aafia.

537
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,626
I can find dozens like you.

538
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,501
Why like me?

539
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,085
- I like uneducated types.
- I can be the intellectual gent.

540
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,585
I've seen many English films.

541
00:34:56,585 --> 00:35:00,460
Now I'll say goodnight.

542
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:05,376
Stand there if you
want to waste your time.

543
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:10,793
Bauua!

544
00:35:18,168 --> 00:35:19,210
Bauua!

545
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,460
Are you there?

546
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:27,793
So your head was against the door.
Like this?

547
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,168
How romantic! Standing at her door.
Then?

548
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:33,918
The usual.

549
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:35,251
What? Romance?

550
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:37,501
No, fool! A song.

551
00:35:38,126 --> 00:35:43,418
<i>Guddu, the orchestra cost 250,000.
150,000 for their costumes.</i>

552
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:47,043
<i>50,000 bribe for the
Imperial Hotel's manager.</i>

553
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:51,668
<i>80,000 to hire the nasty kids.
20,000 for colour sprays.</i>

554
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:54,376
<i>Plus my suit at 150,000.</i>

555
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:59,251
<i>I didn't want to, but ended up
spending 600,000 of Dad's money.</i>

556
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:04,293
<i>Thanks to the Goddess,
at last the girl looked at this dwarf.</i>

557
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:27,085
<i>A colour has no colour...</i>

558
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:32,543
<i>...if it does not match the colour
of your lips.</i>

559
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,168
<i>A fragrance has no fragrance...</i>

560
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:45,251
<i>...if it does not match the fragrance
of your dark hair.</i>

561
00:36:47,293 --> 00:36:51,293
<i>The world pales next to you</i>

562
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:55,376
<i>You can only be mine</i>

563
00:36:55,376 --> 00:37:02,085
<i>Everyone can see it.
I say this out loud:</i>

564
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:07,710
<i>As long as there's
light in the world...</i>

565
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:11,335
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

566
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:16,043
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

567
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:19,335
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

568
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,668
<i>As long as there's
light in the world...</i>

569
00:37:24,043 --> 00:37:27,501
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

570
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:31,793
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

571
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:35,001
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

572
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:24,001
<i>I am your confusion.
I am your solution</i>

573
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,960
<i>I'm a little stubborn</i>

574
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,210
<i>A little crazy too</i>

575
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,085
<i>How false are the clouds
and spring showers</i>

576
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:39,418
<i>How false is offering
a gift of flowers</i>

577
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:43,043
<i>Only you are real.
Only I am real</i>

578
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:47,335
<i>My heart speaks the only truth</i>

579
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:51,418
<i>Etch your name on my heart
with your lovely hands</i>

580
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:59,043
<i>Open your eyes to my love.
Do I ask too much of you?</i>

581
00:38:59,043 --> 00:39:04,085
<i>I say this out loud:</i>

582
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:08,043
<i>As long as there's light
in the world...</i>

583
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:11,585
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

584
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:16,043
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

585
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:19,043
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

586
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:24,043
<i>As long as there's
light in the world...</i>

587
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:27,501
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

588
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:32,043
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

589
00:39:32,043 --> 00:39:35,168
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

590
00:39:55,876 --> 00:40:02,793
<i>Forever you will sway
in my loving arms</i>

591
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:10,918
<i>Like the earth sways
in the arms of the sun</i>

592
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:18,251
<i>You will never be apart from me</i>

593
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:26,335
<i>Forever you will be a part of me</i>

594
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:35,376
<i>Shatter all my dreams if you wish</i>

595
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:39,376
<i>The shards of my dreams
will still dream of you</i>

596
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:42,751
<i>You are my inspiration</i>

597
00:40:43,043 --> 00:40:45,960
<i>I say this out loud:</i>

598
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:56,001
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

599
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:59,210
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

600
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:03,876
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

601
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:07,251
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

602
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:12,668
My good sir!

603
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:17,085
Your romancing will get my
family thrown out on the street.

604
00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:18,501
I'll be fired.

605
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:21,210
Shut up! She's coming round.

606
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,876
I should shut up?
Pass me the agreement.

607
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:27,085
Where does it say
you'll ruin this place?

608
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,460
We agreed you'd spray colours,
there'd be some musicians...

609
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,418
...that's all.

610
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:38,751
Bauua.

611
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:41,751
Bauua, give me 100-rupees
and I'll tell you something.

612
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,710
Your father wants you home.

613
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,668
I paid you to hear this?

614
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:51,085
Naughty! What's this?

615
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:52,710
Lost your tongue?

616
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,460
You sang to her.

617
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,168
Now you're in love. What else?
Why deny it?

618
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:03,543
She fell in love with me.
And I started loving myself.

619
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:08,418
- Then?
- The usual.

620
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:10,376
Another song? You just sang.

621
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:11,210
No!

622
00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:13,460
Romance.

623
00:42:14,543 --> 00:42:16,126
God forgive us!

624
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:29,543
Do you know...

625
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:33,876
...why the moon is sometimes
a half moon?

626
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,001
Yes.

627
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:43,710
Because the other half sits
on the Imperial Hotel balcony.

628
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:51,043
- Trying to be smooth?
- Trying?

629
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,001
Showing me your dimple,
making a fool of me.

630
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,751
I know your ways.

631
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:57,626
Well...

632
00:43:01,293 --> 00:43:03,376
...let me try another technique.

633
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,210
Look!

634
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:13,293
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

635
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,376
Do it...

636
00:43:26,543 --> 00:43:27,543
...again.

637
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:32,626
Ten... nine... eight...

638
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:34,168
...zero.

639
00:43:44,043 --> 00:43:47,335
How did you do it?

640
00:43:52,835 --> 00:43:55,043
Would you make the moon fall too?

641
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:06,418
Ten... nine... eight...

642
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,793
Never mind!

643
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:36,251
There's only one moon.

644
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:56,626
So...

645
00:44:57,085 --> 00:45:01,001
...if we get intimate now...

646
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:07,001
...your job's done, right?

647
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,626
It's all you wanted?

648
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:18,168
That's what I thought, but...

649
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:20,043
But?

650
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:23,668
But...

651
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,543
...it's hard for me to say this.

652
00:45:27,835 --> 00:45:29,668
It's insulting for me...

653
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:31,293
...but...

654
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,710
...I'm in love with you.

655
00:45:45,585 --> 00:45:47,793
Wait. What are you doing?

656
00:45:49,168 --> 00:45:51,001
Don't go. I'll be back.

657
00:46:09,335 --> 00:46:11,251
What a scandal! Then?

658
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:14,460
It's a month since that night.
Haven't seen her since.

659
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:17,210
I've got a new SIM card
and a new number.

660
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:20,501
Don't fly too high! Clever
crows can end up eating crap too.

661
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:24,168
I've had my share of crap.
I'll just be the clever crow now.

662
00:46:24,168 --> 00:46:25,585
And fly high.

663
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:28,001
You did her wrong.

664
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:32,085
- God will take His revenge.
- What more revenge can He take?

665
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:35,876
Remember when my father used to pay
tax in advance? I've paid too.

666
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,251
And if God asks me, why this?
Why that?

667
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:42,668
We cover our faces.

668
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:45,418
Don't believe her.

669
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:47,751
Blast you, Pandey.

670
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,293
- What is it?
- Can you eat sweets?

671
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:51,710
What?

672
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:53,085
Dear...

673
00:46:54,085 --> 00:46:55,876
He's back. Wait a second.

674
00:46:59,043 --> 00:47:03,376
- Come here.
- I don't know her. Listen.

675
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:06,793
What's going on?

676
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:08,585
Look at me.

677
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,918
Are you duping her?

678
00:47:11,918 --> 00:47:13,168
Bauua!

679
00:47:13,835 --> 00:47:14,710
Scoundrel.

680
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:19,543
You talk non-stop.
Cat got your tongue now?

681
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,043
That's our Bauua.

682
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:24,793
Yes, I know.

683
00:47:25,126 --> 00:47:28,710
You don't get it? He's always
going to look small.

684
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:36,418
I won't look different
25 years from now either.

685
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:38,293
True.

686
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,126
You're lucky.

687
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:42,626
You found a girl who'll marry you.

688
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,293
Even boys would say no.

689
00:47:48,293 --> 00:47:50,376
Playing games with her?

690
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:05,168
Fix the wedding date.

691
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,585
An auspicious day. Hurry.

692
00:48:07,835 --> 00:48:12,126
He's getting married at last!

693
00:48:12,835 --> 00:48:15,626
He's finally getting married.

694
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:18,126
I am not getting married.

695
00:48:18,335 --> 00:48:20,376
I'll hang myself.

696
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:21,710
- Listen Ashok.
- How will he hang himself?

697
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:22,918
Where's everybody?

698
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:23,876
Aunty.

699
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:26,668
- Guddu, let's celebrate.
- Celebrate?

700
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:28,960
How can you all eat?

701
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,710
He'll commit suicide.

702
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,668
- Who?
- Bauua, who else?

703
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:36,126
Listen, Guddu.
That's just typical of him.

704
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:39,751
He shouts his head off.
No one can say a word to him.

705
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,543
Before anyone calls him a dwarf...

706
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,668
...he stuffs money in their face.
Or pelts stones.

707
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:47,668
His strutting is a sham.

708
00:48:48,376 --> 00:48:51,793
I'll buy you a shop
if that dog commits suicide.

709
00:48:51,793 --> 00:48:54,210
God! What kind of mother are you?

710
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:55,543
The real thing.

711
00:48:57,876 --> 00:48:59,751
Yes, listen.

712
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:02,001
I want 75 boxes of sweet.

713
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:04,585
Not 80, 75.

714
00:49:06,668 --> 00:49:07,835
Move aside.

715
00:49:07,835 --> 00:49:09,251
Fine, fine.

716
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,918
Bauua, you're marinating here...

717
00:49:12,126 --> 00:49:14,418
...while the boys are jumping for joy.

718
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,960
Shut those women up.
My head's splitting.

719
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,543
Babita's coming to the Mall tonight.

720
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:21,126
Babita, who?

721
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,918
Babita, who?

722
00:49:24,501 --> 00:49:26,251
Babita Kumari!

723
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:27,626
Your Mrs.

724
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:29,251
My sister-in-law.

725
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:32,751
The one who'll enter this house
with bridal bells on her feet.

726
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:36,210
The one who'll feed your children.

727
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,626
The one who'll have henna
painted on her hands. Bauua Singh!

728
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,126
The irony of love!

729
00:49:41,751 --> 00:49:45,251
Before I die,
she has come to meet me. In person.

730
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,460
God is Great!

731
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:51,251
Don't rub any more inches off me.

732
00:50:00,085 --> 00:50:01,876
Get the scooter out, Guddu.

733
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:05,085
<i>Fill my brow with stars!</i>

734
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:10,543
<i>My beloved is here</i>

735
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:12,085
Babita!

736
00:50:12,085 --> 00:50:14,001
- Jeetu da...
- Fast.

737
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,751
Madam called you two minutes ago.

738
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:18,543
Babita, costume is ready.
Everything is ready. Now you...

739
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,001
Oh!

740
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:21,918
Did you bet?

741
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,251
I'll bet 500.

742
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:25,710
Call him.

743
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:28,751
He won't pick up.

744
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,501
I know his father too.

745
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:31,918
All cons.

746
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:38,793
Best of three.

747
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:48,126
<i>The number you're trying to reach
is currently busy.</i>

748
00:50:48,126 --> 00:50:50,960
How about the best of five, ma'am?

749
00:50:51,585 --> 00:50:53,835
<i>The number you're trying to reach...</i>

750
00:51:03,251 --> 00:51:04,418
Shall I call back?

751
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:08,918
OK. Let's try.

752
00:51:16,876 --> 00:51:20,043
<i>The customer you're calling
is unavailable.</i>

753
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,710
Can I come in?

754
00:51:29,335 --> 00:51:31,001
Yes. No one's bathing.

755
00:51:31,793 --> 00:51:33,293
Madam, shall we leave?

756
00:51:34,168 --> 00:51:36,793
It's a 3-hour drive to Meerut.

757
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:41,793
Okay.

758
00:51:44,418 --> 00:51:45,501
How much did I lose?

759
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:48,460
25,000. But you can pay 15,000.

760
00:51:52,751 --> 00:51:56,793
Here. Go, get my bag.
I'll pay the rest later.

761
00:51:57,043 --> 00:51:59,543
It's already in the car.
You please get ready.

762
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:04,585
- Shall we go?
- Hello! Costume, make-up and hair.

763
00:52:11,876 --> 00:52:13,335
Clothes done.

764
00:52:14,126 --> 00:52:16,501
Hair done.

765
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:22,043
I'm so pretty. Don't need make-up.

766
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:27,793
<i>Your love's fake.</i>

767
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:30,251
<i>I've seen how selfish you are.</i>

768
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:32,543
<i>Every day you get a new arm candy.</i>

769
00:52:32,543 --> 00:52:35,335
<i>I am high on your betrayal.</i>

770
00:52:40,585 --> 00:52:42,126
Take a look here.

771
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,960
Stop going crazy.

772
00:52:45,668 --> 00:52:47,960
<i>Your love's fake.</i>

773
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,501
<i>I've seen how selfish you are.</i>

774
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,751
<i>Every day you get a new arm candy.</i>

775
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:54,585
<i>I am high on your betrayal.</i>

776
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:55,751
Babita!

777
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:58,001
<i>You go to god and tell...</i>

778
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:00,585
<i>That you swindle everyone,</i>

779
00:53:00,793 --> 00:53:05,418
<i>There is a blame on you,
come and listen.</i>

780
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,460
Sc*** you.

781
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,293
<i>You have defamed her, defamed her,</i>

782
00:53:11,293 --> 00:53:13,751
<i>- With your fake love
- Sc***</i>

783
00:53:13,751 --> 00:53:15,501
She proposed to you.

784
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:18,043
I love you!

785
00:53:18,335 --> 00:53:20,210
I love you too.

786
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:23,251
<i>With your fake love</i>

787
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:44,251
Babita, my love look at me once.

788
00:53:44,751 --> 00:53:46,293
Bauua, faster.

789
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:49,501
- You want me to fly like a helicopter?
- Step on it.

790
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:52,043
Move aside!

791
00:53:54,626 --> 00:53:56,043
Bauua, where are you going?

792
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:59,376
- Are you following your mother?
- No, your sister.

793
00:53:59,376 --> 00:54:01,918
- Your daughter.
- No, my sister-in-law.

794
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:03,085
Understand.

795
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:06,210
I'll teach you a lesson.

796
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,751
We'll get you.

797
00:54:09,168 --> 00:54:10,710
Give him one.

798
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:13,710
- Don't flash your torch. Kick him.
- Hold on.

799
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,418
- I can't see them.
- They're behind us.

800
00:54:17,418 --> 00:54:20,835
You blinded me in one eye
when we were kids. Remember?

801
00:54:20,835 --> 00:54:22,710
- I can't see.
- Kick now!

802
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:25,251
- You...
- Get off.

803
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:32,585
I paid for your mother's surgery...

804
00:54:32,585 --> 00:54:35,001
...why follow my bride? You dog.

805
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,460
- Is that Acchan?
- Yes.

806
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,751
Here. Pay your father's bail.

807
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:41,751
Grab it. Get your sister married.

808
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:44,293
Grab it.

809
00:54:44,293 --> 00:54:45,668
Watch it.

810
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,793
Guddu, there's still
some jokers around.

811
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:53,543
Push them under the bus.

812
00:54:54,126 --> 00:54:56,085
Guddu, hold on tight.

813
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:58,418
Pull the banner.

814
00:55:08,168 --> 00:55:09,626
Got them all.

815
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:15,668
Stop the car.

816
00:55:16,918 --> 00:55:19,293
- Pull over.
- Babita, what are you doing?

817
00:55:23,376 --> 00:55:26,460
What happened?
What's going on?

818
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,668
Babita Kumari's car has stopped.

819
00:55:29,043 --> 00:55:30,126
Her car?

820
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,126
She's coming out.

821
00:55:32,126 --> 00:55:33,418
- Out?
- Yes.

822
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:37,751
Guddu, she's calling me.

823
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:41,001
- God! But why?
- How would I know why?

824
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,751
Go!

825
00:56:13,126 --> 00:56:14,418
Do you love me?

826
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:20,168
Do you love me?

827
00:56:22,043 --> 00:56:23,376
Love you too.

828
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,710
I loved him.

829
00:56:30,501 --> 00:56:33,210
But I guess all you men
just have that...

830
00:56:33,501 --> 00:56:36,168
...cheating gene in your DNA.

831
00:56:36,585 --> 00:56:37,585
No, no...

832
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:40,751
I like you in shorts,
I like you in jeans too.

833
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,001
Same, same.

834
00:56:42,293 --> 00:56:46,210
- I want to kill all you bloody men.
- No kill, Babitaji.

835
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:48,293
Already dead, dead.

836
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,001
Go back to your pathetic life...

837
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:05,251
...in your pathetic town
and spend the rest of your life...

838
00:57:05,751 --> 00:57:09,126
...telling everyone that
Babita Kumari kissed you.

839
00:57:09,918 --> 00:57:12,168
No one will believe you.

840
00:57:13,835 --> 00:57:16,626
No one will ever believe you.

841
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:24,210
No one will ever believe me
that I loved him so much.

842
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:30,960
So much that I'm crying
for that pathetic man.

843
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,376
I'm crying for...

844
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:36,751
I hate myself.

845
00:57:37,085 --> 00:57:38,460
I hate myself...

846
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:40,876
Babita.

847
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:43,668
- Bauua!
- Come. Easy, easy.

848
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,710
Bauua.

849
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:48,376
You left me alone in the dark.

850
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,501
Where's Bauua?
Has she taken him away?

851
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,626
Guddu.

852
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,210
Babita kissed me.

853
00:58:02,251 --> 00:58:07,626
Your mother never kissed your father.
Why would Babita kiss you?

854
00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:09,335
I swear!

855
00:58:09,626 --> 00:58:14,210
She kissed me passionately.
The kiss lasted three seconds.

856
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:19,251
O people of the world!

857
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:23,001
You have never respected me.

858
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:26,460
"Look, there goes the dwarf,
here comes the dwarf."

859
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,793
Today Babita Kumari kissed the dwarf.

860
00:58:31,335 --> 00:58:33,335
I'm going to sing a song.

861
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,960
- I'm going to sing a song.
- God forgive us.

862
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:39,668
Don't say such crazy things,
Your Majesty.

863
00:58:39,668 --> 00:58:41,001
You're marrying tomorrow.

864
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:43,376
Maybe it's given you
a brain haemorrhage.

865
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:45,960
It happens before a wedding.
Let's go.

866
00:58:48,168 --> 00:58:50,043
Let me sing first.

867
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:54,960
We're on our way.
The boy looks nice in his photo.

868
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:58,960
He has cute dimples.
What does he do?

869
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:02,418
His father owns a big business.

870
00:59:02,585 --> 00:59:03,918
<i>But, Papa...</i>

871
00:59:04,418 --> 00:59:06,876
...he's a little short.

872
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:09,543
So what?

873
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:11,585
<i>Your granddad was only 5'6".</i>

874
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:13,085
But what a gem.

875
00:59:13,793 --> 00:59:18,501
- Is he tall enough to reach you?
- Yes, he does.

876
00:59:18,501 --> 00:59:21,835
<i>Come, my beloved,
let us meet in the moonlight</i>

877
00:59:21,835 --> 00:59:27,251
<i>Seeing you, the wilderness will turn
to spring</i>

878
00:59:29,668 --> 00:59:33,960
<i>In this rain-soaked night...</i>

879
00:59:39,418 --> 00:59:41,710
"I'll walk this road." My foot.

880
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,751
Guddu, I don't want to get married.

881
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,126
I'm not ready.

882
01:00:05,293 --> 01:00:06,543
Enough, Ashok!

883
01:00:08,668 --> 01:00:09,668
Is this a joke?

884
01:00:09,668 --> 01:00:12,001
You said he was short,
but this short?

885
01:00:12,293 --> 01:00:14,210
You call this short?

886
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,251
Pritpal, do you call this "short?"

887
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:21,293
- He's a dwarf.
- A dwarf!

888
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:25,376
You're a top scientist
and you want to marry him?

889
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:26,626
A dwarf?

890
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:29,960
I'm hardly a Cinderella, Papa.

891
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,418
What can I do if I'm in love
with a dwarf?

892
01:00:33,418 --> 01:00:36,835
You've fallen for a school dropout?

893
01:00:37,168 --> 01:00:41,126
Should I have checked
his school certificate first?

894
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:45,376
I don't have to send him
to Mars, Mummy.

895
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:51,668
Papa.

896
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:58,293
This is the first time
I've met someone...

897
01:00:58,543 --> 01:01:02,751
...who sees me, not my wheelchair.

898
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,835
He talks to me like a human being.

899
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:09,793
He doesn't think:

900
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:13,960
"How does one talk
to a disabled girl?"

901
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,043
He treats me like a normal girl.

902
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,918
- He doesn't pity me, Papa.
- Pity!

903
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,001
A dwarf pitying you?

904
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:29,543
Enough! Are you marrying him?
Or am I?

905
01:01:32,085 --> 01:01:33,085
Papa.

906
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:42,585
OK. Now I want to see everyone
having a good time here.

907
01:01:42,793 --> 01:01:44,293
- DJ!
- Yes ma'am.

908
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:46,335
Let's have a Pashto song.

909
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:48,751
What's Pashto?

910
01:01:50,376 --> 01:01:55,626
- Then play an English song.
- Don't have any English songs.

911
01:01:57,126 --> 01:02:00,710
Play a song in any language.

912
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:02,918
An Afghani song then?

913
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:04,126
Go on, play!

914
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,876
Oh Papa, remember this song?

915
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:10,543
Duffer!

916
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,876
Let me ward off the evil eye...

917
01:02:18,876 --> 01:02:21,418
- ...or you might die.
- Get lost.

918
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:24,293
Your family duped you.

919
01:02:24,293 --> 01:02:26,210
The post office played a trick too.

920
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,168
What's this?

921
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,960
Remember you enrolled for the Babita
dance contest? You're in.

922
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,293
What...

923
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:40,085
Now dance.

924
01:02:54,376 --> 01:02:59,293
<i>I'll say a prayer in your name...</i>

925
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,918
<i>Be it day or night...</i>

926
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,793
- It's nice and cool outside.
- Bauua, come inside.

927
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:20,251
- Bauua.
- What?

928
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:21,835
- Congratulations!
- Fine. Fine.

929
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:25,960
These notes aren't fake.
Give them to me later.

930
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,210
I think you should
take him to America.

931
01:03:29,418 --> 01:03:33,501
- What's up?
- I... Uncle?

932
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:37,376
Go on. You can talk to uncle.

933
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:41,835
Uncle, where's the toilet?

934
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:45,376
Do it anywhere.

935
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:47,543
Go ahead.

936
01:03:47,876 --> 01:03:49,126
He pees in small amounts.

937
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:53,126
Take him to the US.
Charge people to see him.

938
01:04:02,501 --> 01:04:04,585
Come this side.

939
01:04:04,585 --> 01:04:05,710
Come on.

940
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,251
Come on. What are you doing?

941
01:04:15,793 --> 01:04:17,085
Come on.

942
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,418
Hello! Hello!

943
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:27,251
Aunty!

944
01:04:27,668 --> 01:04:28,626
Aunty!

945
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:31,168
- How are you related?
- Her aunt.

946
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,460
Okay, you stay.

947
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:35,376
- And you?
- Her father's brother's...

948
01:04:35,585 --> 01:04:40,543
Out. Anyone who doesn't know
how they're related must go.

949
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,918
"Her father's so-and-so..."
etc won't do. All out!

950
01:04:43,918 --> 01:04:46,418
Kids, go outside.

951
01:04:46,418 --> 01:04:48,835
What are you doing, Bauua?

952
01:04:57,418 --> 01:05:00,376
What I'm about to say,
and what you're about to hear...

953
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:02,501
...only your close relatives...

954
01:05:03,376 --> 01:05:05,543
...will be of help to you.

955
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:13,001
In romance there comes 10 seconds
when a man says: "Let's marry."

956
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:16,710
You and my father didn't give me
those 10 seconds.

957
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:20,293
You visited our house.
2 days later it's done.

958
01:05:20,293 --> 01:05:24,001
The sangeet in 3 days.
All Meerut at my wedding in 4.

959
01:05:24,001 --> 01:05:27,460
Now I stand before you,
a bridegroom.

960
01:05:32,835 --> 01:05:35,543
Are you proposing now?

961
01:05:35,543 --> 01:05:39,168
Proposing? I'm talking
about opposing, Aafia.

962
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:44,335
I'm like the cuckoo.

963
01:05:44,918 --> 01:05:46,543
I can't build my own nest.

964
01:05:46,918 --> 01:05:49,376
I lay eggs in the
nests of other birds.

965
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:53,168
All this, this wedding...

966
01:05:54,043 --> 01:05:55,543
My hands are tied.

967
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,210
I really can't.

968
01:05:57,668 --> 01:06:01,210
You're an American.
Why did you agree to marry me?

969
01:06:01,751 --> 01:06:04,918
I took you for a modern girl.
You drink and all.

970
01:06:05,085 --> 01:06:06,085
But...

971
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,710
How come you suddenly became
the traditional wife?

972
01:06:10,418 --> 01:06:13,751
You'll look odd fasting for the
health of your husband.

973
01:06:17,418 --> 01:06:18,460
Come here.

974
01:06:26,668 --> 01:06:29,668
How old are you, Bauua?

975
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:32,251
38!

976
01:06:32,876 --> 01:06:35,335
- Meaning?
- 39.

977
01:06:37,543 --> 01:06:42,043
In all these 38 years...

978
01:06:42,835 --> 01:06:47,460
...have you found anyone besides me...

979
01:06:48,335 --> 01:06:53,876
...whom you could look in the eye
and talk to?

980
01:06:56,293 --> 01:06:59,668
Everyone towers over you.

981
01:07:01,376 --> 01:07:04,918
How long will you crane your neck?

982
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:09,918
When you can look at me
straight in the eye. And me you.

983
01:07:10,835 --> 01:07:14,293
We're made for each other.

984
01:07:15,085 --> 01:07:19,460
Why be a cuckoo at your age, Bauua?

985
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,001
Build your own nest.

986
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,376
Don't, Aafia. Don't.

987
01:07:28,585 --> 01:07:30,376
My heart can hear you.

988
01:07:31,293 --> 01:07:33,585
But my heart does not hear you.

989
01:07:38,293 --> 01:07:41,626
Control both your hearts.

990
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,710
Have a drink if you need to.

991
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:51,960
Go and sit in the groom's chair.

992
01:07:52,293 --> 01:07:53,460
Don't be scared.

993
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:58,085
The operation will be over
before you know it.

994
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:03,168
But if there's something else,
tell me.

995
01:08:15,376 --> 01:08:16,585
What is this?

996
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,710
I've been selected
for a dance contest.

997
01:08:20,668 --> 01:08:23,126
The winner meets Babita Kumari.

998
01:08:25,543 --> 01:08:26,585
So?

999
01:08:28,043 --> 01:08:31,710
You've hardly been selected
to an Ivy League college.

1000
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:41,418
Babita Kumari kissed me yesterday.

1001
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,626
Look at your height, Bauua.

1002
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:05,168
If Babita kissed you...

1003
01:09:05,168 --> 01:09:08,876
...then I'm carrying
Leonardo DiCaprio's child.

1004
01:09:12,001 --> 01:09:15,710
You've ruined my make-up.
Go!

1005
01:09:17,376 --> 01:09:18,251
You know...

1006
01:09:19,751 --> 01:09:21,960
I was born a cuckoo...

1007
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:24,501
...I'll die as one.

1008
01:09:29,918 --> 01:09:31,710
Don't be sad.

1009
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,626
I'll run away.

1010
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:37,043
I'll run away.

1011
01:09:37,876 --> 01:09:40,376
I'll run away.

1012
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,626
"I'll run away." As if!

1013
01:09:43,335 --> 01:09:46,210
Go, wait outside.

1014
01:09:46,543 --> 01:09:48,210
Go, wait outside.

1015
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:26,043
Small chap, sit down!

1016
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,585
No, brother.

1017
01:10:29,876 --> 01:10:32,710
I'm not staying. No.

1018
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:36,460
- Shall I show you a magic trick?
- What trick?

1019
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,043
- Can you count?
- Yes.

1020
01:10:38,043 --> 01:10:39,835
- So count... one
- One...

1021
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,918
- Two...
- Two...

1022
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:50,418
- Three...
- Three...

1023
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:54,501
Where are you going?

1024
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,960
Stop!

1025
01:11:21,293 --> 01:11:24,043
Damn you, people of Meerut!

1026
01:11:24,668 --> 01:11:25,585
Get lost.

1027
01:11:25,918 --> 01:11:26,835
Stop!

1028
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:29,168
He is gone.

1029
01:11:35,335 --> 01:11:36,835
Where to, mister?

1030
01:11:51,168 --> 01:11:54,710
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

1031
01:12:01,376 --> 01:12:03,710
<i>A man is basically 4'6".</i>

1032
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:06,918
<i>Anything above that is arrogance.</i>

1033
01:12:07,418 --> 01:12:10,293
<i>Babita made me arrogant by kissing me.</i>

1034
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,793
<i>Now I'm a six-footer.</i>

1035
01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:16,585
<i>I've left behind my family,
friends and Aafia.</i>

1036
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:19,626
<i>But Bauua Singh would
never leave behind his courage.</i>

1037
01:12:22,043 --> 01:12:25,251
<i>Bauua Singh has won
five dance rounds...</i>

1038
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:28,918
<i>... by defeating his rivals
and winning their hearts.</i>

1039
01:12:29,293 --> 01:12:32,418
<i>He's through the semi-finals...</i>

1040
01:12:32,418 --> 01:12:37,210
<i>...and now Bauua Singh comes
for the grand finale of the show.</i>

1041
01:12:39,501 --> 01:12:43,293
<i>He will now have to dance
against two contestants.</i>

1042
01:12:50,085 --> 01:12:52,418
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1043
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:56,460
<i>...please welcome Ganesh Acharya...</i>

1044
01:12:57,335 --> 01:13:00,835
<i>...and Remo D'Souza.</i>

1045
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:06,251
<i>Whether Bauua Singh wins
or loses will be decided by...</i>

1046
01:13:07,001 --> 01:13:09,960
<i>...yes,
my friends, I present to you...</i>

1047
01:13:10,251 --> 01:13:13,335
<i>...the glory of "Dabangg, "
the life of "Tiger"...</i>

1048
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:16,085
<i>...Salman Khan!</i>

1049
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:27,251
<i>Towers over all others.</i>

1050
01:13:39,585 --> 01:13:42,626
<i>I drank the nectar of love...</i>

1051
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,043
<i>...and lost all sense of reason</i>

1052
01:13:46,043 --> 01:13:49,293
<i>I am the great lover...</i>

1053
01:13:49,543 --> 01:13:52,543
<i>...let no one come in my way</i>

1054
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:59,043
<i>The look in her eyes
makes my head spin</i>

1055
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,501
<i>Since she became mine...</i>

1056
01:14:02,793 --> 01:14:06,168
<i>...the world seems full of lovers</i>

1057
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,126
<i>I swear</i>

1058
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:09,501
<i>By God</i>

1059
01:14:09,793 --> 01:14:16,085
<i>My heart has been taken over by love</i>

1060
01:14:16,335 --> 01:14:22,793
<i>My heart has been taken over by love</i>

1061
01:14:50,418 --> 01:14:52,460
<i>How would you know...</i>

1062
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:56,793
<i>... where the bird of love
flies in the sky?</i>

1063
01:14:56,793 --> 01:15:00,418
<i>My love is like a shadow...</i>

1064
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:03,168
<i>...falling wherever it pleases</i>

1065
01:15:03,418 --> 01:15:09,918
<i>Love pierces your heart
with the sharpest dagger</i>

1066
01:15:09,918 --> 01:15:12,335
<i>When the pain increases...</i>

1067
01:15:12,335 --> 01:15:16,626
<i>...then living life
is more pleasurable</i>

1068
01:15:16,626 --> 01:15:20,626
<i>Our meeting is so unique</i>

1069
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:26,585
<i>Our meeting is so unique</i>

1070
01:15:27,251 --> 01:15:29,960
<i>He's a wave, I am water</i>

1071
01:15:30,585 --> 01:15:36,793
<i>You are the river. I am the shore.
The waves roll my way</i>

1072
01:15:37,501 --> 01:15:44,085
<i>My heart has been taken over by love</i>

1073
01:15:58,293 --> 01:16:00,168
<i>I love her deeply</i>

1074
01:16:01,543 --> 01:16:04,085
<i>She loves me deeply</i>

1075
01:16:04,876 --> 01:16:07,876
<i>I can't live without her</i>

1076
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:11,043
<i>She's incomplete without me</i>

1077
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:14,710
<i>I'll make her turn away from you</i>

1078
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:17,960
<i>You may be her yes-man,
but she won't listen to you</i>

1079
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:21,293
<i>She has so many admirers,
how could she care for you?</i>

1080
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:24,585
<i>You're not tall enough
to have big dreams</i>

1081
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:28,043
<i>You've become too big
for your boots</i>

1082
01:16:28,043 --> 01:16:31,335
<i>You're a crazy Indian,
she's a foreign fairy</i>

1083
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:34,668
<i>For me only love counts...</i>

1084
01:16:34,668 --> 01:16:37,668
<i>...that's why I'm an Indian lad,
and she's a foreign lass</i>

1085
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:41,043
<i>You've won my heart
with your words</i>

1086
01:16:41,251 --> 01:16:44,335
<i>Let's be friends,
let's shake hands</i>

1087
01:16:44,585 --> 01:16:47,668
<i>Let's be friends,</i>

1088
01:16:48,585 --> 01:16:52,501
<i>Let's shake hands</i>

1089
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:06,918
Once more! Once more...!

1090
01:17:38,918 --> 01:17:40,085
Aafia!

1091
01:17:42,335 --> 01:17:43,585
Babita!

1092
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:45,793
Babita!

1093
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,335
OK, listen, I'm here.

1094
01:17:54,668 --> 01:17:57,376
Call you later. Bye.

1095
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,668
Mind your strap, babe!

1096
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,960
Sweetheart, that's why
they come to see me.

1097
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,710
Babita Kumari can't control herself.
Or her clothes.

1098
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:13,668
"Wardrobe malfunction
at her own party!"

1099
01:18:16,335 --> 01:18:17,835
Let them enjoy!

1100
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:53,168
"Your eyes are full of pain."

1101
01:18:53,626 --> 01:18:54,543
Excuse me?

1102
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:56,251
Did he say that to you?

1103
01:18:57,543 --> 01:18:59,418
"I have a complaint.

1104
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,376
"Why haven't we met before?"

1105
01:19:03,668 --> 01:19:05,085
Did he tell you?

1106
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:08,210
Tell me.

1107
01:19:14,418 --> 01:19:16,543
Did he ask you to sit on his lap?

1108
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,960
- What are you doing, babes?
- Let go!

1109
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:20,835
Stop it.

1110
01:19:20,835 --> 01:19:24,376
Vinod, get me a drink.

1111
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:25,793
Let's go.

1112
01:19:30,793 --> 01:19:33,085
One fine day he just got bald.

1113
01:19:33,085 --> 01:19:35,126
But he looks so funny bald!

1114
01:19:36,085 --> 01:19:38,293
- Hi, ma'am.
- How are you?

1115
01:19:38,293 --> 01:19:41,335
"Four lamps always
burning at your alter."

1116
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:43,418
"And I am the fifth..."

1117
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,210
Hurry, Bauua.
Madam is on her way.

1118
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:48,751
- What is this?
- Hurry up.

1119
01:19:50,126 --> 01:19:52,626
- Keep moving.
- Let me finish eating.

1120
01:19:53,668 --> 01:19:54,793
There she is.

1121
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,960
Bring her here.

1122
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:00,460
Another tacky party.

1123
01:20:01,918 --> 01:20:03,460
You are drinking.

1124
01:20:04,126 --> 01:20:05,710
You must meet him.

1125
01:20:05,918 --> 01:20:09,835
- What is it? Who must I meet?
- The winner of the dance contest.

1126
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:20,710
Don't worry.

1127
01:20:21,168 --> 01:20:22,710
You look fine.

1128
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:25,251
Hi. Babita Kumari.

1129
01:20:25,876 --> 01:20:28,085
Bauua Singh from Meerut,
Uttar Pradesh.

1130
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,126
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

1131
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:34,918
I've known you for 15 years.

1132
01:20:35,085 --> 01:20:37,918
Yes, we've met. In Meerut.

1133
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:39,918
Don't remember.

1134
01:20:40,918 --> 01:20:44,251
Congratulations on winning
the dance competition.

1135
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:45,960
Keep watching my films.

1136
01:20:54,876 --> 01:20:56,960
Was I drunk in Meerut?

1137
01:20:58,835 --> 01:21:00,251
Not that drunk.

1138
01:21:02,168 --> 01:21:03,960
Did I kiss you?

1139
01:21:05,835 --> 01:21:09,043
No way! Meerut guys aren't that lucky.

1140
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,835
I do crazy things when I'm drunk.

1141
01:21:19,585 --> 01:21:20,585
Good.

1142
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,543
It's all good.

1143
01:21:22,835 --> 01:21:24,543
Ladies and gentlemen!

1144
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,918
You're all such important people.

1145
01:21:27,085 --> 01:21:30,668
You have travelled the world
and seen so much.

1146
01:21:30,668 --> 01:21:32,626
But it's the first time you'll see...

1147
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:36,751
...a dwarf plucking stars
from the sky.

1148
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:40,793
This boy's not on my team.

1149
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,793
If he messes up, don't cut my share.

1150
01:21:43,793 --> 01:21:45,876
- Ok.
- I just play the music.

1151
01:21:46,126 --> 01:21:48,335
OK. Start!

1152
01:21:55,626 --> 01:21:57,751
Come, madam,
let me show you magic.

1153
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:01,293
Ladies, gather round.
The show is for you.

1154
01:22:04,251 --> 01:22:05,460
Come, ladies.

1155
01:22:05,751 --> 01:22:09,168
I've always encouraged new talent.

1156
01:22:09,835 --> 01:22:11,710
Show us your star-plucking.

1157
01:22:12,668 --> 01:22:14,126
You recognise talent.

1158
01:22:14,126 --> 01:22:16,376
Talent knows talent.

1159
01:22:16,376 --> 01:22:18,126
I'll show you some magic.

1160
01:22:18,418 --> 01:22:21,043
Let's see your magic.

1161
01:22:21,543 --> 01:22:22,710
Kajol! Hi!

1162
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:24,626
Wait for us.

1163
01:22:24,835 --> 01:22:27,335
Hey you...

1164
01:22:28,793 --> 01:22:32,293
Srideviji, you look wonderful.

1165
01:22:32,293 --> 01:22:35,626
Some guy here is promising
to pluck stars like you!

1166
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:37,293
Bye.

1167
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:40,876
You're a newly-wed.

1168
01:22:40,876 --> 01:22:43,210
My gift to you.
Watch the stars fall.

1169
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:44,085
Ready.

1170
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:45,210
Do you think he can do it?

1171
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,918
Long live the Goddess!

1172
01:22:49,585 --> 01:22:52,335
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1173
01:22:58,376 --> 01:23:00,960
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1174
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:06,085
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1175
01:23:10,293 --> 01:23:13,001
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1176
01:23:13,501 --> 01:23:15,418
Come on! What's going on?

1177
01:23:15,918 --> 01:23:19,168
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1178
01:23:20,543 --> 01:23:21,710
Its happening.

1179
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:23,376
It takes time.

1180
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:25,626
Take your time.

1181
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:30,210
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1182
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:33,126
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1183
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,126
Come on!

1184
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:45,251
- This is a new city, that's why.
- Maybe they've fallen in Meerut.

1185
01:23:45,251 --> 01:23:47,418
Forget Meerut.
I can do it here.

1186
01:23:47,418 --> 01:23:50,835
Just watch.
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1187
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:53,668
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1188
01:23:54,168 --> 01:23:56,168
Ten... nine... eight... zero.

1189
01:23:56,168 --> 01:23:57,210
Let it be.

1190
01:23:57,501 --> 01:23:59,335
You're not that talented.

1191
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:03,001
Madam, give me another minute.

1192
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:05,085
- Maybe next time.
- Please wait.

1193
01:24:05,751 --> 01:24:09,043
You haven't take a selfie.
Take one.

1194
01:24:10,043 --> 01:24:11,668
- What's "oui, oui"?
- Bye.

1195
01:24:12,043 --> 01:24:13,335
Why are you laughing?

1196
01:24:13,335 --> 01:24:14,626
It's fine. Next time.

1197
01:24:14,626 --> 01:24:16,126
I'm going tomorrow.

1198
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:19,001
- The moon.
- The moon?

1199
01:24:19,001 --> 01:24:21,418
- Tried the moon?
- Only the stars...

1200
01:24:22,418 --> 01:24:24,126
Your wedding is over.

1201
01:24:25,418 --> 01:24:26,460
But...

1202
01:24:27,251 --> 01:24:29,710
Ten... nine... eight...

1203
01:24:34,543 --> 01:24:35,626
What's wrong?

1204
01:24:37,126 --> 01:24:40,126
First time you've been humiliated
in public?

1205
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:42,626
Is that why you're sad?

1206
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,626
Bauua Singh from Meerut, U.P.

1207
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:51,501
The stars used to listen to me,
Babita.

1208
01:24:51,751 --> 01:24:53,876
I don't know what's wrong.

1209
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:56,543
Of course they listen.

1210
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:01,710
Whose heart did you break, Shorty?

1211
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:05,751
Yours or hers...

1212
01:25:06,168 --> 01:25:08,210
...or all the hearts in Meerut?

1213
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:12,126
Correct?

1214
01:25:12,126 --> 01:25:14,585
They're only stars, Shorty.

1215
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:19,210
That naughty used to say if I just
looked at him...

1216
01:25:19,626 --> 01:25:21,918
...the ground would slip away.

1217
01:25:23,335 --> 01:25:24,335
Rubbish!

1218
01:25:25,168 --> 01:25:28,126
I can't even put down
this wine glass.

1219
01:25:28,376 --> 01:25:32,251
It's been two months and it's
still glued to my hand.

1220
01:25:33,668 --> 01:25:40,543
Shorty, when a heart breaks
even a wretched dog doesn't hear it.

1221
01:25:41,626 --> 01:25:44,085
At least your stars have dignity.

1222
01:25:46,043 --> 01:25:46,876
Wow!

1223
01:25:47,168 --> 01:25:48,751
Now that's a good line!

1224
01:25:48,751 --> 01:25:51,001
Shall I walk you out?

1225
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:54,251
Is someone like you going
to walk out on me too?

1226
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:56,501
I've left the world for you.

1227
01:25:56,668 --> 01:25:59,835
Just say the word.
I'll stay glued to you forever.

1228
01:26:00,668 --> 01:26:02,751
Say something new.

1229
01:26:02,751 --> 01:26:05,460
That's a line from my old film.

1230
01:26:05,918 --> 01:26:07,293
You're broken hearted.

1231
01:26:07,293 --> 01:26:10,043
Keep me by your side,
I'll amuse you.

1232
01:26:10,043 --> 01:26:12,710
I'll make you laugh at
least 25 times a day. Promise.

1233
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,626
Laughing isn't all I want.
It's not important.

1234
01:26:15,626 --> 01:26:16,418
Then, I will not laugh.

1235
01:26:16,418 --> 01:26:20,126
I can advise you on what to wear;
the matching lipstick.

1236
01:26:20,126 --> 01:26:23,793
I already pay ten people to do that.

1237
01:26:23,793 --> 01:26:27,543
If you're that smart,
why is your heart broken so often?

1238
01:26:27,543 --> 01:26:31,085
Babita, you understand
the world but not people.

1239
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:32,293
And you do?

1240
01:26:32,293 --> 01:26:36,751
I can tell the annual budget just
by looking at the Finance Minister!

1241
01:26:37,501 --> 01:26:39,293
My specialty!

1242
01:26:39,751 --> 01:26:42,043
That's useful.

1243
01:26:42,793 --> 01:26:46,710
Let me decide if I want you
glued to me.

1244
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:51,710
Come to the shoot tomorrow.

1245
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:58,293
- And this director?
- An idiot.

1246
01:26:59,668 --> 01:27:02,751
- That one?
- Shrewd, a sharpie.

1247
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:05,585
Hi!

1248
01:27:09,626 --> 01:27:11,960
Is she a friend or foe?

1249
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:14,918
Neither.

1250
01:27:15,168 --> 01:27:18,210
She couldn't care less
if you lived or died.

1251
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:22,501
<i>The gangsters are circling
the heroine.</i>

1252
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:24,293
<i>And him?</i>

1253
01:27:24,293 --> 01:27:27,460
<i>Why does he take my breath away?</i>

1254
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:31,501
<i>Because he's a pillow girls love
smothering their faces in.</i>

1255
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:36,085
<i>He pretends to be a poet.
Misunderstood by the world.</i>

1256
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,335
<i>- But he's a mother...!
- Enough.</i>

1257
01:27:39,293 --> 01:27:40,043
Listen.

1258
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:47,126
Ma'am, shot's ready.

1259
01:27:48,835 --> 01:27:49,835
The shot's ready.

1260
01:27:50,918 --> 01:27:53,293
Not ready, son. It's a wrap.

1261
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:54,543
Let's go.

1262
01:27:55,835 --> 01:27:57,460
It's a wrap!

1263
01:27:58,126 --> 01:28:00,460
Bauua, want a drink?

1264
01:28:01,626 --> 01:28:04,085
What's today? Wednesday?

1265
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:05,876
OK, I'll drink.

1266
01:28:06,376 --> 01:28:08,585
Come. Close the door.

1267
01:28:08,585 --> 01:28:12,418
I'm plain unlucky.
Falling in love with a mother...!

1268
01:28:12,418 --> 01:28:14,751
Enough! Let's throw up together.

1269
01:28:14,918 --> 01:28:16,585
It's coming.

1270
01:28:16,793 --> 01:28:19,835
There comes the corn!

1271
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:25,001
In Uttar Pradesh,
people think you're an angel.

1272
01:28:25,501 --> 01:28:28,001
That you sprout wings
behind closed doors.

1273
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:32,085
Your name may not matter to you here,
but keep your honour in my town.

1274
01:28:32,293 --> 01:28:34,876
Get over that man.

1275
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,501
He's a cheap guava...

1276
01:28:38,251 --> 01:28:41,460
...and you're a pricey Kashmiri apple.

1277
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,626
I mean it.

1278
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:47,918
You're right.

1279
01:28:49,085 --> 01:28:50,501
A pricey...

1280
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:54,001
...Kashmiri apple.

1281
01:28:54,335 --> 01:28:55,710
With wings!

1282
01:28:55,918 --> 01:28:57,043
Come on.

1283
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:01,293
Action!

1284
01:29:02,376 --> 01:29:04,085
<i>Do you have a large family?</i>

1285
01:29:04,543 --> 01:29:06,835
<i>All Meerut belongs to me!</i>

1286
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:12,668
<i>At home there's Ma, Papa,
my younger brother, his wife and...</i>

1287
01:29:12,668 --> 01:29:15,751
<i>- And?
- And Aafia.</i>

1288
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:17,668
<i>Aafia? Who's Aafia?</i>

1289
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,585
<i>This fantastic girl.</i>

1290
01:29:21,126 --> 01:29:24,126
<i>Good thing the Goddess
put her in a wheelchair...</i>

1291
01:29:24,126 --> 01:29:26,543
<i>...or she'd be flying in the air.</i>

1292
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,710
<i>She's as honest as I'm dishonest.</i>

1293
01:29:30,585 --> 01:29:34,001
<i>She was the only one, apart from
my mother, who loved me.</i>

1294
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:38,543
<i>I ran away, leaving her in tears.</i>

1295
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:41,501
Why? Did a mad dog bite you?

1296
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:44,835
Not a dog.
My dishonesty bit me.

1297
01:29:45,751 --> 01:29:49,376
Then one night India's queen
kissed me.

1298
01:29:49,376 --> 01:29:51,460
Want a slap? Move your foot!

1299
01:29:53,126 --> 01:29:55,251
You've got long legs... please.

1300
01:29:59,168 --> 01:30:00,668
<i>So you forgot Aafia?</i>

1301
01:30:01,251 --> 01:30:04,210
<i>Don't you miss her?
Why are you here?</i>

1302
01:30:05,126 --> 01:30:06,168
Because of you.

1303
01:30:06,751 --> 01:30:08,501
<i>I do miss her...</i>

1304
01:30:08,793 --> 01:30:12,501
<i>...but I scold myself and say,
"I don't miss her."</i>

1305
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:15,835
<i>How long will you keep
scolding yourself?</i>

1306
01:30:17,626 --> 01:30:19,835
Do you know why I've kept you?

1307
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:24,335
Because I'm so cute.
All the girls fall for me.

1308
01:30:24,626 --> 01:30:26,251
They love my dimples.

1309
01:30:27,668 --> 01:30:28,210
Cute!

1310
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:30,293
- Think I don't know that?
- So, why?

1311
01:30:30,668 --> 01:30:32,418
Because my parents were dwarves.

1312
01:30:35,126 --> 01:30:36,126
Dwarves?

1313
01:30:37,751 --> 01:30:41,793
They looked fine in the Google photo.
You're kidding.

1314
01:30:41,793 --> 01:30:43,293
They aren't my real parents.

1315
01:30:44,168 --> 01:30:45,960
I met them outside a temple.

1316
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:48,210
My parents were dwarves.

1317
01:30:50,626 --> 01:30:53,168
They worked in a circus in Kolkata.

1318
01:30:54,001 --> 01:30:56,418
My mother was bought
from a Russian circus.

1319
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:59,376
And my father was a Punjabi.
Both dwarves.

1320
01:31:00,126 --> 01:31:01,210
Amazing.

1321
01:31:01,585 --> 01:31:05,043
Papa was a lion tamer,
Mummy a trapeze artist.

1322
01:31:06,126 --> 01:31:06,876
Then?

1323
01:31:06,876 --> 01:31:11,835
They fell deeply in love
with each other. They got married.

1324
01:31:12,793 --> 01:31:14,376
When my mother was pregnant...

1325
01:31:14,376 --> 01:31:16,876
...the circus-owner's daughter
fell in love with Papa.

1326
01:31:19,001 --> 01:31:21,543
- Was she a dwarf?
- No, she was normal.

1327
01:31:22,501 --> 01:31:27,126
She seduced Papa, so he dumped
my mother and they eloped.

1328
01:31:31,001 --> 01:31:33,918
- Then?
- They say she took him to Belarus.

1329
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:39,668
They were together for a while
then she dumped Papa.

1330
01:31:40,126 --> 01:31:41,210
I heard...

1331
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:45,293
...she fell in love with a Prince
from Madagascar.

1332
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:46,668
Then?

1333
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:49,751
She sold father in an Egyptian market.

1334
01:31:50,126 --> 01:31:53,085
Good heavens. Then?

1335
01:31:53,335 --> 01:31:56,335
He worked in a circus in Egypt
for ten years.

1336
01:31:56,543 --> 01:31:59,001
Then he ran away to Yemen...

1337
01:31:59,335 --> 01:32:00,668
...and worked in an oil well.

1338
01:32:00,876 --> 01:32:02,376
People who knew him said...

1339
01:32:02,376 --> 01:32:05,251
...he loved my mother till the end.

1340
01:32:06,043 --> 01:32:09,793
When he died he had a smile
on his lips and my mother's name...

1341
01:32:10,168 --> 01:32:11,126
...Alina.

1342
01:32:11,418 --> 01:32:14,543
He loved her! Utter rubbish!

1343
01:32:14,543 --> 01:32:16,710
Why didn't he go back to your mother?

1344
01:32:17,626 --> 01:32:20,251
She was dead by then.

1345
01:32:26,918 --> 01:32:28,793
When did she die?

1346
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:32,001
By the time he returned to
Kolkata, 20 years later...

1347
01:32:32,543 --> 01:32:34,085
...she was already dead.

1348
01:32:34,418 --> 01:32:38,876
Why didn't he go back to her sooner?
To Alina?

1349
01:32:38,876 --> 01:32:41,210
My mother had remarried by then.

1350
01:32:43,335 --> 01:32:45,085
To a dwarf?

1351
01:32:45,085 --> 01:32:46,710
No, he was normal.

1352
01:32:47,293 --> 01:32:49,126
Must they all marry normal people?

1353
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,751
- When did she remarry?
- 6 years after Papa...

1354
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,501
...had left, I guess.

1355
01:32:57,626 --> 01:33:00,293
Why didn't he return to Alina
in all those years?

1356
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:04,001
If he loved her, surely
he would have gone back.

1357
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:05,543
He should've.

1358
01:33:07,001 --> 01:33:07,918
Why didn't he?

1359
01:33:09,043 --> 01:33:09,835
You tell me.

1360
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:13,960
When people love each other
why don't they stay together?

1361
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:15,751
Tell me.

1362
01:33:21,668 --> 01:33:23,960
Stop the car. I have to pee.

1363
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:26,085
I must pee.

1364
01:33:35,418 --> 01:33:38,501
Sorry, madam. But your mother lives
on 12th Road in Bandra.

1365
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:41,210
But he doesn't know that!

1366
01:33:41,793 --> 01:33:45,835
I was narrating the story
of my next film. How is it?

1367
01:33:45,835 --> 01:33:48,210
It's a horror, madam,
but very good.

1368
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,293
Today we're filming
the most important scene.

1369
01:33:53,293 --> 01:33:57,418
She's made us wait two hours.
Bauua, persuade her to come.

1370
01:33:57,418 --> 01:33:59,918
I'll go and check.

1371
01:34:22,835 --> 01:34:24,043
OK, hon.

1372
01:34:26,126 --> 01:34:27,460
I'll call you this evening.

1373
01:34:30,126 --> 01:34:31,293
Hey, buddy.

1374
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:37,418
He begged me to forgive him.
He said he'd never do it again.

1375
01:34:37,793 --> 01:34:40,793
He loves me.
Everyone makes mistake.

1376
01:34:41,585 --> 01:34:43,293
How does this work?

1377
01:35:03,001 --> 01:35:04,043
Cut it!

1378
01:35:16,251 --> 01:35:17,293
Hello?

1379
01:36:07,293 --> 01:36:10,376
- Your girlfriend's robot isn't working.
- It's not a robot. It's a rover.

1380
01:36:10,751 --> 01:36:12,710
It's called Velocity.

1381
01:36:13,626 --> 01:36:17,043
It takes photographs and digs on Mars.

1382
01:36:17,043 --> 01:36:20,626
Sweetheart! You've become
a scientist like Abdul Kalam.

1383
01:36:22,668 --> 01:36:23,793
Aafia built it.

1384
01:36:23,793 --> 01:36:25,793
Either you're blind or I am.

1385
01:36:26,168 --> 01:36:30,960
You're in love with Aafia.
You just can't see it.

1386
01:36:31,335 --> 01:36:32,668
I see it clearly.

1387
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:36,168
Wow! It's looking so nice.

1388
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:39,210
If you know it,
why are you back here?

1389
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,501
Your lover ran away too.

1390
01:36:40,501 --> 01:36:42,626
Yes. But he came back.

1391
01:36:42,626 --> 01:36:45,501
He won't leave you again, will he?

1392
01:36:45,876 --> 01:36:48,460
Stay with him.

1393
01:36:49,126 --> 01:36:51,626
Let's see if your love story
becomes the stuff of legends.

1394
01:36:51,626 --> 01:36:54,251
You bolted. Some love story!

1395
01:36:57,043 --> 01:36:59,501
What has running or staying
got to do with love?

1396
01:36:59,835 --> 01:37:02,960
Even my lust is truer than
other people's love.

1397
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,668
So you admit you love her?

1398
01:37:04,668 --> 01:37:06,168
Did I say I didn't?

1399
01:37:06,835 --> 01:37:09,335
In 38 years... 39...

1400
01:37:09,918 --> 01:37:13,126
...she was the only girl I could
look in the eye and talk to.

1401
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:17,418
They all towered over me.
I had to crane my neck.

1402
01:37:17,751 --> 01:37:20,418
We could look each other
straight in the eye.

1403
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:25,085
If I'd stayed, we would've
been a perfect match.

1404
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,751
Those are her lines.

1405
01:37:29,126 --> 01:37:30,126
And yours?

1406
01:37:30,501 --> 01:37:32,918
My line? "I love you."

1407
01:37:33,501 --> 01:37:36,543
Forget it! Stop lying.

1408
01:37:36,543 --> 01:37:39,418
- Why don't you lie sometimes?
- You won't go back to her?

1409
01:37:40,876 --> 01:37:42,418
You won't let me, will you?

1410
01:37:46,168 --> 01:37:47,335
Go!

1411
01:37:48,543 --> 01:37:49,960
I'm not stopping you.

1412
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:52,293
Send me back.

1413
01:37:53,793 --> 01:37:56,168
For God's sake. Push me away.

1414
01:37:57,293 --> 01:38:01,293
For the sake of your lover,
that dog Aditya Kapoor.

1415
01:38:05,876 --> 01:38:06,835
Please.

1416
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:38,710
Happy birthday to you!

1417
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:42,001
Happy birthday, dear Babita!

1418
01:38:52,168 --> 01:38:53,626
Let me through.

1419
01:38:57,585 --> 01:38:58,710
He's a cheat.

1420
01:38:59,001 --> 01:39:01,835
I saw him kissing that girl.

1421
01:39:02,418 --> 01:39:04,460
What the hell!
He's lying, Babita.

1422
01:39:05,001 --> 01:39:06,793
Me? Lying?

1423
01:39:07,001 --> 01:39:09,876
Admit it! Weren't you kissing him
in the kitchen?

1424
01:39:10,793 --> 01:39:14,251
That was my boyfriend.
I wasn't kissing Aditya.

1425
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,668
Same thing.
Everyone is kissing someone.

1426
01:39:17,876 --> 01:39:19,876
He kissed her, she kissed him.

1427
01:39:20,085 --> 01:39:22,126
She kissed me, I kissed her.

1428
01:39:22,126 --> 01:39:24,793
These two guys kissed that girl
and she kissed someone else.

1429
01:39:27,335 --> 01:39:30,126
I didn't expect this of you.

1430
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:31,293
I swear, by God!

1431
01:39:31,585 --> 01:39:33,793
Bauua Singh ran away for love.

1432
01:39:34,626 --> 01:39:35,460
Honestly.

1433
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:39,335
If he's come back, it's not for love.
He's conning you.

1434
01:39:39,335 --> 01:39:41,001
Babita, how do you bear this guy?

1435
01:39:41,168 --> 01:39:43,501
- For ten months, he's...
- Shut up!

1436
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:46,126
What did you bring for Babita?

1437
01:39:46,335 --> 01:39:50,835
This silly ring? How much was it?

1438
01:39:50,835 --> 01:39:53,418
A million rupees? Two million?

1439
01:39:53,418 --> 01:39:55,585
Let me show you
what I've brought her.

1440
01:39:55,585 --> 01:39:56,418
Look!

1441
01:39:57,335 --> 01:40:00,376
Only for Babita.
Diamonds.

1442
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:02,501
A locket.

1443
01:40:02,876 --> 01:40:04,460
A chain.

1444
01:40:04,626 --> 01:40:06,376
A chocolate.

1445
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:08,460
A birthday card.

1446
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:09,835
Look.

1447
01:40:10,335 --> 01:40:11,543
A ribbon.

1448
01:40:12,501 --> 01:40:15,168
A hair clip.

1449
01:40:15,418 --> 01:40:18,001
An Aadhar ID card.

1450
01:40:18,376 --> 01:40:19,876
Why are you laughing?

1451
01:40:19,876 --> 01:40:23,668
What did you bring?
You've brought her a crappy ring.

1452
01:40:23,876 --> 01:40:26,001
A nasty little ring.

1453
01:40:26,001 --> 01:40:27,668
A mean little ring.

1454
01:40:27,876 --> 01:40:31,543
- Enough!
- Leave my hand.

1455
01:40:31,751 --> 01:40:33,626
- Get out from here!
- Your nasty ring.

1456
01:40:33,626 --> 01:40:36,960
Lover boy! Listen to me.

1457
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,043
Just arrived?
The party's over.

1458
01:40:39,043 --> 01:40:43,460
You lot come here all dolled up,
looking for fun.

1459
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:45,710
You'll drink, you'll blow air kisses.

1460
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:47,793
You love to party.

1461
01:40:47,793 --> 01:40:50,585
- Get out!
- While I love spoiling them.

1462
01:40:51,043 --> 01:40:53,501
Get out! What did you think?

1463
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:56,585
If I bothered to talk to you,
you'd become special for me?

1464
01:40:56,585 --> 01:40:59,543
I spoil you rotten
and you exploit me?

1465
01:40:59,543 --> 01:41:02,876
- Get out!
- Humiliate me some more.

1466
01:41:02,876 --> 01:41:06,251
Or else I'll never leave.
Humiliate me some more.

1467
01:41:06,751 --> 01:41:09,168
- You're a zero, Bauua Singh!
- Humiliate me more.

1468
01:41:09,168 --> 01:41:12,668
You're nothing. You have zero status.
Your wheelchair girl is zero.

1469
01:41:12,668 --> 01:41:14,751
You'll achieve nothing.

1470
01:41:14,751 --> 01:41:17,418
Be with her but you'll still be zero.

1471
01:41:17,418 --> 01:41:21,168
- Don't hold back, Babita.
- Go home, Bauua.

1472
01:41:21,501 --> 01:41:24,751
This time tell the people
of Meerut that...

1473
01:41:24,751 --> 01:41:28,251
...Babita Kumari kicked you
out of her house.

1474
01:41:28,585 --> 01:41:31,043
Your wheelchair girl
didn't believe I kissed you...

1475
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:32,710
...but she'll believe I threw you out.

1476
01:41:32,918 --> 01:41:37,418
- You're nearly there. A little more.
- I'm done with you.

1477
01:41:37,626 --> 01:41:41,751
Want to be disgraced some more?
Go jump in the lake. Out!

1478
01:41:45,668 --> 01:41:46,501
Done?

1479
01:41:52,543 --> 01:41:54,001
Thank you, Babita.

1480
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:07,876
Who's the celebrity?

1481
01:42:16,876 --> 01:42:17,960
Thank you, fans.

1482
01:42:18,585 --> 01:42:19,585
Sir... sir...

1483
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:36,585
Hello, everyone. Party's over.

1484
01:42:36,585 --> 01:42:38,501
DJ! Stop the music!

1485
01:42:39,126 --> 01:42:42,418
Put all the plates,
glasses and bottles...

1486
01:42:42,668 --> 01:42:44,460
...in the kitchen.

1487
01:42:44,668 --> 01:42:47,960
Hey, Aunty! Wake up. Very good.

1488
01:42:49,126 --> 01:42:51,585
What are you waiting for?

1489
01:43:00,126 --> 01:43:01,626
Mr. Kapoor...

1490
01:43:03,418 --> 01:43:05,876
- ...did you drive here?
- Yes, why?

1491
01:43:06,168 --> 01:43:07,585
You'd better go.

1492
01:43:08,751 --> 01:43:10,751
Leave your glass in the sink.

1493
01:43:13,543 --> 01:43:14,960
Take her with you.

1494
01:43:16,751 --> 01:43:19,085
Baby wants to party some more.

1495
01:43:19,293 --> 01:43:20,751
What are you up to?

1496
01:43:24,585 --> 01:43:27,710
I'm asking you to get out.
Politely.

1497
01:43:29,376 --> 01:43:31,918
Should I say it some other way?

1498
01:43:32,293 --> 01:43:35,085
You know another way?

1499
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:39,585
Who do you think you are?

1500
01:43:41,751 --> 01:43:42,793
An angel!

1501
01:43:43,335 --> 01:43:45,585
I sprout wings behind closed doors.

1502
01:43:47,126 --> 01:43:50,376
I can't break every heart
in this country for your sake.

1503
01:44:07,626 --> 01:44:08,251
Hello.

1504
01:44:08,251 --> 01:44:10,585
Guddu, where are you?

1505
01:44:10,751 --> 01:44:13,668
As far as I remember you ran off
a year ago. I'm still here.

1506
01:44:13,668 --> 01:44:17,626
- Want to go to America?
- Muslims get visas? Take me then.

1507
01:44:17,835 --> 01:44:21,210
Done. Bring my passport with you
and meet me in Mumbai.

1508
01:44:21,543 --> 01:44:22,543
OK.

1509
01:44:22,543 --> 01:44:23,751
- Listen.
- Yes?

1510
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:24,918
Bro...

1511
01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:30,876
...the bride for me?
She's the previous girl.

1512
01:44:32,501 --> 01:44:33,210
Yes.

1513
01:44:36,543 --> 01:44:38,126
Aafia!

1514
01:44:40,585 --> 01:44:43,585
- Bablu, what's that dye?
- Henna.

1515
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:48,085
Forget the henna. Make me blonde.

1516
01:44:49,418 --> 01:44:50,418
Full blonde!

1517
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:01,585
- Bauua Singh?
- Present.

1518
01:45:02,168 --> 01:45:04,126
They want to take my photo.

1519
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,001
Look here, please.

1520
01:45:08,501 --> 01:45:10,335
Whoever we choose...

1521
01:45:10,335 --> 01:45:13,501
...will be asleep
on his journey to Mars.

1522
01:45:14,043 --> 01:45:17,585
Believe me, this will be so simple...

1523
01:45:17,585 --> 01:45:22,335
...that we can even prepare
a chimpanzee to do this.

1524
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:27,793
And that's exactly what we've done.

1525
01:45:29,626 --> 01:45:33,168
You think this is a joke.

1526
01:45:33,376 --> 01:45:38,251
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me present...

1527
01:45:40,001 --> 01:45:40,793
...Indya.

1528
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:44,668
Come, come.

1529
01:45:48,668 --> 01:45:49,710
Come, come.

1530
01:46:01,293 --> 01:46:03,835
- Hope you're not scared, Guddu?
- Why should I be?

1531
01:46:04,043 --> 01:46:06,543
They didn't arrest me at the airport.

1532
01:46:06,543 --> 01:46:08,960
Can they arrest me here?

1533
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,751
Forget them.
You're scared of seeing Aafia again.

1534
01:46:13,001 --> 01:46:14,501
Why would I be scared? You should be.

1535
01:46:14,751 --> 01:46:16,501
Who ran after Babita? Me? Or you?

1536
01:46:16,501 --> 01:46:19,376
It'll be fine. I'll make it all right.

1537
01:46:19,376 --> 01:46:23,293
How long can Aafia be mad at me?
10, 15, 30 minutes?

1538
01:46:23,918 --> 01:46:27,335
Long live the Goddess!

1539
01:46:28,418 --> 01:46:29,376
What's that?

1540
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:31,543
Fake tears?

1541
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:32,668
It's love.

1542
01:46:35,585 --> 01:46:37,043
Do they bottle love now?

1543
01:46:37,293 --> 01:46:42,418
Indya has an experience
of over two hundred hours...

1544
01:46:42,418 --> 01:46:46,751
...working underwater on a module
of an international space station.

1545
01:46:47,085 --> 01:46:54,585
He can endure the zero G pressure
as much as our working astronauts.

1546
01:46:54,585 --> 01:47:02,168
He's fully trained to drive a vehicle
on the Martian surface.

1547
01:47:02,168 --> 01:47:08,168
And the best part
is Indya loves sleeping.

1548
01:47:10,251 --> 01:47:11,501
What she's saying?

1549
01:47:12,918 --> 01:47:16,293
- Something about Mars.
- Is she an astrologer?

1550
01:47:16,585 --> 01:47:18,751
...a monkey is a better idea...

1551
01:47:18,751 --> 01:47:23,626
...than getting extinct and starting
from a chimp again!

1552
01:47:44,585 --> 01:47:46,751
Indya, no.

1553
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:49,960
- What's going on?
- The monkey's gone nuts.

1554
01:47:51,293 --> 01:47:52,376
Indya, no.

1555
01:47:55,793 --> 01:47:56,876
Stop!

1556
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:02,043
Indya, no.

1557
01:48:03,043 --> 01:48:08,918
<i>If you promise to stay by my side...</i>

1558
01:48:09,168 --> 01:48:14,543
<i>...I will sing lovely songs to you</i>

1559
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:30,751
<i>If you look at me and smile...</i>

1560
01:48:31,043 --> 01:48:32,960
<i>I will...</i>

1561
01:48:35,085 --> 01:48:37,376
- What was that?
- A gunshot.

1562
01:48:37,376 --> 01:48:39,043
- Who fired?
- Aafia.

1563
01:48:39,043 --> 01:48:41,418
- How?
- She has a gun.

1564
01:48:42,376 --> 01:48:44,251
- She's just scaring me.
- Scaring you?

1565
01:48:44,251 --> 01:48:46,168
Her hands shake.
That's why you're alive.

1566
01:48:46,418 --> 01:48:49,168
We mustn't be scared.
We must be brave.

1567
01:48:49,168 --> 01:48:50,835
We? You must.

1568
01:48:50,835 --> 01:48:53,168
I paid Club Class for you to sightsee?

1569
01:48:53,168 --> 01:48:55,335
Come on get up. Go ahead.

1570
01:48:55,668 --> 01:48:58,543
Careful. She has five bullets left.

1571
01:48:58,751 --> 01:49:00,918
- You blind bat! I know how to count.
- Get up!

1572
01:49:02,918 --> 01:49:11,710
<i>I saw you...</i>

1573
01:49:12,376 --> 01:49:18,293
<i>...and my eyes refused to turn away</i>

1574
01:49:23,043 --> 01:49:24,710
How you've changed, Aafia.

1575
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:26,543
Want a slap?

1576
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,460
How dare you come here?
Get out!

1577
01:49:29,751 --> 01:49:30,793
Out!

1578
01:49:30,793 --> 01:49:33,751
I don't need permission
to meet my wife, Papa.

1579
01:49:33,918 --> 01:49:35,835
Papa?

1580
01:49:36,168 --> 01:49:38,001
Ismail, throw this fellow out.

1581
01:49:38,001 --> 01:49:39,626
Don't touch me.

1582
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,668
Stop! I am holding a baby.

1583
01:49:41,668 --> 01:49:44,501
Get back, Ismail.
Let me talk to her.

1584
01:49:44,793 --> 01:49:46,001
Let me talk to her.

1585
01:49:46,210 --> 01:49:48,960
Aafia, I made a mistake. Forgive me.

1586
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:51,085
I'm not a cuckoo. I'm a crow.

1587
01:49:51,376 --> 01:49:52,460
Forgive me.

1588
01:49:52,793 --> 01:49:55,876
I will caw around you all my life.

1589
01:49:57,210 --> 01:50:00,751
But you didn't stop me at our wedding.
You laughed at me.

1590
01:50:00,751 --> 01:50:02,835
- Shall I...
- Wait.

1591
01:50:02,835 --> 01:50:04,751
This kid's life is in my hands.

1592
01:50:04,751 --> 01:50:06,918
See that baby.

1593
01:50:07,585 --> 01:50:11,543
- Not "see." It's "look" at that baby.
- Look at that baby, swine.

1594
01:50:12,126 --> 01:50:13,543
She's your baby.

1595
01:50:15,293 --> 01:50:16,835
Aafia's daughter.

1596
01:50:52,376 --> 01:50:53,626
Is she like Aafia?

1597
01:51:01,543 --> 01:51:02,501
Or me?

1598
01:51:11,751 --> 01:51:13,918
So how can she be ours?

1599
01:51:23,668 --> 01:51:24,793
Stop!

1600
01:51:25,626 --> 01:51:26,376
Baaua.

1601
01:51:26,626 --> 01:51:27,793
Let him go.

1602
01:51:30,293 --> 01:51:37,418
<i>A perfect half dream...</i>

1603
01:51:37,626 --> 01:51:42,835
<i>...once came to me</i>

1604
01:51:43,043 --> 01:51:49,335
<i>Like a tear of happiness</i>

1605
01:51:49,543 --> 01:51:57,626
<i>Falling from my eyelid</i>

1606
01:52:05,085 --> 01:52:08,376
<i>O God, have mercy on me</i>

1607
01:52:09,043 --> 01:52:12,751
<i>My shadow seems cross with me</i>

1608
01:52:13,293 --> 01:52:17,293
<i>Knowingly, unknowingly</i>

1609
01:52:19,251 --> 01:52:23,335
<i>I find myself alone
again and again</i>

1610
01:52:23,335 --> 01:52:27,085
<i>Loneliness has no bounds</i>

1611
01:52:27,543 --> 01:52:31,668
<i>I find myself alone again and again</i>

1612
01:52:31,668 --> 01:52:35,210
<i>Loneliness has no bounds</i>

1613
01:52:44,626 --> 01:52:50,376
<i>My eyes do not moisten
with drops of dew</i>

1614
01:52:52,918 --> 01:52:58,626
<i>I could not belong to myself.
How could I belong to anyone?</i>

1615
01:53:00,918 --> 01:53:04,168
<i>The depths of my heart...</i>

1616
01:53:05,043 --> 01:53:08,835
<i>...seek the truth</i>

1617
01:53:09,085 --> 01:53:13,543
<i>Knowingly, unknowingly</i>

1618
01:53:17,585 --> 01:53:21,710
<i>I find myself alone
again and again</i>

1619
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:25,126
<i>Loneliness has no bounds</i>

1620
01:53:34,376 --> 01:53:42,626
<i>See the happy world while
my heart is full of sorrow</i>

1621
01:53:42,626 --> 01:53:46,751
<i>O unfaithful heart of mine...</i>

1622
01:53:46,751 --> 01:53:50,585
<i>...let us learn to be faithful</i>

1623
01:53:50,876 --> 01:53:52,960
<i>I will win her, make her mine...</i>

1624
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,626
<i>...or sacrifice my life</i>

1625
01:53:55,126 --> 01:54:02,876
<i>My bad name foreshadows me</i>

1626
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:08,085
<i>Knowingly, unknowingly</i>

1627
01:54:12,043 --> 01:54:16,168
<i>I call out to my beloved</i>

1628
01:54:16,168 --> 01:54:19,960
<i>I want to stay forever with you</i>

1629
01:54:20,418 --> 01:54:24,460
<i>I call out to my beloved</i>

1630
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:27,835
<i>I want to stay forever with you</i>

1631
01:54:45,168 --> 01:54:51,960
<i>Being unfaithful did nothing for me</i>

1632
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:59,418
<i>Let us see if faithfulness
will befriend me</i>

1633
01:54:59,418 --> 01:55:06,876
<i>Life turned its back and walked away</i>

1634
01:55:07,335 --> 01:55:14,626
<i>Let us see if it returns
to smile on me again</i>

1635
01:55:14,626 --> 01:55:21,335
<i>Losing everything is easy for me</i>

1636
01:55:21,335 --> 01:55:28,001
<i>Now I know how to regain what is lost</i>

1637
01:55:36,585 --> 01:55:37,710
Come on, Guddu.

1638
01:55:37,710 --> 01:55:39,126
This is all my fault.

1639
01:55:39,126 --> 01:55:42,126
I'll beg her forgiveness.
Oh, the doors are closed.

1640
01:55:42,126 --> 01:55:46,085
Brother! You with the specs!

1641
01:55:46,085 --> 01:55:47,168
- Where are you going?
- Yes.

1642
01:55:47,168 --> 01:55:48,001
Can I help you?

1643
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:50,876
- The wheelchair girl who gave a speech...
- Aafia?

1644
01:55:51,085 --> 01:55:53,918
Yes, Aafia. Has she left?

1645
01:55:54,126 --> 01:55:56,418
She's gone. I got here late.

1646
01:55:56,626 --> 01:55:58,418
Do you know her?

1647
01:55:58,418 --> 01:56:00,960
I'm her fiancé.

1648
01:56:02,126 --> 01:56:04,501
- Fancy?
- Must be her cousin.

1649
01:56:05,626 --> 01:56:09,668
Can you tell me where
I can find her?

1650
01:56:11,085 --> 01:56:12,085
Here's her card.

1651
01:56:12,293 --> 01:56:13,876
- Her card?
- All the best, gentlemen.

1652
01:56:13,876 --> 01:56:14,668
Goodnight.

1653
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:23,626
Fancy!

1654
01:56:24,501 --> 01:56:28,793
- Guddu, he doesn't look like her cousin.
- You're right.

1655
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:31,876
NSAR.

1656
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:44,543
Guddu, our visa will expire
while we're standing in line here.

1657
01:56:44,543 --> 01:56:45,960
Let's sneak in.

1658
01:56:46,293 --> 01:56:49,293
This isn't the Delhi-Meerut tollbooth.
You can't sneak through.

1659
01:56:49,543 --> 01:56:53,085
Anyway, they think Muslims come here
to plant bombs. We'll get whacked.

1660
01:56:53,293 --> 01:56:56,251
- What shall we do?
- Ask this aunty.

1661
01:56:56,251 --> 01:56:57,543
- Shall I?
- Go.

1662
01:56:57,751 --> 01:56:59,335
- Side, please.
- My space...

1663
01:56:59,543 --> 01:57:01,960
- Madam...
- Blind man coming.

1664
01:57:02,585 --> 01:57:04,835
We're middle-class Indians.

1665
01:57:05,043 --> 01:57:07,501
- Are you Indian?
- No, lower middle-class British.

1666
01:57:07,501 --> 01:57:09,751
- Quit India!
- The Kohinoor?

1667
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:11,376
We'll tax you double.

1668
01:57:11,376 --> 01:57:14,251
What do you want?
I speak Hindi. So talk Hindi.

1669
01:57:14,251 --> 01:57:16,626
Oh! Why this crowd?

1670
01:57:16,835 --> 01:57:22,126
NSAR selects 7 people every 3 years
for their space programme.

1671
01:57:22,126 --> 01:57:25,001
They want to see if a
human can survive in space.

1672
01:57:25,168 --> 01:57:27,501
- Understand "space?"
- You mean "pace?"

1673
01:57:27,751 --> 01:57:30,835
- Beyond the sky. Up there.
- Oh, that space!

1674
01:57:30,835 --> 01:57:33,876
- Can a man survive there?
- Okay. Okay.

1675
01:57:34,043 --> 01:57:36,043
There's 6 months of tests.

1676
01:57:36,043 --> 01:57:39,210
Today's the first selection round.
You get paid too!

1677
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:41,751
- You're in the right place.
- We've come to see Miss Aafia.

1678
01:57:41,751 --> 01:57:43,210
She works here.

1679
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:46,460
She approves the candidates.
References don't work.

1680
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:49,418
- But shortcuts will!
- Bauua Singh.

1681
01:57:49,418 --> 01:57:51,251
- Who is Bauua Singh?
- Present!

1682
01:57:51,585 --> 01:57:54,210
- Here you go, sir.
- Blind man coming.

1683
01:57:55,043 --> 01:57:56,376
- Blind man.
- That way?

1684
01:57:56,710 --> 01:57:57,793
That way?

1685
01:57:57,793 --> 01:58:00,626
- You've got the pass?
- D'you see this?

1686
01:58:00,793 --> 01:58:03,251
- We've got the pass.
- Aafia knows us.

1687
01:58:05,543 --> 01:58:07,626
What's wrong?

1688
01:58:07,626 --> 01:58:08,585
What's this?

1689
01:58:08,793 --> 01:58:12,043
Where is Aafia?
I want to see her, please!

1690
01:58:12,043 --> 01:58:13,335
- I want to see her.
- What's wrong?

1691
01:58:13,335 --> 01:58:16,668
- You need to leave the premises.
- Let me go, please.

1692
01:58:16,668 --> 01:58:19,418
Let me go. One minute.

1693
01:58:19,418 --> 01:58:21,335
Aafia is getting married.

1694
01:58:30,835 --> 01:58:31,585
Let him in.

1695
01:58:31,585 --> 01:58:34,376
Sir, we're sending you inside.

1696
01:58:34,376 --> 01:58:37,918
- Yes, yes.
- Let us go. We won't come back.

1697
01:58:55,251 --> 01:58:56,793
Hey, come on. Let's go.

1698
01:59:34,418 --> 01:59:35,293
Aafia?

1699
01:59:35,293 --> 01:59:36,876
I just wanted to apologies.

1700
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:40,668
I swear by the Goddess.
I knew nothing about the child.

1701
01:59:44,418 --> 01:59:47,043
What's this invite?

1702
01:59:48,626 --> 01:59:52,251
Why are you marrying someone else
when you love me?

1703
01:59:54,043 --> 01:59:58,626
You may not love me anymore,
but I still love you.

1704
01:59:59,668 --> 02:00:03,501
Aafia, you were right when you said
we were made for each other.

1705
02:00:03,876 --> 02:00:05,793
We're a match made...

1706
02:00:34,043 --> 02:00:37,376
Stop barking and listen to me.

1707
02:00:37,751 --> 02:00:40,501
Now we're truly equals, Bauua.

1708
02:00:40,668 --> 02:00:45,835
We could talk eye to eye, that's all.
I've stooped to your level.

1709
02:00:45,835 --> 02:00:48,793
Your arrogant ways, your status,
your class.

1710
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:53,585
"I didn't know about the child,
Aafia." Do you think I knew?

1711
02:00:53,793 --> 02:00:55,918
When I came to your house...

1712
02:00:55,918 --> 02:00:59,501
...I came to tell you
not to be nervous, Bauua.

1713
02:00:59,501 --> 02:01:02,543
If I liked you, it was my problem.

1714
02:01:02,543 --> 02:01:05,585
You wanted to change
your phone number, fine!

1715
02:01:05,585 --> 02:01:09,418
But your father said:
"Fix the wedding date...

1716
02:01:09,418 --> 02:01:11,126
"...fix the wedding date."

1717
02:01:11,668 --> 02:01:13,460
Go away, Bauua.

1718
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:17,210
There's nothing left of Aafia.

1719
02:01:55,793 --> 02:01:57,960
Did you think...

1720
02:01:59,793 --> 02:02:02,251
...I came all this way
looking for you...

1721
02:02:03,918 --> 02:02:05,210
...only to leave again?

1722
02:02:05,585 --> 02:02:08,251
So you're trying it on?

1723
02:02:08,626 --> 02:02:14,085
You may be brave,
but you have no feelings.

1724
02:02:31,001 --> 02:02:32,835
Hey, middle-class Indian!

1725
02:02:32,835 --> 02:02:34,876
Why are you looking miserable?

1726
02:02:35,126 --> 02:02:37,793
Well? Your shortcut didn't work?

1727
02:02:38,501 --> 02:02:39,835
Want my help?

1728
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:52,960
- How old are you?
- What's age? I'm 38. 39.

1729
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,043
And you?

1730
02:02:54,626 --> 02:02:58,585
<i>The quarrel between you and me...</i>

1731
02:02:58,585 --> 02:03:00,918
<i>...is an empty quarrel</i>

1732
02:03:05,293 --> 02:03:09,085
<i>All lovers argue,
so you're mad at me... </i>

1733
02:03:09,293 --> 02:03:11,501
<i>...for a fleeting moment</i>

1734
02:03:13,210 --> 02:03:15,876
- The smell of gas reminds me of Meerut.
- Yep.

1735
02:03:15,876 --> 02:03:20,376
<i>I'm all around you...</i>

1736
02:03:20,835 --> 02:03:25,251
<i>...so how can we never speak?</i>

1737
02:03:26,085 --> 02:03:31,168
<i>Though you look at me
with different eyes...</i>

1738
02:03:31,585 --> 02:03:36,418
<i>...my feelings are unchanged</i>

1739
02:03:37,626 --> 02:03:42,293
<i>Come what may, I'll never let you go</i>

1740
02:03:43,001 --> 02:03:47,293
<i>Come what may,
I'll never let you go</i>

1741
02:03:48,168 --> 02:03:52,251
<i>I'll belong to you alone</i>

1742
02:03:53,626 --> 02:03:56,626
<i>You can never get mad at me</i>

1743
02:04:01,293 --> 02:04:05,168
<i>The quarrel between you and me...</i>

1744
02:04:05,168 --> 02:04:07,251
<i>...is an empty quarrel</i>

1745
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:15,793
<i>All lovers argue,
so you're mad at me... </i>

1746
02:04:15,793 --> 02:04:18,501
<i>...for a fleeting moment</i>

1747
02:05:07,876 --> 02:05:13,751
<i>I'll smile to lessen my sadness...</i>

1748
02:05:13,751 --> 02:05:18,168
<i>...though my smiles seem false to me</i>

1749
02:05:18,501 --> 02:05:21,876
<i>Every day I'm filled with fear...</i>

1750
02:05:21,876 --> 02:05:27,418
<i>...that you may break my heart
by mistake</i>

1751
02:05:28,418 --> 02:05:31,751
<i>No matter how you treat me...</i>

1752
02:05:31,751 --> 02:05:33,710
<i>...it will feel like love to me</i>

1753
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:39,001
<i>Not knowing my boundaries
has always been my way</i>

1754
02:05:39,585 --> 02:05:44,418
<i>Being alone is not easy</i>

1755
02:05:44,793 --> 02:05:49,960
<i>Loneliness is hard to endure</i>

1756
02:05:50,293 --> 02:05:55,585
<i>My name so longs...</i>

1757
02:05:55,585 --> 02:06:01,293
<i>...to be united with yours</i>

1758
02:06:01,501 --> 02:06:05,460
<i>Come what may, I'll never let you go</i>

1759
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:11,710
<i>Come what may, I'll never let you go</i>

1760
02:06:12,251 --> 02:06:17,043
<i>I'll belong to you alone</i>

1761
02:06:17,585 --> 02:06:21,501
<i>You can never get mad at me</i>

1762
02:06:24,585 --> 02:06:28,960
<i>The quarrel between you and me...</i>

1763
02:06:29,210 --> 02:06:32,668
<i>...is an empty quarrel</i>

1764
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:39,793
<i>All lovers argue,
so you're mad at me... </i>

1765
02:06:39,793 --> 02:06:42,043
<i>...for a fleeting moment</i>

1766
02:07:07,126 --> 02:07:11,460
I like this Bauua Singh.
Mr. Shorty is good.

1767
02:07:11,668 --> 02:07:13,501
He's small but resilient.

1768
02:07:13,876 --> 02:07:16,835
He's only passed
his 10th grade, Srini.

1769
02:07:16,835 --> 02:07:20,126
Sorry, I forgot your chimpanzee
graduated from MIT.

1770
02:07:21,168 --> 02:07:23,126
We don't need an astronaut.

1771
02:07:23,126 --> 02:07:26,001
He has to sleep all the way
to Mars and back.

1772
02:07:26,376 --> 02:07:29,210
We just need someone
who'll take the risk.

1773
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:38,168
Aafia, I haven't figured out
if you love or hate this shorty.

1774
02:07:38,626 --> 02:07:41,626
But trust me, a man at my age,
I couldn't care less.

1775
02:07:41,626 --> 02:07:45,668
I don't have anything in my life beside
this project and your brains, Aafia.

1776
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:49,335
I don't know about you.

1777
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:51,751
Yeah, fine.

1778
02:07:52,293 --> 02:07:53,585
I don't understand.

1779
02:08:01,918 --> 02:08:03,126
Srini...

1780
02:08:04,168 --> 02:08:08,668
...I feel angry all of a sudden.

1781
02:08:10,585 --> 02:08:14,001
And I feel like crying too.

1782
02:08:15,043 --> 02:08:16,418
I am going to go now.

1783
02:08:16,626 --> 02:08:18,376
I'll see you at the office.

1784
02:08:18,793 --> 02:08:21,835
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'll see you.

1785
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:39,376
Are you angry with me?

1786
02:09:40,418 --> 02:09:43,960
You're the one who's angry.
I'm trying to make it up to you.

1787
02:09:44,918 --> 02:09:47,251
Do you love me?

1788
02:09:47,543 --> 02:09:48,793
What do you think?

1789
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:52,668
You love me a lot.

1790
02:09:55,043 --> 02:09:56,168
Do you love me?

1791
02:10:02,751 --> 02:10:06,376
Will you do something for me?

1792
02:10:07,626 --> 02:10:08,418
Anything.

1793
02:10:09,668 --> 02:10:11,293
Go away.

1794
02:10:16,876 --> 02:10:18,960
Let me attend your wedding first.

1795
02:10:20,835 --> 02:10:22,126
Then I'll go.

1796
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:25,751
Run away, Bauua.

1797
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:28,376
You're so good at running.

1798
02:10:28,585 --> 02:10:32,668
Break my heart then.
Like you've been doing.

1799
02:10:33,043 --> 02:10:35,918
You'll die, you dog!

1800
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:39,210
Then watch me die.

1801
02:10:40,126 --> 02:10:41,710
I'll watch.

1802
02:10:45,126 --> 02:10:50,418
The Mission Mars team is impressed
by your performance, Bauua.

1803
02:10:50,835 --> 02:10:52,751
Your reports are amazing.

1804
02:10:53,043 --> 02:10:55,376
So's your endurance.

1805
02:10:55,751 --> 02:10:58,585
You have a high pain threshold.
You're sharp.

1806
02:10:58,793 --> 02:11:01,293
Applied intelligence is excellent.

1807
02:11:02,168 --> 02:11:04,585
The team says ideally...

1808
02:11:04,585 --> 02:11:09,126
...they would need a man like you
for the mission, not a monkey.

1809
02:11:09,376 --> 02:11:11,501
I agree with them.

1810
02:11:11,501 --> 02:11:14,668
But you'd be risking your life.

1811
02:11:14,668 --> 02:11:17,376
It wouldn't matter to you
because you love me.

1812
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:21,126
That poor monkey is
so attached to his family.

1813
02:11:21,126 --> 02:11:27,335
While the very thought of your family
makes you uncomfortable.

1814
02:11:27,876 --> 02:11:30,335
The rocket's very safe, Bauua.

1815
02:11:30,501 --> 02:11:34,960
But I'll pray it crashes
on re-entry.

1816
02:11:37,918 --> 02:11:40,126
Oh, I see.

1817
02:11:42,335 --> 02:11:44,626
Is that how you'll get rid of me?

1818
02:11:45,043 --> 02:11:46,418
Scare me away.

1819
02:11:51,210 --> 02:11:54,376
You can't bear marrying
anyone else when I'm around.

1820
02:11:58,210 --> 02:11:59,710
Admit it!

1821
02:12:00,418 --> 02:12:01,835
Go on.

1822
02:12:02,335 --> 02:12:04,043
OK, I'll do it for you.

1823
02:12:04,793 --> 02:12:07,793
Who knows where you're sending me
or what you're asking.

1824
02:12:08,126 --> 02:12:09,918
But on the day it happens...

1825
02:12:11,835 --> 02:12:13,585
...make sure you get married.

1826
02:12:15,585 --> 02:12:18,001
Bauua Singh isn't running this time.

1827
02:12:19,418 --> 02:12:24,085
The words you just said,
you'll forget them all...

1828
02:12:24,335 --> 02:12:28,585
...when you're in the shuttle
travelling at 30,000kmph.

1829
02:12:29,043 --> 02:12:34,335
The second you hear the noise
it makes, you'll make a run for it.

1830
02:12:34,585 --> 02:12:35,918
When they count...

1831
02:12:36,210 --> 02:12:42,085
- 10... 9... 8... 7... 6...
- Hello!

1832
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:46,085
When I was even shorter,
I could count backwards.

1833
02:12:46,501 --> 02:12:50,335
5... 4... 3... 2... 1... zero.

1834
02:12:50,626 --> 02:12:53,543
Launch me in your rocket!

1835
02:13:00,876 --> 02:13:01,918
Did a star fall?

1836
02:13:08,001 --> 02:13:09,710
At last!

1837
02:13:28,418 --> 02:13:31,626
God bless the stars!

1838
02:13:38,293 --> 02:13:40,793
Let anyone try to
stop Bauua Singh now.

1839
02:13:50,543 --> 02:13:52,835
What happened?
Did those two patch up?

1840
02:13:57,085 --> 02:13:59,543
Your friend will go to Mars.

1841
02:13:59,543 --> 02:14:00,585
Where?

1842
02:14:00,585 --> 02:14:02,168
The planet Mars.

1843
02:14:05,001 --> 02:14:06,501
Does he know that?

1844
02:14:06,918 --> 02:14:08,210
I hope so.

1845
02:14:13,251 --> 02:14:15,293
God forgive us!

1846
02:14:16,085 --> 02:14:19,043
We were sending him to Mars...

1847
02:14:19,418 --> 02:14:22,085
...but now we're sending
Bauua Singh instead.

1848
02:14:22,376 --> 02:14:24,626
But sister-in-law,
if Bauua goes to Mars...

1849
02:14:24,626 --> 02:14:26,168
...who will I take with
me back to Meerut, this chimp.

1850
02:14:26,168 --> 02:14:29,210
He has no one out here except for you.

1851
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:32,960
So you'll have to be his guardian.

1852
02:14:33,168 --> 02:14:35,126
You must sign papers statin..

1853
02:14:35,126 --> 02:14:38,876
..that if anything happens
to him during this mission...

1854
02:14:38,876 --> 02:14:41,501
...then we cannot be held accountable.

1855
02:14:41,751 --> 02:14:42,710
Understood.

1856
02:14:42,710 --> 02:14:43,960
What do you mean?

1857
02:14:44,376 --> 02:14:46,085
Well, for starters he can die.

1858
02:14:46,376 --> 02:14:48,876
God forgive us! The punishment for running
away from his wedding can't be death.

1859
02:14:49,210 --> 02:14:51,418
He's a little guy, who couldn't
achieve anything big on Earth...

1860
02:14:51,418 --> 02:14:52,626
...what does he stand
to achieve on Mars?

1861
02:14:52,626 --> 02:14:54,793
He's no use to you.
Please stop him.

1862
02:14:55,001 --> 02:14:57,376
Stop the charade.

1863
02:14:58,418 --> 02:15:01,918
And anyway,
he's going to run away eventually.

1864
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:03,835
So let him do it now.

1865
02:15:04,043 --> 02:15:05,668
It's will save our money.

1866
02:15:05,918 --> 02:15:07,043
You talk to him.

1867
02:15:07,043 --> 02:15:09,293
He's not listening to me.
But he will listen to you.

1868
02:15:09,626 --> 02:15:11,710
I am busy with my wedding.

1869
02:15:12,376 --> 02:15:14,835
How long do you think will
it take to say "Stop Bauua"?

1870
02:15:15,585 --> 02:15:16,835
A lot.

1871
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,376
And then,
there's my engagement tomorrow.

1872
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:23,585
Then the musical nite,
followed by some more functions.

1873
02:15:23,876 --> 02:15:28,710
Then I've an appointment at the parlor,
the wedding dress trial as well.

1874
02:15:28,918 --> 02:15:30,501
So I am very busy.

1875
02:15:32,626 --> 02:15:33,710
Sign that.

1876
02:15:34,085 --> 02:15:36,668
You know what..

1877
02:15:36,668 --> 02:15:39,376
..meet him between the beauty
parlor appointment and the tailor.

1878
02:15:39,835 --> 02:15:41,168
Sign.
Gud... du...

1879
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:47,210
What do you eat?

1880
02:15:48,168 --> 02:15:51,126
Practically anything,
As long as it's Halal (Holy).

1881
02:16:03,668 --> 02:16:07,751
Bauua, what's going on?
The whites are applauding.

1882
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:11,835
We're from Meerut, Bauua!
We dunk biscuits in our tea.

1883
02:16:12,001 --> 02:16:15,085
What do we care about rockets?
Or Mars?

1884
02:16:15,085 --> 02:16:18,835
Isn't Mars a faraway planet?
It's not a place to go sightseeing.

1885
02:16:18,835 --> 02:16:22,126
Wake up! Mars is not Saharanpur
from where you can sprint.

1886
02:16:22,293 --> 02:16:23,585
It's Mars!

1887
02:16:24,501 --> 02:16:26,085
She won't let me go.

1888
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:28,126
I've seen the look in her eyes.

1889
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:31,335
She can't do it.
The girl will stop me.

1890
02:16:36,293 --> 02:16:38,251
We are on the verge
of a very big mission.

1891
02:16:38,251 --> 02:16:42,460
And tomorrow we decide when this
decade-long dream becomes a reality.

1892
02:16:42,793 --> 02:16:44,793
We sign off on the take-off date.

1893
02:16:44,793 --> 02:16:46,876
The next 48 hours are crucial.

1894
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:51,876
Once it reaches Mars, the
gravity of Mars will slow it down...

1895
02:16:51,876 --> 02:16:54,376
...and finally we'll enter in orbit
around Mars...

1896
02:16:54,376 --> 02:16:56,293
...but the orbit will be elliptical.

1897
02:16:56,293 --> 02:16:59,251
NSAR is the world's most
reputed institution...

1898
02:16:59,251 --> 02:17:04,001
...they have surprised everyone
by sending Bauua Singh to Mars...

1899
02:17:04,001 --> 02:17:06,043
...instead of a chimpanzee.

1900
02:17:06,293 --> 02:17:09,251
Bauua Singh is from Meerut in India.

1901
02:17:09,251 --> 02:17:15,168
<i>The amazing thing is Bauua Singh is not
very educated nor does he speak English.</i>

1902
02:17:15,168 --> 02:17:20,793
This launch is a huge opportunity
to learn about...

1903
02:17:20,793 --> 02:17:24,418
...the potential of life
beyond our planet...

1904
02:17:24,418 --> 02:17:27,626
...with the ultimate
aim of becoming...

1905
02:17:28,876 --> 02:17:32,251
...a multi-planet species.

1906
02:18:45,876 --> 02:18:52,335
- You can't stay here for the launch.
- Why not?

1907
02:18:53,626 --> 02:18:57,543
Because we'll be getting married.

1908
02:19:00,585 --> 02:19:02,085
Are your calculations right?

1909
02:19:04,293 --> 02:19:06,418
100 percent.

1910
02:20:45,210 --> 02:20:46,501
Are you crying?

1911
02:20:47,751 --> 02:20:49,793
- What?
- You're crying.

1912
02:20:51,210 --> 02:20:53,210
- You're nuts.
- You're crying.

1913
02:20:53,626 --> 02:20:55,543
- Don't talk nonsense.
- You're crying.

1914
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:21,043
Hello? Yeah, go ahead.

1915
02:21:21,043 --> 02:21:22,293
Doesn't matter.

1916
02:21:23,085 --> 02:21:25,626
OK. Copy that. Thank you.

1917
02:21:30,543 --> 02:21:32,460
We're heading towards propulsion.

1918
02:21:55,168 --> 02:21:58,835
...how long does it take
to travel 1.2 miles at 5.8mph?

1919
02:22:01,710 --> 02:22:04,293
12.9 minutes.

1920
02:22:18,418 --> 02:22:21,960
It's only right I say goodbye.

1921
02:24:21,001 --> 02:24:23,376
- Its clear way.
- Okay.

1922
02:24:24,210 --> 02:24:25,543
Checking. All good.

1923
02:24:26,126 --> 02:24:26,835
Okay.

1924
02:24:28,876 --> 02:24:32,043
Could I talk to him
for a minute, please?

1925
02:24:34,668 --> 02:24:36,085
All systems ready.

1926
02:24:36,376 --> 02:24:37,418
Standing by.

1927
02:24:52,460 --> 02:24:55,626
You didn't run, Bauua.

1928
02:24:59,001 --> 02:25:00,626
If I didn't win you...

1929
02:25:02,751 --> 02:25:04,876
...let me bring glory to my country.

1930
02:25:07,876 --> 02:25:12,835
What do you care about the country?

1931
02:25:14,085 --> 02:25:17,501
You're dying for
the sake of love.

1932
02:25:24,626 --> 02:25:27,460
If you were near me...

1933
02:25:28,751 --> 02:25:31,376
...I'd kiss you.

1934
02:25:36,876 --> 02:25:38,126
I'd do the same.

1935
02:25:49,043 --> 02:25:54,418
I'll wait for you, Bauua.

1936
02:26:00,751 --> 02:26:02,543
What if I don't come back?

1937
02:26:05,085 --> 02:26:09,751
I'll find someone your height.

1938
02:26:17,168 --> 02:26:20,043
T-2 minutes and counting.

1939
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:21,335
Yes.

1940
02:26:25,168 --> 02:26:29,751
If I'd asked you to,
would you have stayed?

1941
02:27:12,376 --> 02:27:14,835
Flight control, give me a go,
no go for launch.

1942
02:27:15,418 --> 02:27:16,918
Go for launch.

1943
02:27:17,126 --> 02:27:18,710
- Surge in.
- We are go.

1944
02:27:18,918 --> 02:27:20,501
- Network.
- Go.

1945
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:22,251
- Guidance.
- Go.

1946
02:27:22,251 --> 02:27:23,918
- Recovery.
- Go for launch.

1947
02:27:24,126 --> 02:27:25,876
- Capcom.
- We are go for launch.

1948
02:27:26,126 --> 02:27:28,126
Flight control, we are go for launch.

1949
02:27:47,001 --> 02:27:48,501
Bye, Bauua.

1950
02:27:56,376 --> 02:27:59,835
Six, five, four, three...

1951
02:28:00,251 --> 02:28:02,960
...two, one, zero.

1952
02:28:10,168 --> 02:28:14,043
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

1953
02:28:14,043 --> 02:28:17,751
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

1954
02:28:18,001 --> 02:28:21,626
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

1955
02:28:21,835 --> 02:28:25,501
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

1956
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:29,751
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

1957
02:28:29,751 --> 02:28:32,876
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

1958
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:37,293
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

1959
02:28:37,501 --> 02:28:40,335
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

1960
02:28:43,210 --> 02:28:44,335
I kissed him.

1961
02:28:54,001 --> 02:28:57,001
<i>There were so many amazing things
about my story.</i>

1962
02:28:57,501 --> 02:28:59,168
<i>It was like a dream.</i>

1963
02:28:59,626 --> 02:29:00,751
<i>It wasn't amazing that...</i>

1964
02:29:00,751 --> 02:29:05,001
<i>...so many tears and smiles,
so much love amount only to...</i>

1965
02:29:06,085 --> 02:29:09,293
<i>...a trail of smoke in the sky.</i>

1966
02:29:10,126 --> 02:29:14,168
<i>The amazing thing is that we know
this, yet we still fall in love.</i>

1967
02:29:15,585 --> 02:29:19,293
<i>It was not a surprise that I should
cry when Bauua left.</i>

1968
02:29:19,626 --> 02:29:23,960
<i>The amazing thing was that he didn't run.
The joy of that fact dried my tears.</i>

1969
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:29,418
<i>It wasn't amazing that an unknown
4'6" man from Meerut...</i>

1970
02:29:29,918 --> 02:29:34,668
<i>... was sent in a rocket to a planet
so very far away.</i>

1971
02:29:35,501 --> 02:29:40,335
<i>The amazing thing was that
he convinced over a billion people...</i>

1972
02:29:40,626 --> 02:29:42,168
<i>...that he could do it.</i>

1973
02:29:43,751 --> 02:29:46,835
<i>It was not a surprise that Srini and I
did not get married.</i>

1974
02:29:47,168 --> 02:29:52,751
<i>The amazing thing was after so much
loathing I loved Bauua again.</i>

1975
02:29:53,918 --> 02:29:58,710
<i>The amazing thing wasn't
that Bauua reached Mars.</i>

1976
02:29:59,085 --> 02:30:02,168
<i>The amazing thing was that
he did not run away.</i>

1977
02:30:02,876 --> 02:30:05,835
<i>The amazing thing wasn't that,
on re-entry, the shuttle...</i>

1978
02:30:05,835 --> 02:30:07,876
<i>...silently went missing.</i>

1979
02:30:08,251 --> 02:30:12,626
<i>The amazing thing was that
I kept waiting for Bauua to return.</i>

1980
02:30:13,251 --> 02:30:15,585
<i>The amazing thing wasn't that...</i>

1981
02:30:15,585 --> 02:30:19,626
<i>...Bauua, rejected by the world,
was even spat out by the sky.</i>

1982
02:30:19,918 --> 02:30:25,376
<i>One day, the Chinese Space Centre
got a call. He was returning.</i>

1983
02:30:26,501 --> 02:30:31,085
<i>The amazing thing was it took
15 years for that phone to ring.</i>

1984
02:30:31,751 --> 02:30:35,043
<i>The amazing thing wasn't that
Bauua Singh's shuttle...</i>

1985
02:30:36,085 --> 02:30:38,460
<i>... was re-entering towards
the Arabian Sea...</i>

1986
02:30:38,668 --> 02:30:40,710
<i>...at a speed of 20,000kmph.</i>

1987
02:30:41,376 --> 02:30:47,376
<i>The amazing thing was 15 years
had wrinkled many faces, honey...</i>

1988
02:30:47,751 --> 02:30:52,251
<i>...but the dimples on my face
remained forever young. Right?</i>

1989
02:31:02,876 --> 02:31:07,126
Long live...

1990
02:31:07,126 --> 02:31:10,585
...the Goddess!

1991
02:31:45,335 --> 02:31:49,210
<i>A colour has no colour...</i>

1992
02:31:49,210 --> 02:31:55,793
<i>...if it does not match the colour
of your lips.</i>

1993
02:31:57,293 --> 02:32:01,085
<i>A fragrance has no fragrance...</i>

1994
02:32:01,335 --> 02:32:08,335
<i>...if it does not match the fragrance
of your dark hair.</i>

1995
02:32:09,210 --> 02:32:13,335
<i>The world pales next to you</i>

1996
02:32:13,335 --> 02:32:17,376
<i>You can only be mine</i>

1997
02:32:17,376 --> 02:32:25,501
<i>Everyone can see it.
I say this out loud:</i>

1998
02:32:25,918 --> 02:32:29,793
<i>As long as there's
light in the world...</i>

1999
02:32:30,043 --> 02:32:33,376
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2000
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:38,043
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

2001
02:32:38,043 --> 02:32:41,376
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2002
02:32:41,876 --> 02:32:45,960
<i>As long as there's
light in the world...</i>

2003
02:32:45,960 --> 02:32:49,710
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2004
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:53,835
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

2005
02:32:54,043 --> 02:32:58,626
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2006
02:33:38,043 --> 02:33:45,585
<i>I am your confusion.
I am your solution</i>

2007
02:33:46,001 --> 02:33:49,918
<i>I'm a little stubborn</i>

2008
02:33:49,918 --> 02:33:53,043
<i>A little crazy too</i>

2009
02:33:53,210 --> 02:33:57,043
<i>How false are the clouds
and spring showers</i>

2010
02:33:57,043 --> 02:34:01,376
<i>How false is offering
a gift of flowers</i>

2011
02:34:01,376 --> 02:34:05,001
<i>Only you are real.
Only I am real</i>

2012
02:34:05,001 --> 02:34:09,293
<i>My heart speaks the only truth</i>

2013
02:34:09,293 --> 02:34:13,376
<i>Etch your name on my heart
with your lovely hands</i>

2014
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:21,001
<i>Open your eyes to my love.
Do I ask too much of you?</i>

2015
02:34:21,001 --> 02:34:25,001
<i>I say this out loud:</i>

2016
02:34:26,043 --> 02:34:30,001
<i>As long as there's light
in the world...</i>

2017
02:34:30,001 --> 02:34:33,251
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2018
02:34:33,918 --> 02:34:37,626
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

2019
02:34:38,001 --> 02:34:40,960
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2020
02:34:42,043 --> 02:34:45,751
<i>As long as there's light
in the world...</i>

2021
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:49,251
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2022
02:34:49,876 --> 02:34:54,043
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

2023
02:34:54,043 --> 02:34:57,918
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2024
02:35:17,876 --> 02:35:24,460
<i>Forever you will sway
in my loving arms</i>

2025
02:35:26,001 --> 02:35:32,751
<i>Like the earth sways
in the arms of the sun</i>

2026
02:35:33,376 --> 02:35:40,210
<i>You will never be apart from me</i>

2027
02:35:41,418 --> 02:35:48,210
<i>Forever you will be a part of me</i>

2028
02:35:53,376 --> 02:35:57,210
<i>Shatter all my dreams if you wish</i>

2029
02:35:57,418 --> 02:36:01,376
<i>The shards of my dreams
will still dream of you</i>

2030
02:36:01,376 --> 02:36:04,876
<i>You are my inspiration</i>

2031
02:36:05,085 --> 02:36:08,126
<i>I say this out loud:</i>

2032
02:36:14,085 --> 02:36:17,543
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

2033
02:36:17,876 --> 02:36:21,293
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2034
02:36:22,293 --> 02:36:25,960
<i>As long as I live in this world...</i>

2035
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:29,418
<i>...you'll belong to me</i>

2036
02:36:56,460 --> 02:36:58,793
<i>Your love's fake.</i>

2037
02:36:59,001 --> 02:37:01,293
<i>I've seen how selfish you are.</i>

2038
02:37:01,501 --> 02:37:03,585
<i>Every day you get a new arm candy.</i>

2039
02:37:03,585 --> 02:37:06,376
<i>I am high on your betrayal.</i>

2040
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:19,001
<i>Your love's fake.</i>

2041
02:37:19,210 --> 02:37:21,543
<i>I've seen how selfish you are.</i>

2042
02:37:21,751 --> 02:37:23,793
<i>Every day you get a new arm candy.</i>

2043
02:37:23,793 --> 02:37:26,126
<i>I am high on your betrayal.</i>

2044
02:37:26,793 --> 02:37:29,085
<i>You go to god and tell...</i>

2045
02:37:29,293 --> 02:37:31,626
<i>That you swindle everyone,</i>

2046
02:37:31,835 --> 02:37:36,460
<i>There is a blame on you,
come and listen.</i>

2047
02:37:39,376 --> 02:37:42,335
<i>You have defamed her, defamed her,</i>

2048
02:37:42,335 --> 02:37:44,460
<i>With your fake love</i>

2049
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:47,418
<i>You have defamed her, defamed her,</i>

2050
02:37:47,418 --> 02:37:49,543
<i>With your fake love</i>

2051
02:37:49,543 --> 02:37:52,501
<i>You have defamed her, defamed her,</i>

2052
02:37:52,501 --> 02:37:54,876
<i>With your fake love</i>
