1
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:04,329
The pro-treaty paddies and the king
want the same man dead.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,729
You have been chosen, Mr Shelby.

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,889
The Epsom Derby, Pol. We'll be
drinking with the bloody king.

4
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:12,009
For the last ten years,
Sabini's made it his race.

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,529
If we're going to take him down,
might as well make it there.

6
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,209
~ It's good to see you, Grace.
~ Tommy, do you have someone?

7
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:19,569
Your horse will come fifth or sixth.

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,649
But I will win you.

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,369
Mr Churchill was impressed.

10
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,249
He has asked that the
Colonial Office grant him

11
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:27,569
an Empire export licence.

12
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:30,249
I want my son out of prison. Now.

13
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:32,209
He can be freed by tomorrow morning.

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,489
I'm talking about a simple
transaction here.

15
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:37,889
I will carry out the assassination
at a place of my choosing...

16
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:40,129
Epsom.

17
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,219
Derby Day.

18
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,139
'My name is Thomas Shelby.

19
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,139
'And today, I'm going to kill a man.

this afternoon at the Epsom races...

22

'It may be that I am able
to escape after the killing.

23
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,089
'The odds are not good.

24
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:12,529

crown to carry out this murder

Don't ask any questions.
It's... to do with insurance.

Look, Tommy?

six o'clock in the morning?

~ James, what's going on?

Don't listen to him, James,

What errand?

75

For the cause, Ada.

125
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:44,249
No. No, it is all legal.

20% paid to me
of your export business.

132

133
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:07,249
No, no, no, no.

134
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:13,059
See, I had my lawyer draw this
up for us, just in case.

135
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:19,329
It says that...

136
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,579
here, that 100%
of your business...

137

~ I see. ~ Just there...

139
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,289
Don't worry about it, right.
Cos it is totally legal, binding.

140
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,289
All you have to do is
sign the document

141
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:38,329
and transfer the whole
lot over to me.

142
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,009
Sign just here, is it?

143
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,249
Yeah.

144
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,939
I see. That's funny, that is.

145
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,019
~ What? ~ No, that's funny.

146
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,699
I'll give you 100% of my business?

147
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,419
Yeah!

148
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,459
Why?

149
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,849
Ollie, no.

150
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,769
No. No. Ollie, no. Put that down.

151
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,769
He understands. He understands.

152
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:09,929
He's a big boy, he knows the road.

153
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,249
Now, look, it's just
non-fucking-negotiable.

154
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,489
That is all you need to know,

155
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:16,809
so all you have to do is sign
the fucking contract.

156
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,449
~ Right there. ~ Just sign here.

157
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:21,129
~ With your pen. ~ I understand.

158
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,889
Good. Get on with it.

159
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:25,099
I have an associate waiting
for me at the door.

160
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,449
I know, he looks like a choirboy

161
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:32,169
but he is actually an anarchist

162
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,169
~ from Kentish Town. ~ Tommy,

163
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:38,049
I am going to fucking
shoot you. Right?

164
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,529
Now, when I came in here,
Mr Solomons,

165
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:43,089
I stopped to tie my shoelace...

166
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,449
Isn't that a fact, Ollie?

167
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:47,729
I stopped to tie my shoelace.

168
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,569
And while I was doing it,

169
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:52,489
I laid a hand grenade under
one of your barrels.

170
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:55,369
A mark 15 with wire trip.

171
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:58,809
My friend upstairs is like one of
those anarchists

172
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:02,249
that blew up Wall Street, you know?

173
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:05,339
He's a professional.
And he's in charge of the wire.

174
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,609
If I don't walk out of that
door by the stroke of seven,

175
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,729
he's going to trigger the grenade

176
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,969
and your very combustible rum

177
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,819
will blow us all to hell.

178
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,499
And I don't care...

179
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,619
.. cos I am already dead.

180
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:36,169
He tied his lace, Alfie.
And there is a kid at the door.

181
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,049
From a good family, too. Ollie,
it is shocking what they become.

182
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:41,649
What were you doing
when this happened?

183
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,209
He tied his lace. Nothing else.

184
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,049
Yeah. But what were you doing?

185
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:46,819
Marking the runners in the paper.

186
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,609
What are you doing?

187
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,779
Just checking the time. Carry on.

188
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,849
Ollie, I want you to go outside

189
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:58,889
and shoot that boy in the face
from the good family.

190
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:02,579
Anyone walks through that door
except me, he blows the grenade.

191
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,339
~ He tied his fucking lace, Alfie.
~ I did tie my lace.

192
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,899
I bet hundred to one...

193
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:16,289
.. that you're fucking lying, mate.

194
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:20,489
~ That's my money. ~ Well, you see, you
have failed to consider the form.

195
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:23,739
I did blow up my own pub
for the insurance.

196
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,009
OK, right, well,
considering the form,

197
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,929
I would say, 65 to one.

198
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,609
Very good odds. And I would be
more than happy and agree

199
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:38,689
for you to sign over 65%
of your business to me.

200
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:42,329
~ Thank you. ~ 65? No deal.
Ollie, what do you say?

201
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,889
Jesus Christ, Alfie,
He tied his fucking lace. I saw him.

202
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,409
Look, he planted a grenade.
I know he did.

203
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,339
Alfie, it is Tommy fucking Shelby.

204
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:56,329
You are behaving
like a fucking child.

205
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,899
This is a man's world.

206
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:02,859
Now, get that apron off and sit
in the corner like a little boy.

207
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,059
Fuck off. Now!

208
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,969
~ Four minutes.
~ Right, four minutes.

209
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,729
Talk to me about hand grenades.

210
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,129
The chalk mark on the barrel at knee
height said, "Hamilton Christmas".

211
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,339
I took out the pin
and put it on the wire.

212
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:43,259
Based on this...

213
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:49,329
.. 45%.

214
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,889
30.

215
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:53,419
Aw, fuck off, Tommy.
That's far too little.

216
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:02,459
In France, Mr Solomons, when I was
a tunneller. A clay kicker. A 179.

217
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:06,139
I blew up Schwaben Hohe.

218
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,859
Same kit I'm using today.

219
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,059
Funny that.

220
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:17,889
I do know the 179

221
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:21,769
and I heard they all got buried.

222
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,649
Three of us dug ourselves out.

223
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,939
Like you're digging
yourself out now.

224
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,779
Like I'm digging now.

225
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,059
(Fuck me!)

226
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:40,579
Listen, I'll give you 35%.
That's your lot.

227
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,459
35.

228
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,499
~ You're late. ~ I had business.

229
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,969
How the fuck did you get me
out of that?

230
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,929
I need you today, brother.

231
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,219
~ And pulled some strings.
You all right? ~ I am now.

232
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,249
So, Arthur's back in charge now?

233
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:25,249
He's in charge of you and you're
both in charge of him.

234
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,409
~ Look-out duties only today.
~ Tommy, I'm getting sick of this...

235
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,979
Finn, you don't obey orders,
you don't come.

236
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,249
~ Johnny Dogs. ~ Tommy?

237
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:37,299
~ Your boys will meet us there?
~ The Lees will be there, Captain.

238
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:40,769
"Captain"?

239
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,129
Aye, we promoted you.

240
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,009
Well, the boys decided you're no
longer like a Sergeant Major.

241
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,569
Fucking those rich women
and using those fancy words.

242
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,609
I'd say you're more
like a captain these days.

243
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,899
Fine, well, I'll take
it as a compliment.

244
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:57,489
Just don't bloody shoot me.
Let's go to the Derby, boys.

245
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:59,739
Right then, load them up.

246
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,169
Hello?

247
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,379
No, I'm afraid Mr Shelby
is in London.

248
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,619
He can't be reached.
No, he won't be back today.

249
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,379
He's at the races.
The Epsom races. The Epsom Derby.

250
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:22,819
Can I ask who's calling?

251
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,339
I'm going to the station.

252
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,379
~ What's that? ~ That money's yours.

253
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,049
You take the money,

254
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:16,209
you get a train
and you start a new life

255
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,459
in London. I don't want to see
you here when I get back.

256
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:25,619
If I get back.

257
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:30,099
Everything's an "if"
in this Birmingham life.

258
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,849
You can write on Sundays.

259
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,329
And visit on Holy Days.

260
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,859
But I want you to wash this city
out your hair and your clothes.

261
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,889
It is what I should have
done at the start.

262
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,579
Now, I've got business to attend to.

263
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:54,819
I do love you, Michael.

264
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:58,099
I love you, too.

265
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,619
You'll miss your train.

266
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,219
My beloved greyhounds...

267
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:52,539
.. behold today's rabbit.

268
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,899
When I give you the signal, I want
you to send that man to his maker.

269
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,009
I decided to use you men,

270
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,569
because I couldn't trust the hearts
and the livers

271
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,299
of the English pansies and posies
they've given me as operatives.

272
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,139
Now...

273
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,219
.. this is a man of some
capability...

274
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,689
.. but I expect no excuses
and no failures.

275
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:27,409
The Red Right Hand of the
Ulster Volunteer Force

276
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,379
will not let you down, Mr Campbell.

277
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,819
The Red Right Hand.

278
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,169
Good luck, gentlemen.

279
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,129
♪ They're whispering his name

280
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,769
♪ Through this disappearing land

281
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:44,529
♪ But hidden in his coat

282
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,939
♪ Is a red right hand. ♪

283
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,449
Gentlemen, today we are not
fucking about.

284
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:01,249
I hope you've all obeyed instructions
and brought loaded firearms with you.

285
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:02,969
~ Yes.
~ Very good.

286
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,889
You all know that if you are lifted
on a race track these days

287
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:08,049
with a loaded weapon,
you get 20 years.

288
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,729
That's all right.
Today, you won't get lifted.

289
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,169
Because today, there'll be no
coppers around to lift you.

290
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,609
At exactly three o'clock,

291
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:17,449
there will be an incident
in the owner's enclosure.

292
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:20,729
And all the coppers on the track
will be diverted. All of them.

293
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,329
They'll be looking for someone.

294
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,889
~ So, you'll be free to operate at
will. ~ Looking for who?

295
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,889
Me. They'll be looking for me.

296
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,729
Now, while the coppers
are busy with me,

297
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,729
you will make your move on
Sabini's pitches.

298
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,129
You confiscate his takings,
you destroy his licences

299
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,249
and you do it at gunpoint.

300
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,329
He usually has police protection,
so they won't be armed.

301
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:40,129
We should aim to complete the take
over without a shot being fired.

302
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,329
Understood?

303
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:45,489
And remember, the licences are more
important than the takings.

304
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,329
All right. Before the fun begins, you
can all lay ten bob on Nom De Guerre.

305
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:53,249
I hear she's going to win.

306
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,009
Only beer beforehand, boys.

307
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,409
There'll be plenty of time
for rum and whisky after.

308
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:02,849
And remember, do not make a move
until three, when the coppers leave.

309
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,009
~ That is all. ~ Feeling lucky, John.

310
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:07,329
Incidents...
What are you going to do

311
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:11,809
that's going to make every copper
at the Derby look the other way?

312
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,529
Trust me, brother!

313
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,379
Over here. Over here.
Are you ready, boys?

314
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,099
Ten, please.

315
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,579
It's right here, mate.

316
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,739
She threw a shoe coming
out of the box.

317
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,129
She looks in fine shape.

318
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:12,049
Hello, hello, hello.

319
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,779
~ Should I be worried?
~ You should not.

320
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:25,449
Go and drink. Enjoy the day.

321
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,339
I'll come and find you
when the race is done.

322
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,729
That's nice, is that yours?

323
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:35,889
My mother wore it to
the Derby in 1895.

324
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:37,809
She was presented to Queen Victoria.

325
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,049
After the race,

326
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,289
I'll change in the horse box

327
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,769
and then come and join you up there
with the toffs. What do you say?

328
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:46,659
Hm... yeah.

329
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,979
You don't want me to join you.

330
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,619
It's fine. I'll stay
down here in the mud.

331
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,489
Whatever happens today,

332
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,819
it was good.

333
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,019
You mean win or lose?

334
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,699
Yeah. Win or lose.

335
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,689
You know I never watch the race.
I can't stand it.

336
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,539
I always like to find
somewhere dark and quiet...

337
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,419
Tommy?

338
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,969
If you can't find me up there,

339
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:42,899
I'll come and find you later.

340
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,249
What do you mean?

341
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:51,049
Whatever happens, May, no regrets.

342
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:52,539
No regrets.

343
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,339
And I will find you.

344
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,449
Right.

345
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:01,129
Remember that.

346
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,219
Bye.

Come on. Let's go.

357
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,409
I have to talk to you....

358
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:45,689
~ Grace. What are you doing here?
~ I have to talk to you.

359
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:49,739
Grace... this is not a good time.

360
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:56,739
This way. Excuse us.

361
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,249
Whatever it is, Grace,
it'll have to wait.

362
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,859
It can't wait.
It wasn't me who was at fault.

363
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,419
I'm pregnant.

364
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,459
The baby's yours.

365
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,849
But he'll believe... Make your
husband believe that it's his.

366
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,489
Is that what you want me to do?

367
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,289
Grace, I seriously have things to do.

368
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:27,049
~ It's not even worth the toss
of a coin this time. ~ Grace.

369
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,649
I have things to do. When they are...

370
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:31,809
When they are done, I will decide.

371
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:33,649
~ And when will that be?
~ After the race.

372
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,409
After the race?
After the fucking race, Tommy?

373
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:38,689
When the race is over,
I will decide what to do.

374
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,219
~ What to fucking do. All right?
~ But, Tommy...

375
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:45,609
I was right not to tell him.

376
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,609
I could have phoned him
and lied, but I didn't.

377
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:52,249
Just tell me I was right
not to phone and lie.

378
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,179
Agree with that, Tommy.

379
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,089
Yes. Yes, Grace.

380
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:00,539
Because the thing is...

381
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,979
.. I love you, not him.

382
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:09,739
That is a thing.

383
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:18,259
~ A baby, Thomas. ~ Yes.

384
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:24,009
Go to your race.

385
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,379
~ Where will you be? ~ I'll be waiting.

386
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:29,979
I'll wait where they lay their bets.

387
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:07,649
Found a lost sheep.

388
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:08,739
Come on, Lizzie.

389
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:14,329
~ What do you think? ~ About what?

390
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,659
~ About the dress?
~ Undo two buttons. Come on!

391
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:27,059
~ Oh, Tommy, I never thought
I'd see the like of this. ~ Yeah.

392
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:30,089
But I do know that I'm here to work.

393
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,689
~ So you may have noticed
I haven't taken a drink. ~ Here.

394
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,219
Take this. You might need it.

395
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:45,449
What's the work you want me
to do here today, Tommy?

396
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,289
Taking notes on a meeting?

397
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:50,289
No, Lizzie. You're not
here to take notes.

398
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,139
My shorthand won't be required.

399
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:54,779
Lizzie...

400
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:01,049
.. there's a man here.

401
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:04,409
And I need him to be separated from
the crowd and taken to a quiet place.

402
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,089
"A quiet place"?

403
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:08,299
~ Lizzie, I know what I said.
~ Yeah, you know.

404
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:12,089
You know you told me I shouldn't
do that kind of work any more.

405
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:14,409
I just need you to
isolate him is all.

406
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,569
No exceptions, you said.

407
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,219
I have drawn a map, all right?

408
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:21,729
Of where exactly
you need to take him.

409
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,489
For months, I made no exceptions,

410
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:26,369
~ Because you told me not to.
~ Lizzie...

411
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:28,569
just keep him busy at the
place marked with an X

412
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,179
and I'll get to you before
he can start, I promise. All right?

413
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:38,249
Mustn't smudge my eyes.
He might not like that.

414
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,449
Lizzie, this is the only time.

415
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:43,329
And after this, never again.

416
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:45,369
All right, I'll pay you
an extra five...

417
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,249
DO NOT talk to me about money now.

418
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,899
Not right now or I swear
I'll break this glass in your eyes.

419
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:57,409
"No exceptions"
has been no hardship.

420
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,579
You know why?

421
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,379
Hmm?

422
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:07,539
Doesn't matter.

423
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:11,929
~ Who is he? ~ To your right.

424
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:13,019
Soldier.

425
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,209
Smoking a cigarette.

426
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,049
Just be alone with him at three
when the race starts.

427
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,649
I'll do the rest. Yeah?

428
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:24,009
~ Got a piece of chalk? ~ Chalk?

429
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,209
It's how the soldiers know.
It doesn't matter.

430
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:28,099
Just give me the fucking chalk!

431
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:41,809
Lizzie, it is going
to be all right, eh?

432
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:45,249
I'll get to you, I promise,
before it can start.

433
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,339
I will be there.

434
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,969
Keep them fucking guns ready.

435
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:04,339
~ Keep them guns ready.
~ He's here, boss.

436
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:13,299
The coppers aren't moving. They're
stood there like fucking gargoyles.

437
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:17,619
Keep your wits about you, boys,
all right?!

438
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:56,489
'Ladies and gentlemen,
the race will begin in four minutes.

439
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,739
'Please make your way track side...'

440
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:21,019
Shouldn't you be busy?

441
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:26,659
When you plan something well
there's no need to rush.

442
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:32,219
You know something?
I actually trust you to do this.

443
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:41,049
Do you think there might
be some measure of respect

444
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,449
developing between us?

445
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:45,209
'Ladies and gentlemen,
the runners and riders

446
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:48,329
'are coming to order.
Please take your seats...'

447
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:51,299
Old foes who have grown
to admire each other?

448
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,139
And see each other's
professional virtues.

449
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,729
Personally... I think not.

450
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:03,259
I think not.

451
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,499
Well, I'll drink to that.

452
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:13,889
'Ladies and gentlemen, please be
upstanding for the national anthem.'

453
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,689
So, is the plan that you'll stay
together for ever?

454
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:28,249
Or perhaps she'll whore for you
and take her husband's money.

455
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:29,899
Is that the plan?

456
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,219
How wrong I was about her?

457
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,339
I was wrong about her, as well.

458
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:47,219
You once said to me,
that men like us can never be loved.

459
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:53,299
But she loves me. She told me.

460
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,539
She loves me.

461
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:03,539
And all you got was a bullet
and a fucking wolf head cane.

462
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:07,579
Well, bully for you.

463
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:13,259
This I know...

464
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:17,089
Ahead of you is damnation.

465
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:22,009
But I have the love of God
and the certainty of salvation.

466
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,499
I know what you did to Polly.

467
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:43,259
I know what happened
to Michael in jail.

468
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:51,889
Today, it will be me dead or you.

469
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:56,419
But whoever it is,
they'll wake up in hell tomorrow.

470
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:03,209
'Ladies and gentlemen,

471
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:06,219
'the runners and riders
are under starter's orders.'

472
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,419
'And they're off!'

473
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,219
Come on, girl. Come on.

474
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,299
At least make a showing.

475
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,179
Come on, Tommy.

476
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,059
What a pretty dress.

477
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:19,089
Take it off.

478
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:21,249
Shall we take this off first,
shall we?

479
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:25,179
~ Lift up your dress and show me
that you're clean. ~ Oh!

480
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,179
Do as you're told!

481
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:34,339
We should take it slow.
We've got all the time.

482
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:42,889
This area is closed off.

483
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:45,209
~ What? ~ The king will be coming this
way after the race.

484
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:48,019
This area is secured.
You'll have to go round.

485
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:05,809
Get the fuck off! Fuck off.

486
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:06,979
Get the fuck off me!

487
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,179
Oi!

488
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:30,769
RUSSELL!

489
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,099
Fuck!

490
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:19,849
Lizzie?

491
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:22,129
Where were you?
Where the fuck were you?

492
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,369
Give me the gun, Lizzie.

493
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:26,169
Lizzie. I'm sorry.

494
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,409
Fuck off! Fuck off!

495
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:31,539
Lizzie, just go. Go on. GO!

496
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:45,689
Officers...

497
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:49,409
Officers, I was taking a shit
and I heard voices, Irish voices.

498
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:50,769
Then I heard a shot.

499
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:53,299
I swear to God, there's
a soldier lying dead in there.

500
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,289
Get every man in uniform
around the king!

501
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,449
Every man in uniform
around the king!

502
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:02,579
Right now.

503
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:05,539
The IRA are on the course.

504
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:09,819
Everyone to the king!
The Royal Enclosure now!

505
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:14,529
All right, make ready, boys,
this is it.

506
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,529
Right, you four get round the back.

507
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,289
You take three of your boys...

508
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,409
Scudboat, come on... Show them guns.

509
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:22,489
Right, you come with us
and you stay back.

510
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:23,859
Let's go!

511
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:28,379
Put your hands in the air.

512
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,419
Turn around!

513
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:39,849
Is there a problem?

514
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:42,289
There are Fenians on the course.
A soldier's been shot.

515
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:44,649
Someone said there was
an Irishman in here.

516
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,059
That was correct.

517
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:52,899
Very sorry, sir.

518
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,779
Shadow Security to His Majesty.

519
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,289
I will now take
command of the situation.

520
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,259
MUSIC: Come On Over by Royal Blood

521
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:45,139
Mr Sabini, you're late.
Have a seat.

522
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:53,969
What happened to your nose?

523
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,089
You want to have that
brother of yours put down.

524
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:57,649
I tried that. He bit the vet.

525
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:02,409
I told the coppers that
you're a fucking Gypsy racketeer

526
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:04,369
Peaky Blinder and they're coming,

527
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:07,409
they are going to throw you
out before the king comes up here.

528
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:11,859
Well, from what I saw,
the police are a bit busy right now.

529
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:15,299
Did you win any money today,
Mr Sabini?

530
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,339
Where are our coppers?

531
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:24,169
I said to that sergeant one minute,
he said two,

532
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,849
and it's fucking ten.

533
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:27,939
Like I told you, they're a bit busy.

534
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:30,009
Same as my boys.

535
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,409
~ What the fuck does that mean?
~ What does that mean?

536
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:36,489
Well, my boys are on the track
having a little bonfire.

537
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,539
Gaming licences, you know.

538
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:46,219
Fuck...

539
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,889
You placed too much reliance
on the police

540
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:52,819
for your security, Mr Sabini.

541
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,299
That was a mistake.

542
00:40:57,819 --> 00:40:59,769
No, no. Think about who you are.

543
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:01,449
Think about where you are.

544
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:04,409
You pull a weapon,
you are the king's assassin.

545
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,499
Sit down and stay calm.

546
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,489
Good.

547
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:16,929
Now, your next mistake, Mr Sabini,

548
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:20,899
was breaking your promise
with Alfie Solomons.

549
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:27,219
You promised Alfie that his bookies
could come to Epsom.

550
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,579
He was very hurt when you said no.
He was very hurt.

551
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:37,859
And that is why me
and Alfie are back in business.

552
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,659
Police! All right!

553
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:58,299
It's all right, officers,
he's just a bad loser.

554
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:06,539
You fucking lose, you fucking
Gypsy bastard!! You lose!

555
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,809
What the fuck are you looking at?!

556
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,739
Step back! Move!

557
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,859
You are now a prisoner of
the Red Right Hand.

558
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:29,379
Now, take his hat and gun.
Get him up.

559
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:32,099
Easy...

560
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:36,929
Take a seat.

561
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:49,379
Now, you make
yourself nice and comfortable.

562
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:53,579
We're just going for a wee
drive, Mr Shelby.

563
00:42:56,819 --> 00:42:58,179
Let's go.

564
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:35,339
I guessed
and then John confirmed it.

565
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:39,259
Guessed what? Who are you?

566
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:44,659
I'm May Carleton.
I trained Tommy Shelby's horse.

567
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:48,339
And you're the woman who
he said was going to sail away.

568
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:54,539
I see he didn't tell you about me.

569
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:59,649
He did tell me about you.
I wonder if that's significant.

570
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:02,049
Tell me what about you?

571
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:03,979
You have any idea where he is?

572
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:08,099
I'm waiting for him here.

573
00:44:15,939 --> 00:44:18,049
There's been trouble on the track.

574
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:20,769
All the bookies
have had their licences burned.

575
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,689
Shouldn't you be down with
the horses...

576
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:25,809
Which means they will have to
re-apply for their legal pitches.

577
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:28,489
It's all part of Tommy's
plan for the future.

578
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,369
What do you know about Tommy's
future?

579
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:32,489
The applications will be
denied, of course.

580
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:35,779
And all the pitches will be
allocated instead to Tommy's
bookies.

581
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:40,939
I know because I'll make sure of it.

582
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,659
I have influence with the board.

583
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:50,689
There's business and there's love.

584
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:52,259
Is there?

585
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,779
With Thomas Shelby?

586
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:00,409
What do you want from him?

587
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,139
The same as you.

588
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:06,139
I want to feel alive.

589
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:18,659
Did he tell you my name?

590
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:26,099
My name is Grace.

591
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:37,809
In your statement to the House, sir,
I believe that you should say

592
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,889
that witnesses heard the killers
say that they were

593
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,449
members of the IRA
and that the killing

594
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:49,099
was in retribution for actions of
the Field Marshal in County Cork.

595
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:55,369
Oh... Our friend from Birmingham?

596
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,019
He has been taken care of.

597
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:02,129
Oh... A very good day, sir.

598
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,449
Thank...

599
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:09,579
Oh... Sorry, I must go. Goodbye.

600
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:14,779
Polly.

601
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,459
Tommy told me you'd be here.

602
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:28,129
And I told Tommy it should be me
who finishes you.

603
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:37,409
Small and weak.
That's how you like it, isn't it?

604
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:40,699
Well, this time small
and weak has got a gun.

605
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:45,489
You wouldn't do that here.

606
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:48,009
No?

607
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,489
Do you see any coppers? I don't.

608
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:54,819
They're all around
your precious king.

609
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,779
Polly. Polly...

610
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,209
~ Some part of you...
~ I have no parts.

611
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:21,849
Some part of you wanted me, as well.
I know that.

612
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:22,939
I felt it.

613
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:28,539
And sure as hell some part of me
wants you still.

614
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:32,539
Not just that part.

615
00:47:33,779 --> 00:47:35,219
Some part of my soul.

616
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,729
Some part of my soul.

617
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:41,169
Curious how that is to me...

618
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:43,139
And curious that it should be you.

619
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,259
Opposites, perhaps.

620
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:56,369
Opposites. And that... that thing
sticking in my heart you own.

621
00:47:56,419 --> 00:48:00,249
You own part of that heart.
You do. You do, Polly.

622
00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:01,419
You do.

623
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,499
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

633
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:32,449
Get up!

634
00:49:32,499 --> 00:49:35,689
Lizzie. What the fuck
are you doing here?

635
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,369
Working for Tommy.
Same as all of us.

636
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:38,929
You work for the Blinders?

637
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:40,809
What happened to you?

638
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:41,929
Fell over.

639
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,649
Don't fucking give me that.

640
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:46,819
Lizzie... Come here, come on,
come here.

641
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:50,419
Come here... Were you working?

642
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,089
Yeah? Thought you'd earn yourself
a few bob at the races, eh?

643
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:58,249
This has got to stop, Lizzie.

644
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,449
It's got to stop.
Tommy has already told you.

645
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,449
The toffs at the races
are the worst. You know that.

646
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:08,209
Come here, come here.
Look at me...

647
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:10,369
Cheer up. We won.

648
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:13,289
We fucking took Epsom!

649
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:16,089
We kicked the Cockneys'
fucking arses.

650
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:17,609
Congratu-fucking-lations.

651
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:19,729
We fucking beat them, all right.

652
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:21,809
John didn't even shoot his gun.

653
00:50:21,859 --> 00:50:25,659
We're kings.
Kings of the fucking world!

654
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:28,689
John?

655
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:32,099
I don't see the same thing
in your eyes that I see in Tommy's.

656
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:35,249
You should get out.

657
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:37,179
You should get out.

658
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,529
Where is Tommy anyway?

659
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:53,059
Were any of you boys in France?

660
00:52:00,299 --> 00:52:01,899
Allow a man a cigarette?

661
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:09,539
The Somme. Black Woods.

662
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:16,099
The Somme. The Bulge.

663
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:19,939
Smoke.

664
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:42,339
So fucking close.

665
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:50,939
So fucking close.

666
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:04,739
Oh... And there's a woman.

667
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:07,579
Yeah.

668
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:10,379
A woman...

669
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:15,019
.. I love.

670
00:53:16,419 --> 00:53:18,099
And I got close.

671
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:27,659
I nearly got FUCKING EVERYTHING!

672
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:54,659
Ah, what the fuck.

673
00:53:57,259 --> 00:53:58,779
Get it done, boys.

674
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:13,489
Comrade, we have our orders.

675
00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:15,659
You know how it is.

676
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:22,219
I know how it is.

677
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:38,649
In the bleak mid winter.

678
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,529
At some point in the near future,

679
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:49,379
Mr Churchill will want to
speak to you in person, Mr Shelby.

680
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:54,569
He has a job for you.

681
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:56,059
We will be in touch.

682
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:00,179
Get out of the grave, tinker!

683
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,329
Be on your fucking way!
