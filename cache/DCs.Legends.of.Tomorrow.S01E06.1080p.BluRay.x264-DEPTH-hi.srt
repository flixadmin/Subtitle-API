This doesn't look like

21
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,815
we want to linger out in the open.

22
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:09,988
That looks a lot
like a Palmer Tech building,

23

<i>but why does it have a Smoak logo on it?</i>

24

Wait, this is Star City.

25
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,829
I thought you said the timeline was safe.

26
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:21,332
Yes, Star City was intact in 2016.

27

Hey, Oliver, look.
I know it's been a long time,

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,772
but don't you remember that Rip Hunter

33
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,565
recruited us to become Legends?

34
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,278
I never heard of any Legends.

35
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,203
RIP: Get back!

36
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,045
This guy a friend of yours?
I don't like him.

37
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,843
- What are you doing?
- It's called shooting back.

38
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,220
This can't be the Green Arrow.

40
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,642
That's not Oliver Queen.

Sure dresses like him.

42
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,234
Shoots arrows like him.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,212
Well, whoever he is,
I don't plan on sticking around

44
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,596
to get shish-kebabed by this dude.

45
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,491
Kid's right.
Let's stay behind and kill him.

46
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,954
We need to return to the ship!

47
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,346
All right, Rip,
tell us the truth.

48
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,765
You've all seen how
the timeline is malleable,

49
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,433
in flux until it is set.

50
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,104
Well, this future is not set.

51
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,286
Remember when I told you it was dangerous

52
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,516
for any of you to know too much
about your own futures?

53
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,528
Well, the events that you dread
could very well come to be

54
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,321
due to your actions to prevent them.

55
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,615
You know what I think?
I think you think too much.

56
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:18,822
Believe me when I tell you

57
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,110
that the best thing for
yourselves and for this mission

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,997
is to make the repairs
to the <i>Waverider</i> here in 2046,

59
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,790
then head back to your own time

60
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,751
and make sure that
none of this ever comes to be.

61
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,674
It looks like the whole
propulsion system is jacked.

62
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,277
How do you even know
what we're looking at here?

63
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,654
Doesn't matter if it takes you
down the road or through time,

64
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:39,971
an engine's still an engine.

65
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,765
How long will it take you
to make repairs?

66
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,252
I'm not too sure, but it would go

67
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,852
a lot faster if I had some help.

68
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,478
Maybe Kendra could lend me a hand?

69
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,523
Enlist whoever is free to help.
I have this to contend with.

70
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,233
This is the neuromorphic interface

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,040
for Gideon's logic and navigation matrix.

72
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,696
Without it, Gideon cannot function.

73
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,757
Well, that explains how we got
stranded here in the future.

74
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,261
Palmer Tech was working on
a self-learning neuromorphic cortex.

75
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,166
<i>They surely would've
gone to prototype by 2046.</i>

76
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:04,996
We are gonna need that prototype.

77
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,599
Oh, Palmer Tech is now
Smoak Technologies,

78
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,124
but I'm sure I can still get us in.

79
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,209
As I said, we must keep you and Ms. Lance

80
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,520
separate from your future homes.

81
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:12,545
In any case,

82
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,672
there's a reason
why I recruited individuals

83
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:17,300
adept at misappropriating
others' property.

84
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,221
It's not money, it's not jewels,
it's not a valuable artifact.

85
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,474
You're just lucky I'd steal
anything right about now.

86
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,976
- As I suspected.
- We'll get your gizmo.

87
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,395
You just get this bucket flying again.

88
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,773
- I'm coming with.
- No. No, you are not.

89
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,900
You're too emotionally
connected to this city.

90
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,361
- We've been over this--
- I'm over you.

91
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,987
You've got us on a mission

92
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,594
to change the timeline for yourself,

93
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,908
and you won't even let us
look at our futures?

94
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,577
Now, I know this city
better than anyone else

95
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:47,038
and you're going to need me out there.

96
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,832
So, either I'm coming with,

97
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,668
or we can find out if the Time Masters

98
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,354
are as good at teaching people to fight

99
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,879
as the League of Assassins.

101
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:04,097
So, the rest of the team's on
a field trip to Palmer Tech,

102
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,224
now Smoak Technologies.

103
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,309
Palmer Tech sounds better,
right? Be honest.

104
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,812
Honestly, they sound about the same.

105
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,772
Even assuming our compatriots return

106
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,190
with a neuromorphic prototype,

107
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:16,859
we'll still need to prepare
Gideon for the new device.

108
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,696
And the engines could
definitely use some loving.

109
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,864
Actually, I could use
an extra pair of hands.

110
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,711
Oh, Raymond, why don't you
and Ms. Saunders

111
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,781
continue repairing Gideon?

112
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,995
And I'll assist Jefferson
with the engines.

a potential future,

115
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,839
it doesn't matter
if we kill anyone here, right?

116
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,508
Well, to avoid the risk of a paradox,

117
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,846
it's probably best
to refrain from killing anyone.

118
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,015
I'm not gonna promise anything.

119
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,935
My sister's apartment
used to be over here.

120
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,104
I seem to remember
something about your father

121
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,605
being a police captain?

122
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,357
Your point?

123
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,609
He did one hell of a job.

124
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,612
My father, and everyone else,

125
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,614
would never have let this happen.

126
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,367

You really are pretty good at this.

Yeah, I was a shipyard welder in 1944.

321
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,319
Just some fool in a green hoodie.

322
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,987
It's Christmas every day.

323
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,656
Ah. My sweets.

324
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,666
(SIGHS) Slade had a son?

325
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,086
Look, Oliver tried.

326
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,714
He tried to raise an army
to fight Deathstroke, but...

327
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,884
Look, everyone just wanted to evacuate.

328
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,845
How can you save a city
that doesn't want to be saved?

329
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,848
A moment.

330
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,326
Sara, I know what you must be thinking,

331
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,350
but none of what has
transpired here is your fault.

332
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,312
Nor do you have the means to change it.

333
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,065
But Vandal Savage's future is preventable.

334
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:26,820
I implore you, please,
stay focused on our mission.

335
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,760
We're very grateful for your assistance,

336
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:34,024
but we really must be moving
along to Smoak Technologies.

337
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,914
What for? That place
has been cleared out for years.

338
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:40,084
But a lot of Felicity Smoak's
projects got relocated.

339
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,502
Where?

340
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,629
Come on.

341
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,179
You didn't say that Felicity's
equipment would be here.

342
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,724
Well, where else did you think it'd be?

343
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:12,908
(RIP WHISTLES)

344
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:14,785
Mr. Queen's base of operations

345
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,620
appears to have seen better days.

346
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,331
GREEN ARROW: <i>Yeah, well...</i>

347
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,291
The place got attacked

348
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,877
after Grant Wilson
outed Queen as the Green Arrow.

349
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,176
Let's just find what we're
looking for and get out of here.

350
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,141
MAN: <i>Whoever's there, get out!</i>

351
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,684
<i>I said, get out!</i>

352
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:39,935
(GUN COCKS)

353
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,312
Whoever you are, get out.

354
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,525
Oliver?

355
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,449
Hello, Sara.

356
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,827
Long time no see.

357
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,003
- Is that...
- GREEN ARROW: <i>Oliver Queen.</i>

358
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,923
Everyone thinks that you're dead.

359
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,341
They're not wrong.

360
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,012
Put the arrow down, John.
You're embarrassing yourself.

361
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,015
- John?
- John Diggle, Jr.

362
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,689
My dad is dead
because I couldn't save him.

363
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,358
I don't deserve his name.

364
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,569
I'm Connor Hawke.

365
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,945
So, you won't take his name,

366
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,616
but it's all right to parade
around in someone else's outfit?

367
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,117
Well, someone has to.

368
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,038
Because the last time that
I checked, you were dead.

369
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,207
Everyone thought you were dead.

370
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,377
I've been trying to
hold this city by myself

371
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,047
because I thought you were gone.

372
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,721
What happened to you?

373
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:02,309
To Laurel, to my dad, Felicity--

374
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,395
They're gone. All of them.

375
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,730
What do you mean?

376
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,067
- Ollie--
- They're gone.

377
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,945
<i>What do you want me to say, Sara?</i>

378
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:16,740
30 years ago, you and Ray
hopped on a spaceship

379
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,951
and you never came back.

380
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,118
We will.

381
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,454
I don't want to say that

382
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,039
things would have ended differently

383
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,646
if you and Ray had been here, but...

384
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,671
But if we were,
it could've made the difference.

385
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,589
If you thought I was dead,
what are you doing here?

386
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,925
We were looking
for a neuromorphic prototype

387
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,760
that Felicity Smoak was working on.

388
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,847
Felicity left after everything
that happened.

389
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,349
<i>Everything her company was working on</i>

390
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,185
is being kept in a warehouse
at Adams and O'Neil.

391
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,272
The entry code is 4-5-8-7.

392
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,608
- Thank you, Mr. Queen--
- You found your way in.

393
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,193
Find your way out.

394
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,452
I gotta admit,
that wasn't bad advice, Grey.

395
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,246
So, things went well with Ms. Saunders?

396
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,414
Oh, yeah.

397
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,701
Well, I have more good news.

398
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,626
I was able to very subtly confirm

399
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,421
that Raymond has no romantic inclinations

400
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,965
towards your crush object.

401
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,301
Okay, well, once we've
sorted out my love life,

402
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,469
we need to update your vocabulary.

403
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,929
- Can't wait.
- (CHUCKLES)

404
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,256
I'm gonna go check on Kendra.

405
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,932
- Hey, confidence.
- Yeah.

406
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,854
I got the inertial dampeners back online.

407
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,457
Once the rest of the team returns
with the neuromorphic prototype,

408
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,649
Gideon will be good to go.

409
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,985
Excellent. The sooner
we get out of here, the better.

410
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,320
And thank you, by the way.

411
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,487
Whatever for?

412
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,822
Well, until you mentioned it,

413
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,909
I hadn't really thought
about Kendra in that way.

414
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,159
Because, you know,

415
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,726
she and Carter were destined
to be together in this lifetime.

416
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,331
But it's all changed.

417
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:51,543
And, you know, she's quirky,
and funny, and beautiful,

418
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:53,378
and a pretty good welder.

419
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,796
So, you know,

420
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:58,383
what about all those things
we were talking about?

421
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,427
- The mission and so forth.
- Oh...

422
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,472
We're all adults here, right?

423
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,224
Getting to know each other
a little bit better,

424
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,235
it's not gonna stop us
from saving the world.

425
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,021
Oh, boy.

- (CLATTERING)
- (GLASSES SHATTER)

428
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,494
Who invited them?

429
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:26,870
Word on the street is

430
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,557
Deathstroke is pissed about something.

431
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:29,873
Deathstroke?

432
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,208
What kind of name is that?

433
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,171
Party's over.

434
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,715
Everyone hit the streets,
hit everybody on them.

435
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,093
I want Green Arrow dead by morning.

436
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,845
Listen, pal. This is my gang.

437
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,348
The only orders they take are from me.

438
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,851
Hmm. Might be your gang,
but it's my city.

439
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,607
Green Arrow is running
with a female assassin in white

440
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,567
and a Brit in a brown coat.

441
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,069
Kill 'em all.

442
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,780
(SCOFFS)

443
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,540
You heard the man. Let's go!

444
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,250
Looks like your new minions

445
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:16,461
are about to go on a citywide
manhunt for Rip and Sara.

446
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:19,423
- So what?
- They're gonna kill our friends.

447
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,758
Since when did they become our friends?

448
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:22,926
You tell me.

449
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,429
You and Raymond seemed to get
pretty tight back in Russia.

450
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:26,997
I've never been tight with anyone!

451
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,474
Mick, it's time to go.

452
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,395
- You're not the boss of me!
- Actually, I am.

453
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,028
Okay, let's both take a deep breath.

454
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,364
(INHALING)
And we'll make ourselves a deal.

<i>You help me get to Rip and Sara.</i>

456
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,745
Once they're safe,
we can have this conversation.

457
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,038
Fair?

458
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,418
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

459
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,801
Thank you for agreeing
to accompany us, Mr. Diggle.

460
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,553
It's Connor.

461
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,239
It's not like I needed to stick around

462
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,806
Oliver Queen for anything.

463
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,776
- Did you know?
- Know what?

464
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,945
That this is what would happen
to my city.

465
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,782
Oliver said that the only reason
that things got so bad

466
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,634
was because Ray and I
weren't there to help.

467
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,298
Well, I suspected that might be the case,

468
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,662
but that's actually a good thing, hmm.

469
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,165
Once our mission is complete,

470
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,627
and you and Dr. Palmer are
returned to Star City in 2016,

471
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:42,339
you will both be present
to stop Grant Wilson's Uprising.

472
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,841
This future is only a potential timeline.

473
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,678
So this version of Star City,
this doesn't have to happen?

474
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,847
Correct. The future is always in flux.

475
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,850
Hopefully, this will never come to pass.

476
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,853
This world isn't real.

477
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,981
Let's split up and cover more ground.

478
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,786
Hello, beautiful.

00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,216
(GRUNTING)

481
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,766
There's too many of them!

482
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,520
(ENGINE REVVING)

483
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,778
Gentlemen, your timing is exemplary.

484
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,155
(GRUNTING)

485
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,575
Where's Connor?

486
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,461
He's been taken.

487
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,176
These are Grant Wilson's men.

488
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,013
Mmm. The guy with the half-face
and the body armor

489
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,849
has a real mad-on
for the kid in the hoodie.

490
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,435
Can I have a word?

491
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,979
- Rip--
- I know what you're going to say.

492
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,624
- We have to get him back.
- Yes, that.

493
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,484
But you're forgetting
this future is only a potential timeline.

494
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,319
Yeah, where Grant Wilson kills Connor.

495
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,838
Wilson's not going to murder Connor

496
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:12,342
because once you're returned to 2016,

497
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,242
there won't be a Wilson or a Connor.

498
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,337
At least not
as we know them both right now.

499
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,539
Now that we rescued them,
let's have that chat.

500
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,251
You want to stay here.

501
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,859
I thought I made that pretty clear.

502
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,506
What I'm less clear on is why you don't.

503
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,383
A city of thieves and criminals.

504
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,343
Sounds like a lot of competition.

505
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,719
Then we wipe 'em out.

506
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,346
What I did to that other guy,

507
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,473
we do the same thing
to this Grant Wilson,

508
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,767
and anyone else stupid enough
to get in our way.

509
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,812
Take a look around, Snart.

510
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,897
We're living the dream.

511
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,316
Yeah. Speaking of which...

512
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:49,693
(GRUNTS)

513
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,195
Sleep tight, buddy.

514
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,031
What happened to him?

515
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:56,950
Difference of opinion.

516
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,451
Right.

517
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,372
We need to get this, and
Mr. Rory, back to the <i>Waverider.</i>

518
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,881
Oh, Jefferson, perfect timing.

519
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,259
I'm in need of your mechanical acumen.

520
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,844
Okay, let's do it.

521
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,267
- What?
- What did you do?

522
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,703
I don't know what you're talking about.

523
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,937
You did something. What did you do?

524
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,230
Nothing. Nothing.

525
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,858
You know, this psychic connection thing,

526
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,318
it goes both ways.

527
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,837
And the moment that I walked in here,

528
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,113
I started feeling
really anxious and guilty.

529
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,760
You feel guilty. So, what did you do?

530
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,801
In my defense, I was only acting
in your best interests--

531
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:39,909
What did you do?

532
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,678
It's possible, in my attempt to discern

533
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,063
whether Dr. Palmer had competing
feelings for Ms. Saunders--

534
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,165
Oh, you didn't.

535
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,042
I may have inadvertently prompted him

536
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,128
to think of her in ways
in which he hadn't.

537
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,629
- Grey!
- I'm sorry.

538
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,381
My intentions were honorable.

539
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,425
(SIGHS)

540
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,635
Ah, it's cool.

541
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,264
- Is it?
- Yeah.

542
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,224
I mean, nothing's really changed.

543
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,392
Apart from the fact that

544
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,436
now I've got competition
I didn't have before.

545
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:11,232
But I should still have
confidence in myself, right?

546
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,860
Right.

547
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,614
Well, they're back. Where is Mr. Rory?

548
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,657
Sleeping it off.

549
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,451
We have the neuromorphic prototype.

550
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,952
Any luck with the ship's engines?

551
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,329
Yeah, it's all good.

552
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,582
<i>Is there something wrong, Ms. Lance?</i>

553
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,960
Well, all my friends and family are dead.

554
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,088
Except for Oliver Queen

555
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,632
who happens to be dead inside
and missing his left arm.

556
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,966
Sara, I have told you--

557
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,219
That this is just a potential future.

558
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,972
And that it's all gonna go back
when we return to 2016.

559
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,808
If we return.

560
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,601
<i>But what if we don't?</i>

561
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,645
We all know Carter's not coming back.

562
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,814
It's not like we have
the safest line of work.

563
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:55,276
I think, if Sara wants to
stay and help, then we should.

564
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,821
I mean, that's what
we signed up for, to be heroes.

565
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,072
I agree with Jefferson.

566
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,365
Yes, of course you both do,

567
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,134
because neither of you
understand the pitfalls

568
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,368
of changing the timeline.

569
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,828
<i>Meddling with the future</i>

570
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,163
is arguably more dangerous
than changing the past

571
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,748
because it is still in flux.

572
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,251
Your wife and son's death
are in the future.

573
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,753
You want us to change that.

574
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,672
Do not play that card with me.

575
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,923
<i>So what?</i>

576
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,883
Are you only willing to risk the timeline

577
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,051
if it's your own family?

578
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:22,429
I am not just trying to save my family.

579
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:26,724
And I'm not just trying to save
one city, but the entire world.

580
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,310
I'm not the one being selfish, Sara.

581
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,687
Go to hell.

582
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,814
Most likely.

583
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,693
If you want to go and save
Mr. Hawke, then be my guest.

584
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,821
I'll keep the ship here for
one hour. Then we're leaving.

585
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,365
With you on board or without.

586
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,331
Hello, Mick.

587
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,583
You son of a bitch!

588
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,084
Just calm down.

589
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,836
You lied to me!

590
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,547
Wouldn't be the first time.

591
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,799
<i>Remember the Del Rey currency exchange?</i>

592
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,719
The Blackhawk armored car job?

593
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,512
If I hadn't lied to you on those scores,

594
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,390
we'd both be in prison or dead.

595
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,517
<i>I'm the brains. You're the muscle.</i>

596
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,561
That's how it's always been.

597
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:15,190
And, on occasion,
I've had to call some audibles.

598
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:17,775
You have a habit of
getting in your own way, Mick.

599
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,487
Hmm. You're right.

600
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,155
You've lied to me about jobs before.

601
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,949
But then again, you lied to me
about this being a job.

602
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,327
It's not about the score anymore for you.

603
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,662
You'd rather save the world

604
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,664
than be my partner.

605
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,416
A real team player.

606
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,044
'Cause that's what it's gonna
take to defeat Savage.

607
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:39,506
Then what? More money? More power?

608
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,341
A life of leisure and sin?

609
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,134
Don't you get it, Mick?

610
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,178
We take out Savage,
this immortal monster,

611
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:46,666
can't you see what that gets us?

612
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,431
No. Tell me.

613
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,809
We'd be the two baddest
sons of bitches of all time!

614
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,686
I don't want a ticker-tape parade.

615
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,358
You know what I want from this world.

616
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,277
Yes.

617
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,446
To see it burn.

618
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,990
You lay a hand on me again,

619
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,076
you'll burn, too.

620
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,624
Oliver.

621
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,378
Oliver.

622
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,215
I thought I told you to go.

623
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,800
Grant Wilson has Connor.

624
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,927
They're gonna kill him.

625
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,304
He knew what he was signing up for.

626
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:31,391
And you know there's
nothing I can do to help him.

627
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,268
That's not the Oliver Queen that I know.

628
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,812
Maybe I'm not that person anymore.

629
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:41,234
Look at me, Sara. I'm literally
half the man I used to be.

630
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,861
Then that's the half this city needs.

631
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,656
He's got too many men, Ollie.

632
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,700
I can't do this by myself.

633
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,159
What about your friends?

634
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,995
I'm on my own.

635
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:53,705
Unless I'm not.

636
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,335
Come on, Sara.

637
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:02,338
I never got the chance to ask
Connor why he wears the hood.

638
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,048
But I know why.

639
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:07,427
It's because this city

640
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,512
will always need a Green Arrow.

641
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,692
Is the ship ready for departure?

642
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,819
No, Ms. Lance is not yet on board.

643
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,237
I gave her an hour.

644
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,507
- Hardly enough time for--
- And she's been 90 minutes.

645
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,131
How much longer are we supposed to wait?

646
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:34,912
It doesn't matter
that this is a potential future.

647
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,874
It doesn't matter that
this may never come to pass.

648
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,375
It may never be real.

649
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,836
For Sara, this is very real.

650
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,339
I know, which is why
I gave her an extra 30 minutes.

662
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,070
Certainly more than I want
to maroon Sara here.

663

She's our friend,

<i>So, where to next, Captain?</i>

00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,227
Well, the beauty of this mission is that

806
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:43,544
the real question is not where,

00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:44,753
but when.

808
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,715
<i>In which case, I suggest
that we next hit Savage</i>

809
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,592
when he least expects it.
