
84
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,190
What's going on there?

85
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,610
Get the power back on!

87
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,240
Tell him that the prisoners
are contained...

88
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,870
and that you're working on the power.

89
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,000
Tell him!

90
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,960
And that door there, where does it lead?

91
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,170
To... to cell block two...

92
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,210
No cell blocks!

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,590
I need a safe way out of here.

124
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,130
Lower your weapons.

125
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,800
Lower your weapons!

126
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,180
Don't shoot!

128
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,390
Stop!

134
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,940
You can't go in there!

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's dangerous!

136
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,710
<font color="#ff00ff">[ROARING]</font>

137
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,210
It's dangerous!

492
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,840
Son of a bitch!

501
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,050
Son of a bitch!

522
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,690
You Neanderthal...

765
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,840
If I get a whiff of any
funny business, smuggler...

766
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,720
I will not hesitate to kill you.

767
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,100
In fact... I am just looking for a reason.
Understand?

768
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,940
Are you a parrot, cop?
You keep repeating the same thing.

810
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,890
Yes, hello, miss.

811
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,770
I'd like to place a call to
the United States. A very sick relative.

813
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,820
Correct. Yes... The number is...
