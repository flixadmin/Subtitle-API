Form up!

8
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,375
Let's kill the beast.

9
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,875
For glory! Hyah!

10
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,333
Be on guard.

11
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,250
Form the line!

12
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,791
Hold!

13
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,750
The last I could find.

14
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,916
Did you take the tapestries
into town like Father asked?

15
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,333
This morning.

16
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,541
We should take the furs too,
and the drapes.

17
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,541
Not the drapes!

18
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,916
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

19
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,625
They serve a purpose.

20
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,541
Floria, our people are freezing.

21
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,541
And starving.

22
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,791
Who'd come this far north?

23
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,125
Elodie, why are they leaving?

24
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,333
There's nothing left
for them here, Floria.

25
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,875
I don't have enough.
Please, I'm hungry.

26
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,416
For food, join the line!

27
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,541
- Keep to one side.
- I'm starving.

28
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,000
All right then.

29
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,708
Get off! It's mine!

30
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,833
-Hey! Give me back my food.
-Get off of me, old man!

31
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,000
You've had enough!

32
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,291
Share this
with your sister. Go on.

33
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,750
- Could you see who it was?
- A stranger, my lady.

34
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,083
They may take
whatever wood they can carry.

35
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,625
-I'll see to it.
-Come on, Flor.

36
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,125
- Move on.
- Yes.

37
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,666
- Get in line.
- Give it to me.

38
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,666
- I want to meet her first.
- Father?

39
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,250
You must be Elodie.

40
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,833
I am.

41
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,833
She will do.

42
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,541
- We await your decision.
- Thank you, Your Holiness.

43
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,333
Please, this way.

44
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
Father, what's happening?

45
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,291
Who is that?

46
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,000
Stepmother?

47
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,750
Well, what is it?

48
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,291
From the Queen of Aurea.

49
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,125
A proposal.

50
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,250
- Oh, my goodness.
- Huh…

51
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,500
-I have made a match.
-May I?

52
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,791
Uh-huh.

53
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,041
He is a prince.

54
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,791
A prince?

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,875
I know you've always wished to travel,
as did your mother.

56
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,125
Go. See the world.

57
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:16,291
This man, he has a fleet of ships,
carriages full of gold.

58
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,666
That's no reason to marry.

59
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,041
We need this.

60
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,916
Our stores are empty.

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,041
We will not make it to the thaw.

62
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,583
Your people need you.

63
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,208
Hey.

64
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,208
This is who we are.

65
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,000
Get to the port side.

66
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,791
Port side.

67
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,625
Elodie, what's the matter?

68
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,541
Nothing.

69
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,416
Father says it's natural to be nervous

70
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,666
about meeting
your new husband and his family.

71
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,791
They're strangers.

72
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,000
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea
until Father sprang this on me.

73
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,250
Mind the lines.

74
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,666
Oh!

75
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,333
Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?

76
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,041
Come down here.

77
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,166
Come on.

78
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,833
This is how you
want your prince to meet you?

79
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,958
Scared, cold as a corpse.

80
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,208
Nose all drippy and wet.

81
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,666
What have I been
telling you this entire trip?

82
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,583
- First impressions are everything.
- Hmm.

83
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on, lift up.

84
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,125
Look at that.

85
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,750
I have good news, girls.

86
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,083
The captain informs me
we approach Aurea's coastline.

87
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,083
It should be any time now.

88
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,291
Father.

89
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,875
What in the world?

90
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,291
Looks almost… almost like a--

91
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,458
A dragon.

92
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,291
It's okay.

93
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,708
{\an8}Oh, my heavens.

94
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,958
{\an8}It's magnificent.

95
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,500
{\an8}My lords, my ladies,

96
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,125
{\an8}be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

97
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,958
{\an8}The royal family is at prayer,

98
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,208
{\an8}but word has been sent of your arrival.

99
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,041
In the meantime,
your rooms have been made ready.

100
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,000
If you will follow me.

101
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,333
{\an8}Is this a dream?

102
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,291
{\an8}If so, can I move in and never wake up?

103
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,916
{\an8}If you want these people
to think we belong here,

104
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,166
{\an8}you can't act so easily impressed.

105
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,000
{\an8}What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?

106
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,083
{\an8}I think I had
a rather limited definition of wealthy.

107
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,458
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.

108
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,125
A bath has been drawn

109
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,916
and supper has been carried hence.

110
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,541
At first light,
I shall return to convey you

111
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,666
to meet His Royal Highness.

112
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

113
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,458
Floria,
stop touching everything.

114
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,791
Is something wrong?

115
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,250
-I just hope he's kind.
-Hmm.

116
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,500
-And well-read.
-Yeah.

117
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,083
Handsome.

118
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,333
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

119
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,708
She can use the time
to settle in, as we all could.

120
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, indeed.

121
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,875
Come.

122
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,375
M'lady.

123
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
Everyone's waiting.

124
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Ellie?

125
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,625
I can't sleep.

126
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,375
I still can't believe
you're going to live here from now on.

127
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,416
You and me both.

128
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,125
I keep thinking,
if only Mother were alive,

129
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,583
I could just
talk to her about all of this.

130
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,166
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

131
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,333
She means well, even if she is a bit…

132
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,125
Exhausting?

133
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,333
It'll be fine. You'll see.

134
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,375
You're Elodie. You can do anything.

135
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,458
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What is your greatest strength?</i></font>

136
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
I always tell the truth,
Your Majesty.

137
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,708
Some might call that a weakness.

138
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,166
Do you know your heart?

139
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,833
I believe I do, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,041
And what is it telling you now?

141
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,125
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me
to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.

142
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,625
Arise, Elodie.

143
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm Henry.

144
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,416
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

145
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,291
We all are.

146
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,041
My son understates our joy.

147
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,125
And if I may say so,

148
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,291
your father has understated your beauty.

149
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,500
I've never known my father to understate
much of anything, Your Majesty.

150
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,666
I see she arrives
with some wit.

151
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,083
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

152
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,625
And you must be Floria.

153
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,666
It seems even a harsh clime
can grow the fairest flowers.

154
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,583
I love your castle.

155
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,041
I mean, I really love it.

156
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:24,958
Like, a lot…

157
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:27,875
Your Majesty.

158
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,458
You are to make yourself at home, child.

159
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:35,208
We elders have some trivial matters
like weddings to attend to.

160
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,208
Yes…

161
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,291
Your correspondence
made mention of some particulars

162
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,416
you wish to discuss in person.

163
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,333
-The two of us can confer in private.
-Yes.

164
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,625
It's nothing to bore
our young people with.

165
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,958
They have a far more
important task at hand.

166
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,958
They must get to know each other.

167
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,125
Do you have any questions of me?

168
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,375
Questions of what subject?

169
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,458
You may choose the subject.

170
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,708
What do you think about me?

171
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,208
Pardon?

172
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,625
Well, you seem disinterested at best,
which is your prerogative,

173
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,416
but I'd like to know if the person
I'm being guilted into marrying

174
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,875
truly likes me or not.

175
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,541
If my attitude offends you,
I do apologize. It was not my intent.

176
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:43,750
However, I was unaware that, um,
you were being guilted into anything.

177
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,916
The land where I come from
is exactly how your mother explained.

178
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,125
Harsh and barren.

179
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,083
This union will save us.

180
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,708
I've made my peace with it.

181
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,000
My happiness is a small price to pay
for the future of my people.

182
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,750
Is something wrong?

183
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,375
It's just…

184
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,750
In the letter you sent in advance
of your arrival, you sounded different.

185
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,541
Different. In what way?

186
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,625
Far more, um…

187
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,791
flowery.

188
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,458
Maybe that's because
my stepmother dictated most of it

189
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,958
and my sister's idea was the heart…

190
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,458
-The heart.
-Mmm.

191
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,041
I thought it was
some sort of provincial insignia.

192
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,708
You actually drew this?

193
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,083
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?

194
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,041
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

195
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,625
That is very clever.

196
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,125
I used to make them
for Floria when she was little.

197
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,583
-May I ask you another question?
-Certainly.

198
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,333
Do they always follow you so closely?

199
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,208
This is them giving me space.

200
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,875
That must be tiring.

201
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,458
It is, actually.

202
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,541
I saw some horses
being left unattended at the stables.

203
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,333
Do you ride?

204
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,583
Hyah!

205
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,416
-Where did you learn to ride like that?
-My mother.

206
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,125
Which way now?

207
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,291
Well, depends on what you want to see.

208
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,250
Everything.

209
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,583
Very well.

210
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,750
What happened in there?

211
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:24,833
Speak already.

212
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,166
-Is the wedding still on?
-Aye.

213
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,583
You settled on a fair bride price?

214
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,125
More gold than I could ever imagine.

215
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,291
Then why do you look so?

216
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,958
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

217
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,500
Tell me, you didn't say anything
to embarrass us.

218
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,041
No, I did not.

219
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,958
Because it's very important
that our two families get along.

220
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,250
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

221
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,875
I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong.

222
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,333
I saw something,
high on the mountain last night.

223
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:05,958
Torches.

224
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,166
You saw that?

225
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,416
I couldn't sleep.

226
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,125
It was an ancient ceremony.

227
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,000
Or rather, one of three.

228
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,541
They're very significant to my family.

229
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,250
For our whole kingdom, really. They, um…

230
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,625
They honor our ancestors.

231
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,333
That's why my mother
chose these dates for our wedding.

232
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,708
It is quite beautiful.

233
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,833
Yes, I suppose.

234
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,416
I really don't have
anything else to compare it to.

235
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,125
May I confide in you something?

236
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,041
Yes.

237
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,791
My greatest wish is to go see the world.

238
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,583
Really set out and see it, you know?

239
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,375
I do, actually.

240
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,833
It's my life's dream.

241
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,708
For as long as I can remember,
I've longed to explore the distant lands.

242
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,208
The ones you only read about.

243
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,166
Perhaps, one day, we will.

244
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,291
Perhaps.

245
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,458
And the orange in this area.

246
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,000
Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.

247
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,666
Well, I'm glad you approve.

248
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,125
Very elegant.

249
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,750
You have impeccable taste.

250
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,333
Everything is just so exquisite.

251
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,166
I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?

252
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,750
I just thought
we might become better acquainted,

253
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,708
seeing as we're about to be family.

254
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,333
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

255
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,416
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?

256
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,208
The finest in the city.

257
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,958
And here you are. You've climbed so high.

258
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,000
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

259
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,875
Nor place undue import

260
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,708
on what is ultimately
a transaction born of necessity.

261
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,000
Uh… "Necessity"?

262
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,208
Well, your family needs money.

263
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,458
My family needs a bride.

264
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,791
What we don't need is more family.

265
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,583
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.

266
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,000
-I merely--
-Elodie.

267
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,333
Pardon?

268
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,416
My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.

269
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,000
That's what I said.

270
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,291
Good day, Lady Bayford.

271
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,250
It's perfect.

272
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,833
Everything in here is so perfect.

273
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,125
Stepmother.

274
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,250
Is something the matter?

275
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,666
Elodie,

276
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,041
I know we haven't always been close,

277
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,791
but I need you to listen to me now.

278
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,625
This wedding… is a mistake.

279
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,708
What?

280
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,458
I don't understand.

281
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,958
These people, I don't trust them.

282
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:41,041
It's hard to explain,
but a mother knows these things.

283
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,250
Only yesterday,
you were enamored by this place.

284
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,291
Floria.

285
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,458
I was wrong.

286
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,750
They may be royalty,
but that doesn't make them good people.

287
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,000
Well…

288
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,208
-What does Father think?
-He refuses to talk about it.

289
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:01,458
And when I try to tell him my worries,
he snaps at me.

290
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,250
-Because you're being unreasonable.
-That's enough, Flor.

291
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:10,000
Elodie, I swear that I only want
what's best for you.

292
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,000
Am I interrupting something?

293
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:19,750
No.

294
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,500
Just…

295
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,000
girl talk.

296
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:30,416
Well, tomorrow's a big day,
and these girls, they need their rest.

297
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,125
Think about what I said.
There's still time.

298
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,541
Time for what?

299
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,041
I hope you know
what you're doing.

300
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,916
Good night, my angels.

301
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,708
-Good night, Father.
-Good night, Father.

302
00:25:58,916 --> 00:25:59,833
Good night.

303
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,041
Wow.

304
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,583
You may kiss the bride.

305
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,458
I present my son and new daughter,
Elodie, Princess of Aurea.

306
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,166
Goodbye, Father.

307
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,833
I hope I'm half as beautiful
someday as you are today.

308
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,250
Twice as beautiful.

309
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,291
-I love you.
-I love you.

310
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:53,750
Hey! Hey, hey!

311
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,125
Where are we going?

312
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,416
Remember I told you about those
ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?

313
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,333
Yes.

314
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:06,333
We're going to pay homage
to my ancestors.

315
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,666
Welcome, Princess.

316
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:06,083
For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,

317
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,500
to protect our people.

318
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,083
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

319
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,458
So, tonight,

320
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:22,041
you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom.

321
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,958
When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,

322
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,208
they found they were not
its sole inhabitants.

323
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,458
A creature dwelt here first.

324
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,083
The last of its kind.

325
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,208
With savage bloodlust,

326
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,750
the beast left its lair
and set upon the village.

327
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:50,166
So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people.

328
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,375
But their steel
was no match for the monster,

329
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,791
and each man met his end.

330
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,041
Each save one.

331
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:05,500
For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store.

332
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:10,166
Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared.

333
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,625
A cruel torture.

334
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,791
He adored his daughters,

335
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:19,041
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

336
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,500
And so, a pact was made.

337
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,958
The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,

338
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,625
and a kingdom was born.

339
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,916
It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation.

340
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,416
A tradition going back centuries.

341
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,083
Your hand, child.

342
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:07,708
A legacy of honor and duty
you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.

343
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,458
Let our two lines mingle
and fast become one.

344
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,375
She is now of royal blood.

345
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,583
To ensure that our kingdom
thrives forevermore,

346
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,791
pay your due to the realm.

347
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,208
Toss the coin into the chasm.

348
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,041
The ceremony is now complete.

349
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,916
You may make your return.

350
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,583
I'm supposed to carry you back.

351
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,666
I'm fine with walking, really.

352
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,875
Floria would love this part.

353
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,916
Close your eyes.

354
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,125
I've got you.

355
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,458
I'm sorry.

356
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,791
No!

357
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,625
Help me!

358
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,291
Help!

359
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,500
Is anyone there?!

360
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,000
That's not mine.

361
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,666
I am the sacrifice.

362
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,583
I am the sacrifice?

363
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:14,708
You poor thing.

364
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,041
What happened to you?

365
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:27,500
Give me strength, Mother.

366
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:29,708
Mother?

367
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,125
Your name, little bird?

368
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,333
Speak your name.

369
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,208
Elodie.

370
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:40,333
El-o-die.

371
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,375
Exciting.

372
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,416
What do you want?

373
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:54,333
I want… what is promised.

374
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,875
What is owed.

375
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:07,041
Every generation, your kind must pay.

376
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,750
My kind?

377
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:15,166
The scent of royalty betrays you.

378
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,250
It's in your blood.

379
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:38,625
Now, my favorite part.

380
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,375
Run.

381
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,875
Did I hurt you?

382
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,458
Quiet now?

383
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,458
A clever one.

384
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:27,541
The last one was over so quick.

385
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,041
No.

386
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,958
Mother wanted you to fight.

387
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:49,875
No. No.

388
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,041
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He is a prince.</i></font>

389
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,958
<i><font color="#80FFFF">They must
get to know each other.</i></font>

390
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,791
<i><font color="#80FFFF">My greatest wish
is to go see the world.</i></font>

391
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,791
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Perhaps, one day we will.</i></font>

392
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:19,000
One for the dress.

393
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,500
Don't worry.

394
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,291
I won't hurt you.

395
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:32,458
Almost caught you, little bird.

396
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:41,666
You hide now, like all the others.

397
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,833
It makes no difference.

398
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:59,291
This story always ends the same.

399
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:33,958
V.

400
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,208
Victoria.

401
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:41,750
Beatrice.

402
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:43,708
Artemis.

403
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:45,666
{\an8}Genevive.

404
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:47,500
Fatima.

405
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,708
Carlotta.

406
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,416
How many?

407
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,125
Did anyone make it out?

408
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,625
Please, don't.

409
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:05,583
Somebody…

410
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,041
It's a lie.

411
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:04,125
Get off.

412
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,125
I'm deeply sorry…

413
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,833
for underestimating you.

414
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:01,625
A map.

415
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,541
Now, where am I?

416
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,083
A tree.

417
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:13,083
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The entrance cave.</i></font>

418
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,666
Following down into the bird cave.

419
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:25,791
Through the twisted tunnel…

420
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,625
reaching water.

421
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:33,208
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The glowworm cave.</i></font>

422
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,875
Keep following down.

423
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,416
I am here.

424
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,416
How do I escape?

425
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:48,708
Is this it?

426
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:51,958
Did a princess make it out?

427
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,666
Three ways. Take the middle fork.

428
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,791
Music note.

429
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:04,291
Crystals.

430
00:59:06,666 --> 00:59:07,791
Go on.

431
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:12,041
And then… I am free.

432
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,541
The middle fork.

433
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,375
Music.

434
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:37,583
Crystals.

435
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:52,458
This is it.

436
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,291
Wish me luck.

437
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,041
You made it out.

438
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:48,583
No!

439
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:04,541
Elodie.

440
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,166
Fly, little bird.

441
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:09,958
Hello.

442
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,125
Hello!

443
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:18,541
I'm here! Help!

444
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,791
Help!

445
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Hello!

446
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:35,916
There is no way out, Princess.

447
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:39,583
Not for any of you.

448
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:43,875
Three were taken.

449
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:47,375
Three must be given.

450
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,708
Elodie!

451
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:58,166
What's this?

452
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,875
Elodie!

453
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,166
Elodie!

454
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,000
Move on.

455
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:37,916
I've done what you paid for, milord.
I'll just wait up top.

456
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,666
You'll do no such thing.

457
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,916
I hired you to guide us to her.

458
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:47,333
No one leaves here without my daughter.

459
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,666
Elodie!

460
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:04,875
Elodie!

461
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,708
<i><font color="#80FFFF">A creature dwelt here first.</i></font>

462
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,500
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The last of its kind.</i></font>

463
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:50,958
It's a lie.

464
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:56,791
Three taken.

465
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,083
Slay the vile young.

466
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:36,625
Form the line!

467
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:55,041
Please, spare me.

468
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:57,875
Show mercy.

469
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:02,083
I will give you anything.

470
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:10,291
Death is not enough for you.

471
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:13,125
You will know my pain.

472
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:19,625
Elodie!

473
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:25,000
Elodie!

474
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,208
Elodie!

475
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:45,916
Elodie!

476
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,916
Be quiet. She can hear you.

477
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:54,000
I warned you. It's too late.
The beast lurks in its lair.

478
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:58,333
-It's surely taken her there to devour--
-This lair. Where is it?

479
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:01,041
Sir, your daughter's been
down here nigh on too long.

480
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,208
She's almost certainly been killed.

481
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:05,916
Elodie!

482
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,041
I'm told some have tried
to hunt the beast.

483
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,333
For its blood.

484
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:15,791
Nonsense.

485
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:20,958
Why are you here?

486
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,750
I'm here for my daughter.

487
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:26,125
Father.

488
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,750
Father.

489
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:10,708
Please.

490
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,250
I beg of you.

491
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:27,500
It's not my mercy that you should seek.

492
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:30,250
Call her.

493
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:32,291
She's alive?

494
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:34,750
Elodie's still alive?

495
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:36,958
I smell her.

496
01:12:38,791 --> 01:12:40,041
Hiding.

497
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,916
Watching.

498
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,083
Call her.

499
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:55,916
No.

500
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,208
Call her.

501
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:05,291
Elodie.

502
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:08,791
Can you hear me?

503
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:19,041
I have… I have made a horrible,
horrible mistake.

504
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:23,916
To sacrifice the one thing I love most.

505
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:27,125
To trade your life

506
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:30,458
for the good of my people.

507
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:34,416
I thought that I could take the gold.

508
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,750
That I could live with myself.

509
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,416
My choice.

510
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:46,416
But I can't.

511
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:49,583
I can't.

512
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:00,041
Tell her to come to you.

513
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:07,750
Last chance.

514
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:15,250
Elodie. Hear me.

515
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:20,208
I am your father. You will obey me.

516
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,166
I order you.

517
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,083
Do not come out!

518
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:30,541
No.

519
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:37,666
No!

520
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:33,791
Ellie.

521
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:40,958
Use the ropes.

522
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:42,708
Your stepmother and Floria,

523
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,625
they wait for you at the ship.

524
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:51,333
Forgive me.

525
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:46,000
Go! Go! Go!

526
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:05,958
Go.

527
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:46,041
That damn girl. I knew she was trouble.

528
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:49,625
-Where are you going?
-To fix this.

529
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:25,958
- Stop.
- Stand back.

530
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:35,291
Elodie.

531
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:39,500
Open up!

532
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,333
Get out of the way!

533
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,000
Get out!

534
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:51,958
Seize her.

535
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:53,291
You can't!

536
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,166
- No! She's just a child!
- No!

537
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,791
You promised us a daughter.

538
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,083
-Stepmother!
-No!

539
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:00,583
Floria!

540
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:57,041
Elodie.

541
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,000
Stepmother.

542
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:08,291
-Elodie.
-Stepmother.

543
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:09,750
Oh!

544
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:11,000
Thank God.

545
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:12,541
Are you all right?

546
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:13,583
I can manage.

547
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:15,958
Where's Floria?

548
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:18,875
They took her to the caves in your place.

549
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,000
I tried to stop them
from taking your sister.

550
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:22,291
I have to save her.

551
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,875
No, I'll go. I can find her.

552
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:26,083
It may be too late.

553
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:27,958
No.

554
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:30,166
Not if I can help it.

555
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:32,541
Your father…

556
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:37,791
Go.

557
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:47,333
Please. Let me go!

558
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:49,541
Please let me go.

559
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:52,250
No, don't do this.

560
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:54,625
Mother, enough! She's too young.

561
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:58,833
A prince protects his kingdom,
without hesitation or complaint.

562
01:21:58,916 --> 01:21:59,958
Give me your hand.

563
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:03,083
I cannot do this. She's just a child.

564
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:05,791
You're weak.

565
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:09,416
No! Please don't do this to me!

566
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:16,625
Get off of me!

567
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:18,916
Let go! Off of me!

568
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,166
Throw her in.

569
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,166
Floria!

570
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:48,541
Floria!

571
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:51,916
Floria!

572
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,791
I'm coming for you, Flor.

573
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,708
My little ones…

574
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:52,333
They did not let you live.

575
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:57,958
Nor shall I let Elodie.

576
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:12,583
Your sister will come for you.

577
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,791
There she is now.

578
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:56,791
Hello, Floria. Floria, can you hear me?

579
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:58,583
Wake up!

580
01:25:58,666 --> 01:26:00,375
We need to hurry.

581
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:01,500
Floria!

582
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:03,000
Ellie.

583
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,500
Elodie, you're alive.

584
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:10,958
Okay. I'm going to get you out of here.

585
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:18,208
My leg. I hurt it when I fell.

586
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:21,125
We don't have time, Flor.

587
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,708
No, no, no. Not yet.

588
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:34,833
What now?

589
01:26:34,916 --> 01:26:36,333
You have to hide quickly.

590
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:37,583
What about you?

591
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:39,125
I must tell her the truth.

592
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,083
Come on.

593
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:59,125
Where are you hiding?

594
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:04,541
Dragon.

595
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:11,166
That won't kill me,

596
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:14,625
but it will make me angry.

597
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:15,958
Good.

598
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:18,625
I'm angry too.

599
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,041
We have both been lied to.

600
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:27,625
They said you set upon their village.

601
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:30,041
That the king came
only to defend his people.

602
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:33,708
He came unprovoked.

603
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,291
I know what they did.

604
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,500
I know they killed your children.

605
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,583
"They"? You!

606
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:44,125
Your kind, your blood.

607
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:45,041
No!

608
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:48,875
My daughters were the last of my line.

609
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:53,083
So, I will take their daughters
until my final breath.

610
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:57,000
Except you haven't.
We are not their daughters.

611
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:58,750
More lies.

612
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,625
Ellie!

613
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:56,791
Now, you will know my daughters' pain.

614
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,500
I am not one of them!

615
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,916
I smell it in your blood.

616
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:23,416
El-o-die.

617
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:28,041
Accept your fate…

618
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
as I have mine.

619
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:43,708
We are to die alone.

620
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:52,333
No.

621
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:57,875
I have an army with me.

622
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:04,416
Every innocent woman
whose life was stolen down here.

623
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:10,958
Your kind were never innocent.

624
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,375
Then go ahead.

625
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,208
Show me your fire.

626
01:32:30,125 --> 01:32:30,958
Well?

627
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:33,750
What are you waiting for?

628
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:37,958
Burn me.

629
01:32:40,583 --> 01:32:41,625
Burn me!

630
01:33:45,583 --> 01:33:47,208
My sister had this too.

631
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:49,750
All of us did.

632
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,875
That is how they make us royal.

633
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,458
That is the blood you smell.

634
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:08,125
They fooled you.

635
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:13,458
You've been killing
innocent daughters just like they did.

636
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:24,541
Then, end it.

637
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:51,875
No.

638
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,000
I'm through doing what I'm told.

639
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:19,875
Elodie.

640
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:29,541
You must believe me.
I haven't slept a moment since--

641
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:31,458
Since you tried to kill my sister?

642
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:33,958
I had no choice.

643
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:37,000
Don't you dare explain yourself to this…

644
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,666
this commoner.

645
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:44,583
Is she to be the third?

646
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:47,041
Princess number three.

647
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:52,250
She's the last,
and then I'll be free to marry whoever I--

648
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:54,000
That's enough, Henry.

649
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,375
You know nothing of what we've endured.

650
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:00,291
You know nothing of our story.

651
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:10,000
Take your family

652
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,166
and run.

653
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:16,541
Come. Let's go.

654
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:21,833
I will offer you all
one last chance to do the same.

655
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,166
No?

656
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,750
You insolent creature.

657
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:37,541
You think we ought to fear you now?

658
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:39,791
Why?

659
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:43,750
Because you somehow
managed to escape the dragon?

660
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,708
It's not me you should fear.

661
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:54,291
This is the end of your story.

662
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,375
Run!

663
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,416
- It's the dragon!
- Run!

664
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:42,833
No!

665
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:31,125
Someone give me a hand
with this barrel.

666
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:32,875
Let's be sharp there, lads.

667
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:35,125
You can't be serious.

668
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:36,083
But I am.

669
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,916
We'll run it together.

670
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,583
We've got a bounty of supplies.

671
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:42,041
Enough to get us through
this freeze and the next.

672
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,166
Oh, Elodie.

673
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:46,458
You're the only person I trust
to look after our people, Mother.

674
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:56,500
Can I help too?

675
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:00,625
Floria.

676
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:02,791
I'm counting on it.

677
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,541
Stepmother.
Stepmother, come and see this.

678
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:16,208
Oh, wide heavens!

679
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:19,458
My lady,
what course shall we steer?

680
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,750
Home.
