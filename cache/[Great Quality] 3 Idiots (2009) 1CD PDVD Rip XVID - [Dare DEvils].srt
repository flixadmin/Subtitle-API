214
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:30,438
salt water is a great conductor of electricity

215
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:31,929
8th standard physics

216
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:33,383
we all studied it!!

217
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:35,794
he applied it!!

218
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:43,095
ICE's director's name was Dr.viru shastrabhuddi

219
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:45,008
but every one calls him virus

220
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:46,473
 all called him computer virus!!!

221
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,967
oye virus is comin..carryin eggs with him

222
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,479
he has told first years to come down come fast fast

223
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:55,424
virus was the most competetive man we had  ever seen

224
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:58,119
if someone overtakes him even one step.........

225
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,459
he could'nt accept it,

226
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:06,233
to save time he used velcro instead of buttons

227
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,280
and a hook in tie!!

228
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,986
he has trained his mind

229
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,289
that he can write using both his hands at the same time

230
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:23,471
everday at 2 he used to take a power nap of exactly 7.5 minutes
n used to listen opera

231
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:33,842
govind had to do all unproductive works like shaving, cuttin nails in this 7.5 mins

232
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:51,407
what is this?

cuckoo bird's nest

236
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,726
cuckoo bird never builds their nest..

237
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:02,925
they lay their eggs on other birds nest

238
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:07,842
and when their babies come to the world, what do they do first?

239
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:14,283
they kick out other eggs from the nest...

240
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,978
competition over

241
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:22,089
the life begins with murder

242
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,123
thats nature...

243
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:25,529
compete

244
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,549
or die!

245
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,521
you all so are like the cuckoo birds

246
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:39,198
and these are those eggs whom u kicked out and reached ICE

247
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:40,778
dont forget

248
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:44,262
because every year, 4 lakh applications comes to ICE

249
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:47,378
among them only 200 will be selected

250
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,020
you

251
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:50,311
and these

252
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:51,718
finished

253
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:53,967
broken eggs!!

254
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:58,708
my own son applied for 3 years

255
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:01,432
rejected

256
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:02,887
everytime

257
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:06,919
remember life is a race!!

258
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,670
if u dont run fast someone will beat u n move faster than u...

259
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:13,146
let me tell u very interesting story

260
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,040
this is an astronauts pen

261
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,924
in space, foundain pen, ball pen cannot be used

262
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:22,925
so after spending millions of dollars

263
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:25,066
scientists invented this pen..!!

264
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:29,463
from this u can write in any angle, any temperature, zero gravity

265
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:33,344
one day when i was a student the director of our institute called me

266
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,800
he said "viru shastrabhuddi." i said "yes sir"

267
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,633

269
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:44,168
he said this is a symbol of excellence

270
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,375
i give it to u

271
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:51,729
and the day when u get a extraordinary student like u

272
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,050
pass this pen to him

273
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:59,584
from 32 year viru shastrabhuddi is waiting for the next viru shastrabhuddi

274
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:05,088
any one here in this batch to honour this pen?

275
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:10,071

276
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,613

nor joys dad....

447
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:14,061
everyone will think its a suicide, sir

448
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:18,043
reason for death in postmortem report

449
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:21,733
intense pressure in wind pipe resulting in choking

450
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:25,111
this fool believed tat

451
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:27,286
died because of the pressure held here...

452
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:31,371
and from last 4 years of pressure over here? wat about that?

453
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,179
even thats not in the report also sir,

454
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:37,621
these engineers are so back minded sir

455
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:42,843
didnt even invent some machine, that could really behold the pressure over here...

456
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:49,007
if they had does, could've come to know this is not a suicide, its a murder,

457
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,168
are you blaming me for the suicide of joy?

458
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,399
if one student cant tolerate pressure why im i the one responsible?

459
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:01,402
so many pressure will come in life...

460
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:03,372
then everytime will you blame other for that?

461

sir im not blaming you sir

462
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:07,854

00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,560
nobody got the answer?

492
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:26,307
now rewind 1 min of life a bit and think

493
00:38:27,114 --> 00:38:28,814
when i asked this question..

494
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:33,275
anybody thought that today we will get something to learn new..?

495
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:35,924
anyone..sir

496
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:40,082
no

497
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:42,375
everyone sunk in race

498
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:45,814
whats the use if u come first studying like this?

499
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,352
will you improve your knowledge? no

500
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:51,684
only pressure will increase

501
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:54,607
and this is a college not a PRESSURE COOKER

502
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:59,284
the lion in the circus also learns to sit on the chair fearing the whip held in his owner's hand

503
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:03,308
but we call such a lion as well trained,not well educated

504
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,370
hello....

505
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,442
this is not a philosophy class!

506
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,277
tell us the meaning of those 2 words,

507
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,847

508
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,272

510
00:39:27,255 --> 00:39:27,975
quiet

511
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:30,071
non-sense

512
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:32,814
like this you teach engineering?

513
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:36,841
no sir im not teaching you engineering, you know better than me

514
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,300
i was teaching you that, how to teach,

515
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:45,659
and i believe that you learn someday for sure sir

516
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,750
because i never leave my weaker students hand

517
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:50,443
busted

518
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:53,895
quiet

519
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:56,763
quiet i said

520
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:05,851
i would regret to inform you that your son farhan, raju is goin on wrong routes

521
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,328
if u dont take required action their future will be spoiled

522
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:13,493
VIRUS's letters fell down in our homes like an atom bomb

523
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:16,065
there was mourning in hiroshima n nagasaki!

524
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:19,975
and we were invited to both the home to get kicked

525
00:40:20,596 --> 00:40:22,416

526
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:26,064
see there

527
00:40:26,797 --> 00:40:29,597
we could only afford one airconditioner

528
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:34,702
and we didnt keep in our bedroom , we kept it in farhans bedroom
for him to study convieniently

529
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:40,082
i didnt buy car, riding scooter till now

530
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:43,459
invested all money in farhans studies

531
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:47,513
we sacrificed our future for farhan's better future.. did you understand or not?

532
00:40:48,894 --> 00:40:52,114
then can u imagine wat i must be going through!

533
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,590
hey you took all these photos farhan?

534
00:40:58,196 --> 00:40:59,296
quiet

535
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:02,002
he has the ghost of photography in his head

536
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:06,258
he used to take the images of animals and used to say he wanted to become
wild life photographer

537
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:09,871

552
00:41:55,642 --> 00:41:57,462
we reached raju's home

553
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:02,092
raju's home reminds us about the 1950's black and white films

554
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,653

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,550
mother was retired from school and almost tired everytime...

560
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,310
his dad was a postmaster at his age

561
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:25,209

it was a big confusion whether we should control our friend or wipe his mother's tears

582
00:43:25,555 --> 00:43:28,955

now itself he'll give demo, give

683
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:09,892
um... sir in delhi,
 power goes out frequently sir

684
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:15,087
and this really affects the marriage too sir
so i thought to make an inverter

685
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:17,135
 that can generate power from all cars that has come in the marriage,

686
00:48:17,157 --> 00:48:18,077
ohhh

687
00:48:19,048 --> 00:48:20,168
wow

688
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:22,544
and did you make the inverter?

689
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:24,681
sir design is ready sir!!!!

690
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:28,628
um.. where is the design farhan

691
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:30,492
i've given you the design right?

692
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:32,124
aah, i had given to raju,

693
00:48:32,157 --> 00:48:33,557
raju design??

694
00:48:35,924 --> 00:48:39,824
sir actually, leave it sir ill make the inverter itself and show you directly,

695
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:43,858
you can only make us fool, not an inverter!!!

696
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:46,744
no sir ill surely make the inverter,
 i promise

697
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,558
and ill give your name for the inverter

698
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:54,020
because after all it had been invented in your daughter's marriage
so it'll an honour,

699
00:48:54,074 --> 00:49:00,074
farhan, raju.. i wish to meet both of you in the office tomorrow

700
00:49:05,604 --> 00:49:08,304

701
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:09,510

702
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:12,024
in terms of installment sir

703
00:49:13,275 --> 00:49:15,275
and afterward we wont intrude in any marriage sir

704
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:17,002
i wont even enter my marriage also sir,

705
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:19,133
infact i wont marry also sir, even he wont marry also sir

706
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:22,022
hanh hanh, even i wont sir

707
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,787
even your parents shouldnt've married

708
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:28,925
2 idiots wouldnt've taken birth in this world

709
00:49:31,644 --> 00:49:33,044
sit!!!!!!!!

710
00:49:42,736 --> 00:49:43,856
be attention...

711
00:49:49,847 --> 00:49:50,967
??????

712
00:49:54,336 --> 00:49:57,836
this is ranchhodas's father's monthly income

713
00:49:58,534 --> 00:49:59,934
2.5 crores rupees,

714
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:01,807
now from this,

715
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:05,177
one, or let it be two zero if you remove out...

716
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:08,006
does'nt make much difference to bother,

717
00:50:08,785 --> 00:50:11,685
but if one more zero is less,

718
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,699
i would worry a little

719
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:19,701
this is your father's monthly income, mr.farhan!

720
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:22,341
ye... yes sir,

721
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,899
and now if you make it one more zero less,

722
00:50:28,368 --> 00:50:31,968
now this is your family income mr.raju rastogi,

723
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:35,103
big reason to worry,

724
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:43,366
follow viru shastrabhuddi's suggestion, change your rooms

725
00:50:43,465 --> 00:50:46,265
and get shifted with chathur ramalingam

726
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:49,345
exams are closer, and if you be with that chanchad,

727
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:51,192
will never pass in exams!

728
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,912
#..... opera started......#

729
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,650
wanna get shaved?

730
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:13,681
no sir,,

731
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:15,417
then get lost!

732
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:26,911
raju you try to understand,

733
00:51:26,993 --> 00:51:30,013
VIRUS is playing games between us, divide and rule

734
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:31,153
dont get scared,

735
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:32,571
had to be scared!

736
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,031
for me to get good job, i need good grades, and grades are within his hands,

737
00:51:36,038 --> 00:51:39,758
i dont have rich father like you..using whose money, i can spend the rest of my life

738
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:41,341
hey raju what non-sense are you tellin?

739
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:44,851
should we do whatever he says hanh? aal iz well, aal iz well?

740
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:45,829
you'll  be the only one who gonna catch his tail not me,

741
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,970
now you're crossing the line,

742
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:52,019
no im making line in between, because i have to support my family!

743
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:56,909
mom's half salary has been spend on dad's medicines,

744
00:51:57,103 --> 00:51:59,103
sister's marriage is not happening,

745
00:51:59,145 --> 00:52:02,645
as the groom wants maruthi 800,

746
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:06,356
from past 5 years

747
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:09,292
mom dint even buy one saree,

748
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:14,461
yaar..now in this argument..if u r getting mother's saree in between..what can i say?

749
00:52:14,575 --> 00:52:17,895
yaar so like that how many sarees are reserved for one year? heheh

750
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:20,259
dont make fun of my mother,

751
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,810
hey raju we will study, with complete dedication we'll study,

752
00:52:22,834 --> 00:52:24,734
but not only to pass exams,

753
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:29,295
some great scholar has told,
"never study to be successful, study for self efficiency"

754
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:31,365
dont run behind success,

755
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:32,176
excellence

756
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:33,384
follow behind excellence

757
00:52:33,444 --> 00:52:35,444
success will come all way behind you,

758
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:37,785
who the great scholar told this?

759
00:52:37,924 --> 00:52:39,744
BABA ranchhodas???

760
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,379
hey hey dont take tension yaar,

761
00:52:44,444 --> 00:52:46,444
we'll top the exams yaar, nothin is impossible!

762
00:52:46,484 --> 00:52:47,504
nothin is impossible? hanh?

763
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:51,665
take this,

764
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:54,129
now put this back, k!!

765
00:52:55,596 --> 00:52:57,696
raju changed his train's bogey,

766
00:52:57,897 --> 00:53:00,217
now he started the journey(saffar) with chathur,

767
00:53:00,384 --> 00:53:02,204
not the "saffar" in hindi,

768
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:03,329
english's SUFFER

769
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,200
S

770
00:53:04,216 --> 00:53:04,736
SU

771
00:53:04,778 --> 00:53:05,098
SUF

772
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:05,620
SUFF

773
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:06,036
SUFFE

774
00:53:06,074 --> 00:53:06,594
SUFFER

775
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:07,551
SUFFER hehhehe

776
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:09,054
everyone calls chathur as "silencer"

777
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:11,058
to make his mind even more sharper,

778
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,355
he used to eat some bengali BABA's PAN,

779
00:53:13,454 --> 00:53:16,654
and he used to leave his HOT AIR!!!!

780
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:19,427
i din do it!

781
00:53:19,482 --> 00:53:20,882
raaju....

782
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:24,173
and he always put the blame on others!

783
00:53:24,228 --> 00:53:27,228
SILENCER used to mug up 18 hours a day

784
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:30,561
and during exam's night, he used to distract others from study

785
00:53:30,682 --> 00:53:33,702
#.... oooo baby.... come on baby ye.....#

786
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:37,603
he believed in two ways of topping exams

787
00:53:37,635 --> 00:53:43,635
one is to get marks by yourself,  or try reducing other's marks

788
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:50,204
racho has made the combined plan to teach silencer a lesson,
and to help raju,

789
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:58,230
our director sir has done much miracle here,

790
00:53:58,253 --> 00:53:59,253
chamatkaar (miracle) means....

791
00:53:59,317 --> 00:54:03,817
i dont want the meaning dubey jee, i'll memorize it....

792
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:08,290
chathur has been chosen to present introductory speech on teacher's day

793
00:54:08,614 --> 00:54:14,014
he wrote speech in pure hindi from librarian dubey jee to impress VIRUS,

794
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,800

806
00:54:51,223 --> 00:54:52,843

807
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,927

um listen to my instructions carefullly

811
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:06,213
else when you step out from the college gate
you'll face death in centre of road itself,

812
00:55:06,298 --> 00:55:07,918
why ? what happened?

813
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:10,051
by the time chathur recovers from this shock,

814
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:13,205
before that itself racho changed a few words in the speech

815
00:55:13,307 --> 00:55:14,307
like.....

816

01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:42,016
not because we were last but because our friend had failed!

1132
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:42,980
not posibble!.

1133
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:43,492

1134
01:17:43,577 --> 01:17:46,377

1135
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:49,185

1136
01:17:51,192 --> 01:17:54,192

1137
01:17:54,732 --> 01:17:55,852

01:18:00,235 --> 01:18:01,355

1140
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:06,933
rancho...idiot..

1141
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:09,490
move..move yaar

1142
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:15,893
we learnt something about human behaviour tat day

1143
01:18:15,961 --> 01:18:17,881
if ur friend fails, u feel sad!..

1144
01:18:17,922 --> 01:18:21,422
but if ur friend comes first..u feel even more sad!

1145
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:22,664
on tat day..we were sad..

1146
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:26,564
but there were two more people who were sadder than us

1147
01:18:26,644 --> 01:18:30,144
ranchhoddas chhanchad..first row..right of the director!

1148
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:33,574
uday sinha..second row..third seat!

1149
01:18:34,412 --> 01:18:38,012
alok mittal..second row..fifth seat!
hey!

1150
01:18:41,932 --> 01:18:45,232
sir..is it compulsory to sit acccording to our ranks?

1151
01:18:45,283 --> 01:18:46,783
why, do u have any problem?

1152
01:18:46,867 --> 01:18:49,367
sir, i have problem with entire grading system itself!

1153
01:18:49,443 --> 01:18:54,043
its like caste-system sir!..A grade students-kings, C grade students-slaves!

1154
01:18:54,076 --> 01:18:55,496
its not nice sir!

1155
01:18:55,667 --> 01:18:57,767
do u have a better idea for this?

1156
01:18:57,774 --> 01:18:59,594
yes sir, i do have!

1157
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:02,652
results should not be put up on a notice board....

1158
01:19:02,673 --> 01:19:06,573
why should we exhibit someone's weakness in front of all?

1159
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:10,091
now sir..if in ur blood test, the haemoglobin count is less.,.

1160
01:19:10,098 --> 01:19:13,598
will the doctor give u tonic..or put up ur report on the TV?

1161
01:19:14,036 --> 01:19:15,436
u see sir!

1162
01:19:15,524 --> 01:19:21,824
so basically wat u're saying is i must go to each one's room one-by-one n say results in their ears!

1163
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,680
u've come first..u've come second..i'm so sorry, u failed!

1164
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:31,570
no sir,i dint mean tat way

1165
01:19:31,608 --> 01:19:34,408
but the thing is..grade creates divide..divide

1166
01:19:35,668 --> 01:19:37,568
now see..i've come first so i'm sitting with u..

1167
01:19:37,643 --> 01:19:40,243
whereas my friends have come last..
so they are seated in the last..in a corner

1168
01:19:40,273 --> 01:19:44,773
atleat they r sitting in a corner now..if they continue being with u,
next year they'll be out of the photo itself!

1169
01:19:44,802 --> 01:19:47,802
neither will they pass nor any company will give them jobs!

1170
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,670
sir, they'll find a job some how sir....

1171
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:53,884
there wil be atleast few companies..
which hire people n not machines for work!

1172
01:19:55,014 --> 01:19:58,514

01:28:27,778 --> 01:28:29,178
chhote??????

1298
01:28:30,031 --> 01:28:32,131
he was the son of our gardener..

1299
01:28:32,198 --> 01:28:34,698
everyone used to call him chhote!

1300
01:28:36,084 --> 01:28:39,584
even after his mom-dad passed away...dad let him stay in the house!

1301
01:28:40,751 --> 01:28:43,951
he used to do odd house-hold works..u know

1302
01:28:44,672 --> 01:28:48,872
changing bulbs..gettin eggs n bread..ironing..like

1303
01:28:50,016 --> 01:28:52,816
he was very much interested in studies!

1304
01:28:54,457 --> 01:28:57,957
he used to wear my old uniform n get into the school

1305
01:28:59,183 --> 01:29:02,683
whichever class he liked..he would go n sit in that one!

1306
01:29:02,764 --> 01:29:04,864
i used to take advantage of that..

1307
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:07,169
i used to make him do my homework also

1308
01:29:07,262 --> 01:29:08,862
and make him write my exam papers also

1309
01:29:08,887 --> 01:29:10,987
i was having a good time!

1310
01:29:10,991 --> 01:29:12,191
then one day..

1311
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:16,611
master ji saw that a sixth standard child was solving a tenth standard problem

1312
01:29:17,013 --> 01:29:20,713
which class u r in,son?..wats ur name?

1313
01:29:21,404 --> 01:29:23,004
we were caught

1314
01:29:23,189 --> 01:29:28,589
dad was a big man so master ji thought its better to tell him before telling the principal!

1315
01:29:28,901 --> 01:29:32,601
u've beginned this..then u only wil end it!

1316
01:29:35,053 --> 01:29:37,853
the whole himachal salutes in front of me..

1317
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:41,629
but as soon as i turn away....behind my back,

1318
01:29:41,688 --> 01:29:43,788
they call me an illiterate!

1319
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:46,187
this wont happen with my son!

1320
01:29:47,045 --> 01:29:52,045
he wants education...and me..just..degree

1321
01:29:52,118 --> 01:29:56,118
let it continue as it is...make this boy an engineer

i went away to london for four years ..n he kept studyin in ICE using my name

1324
01:30:08,248 --> 01:30:11,748
he had a deal with my dad that after gettin a degree from ICE

1325
01:30:11,789 --> 01:30:15,289
he wont meet anyone from ICE in his whole lifetime!

1326
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:22,190
he usually said..i wont go meet anyone..but one day two idiots will come searching for me

01:31:34,303 --> 01:31:35,903

1351
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,595
and he..A for apple..B for ball

1352
01:31:47,509 --> 01:31:50,509
today, my respect grew even more for that Idiot rancho!

1353
01:31:50,992 --> 01:31:53,612
we all went to college only to get a degree....

1354
01:31:53,654 --> 01:31:55,474
if we dont have a degree, we wont have a job!

1355
01:31:55,537 --> 01:31:57,837
if u dont have a job, no father will give his daughter's hand

1356
01:31:57,891 --> 01:32:00,691
bank wont give credit card, n world wont respect us...

1357
01:32:01,043 --> 01:32:04,443
but that idiot came to college, not for the degree but to study!

1358
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:08,610
he wasnt afraid to come last or greedy to come first!

1359
01:32:08,668 --> 01:32:11,168
who was the first man to step on the moon?

1360
01:32:11,266 --> 01:32:13,086
neil armstrong sir!

1361
01:32:13,122 --> 01:32:16,622
obviously its neil armstrong, we all know it..but who was the second man?

1362
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:18,720
dont waste ur time, its not important!

1363
01:32:18,794 --> 01:32:21,594
nobody remembers the man who ever came second!

1364
01:32:21,621 --> 01:32:27,621
after two monthes..26 companies will come to this college to offer jobs to u all!

1365
01:32:27,748 --> 01:32:31,248
that means before ur final exams,

1366
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:33,290
 u'll have jobs on ur hands!

1367
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:36,070
this is ur last act my friends!

1368
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:40,510
put the medal on the pedal..press the accelerator
go out there n make history

1369
01:32:43,372 --> 01:32:44,772
any questions?

1370
01:32:47,024 --> 01:32:48,144
yes..

1371
01:32:49,044 --> 01:32:53,244
sir, suppose any student gets a job and.....

1372
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:57,808
he fails in the finals by 1-2 marks..

1373
01:32:58,092 --> 01:33:00,392
then will the job remain or....?

1374
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,480
very good question

1375
01:33:04,604 --> 01:33:08,104
is there any other person, in whose mind, the same question is arising?

1376
01:33:08,672 --> 01:33:10,072
as expected

1377
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:17,270
please come on stage, everyone give them a big hand..come on the stage..come

1378
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,300
come...come..dont waste time!

1379
01:33:26,201 --> 01:33:31,501
from past four years, they have been the most consistent students of ICE!

1380
01:33:31,589 --> 01:33:35,089
because consistently, they've come last in every exam

1381
01:33:35,486 --> 01:33:37,306
come my geniuses..come

1382
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:43,280
if we remove these two people's brains n sell in the market, we'll get a very gud price!

1383
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:47,665
because they r unused brain..never have been used!

1384
01:33:49,192 --> 01:33:51,092
n to answer to their question

1385
01:33:51,312 --> 01:33:54,812
whether they paas or fail, its not gonna affect their jobs

1386
01:33:54,852 --> 01:33:57,652
because they r not gonna get jobs at all!

1387
01:33:57,678 --> 01:33:59,078
i guarentee it

1388
01:33:59,808 --> 01:34:02,608
their names will be written in gold

1389
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:05,460

01:34:34,154 --> 01:34:35,974

01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:51,671
while we'll be rotting in the side

1403
01:34:52,629 --> 01:34:55,729
this year i think we'll be finished out of the photo itself!

1404
01:34:55,816 --> 01:34:57,416

1405
01:34:57,774 --> 01:34:59,374
do u know why i come first?

1406
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:00,150
why?

1407
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:02,254
because i'm in love with machines

1408
01:35:02,474 --> 01:35:04,574
engineering is my passion..passion

1409
01:35:05,332 --> 01:35:07,432

1410

01:35:20,772 --> 01:35:22,172
but wat is it?

1417
01:35:24,167 --> 01:35:28,667
5 years ago, he had written this letter to his favorite wild life photographer!

1418
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:30,310
andre..isthawa

1419
01:35:30,927 --> 01:35:32,327
ya..isthawa

1420
01:35:32,410 --> 01:35:35,910
he wanted to go to him..go to hungary n learn work from him!

1421
01:35:36,711 --> 01:35:40,911
but fearing his dad, due to hitler qureshi, he never posted the letter at all!

1422
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:45,490
aare..quit engineering..n become a wild life photographer!

1423
01:35:46,217 --> 01:35:49,017
do that work which u are talented in!

1424
01:35:51,156 --> 01:35:55,156
if lata mangeshkar's dad would have told her to become a fast bowler

1425
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:59,130
or sachin tendulkar's father would have told him to be a singer..

1426
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:02,440
then think..where would they stand today!

1427
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:06,039

1428
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:11,883

1429
01:36:12,761 --> 01:36:13,881

01:36:24,384 --> 01:36:26,404
then y do i come last..tel?

1433
01:36:28,095 --> 01:36:30,595
because u are a coward..coward

1434
01:36:31,799 --> 01:36:36,699
see this..see his hand..the fingers are less..and the rings are more

1435
01:36:36,782 --> 01:36:40,282
one for exam..one for sister's marriage n one for job

1436
01:36:41,324 --> 01:36:45,324
aare..if u fear so much from the future..u think u can live?

1437

1439
01:36:49,723 --> 01:36:52,523

01:55:42,246 --> 01:55:44,746
i'll be frustrated being an engineer,

1717
01:55:44,830 --> 01:55:47,630

due to fear..i was a bright student since childhood

1759
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:45,833
parents thought that it will abolish our poverty!

1760
01:58:45,912 --> 01:58:47,732
i started to fear!

1761
01:58:49,210 --> 01:58:54,110
when i came here.. i saw that there's a race,.. if u dont come first, no one will recognize u

1762
01:58:54,128 --> 01:58:56,228
i started to fear even more!

1763
01:58:56,469 --> 01:58:58,569
fear is not good for grade, sir!

1764
01:58:58,654 --> 01:59:01,674
i started wearing more rings..praying more

1765
01:59:01,701 --> 01:59:04,401
not only praying..i started begging to god

1766
01:59:04,802 --> 01:59:06,902
give me this, give me that!

1767
01:59:08,803 --> 01:59:13,803
16 bones broke, i got two months to think..then i understood!

1768
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,840
sir, today i havent told god..tat get me this job

1769
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:21,420
i just folded my hands..n said thank u 4 this life

1770
01:59:22,764 --> 01:59:26,264
if u guys..if u guys even reject me today..then i dont have any regrets

1771
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:31,280
because i believe..i'll somehow do something worthy with my life sir!

1772
01:59:31,358 --> 01:59:36,358
see..this very much frank behaviour of ur's is not good for our company!

1773
01:59:36,798 --> 01:59:40,798
we need a diplomatic person to handle the clients

1774
01:59:40,861 --> 01:59:42,961
and u are way too straightforward!

1775
01:59:44,835 --> 01:59:53,035
but..if u assure us that u can control this attitude of ur's..

1776
01:59:53,044 --> 01:59:56,344
then..something can happen!!!

01:59:56,364 --> 01:59:57,484

1778
01:59:59,617 --> 02:00:03,117
after breaking both the limbs, i learnt to stand on my feet sir,

1779
02:00:03,952 --> 02:00:07,652
with great difficulty, i got this attitude in me!..it wont cant happen sir!

02:00:11,096 --> 02:00:16,096

2084
02:19:52,731 --> 02:19:55,131
rancho, see if crowning is happening?

2085
02:19:55,246 --> 02:19:57,066
crowning means?

2086
02:19:57,407 --> 02:19:59,227
go get that diagram

2087
02:20:01,158 --> 02:20:03,958

2088
02:20:06,137 --> 02:20:07,957

02:20:21,406 --> 02:20:23,226

02:20:25,804 --> 02:20:27,204
mona..

2094
02:20:27,533 --> 02:20:28,653
mona

2095
02:20:29,428 --> 02:20:30,848
she's tired pia..

2096
02:20:30,918 --> 02:20:32,118
wake her up

2097
02:20:32,118 --> 02:20:34,718
if she doesnt push, then it'll be a big problem

2098
02:20:34,726 --> 02:20:36,826
vacuum cup has to be put, pia

02:20:36,869 --> 02:20:38,669

i'll show u

2102
02:20:45,419 --> 02:20:49,619
if the mother gets tired and is unable to push then this cup is put on the baby's head

2103
02:20:49,664 --> 02:20:53,164
suction pump creates vacuum and this cup sticks on the baby's head

2104
02:20:53,922 --> 02:20:56,022
then the baby is pulled out

2105
02:20:56,467 --> 02:20:58,167
i can make this..i can make it

2106

2112
02:21:05,034 --> 02:21:06,134

but when that idiot opened his mouth, then a miracle happened!

2207
02:27:56,209 --> 02:27:59,409
solid you kick.. will u become a footballer or what?

02:28:21,054 --> 02:28:23,154
i'm not finished with you,

2211
02:28:24,420 --> 02:28:27,620
on the first day of college, you had asked me a question....remember?

2212
02:28:27,656 --> 02:28:30,456
that why dont they use a pencil in the space..

2213
02:28:30,541 --> 02:28:34,741
if the tip of the pencil breaks in the space, then it will be revolving under the action of gravity

2214
02:28:34,762 --> 02:28:37,162
it can get into someone's eyes, it can get into someone's nose

2215
02:28:37,247 --> 02:28:38,947
it can get into the instrument panel..

2216
02:28:39,002 --> 02:28:41,102
u were wrong..u were wrong

2217
02:28:41,937 --> 02:28:44,037

2218
02:28:45,909 --> 02:28:47,729

2221
02:28:56,973 --> 02:28:58,093

2222
02:28:59,385 --> 02:29:01,985

2223
02:29:03,192 --> 02:29:09,692

2228
02:30:23,782 --> 02:30:27,982
on that day, everyone were hugging each other, getting emotional and making promises

2229
02:30:28,133 --> 02:30:31,633
that we'll stay in touch, we'll surely meet up once in a year!

2230
02:30:31,783 --> 02:30:36,783
who knew that we were seeing rancho for the last time?

2231
02:31:06,557 --> 02:31:08,377
