00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,240
You know, it's a pity.

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,880
I was looking forward to killing you.

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,120
You're at the back of a long queue.

19
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,720
My white flag is a flag of truce.

20
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
Yours is more a flag of surrender.

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,440
Whatever you say, Mr McCavern.

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,600
Colour is the same,
the outcome is the same.

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,360
I believe we have friends in common.
We should postpone our war.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,760
Your brother left me a hand grenade.

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
He sends his apologies.

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
You left me landmines.

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
For which I, too, apologise.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,560
Then peace it is.

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,760
Your message said you wanted to
seal our truce with some business.

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,680
Since we're men of similar interests
and distribution networks,

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,440
I thought we might use
our temporary settlement

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,840
for our mutual benefit.

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,560
You stand in a yard full of scrap metal
and stolen goods

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,320
and you talk like a politician.

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,600
No. Nothing here is stolen, Mr McCavern.

36
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,360
Charlie simply finds things
before they're lost.

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,400
The nature of the deal
is explained in my proposal.

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,600
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,760
If you need anything in this city,
just mention my name.

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
So you want to impress me, Mr Shelby?

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,360
Isiah.

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,880
Also in the envelope is a cheque...

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
for £500. For your wife.

44
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,200
She can use it to buy a black dress,

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,640
rent a black horse with black feathers,

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,720
to pull a black carriage
with your body in it,

47
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,160
should you break the terms
of the white flag.

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,960
Now, please, enjoy the city
it's my honor to represent.

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,200
This week, I managed to get
to the people, York and Lincoln City.

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,880
I mean, they're the teams that will lose.

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,720
I got to the...

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,160
All right. Go on, go on. Take your time.

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,600
-Hmm?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,120
I got to the goalkeepers.
They all said five pounds is enough. I...

55
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,640
I've written to the, um, people
at Tranmere Rovers

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,760
because the phone you put
into my house has stopped working.

57
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
-So I'm gonna need another one of those.
- Okay.

58
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,040
Once we've got that fixed, eh,

59
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,960
then we'll have all the names and numbers
of the first division referees.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
-The first?
-Yeah!

61
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,080
Shit. Ah, shit.
Shit, shit, shit...

62
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,800
Billy. Come on. Come on, listen.
Listen to me.

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,120
Come on, now.

64
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,960
-No need for that. Hmm?
-Hmm. Yeah.

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,160
We need you to find out what they like.

66
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
You know, what gets them going.

67
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,160
'Cause a lot of them are comfortable.
A fiver's nothing to them.

68
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,480
We need you to find out
what they really like, Billy.

69
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
Yes.

70
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,440
See, 'cause we can offer them that.

71
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,840
Yeah, Shelby Company Limited.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,000
We can offer them
all the lovely things people like.

73
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,600
Hmm?

74
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,440
We can also offer 'em protection

75
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
from the things they don't like.

76
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,520
You ever touch my family...

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,040
ever...

78
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,840
York...

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
-Hmm. Lincoln.
- Lincoln.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
Hmm.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,480
Tranmere Rovers.

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Hmm?

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,920
Bye, Finn.

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,520
Goodbye, brother.

85
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,600
Shit.

86
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,880
<i> It's all right, Mrs Conners,</i>
<i>you can carry on. It's just me brother.</i>

87
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
So, tell me how it happened.

88
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,440
Uh, they were
sleeping downstairs,

89
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,360
and then my husband came home,

90
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,080
drunk from the Marquis
even though he'd just lost his job.

91
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,200
We don't have any money.

92
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,560
Anyway... he came to bed.

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,360
But downstairs, they must've
heard a noise. They woke up.

94
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640
They started, uh, calling out.

95
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,800
They woke my husband up...

96
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,880
and when he's drunk,
you don't wake him up.

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
What happened then, Mrs Conners?

98
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
He, uh...

99
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,720
He...

100
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,200
He went downstairs.

101
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,560
He killed them.

102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,480
Strangled them, all three of them.

103
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,160
And you've, um...

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,520
you've brought
their bodies here today with you?

105
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,600
Proof, Mr Shelby.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,040
Their singing
was the only pretty thing in my life.

107
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,680
I don't care my husband beats me...

108
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,000
but not this.

109
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Mrs Conners, we have your address.

110
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,520
We will speak to your husband.

111
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,600
My brother here
will go to the Bull Ring Market today

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,640
and buy you three new goldfinches
and have them delivered to your door.

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,080
With the same colours
and, you know, feathers.

114
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
The new ones
I will call Thomas, Arthur and Finn.

115
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,920
That'll make him pause
even when he's drunk.

116
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,400
Good day, Mr Shelby.

117
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,600
-You take care, Mrs Conners.
-Bye.

118
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,200
I don't know
how you do this, Tom.

119
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,200
I really don't.

120
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,640
You learn things, Arthur.

121
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
That woman has only two rooms downstairs.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,240
Her husband has lost his job
and he beats her.

123
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,600
And yet the thing that brings her
to see her Member of Parliament

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,159
is songbirds.

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Now, that's politics, Arthur.

126
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,480
It's not for me.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,200
Anyway, look. Our list of losers.

128
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,080
How much
have we made on the football?

129
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480
Ten grand this week.

130
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,440
Finn showing promise, Tom.
Maybe we should put him on the track.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,960
Just a thought.

132
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,520
-Finn?
-Yeah?

133
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,080
Your lunchtime delivery.

134
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,400
Bring her in.

135
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,320
Tommy.

136
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,080
The next fellow wants to see both of ye.

137
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,640
-Do you know his face?
-No. He's Chinese.

138
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,640
Chinese, in our pub?

139
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,560
Tom.

140
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200
All right.

141
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,280
Slowly, Micky. Let him in.

142
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,720
Three little birds, eh?

143
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,520
Tommy, Finn and Arthur.

144
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,440
Mr Thomas.

145
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,120
Mr Arthur.

146
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,120
My name is Brilliant Chang.

147
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Brilliant Chang is dead.

148
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,600
Perhaps.

149
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,200
Sometimes, I wonder...

150
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,760
is this heaven?

151
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,480
Doesn't smell like heaven.

152
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,160
So I would say I have survived.

153
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,480
What happened to Maggie?

154
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,680
You don't like me?

155
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,120
I like everything.

156
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
I like fucking everything.

157
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,840
You should answer the phone, Mr Shelby.

158
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
Micky, bring that phone here, now.

159
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,640
-Hello?
- <i>Arthur! Arthur!</i>

160
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,720
I sent a woman with a gun
to your youngest brother's office.

161
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,880
It's all right, Finn.

162
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,080
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

163
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

164
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,520
Do you wanna die again, Chang? Hmm?

165
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Good.

166
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,520
The guns are pointed.

167
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,080
Now we are all concentrating.

168
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,360
The moment is now pure.

169
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,680
Purity is not necessary.
Displays are not necessary.

170
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,000
They said, "Tommy Shelby.
That door will need some kicking down."

171
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,440
When you walked through that door,
it was open.

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,520
You don't need to do anything
to get my attention.

173
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,680
Now, what exactly do you want?

174
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,440
Do you have a match, Mr Shelby?

175
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Anything happens to my brother, Chang...

176
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,120
you die.

177
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,760
If you die here today,

178
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,360
we'll bury you face-down with no hands.
You'll go straight to hell.

179
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,640
I don't care about rituals.

180
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
I am a rationalist, Mr Shelby.

181
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,400
Well, tell your friend on the phone

182
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,040
to put her gun down
and we can all have a talk.

183
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,520
Hold your fire, brother.

184
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,760
Hold your fire.

185
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm all right.

186
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,440
<i>She fired into the ceiling.</i>

187
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Finn's all right.

188
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,840
Finn's okay.

189
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,520
Give me the order. Hmm?

190
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,600
Give me the order, Tommy.

191
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,760
-Yes or no?
-At ease.

192
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,720
I said, at ease.

193
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,920
May I take something
from my pocket, Mr Shelby?

194
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,640
It is the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

195
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,120
No salt, no flour...

196
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
no lies.

197
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,600
Pure truth.

198
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,400
Came off a ship called the <i>Capital...</i>
out of Shanghai.

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Docked at Poplar a week ago.

200
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,440
Stevedores were held at gunpoint.

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,480
Chinese unloaded the cargo
by the light of lanterns.

202
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,400
A foreman at the dock estimated there was

203
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,800
seven tons of the stuff.

204
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
I made a note at the time.

205
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,400
I spoke to that particular foreman,

206
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,760
and I worked out that

207
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,920
seven tons of pure opium crystals
would be worth...

208
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,400
approximately £1,190,000

209
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
on international markets.

210
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
The big crash, hmm?

211
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
Wall Street.

212
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,200
Now we all
keep our ears open for opportunities.

213
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,840
-What the fuck is going on?
- What are you doing?

214
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
-Bastard.

215
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,040
Finn, we are conducting
a piece of business.

216
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,360
She had a gun to my fucking head!

217
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,160
But your trousers are dry.

218
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,960
You didn't piss yourself.
He didn't piss himself, Arthur.

219
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,240
Well done, Finn.

220
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,240
You had a dispute with a lady
and you didn't piss yourself.

221
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,080
And Arthur here tells me
we should put you on the tracks.

222
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,960
It'll be a good day for you
after all, Finn.

223
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,640
-Give me that.
-Hey.

224
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,920
Always have your whores
searched at the door.

225
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,040
If I see that bitch on
the street, I'll fucking cut her, yeah?

226
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
Yeah, all right. Come on.

227
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,720
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

228
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,400
Gesture of goodwill.

229
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
I'll throw it in the canal.

230
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,200
Canals are the idea.

231
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,880
Right, Chang?

232
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,160
<i>♪ I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man ♪</i>

233
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,440
<i>♪ I'm the man, the evil man</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm the man ♪</i>

234
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,440
<i>♪ I'm the man, the one you hate</i>
<i>Don't you understand? ♪</i>

235
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,040
<i>♪ The evil man ♪</i>

236
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,880
<i>♪ I'm the man, I'm the man</i>
<i>I'm the man, yeah ♪</i>

237
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,360
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here,
but the location is part of the deal.

238
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,360
What fucking deal?

239
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,240
How does it feel
to be barefoot in the mud again, Pol?

240
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,240
Makes me feel young.

241
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,720
What fucking deal?

242
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,680
Four boats,

243
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,280
four days, up the Grand Union
from Poplar to here.

244
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,960
Half the cargo is coal...

245
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,400
and underneath the coal...

246
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,480
pure opium crystal.

247
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,319
Opium?

248
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,480
I vote against it.

249
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,560
They can't use trucks

250
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,040
because the Chinese drivers
get stopped by the police.

251
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,400
They need to get it out of London

252
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,120
because all the warehouses
are being searched by Customs.

253
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,520
The seven tons is bound for San Francisco,

254
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,760
but the outward ship doesn't sail
for seven days from Liverpool.

255
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,320
They need somewhere safe to store it.

256
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,400
All we have to do is take it up the canal
and keep it here for a week.

257
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,800
We don't fuck with the Chinese
though, Tom. Dad always said it.

258
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,840
Ask yourself, would he turn down £250,000

259
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,240
to drive four boats up the canal
with no prospect of inspection?

260
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,120
My vote's against it, Tom.
Hmm? Mmm-mmm.

261
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,600
Polly... £250,000.

262
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,880
That's half of what
Michael lost in Chicago.

263
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,160
I will ask him
to take charge of this business.

264
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,240
Michael's position
will be reinstated in the company?

265
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
His period of quarantine will be over.

266
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,200
Think about it, brother.

267
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,520
Four boats sailing up the cut,
smelling of woodsmoke and bacon.

268
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,320
Which one of Charlie's Gypsy
didicoy friends do you trust, Tom, eh?

269
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,960
With a cargo worth a million pounds?

270
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,360
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.

271
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,560
Let's vote.

272
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,520
Those in favour?

273
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,920
Mmm.

274
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,560
Motion carried.

275
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,040
Arthur, tell Charlie we need four boats,
four tons of coal before it gets dark.

276
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,440
They sail south tonight.

277
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,560
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring
and get them three songbirds, Arthur.

278
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
Yes, Tommy.

279
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Fuck!

280
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,360
What have you heard, Pol?

281
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,760
The man you cut went to the police.

282
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,120
But we dealt with it.

283
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,680
Was she with him?

284
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,240
If she was,
it would be your fault, Arthur.

285
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,400
But they say his face is so badly cut,
he's hard to look at.

286
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,880
So I would say not.

287
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,560
I would also say
it is time to give up on Linda.

288
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,680
Find someone else
who might be able to put your fires out.

289
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,320
But I can't, though, Pol.

290
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,400
I fucking can't!

291
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,560
And that's it.

292
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,680
That's it.

293
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,120
Whisky?

294
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Thank you, no.

295
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,560
For reasons I can't divulge,
I need to keep Jimmy McCavern alive.

296
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,840
But I've already got
a time and a place for the killing.

297
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,960
You see...

298
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,760
a little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.

299
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,600
A girl called Karen who hates him,
who will give him up.

300
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,840
I have the sound of cranes
and winches to cover the gunshot.

301
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
I've got a Bentley to get me away.

302
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,560
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.

303
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,240
We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.

304
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,000
When that business is done,
he's all yours.

305
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
You can avenge the death of your son
in any way you see fit.

306
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,640
You mean when you say.

307
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,760
When you check
that little stopwatch you've got

308
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
that controls the turning of the Earth.

309
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,680
Yeah.

310
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,920
And then you will marry
and you will settle.

311
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,360
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?

312
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,560
Just let me understand you.

313
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,960
Do you mean
that Polly is part of this deal?

314
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,480
Yeah.

315
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,480
Well, Holy Lord God.

316
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,360
Tommy Shelby OBE,
does your vanity have no limits?

317
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,920
I believe it's called
the ego these days.

318
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,840
I read books.

319
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,920
You sit in your throne
and you instruct Polly Gray,

320
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,160
who is of far richer blood than you,

321
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,160
as to when she can
and when she can't marry.

322
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,920
Oh, no, she instructs herself.

323
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,680
She has her own strategies.

324
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,360
And we are of the same blood.

325
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,680
She will marry you,
but only if you agree to postpone

326
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,920
any attack on McCavern
until this business is done.

327
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,640
So, she is some young Gypsy bride
that's yours to give away.

328
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Young she is,
when she's barefoot on the cobbles.

329
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,800
What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?

330
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,120
If it's gonna be done in the old way,

331
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,960
well, you know,
you throw in a few coloured ponies or...

332
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm having an event at me house.

333
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,800
You are invited.

334
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,840
Polly will be there.

335
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,840
There will be candles
and violins and dancing.

336
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,200
Polly wants you
to propose in the proper way,

337
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,640
and then she will give you
her terms of acceptance.

338
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,400
Inviting you for this purpose
was Polly's idea.

339
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,760
-You can't read?
-I don't read.

340
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,480
-It's <i>Swan Lake.</i>
-Ballet?

341
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,200
Yeah. Apparently, it's about love.

342
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,560
Polly says that for now,
love must defeat revenge.

343
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,280
"As a result of the greed and the excess
of a small number of bankers,

344
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,360
financiers and other feckless gamblers..."

345
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,600
Hear, hear.

346
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,640
"...this comprehensive document,
pleading for government intervention

347
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,440
in all areas of economic life,

348
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,520
represents not just socialism,

349
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,480
but a new breed...

350
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,080
of national socialism."

351
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,040
"And I believe... I believe
that the leaders of my own party

352
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,040
have been very foolish to reject it."

<i>♪ Albert shows, no reprieve ♪</i>

354

<i>♪ Albert shows, no reprieve ♪</i>

355
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,360
<i>♪ Albert shows, no reprieve ♪</i>

356
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,920
<i>♪ Albert shows, no reprieve ♪</i>

359
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,400
How on earth did you get a ballet company
to come to your bloody house?

360
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,440
It's an independent dance company

361
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,040
dedicated to bringing ballet
to the people.

362
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,280
We share a philosophy.

363
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm a patron.

364
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,080
I also gave them a lot of money.

365
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,560
Hmm.

366
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,480
And this date is your wife's birthday.

367
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Yeah.

368
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,280
The party is for her.

369
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,920
And she likes ballet, your wife?

370
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,200
Why wouldn't she?

371
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,400
It's just... Well, you see,
I did some research into her.

372
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,080
Into her past.

373
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,520
If you want to buy her a gift...
she likes diamonds.

374
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,160
Now that we're going to be
conquering the world together,

375
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,720
we need to have no secrets.

376
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,080
We should know each other's weaknesses.

377
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,920
Your wife has led an interesting life.

378
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,720
It may even be possible
that as a younger man in Birmingham,

379
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,720
I came across her.

380
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,080
My friends and I would sometimes go
to nightclubs in the south of town.

381
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,160
Well, if you recognize her,
maybe you can talk about old times, eh?

382
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,800
Maybe,

383
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,280
if we have met before, your wife and I
could even renew our acquaintance.

384
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,840
I am invited to stay the night, yes?

385
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,320
I, too, have done some research,
Sir Oswald.

386
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,440
Yeah, I researched your wife

387
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
and your wife's younger sister,

388
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,840
and your wife's stepmother, Lady Curzon.

389
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
All of whom you are fucking.

390
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,560
If such things were to take place
on a narrow boat,

391
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,360
the church would get involved.

392
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,200
But...

393
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,160
it's not happening on a narrow boat.

394
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,800
No.

395
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,040
It's taking place in your apartment,
in your country house,

396
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,480
sometimes even in your office here
in the House of Commons.

397
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,240
So, no secrets. And yes.

398
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,680
Yes, you are invited to stay the night

399
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,880
with whichever member of your family
finds favour.

400
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,000
Now, if you don't mind,
I was about to leave.

401
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,520
I need to lock up me office.

402
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,480
Actually, I will come alone.

403
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,840
In society, you are judged
by your hospitality.

404
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,960
I will expect adventure.

405
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,880
Such rogues
we are, aren't we?

406
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Sing like songbirds in the House.

407
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,640
And then afterwards,

408
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,120
relieve ourselves in the bodies
of whomever we choose.

409
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,680
Two men for whom forbidding is forbidden.

410
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,560
Should be quite a party.

411
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,440
You have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

412
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,200
Do what they tell you to do.

413
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,600
You don't even have to rub the lamp
any more to summon the genie.

414
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,920
It wasn't the blue stone, Tommy.

415
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,600
It was you.

416
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,000
It was you.

417
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,760
Who is it?

418
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,680
It's Tommy's car outside. It's him.

419
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,160
I'll get it.

420
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,760
What's happened?

421
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,920
Nothing's happened. I'm all right.

422
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,680
-Come in.

423
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,080
Do you want a drink?

424
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,080
-No.
-No?

425
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,320
No. I have some information
for the intelligence officer.

426
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,960
Our conversations with Mosley.

427
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,520
He's planning to put forward
proposals on building works.

428
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,600
He, um...

429
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,240
He wants the communists
to consider his new party as fraternal,

430
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,160
which means his activities are now a part
of your official remit. Yeah?

431
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,120
Mr Shelby, it's 2:00 a.m.
You can make your report any time.

432
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,520
-Why don't you stay tonight?
-No.

433
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,480
I'll leave you two to...

434
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,640
Yes.

435
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,560
Good night.

436
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,000
Uh, I stood on a bridge tonight, Ada.

437
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,280
And I looked down...

438
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,520
and Grace was there.

439
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,440
But she was still alive.

440
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,840
Tom, have you still
been taking laudanum?

441
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,600
And the fucking name of the barge
was the <i>January.</i>

442
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,160
Our dad's boat.

443
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
The boat I was born on.
We've never gotten off it.

444
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,720
We've never gotten off it
and we never fucking will.

445
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,160
Dr Brooke said that you never arrived

446
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,920
-for your appointment, Tom.
-No.

447
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,280
There is nothing in his books
of any use to a man like me.

448
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,560
They talk about guilt. Eh?
Guilt. What fucking guilt?

449
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,360
-The black barge.
-No. No, that's not it.

450
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,280
That's not it.

451
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,160
He had it right.
Mosley had it right. He said,

452
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,760
"Forbidding is forbidden to us."
We can do anything.

453
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,360
Nothing can stop us.

454
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,120
But there is a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself...

455
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,840
and I keep finding meself there.

456
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,000
And only the <i>January</i> can get me away.

457
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,760
At least try the doctors again, Tom.

458
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,880
Well, then at least throw away your opium.
It's that that causes the visions.

459
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,840
Just throw it away.

460
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,280
While it's there, it's a temptation.

461
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,520
-Hmm?

462
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,520
How much have you got left?

463
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,720
Seven tons.

464
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,560
-Seven tons?
-Yep.

465
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,120
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.

466
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,480
Hey, do me a favour.

467
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,880
When that kid of yours arrives...

468
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,880
keep it away from me.

469
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,080
A fucking ballet?

470
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,880
He wants to impress somebody.

471
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,880
And I'm invited?

472
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,400
You and Gina.

473
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,239
Why?

474
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,719
Because he wants to give you the chance
to come back properly.

475
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,000
-Coal haulage?
-Yeah.

476
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,639
Tommy wants you to reopen those books
and become managing director.

477
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:03,560
So I've come back from Detroit
to become a coal man.

478
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,760
The first delivery is bound
for San Francisco.

479
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,120
But if it works,

480
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,760
Tommy thinks he can find
distribution for it here.

481
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,320
And this, um...

482
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
this coal.

483
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,840
-Is it snow white?
-No.

484
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,480
Golden brown.

485
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,480
Fuck.

486
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,240
This is your opportunity, Michael.

487
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,120
There is more money in this

488
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,800
than there is in all the other parts
of our business put together.

489
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,840
Tommy knows what opium does to people.

490
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,880
Tommy knows what whiskey does to people.

491
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,560
He got an OBE for selling it.

492
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,640
I'll speak to Gina.

493
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,600
You'll what?

494
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,120
I'll consult my wife.

495
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,960
Your father ran this business for a bit.
1901.

496
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,520
And he shipped coal, real coal. Just coal.

497
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,160
And his fingernails and his eyelids
and his ears were black with it.

498
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
And the merchants
would offer them one price

499
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,280
and then only pay half,
because they could.

500
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,280
And that was wrong, Michael.

501
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,840
Run your hands through it,

502
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,160
get it under your skin,

503
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,080
and then see if Gina
will let you lay a finger on her.

504
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,120
I think golden brown is more to her taste.

505
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,600
Especially when you tell her
how much money you're going to earn.

506
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,720
Now we're in business together,
I should ask,

507
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,000
which foot do you
kick the ball with, Mr Shelby?

508
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,320
I have no religion.

509
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,040
Some nights I wish I had.

510
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,240
He's kin?

511
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,280
Yep.

512
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,200
And the simple fellow?

513
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,920
He's a lot less simple
than you might at first think.

514
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,080
Do you trust them?

515
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,040
Right. So I take a boatload.

516
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,360
Well...

517
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,960
Ten sacks to start with,
so you can test the market.

518
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,920
Then we'll deal in boatloads.

519
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,360
Cash payment on loading.

520
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,520
Ten thousand pound.

521
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,720
Well, for that amount,
it will have to be a cheque.

522
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,400
Don't take cheques.

523
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,400
It'll be a cheque.

524
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,080
I will take a cheque if it's guaranteed

525
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,600
by our mutual friend
in London, Mr Mosley.

526
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,000
Well, who'd ever have thought
I'd be doing business

527
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,480
with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?

528
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,520
Yeah, who'd have thought, eh, Charlie?

529
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,280
Who would have thought it?

530
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,200
Ah, but you're okay.

531
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,800
Yeah, I'm only okay
until I'm not okay.

532
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,720
And then I'm really not.

533
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,160
Delivery in seven days.

534
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,800
Cheque guaranteed.

535
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,200
Won't your Chinese friends
expect the seven tons that leaves London

536
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,560
to still be seven tons
when it reaches Liverpool?

537
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,920
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.

538
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,880
Oh, you mean you're bold enough
to skim the Chinese?

539
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,320
You have some kind of death wish,
Mr Shelby?

540
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,760
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.

541
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,520
When you've unpacked,
there should be a girl laid on for you.

542
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,400
Mr Shelby is a socialist

543
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,040
and believes in
equality of service for all classes.

544
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,840
According to the invitation...
there will be an interval at 9:00.

545
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,840
Say that you're feeling tired
and we'll leave.

546
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,840
Well... if you see a duke,
introduce me.

547
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,280
My God, at last.

548
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,640
-Something that you like about England.

549
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,600
Gina,

550
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,520
I've been made an offer...

551
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,600
to come back into the company.

552
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,680
Michael,

553
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,680
we agreed the baby will be born
in New York. Remember?

554
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,120
The job is haulage.

555
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,760
Supply. Transport.

556
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,080
Opium.

557
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,520
-Tommy has made contact--
-Tommy.

558
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,280
Tommy has made contact

559
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,520
with Chinese suppliers
who have plantations in the Afghan hills.

560
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Pure grade.

561
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,240
We'll take delivery
and ship it all over Europe.

562
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,200
You mean heroin?

563
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,680
Yes.

564
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,200
And how much would you make?

565
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,440
Conservative estimate,

566
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,760
three shipments a year
from Shanghai, seven tons each.

567
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,920
Stand to make approximately
a million pounds. Per annum.

568
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,360
The company will make three.

569
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,720
We could go to New York
whenever we wanted.

570
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,680
On our own fucking plane.

571
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,960
-But we always have to come back, right?
-Yes.

572
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,480
For a million pounds a year, we do.

573
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,080
What happens if you get caught?

574
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,360
Tommy has friends.

575
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,920
If a ship gets stopped,
it'll be the Chinese who hang.

576
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,160
Think about it, Gina.

577
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,120
When we move into our house,

578
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,160
our room for entertaining
will be twice this size.

579
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,320
Will it, now?

580
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,000
Magazines say that

581
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,880
it's all straight lines and simplicity
in the 1930s.

582
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,800
Deco is dead.

583
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,120
We'll be able
to afford dukes and duchesses.

584
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,120
And maybe...
maybe a princess or two.

585
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,520
And the painting on the wall
will be of you.

586
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,360
If Tommy Shelby will be gone,

587
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,960
then it will be Michael Gray
arranging the ballet.

588
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,680
Where will Tommy be?

589
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,200
Where he wants to go to most.

590
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,560
Ah.

591
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,320
There.

592
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,040
A lord.

593
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,800
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.

594
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,920
Where the fuck is Tommy, anyway?

595
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,800
Tommy.

596
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,560
My house. My wife.

597
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,240
Let them wait.

598
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,880
Sir Oswald.

599
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,240
Do I not get announced?

600
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,720
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you that
he's busy with the catering preparations

601
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,720
and will be joining you shortly.

602
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,160
In the meantime,
and while you are waiting,

603
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,160
we have opium, cocaine and brandy.

604
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,880
I don't use opium. Or cocaine.

605
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,920
And brandy is for after dinner,
not before.

606
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,640
I also have a list of options
for the end of the evening.

607
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,280
You will notice
that the maids wear name tags.

608
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,760
We hired them specially.

609
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
For those guests staying the night,

610
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,080
all things are available...
except the ballerinas.

611
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,120
And who, might I ask, are you?

612
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,760
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.

613
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,480
And I, too, am unavailable.

614
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,440
Lizzie... there's something
I didn't tell you about this evening.

615
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,120
Something about our guest.

616
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,200
Mosley.

617
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,560
It's possible that you've met him before.

618
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,600
Before when?

619
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,400
Before you became who you are.

620
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,040
Would you even remember him?

621
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,040
Will he remember you?

622
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,040
All I remember is
I drank too much champagne.

623
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,120
And I wasn't taking cash.

624
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,560
Lizzie.

625
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,920
It's a pile of bodies...

626
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,080
floating by.

627
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,520
Let 'em go, Lizzie.

628
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,680
Let 'em go.

629
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,400
So, that's why you brought me in here.

630
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,360
To lay your claim.

631
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,080
Yeah.

632
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,240
Well, it's a start, I suppose.

633
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,400
He lays a fucking hand on you,

634
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,760
he will be meat for Johnny Dogs.

635
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,560
You were indisposed
when I arrived.

636
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,560
In society, you greet a guest.
You don't leave them hanging...

637
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,520
looking around like a fucking dog.

638
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,200
Before we join the others,
I have some business.

639
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
I need a signature.

640
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,720
By the way, your brandy
before dinner thing amuses me,

641
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,760
but none of the maids are of interest.

642
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,640
And I despise the use of drugs.

643
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,720
Your strategies are very transparent.

644
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,200
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern,

645
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,120
your acquaintance from the north.

646
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,640
I have no idea who you mean.

647
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,120
I don't trust him.
He wants to pay by cheque.

648
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,560
I need your signature
as a guarantor on the transaction,

649
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,800
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

650
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,560
The sum is £10,000.

651
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,000
And what is it he is buying from you?

652
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,120
Gin distillery. He's buying me old one.
I'm buying a new one.

653
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,480
Hmm.

654
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,000
So, not only is the truce holding,
but you two are actually doing business.

655
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,960
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.

656
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,880
If I sign a cheque guarantee for this man,

657
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,520
it is proof of a connection
between me and him.

658
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,200
Something you could later use against me.

659
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,760
Why would I
want to move against you?

660
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,080
You're curious about my weaknesses.

661
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,120
And you have learned it's not cocaine...
not maids.

662
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,160
But now you will learn my weakness...

663
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,240
is a tendency to trust people.
Do you have a pen?

664
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,960
Mr Shelby.

665
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,280
I know you had no classical education,
but I've just realised

666
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,640
you are the perfect balance
between the gods Dionysus and Apollo.

667
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,600
Irrational frenzy
controlled by reason and self-reflection.

668
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,560
Do you know
the work of Friedrich Nietzsche?

669
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,000
-No.
-Freud?

670
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,800
Yes.

671
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,320
Ah.

672
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,560
There.

673
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,040
Your guarantee of trust.

674
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,080
Now, perhaps you could introduce me
to your wonderful wife.

675
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,480
So, did you know?

676
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,800
What?

677
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,200
Oh, that tonight's special guest

678
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,520
might have fucked you
when you were a nightclub hostess?

679
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,600
Yeah.

680
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,040
Lizzie, if we were to
strike from our guest list

681
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,240
-every man in Birmingham who you--
-Fuck.

682
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,680
-Yes or no?
-Fucking yes. Shit.

683
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,360
Sir Oswald, this is my wife, Elizabeth.

684
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,600
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.

685
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,800
Since we all appear to know,
and since knowledge is permission,

686
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,240
I'm sure, Mr Shelby,
in the spirit of our honest relationship,

687
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,400
you won't mind me saying,

688
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,480
it was a bottle of champagne
and an evening well spent.

689
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,680
Actually, it was an evening wasted.

690
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,680
For the champagne and brandy
you bought me.

691
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,360
As I recall, it was the booze that
put you to sleep a little prematurely.

692
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,280
Ladies and gentlemen...
the dance is about to begin.

693
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,800
Mr Mosley,

694
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,320
a toast, if I may.

695
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,040
To the end of our deal.

696
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,360
And the beginning of something more.

697
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,080
Happy birthday, Lizzie.

698
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,320
This way.

699
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,200
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen...

700
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,240
will you marry me,
a poor commoner who loves you?

701
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,280
Let's fuck

702
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,000
before the swan dies.

703
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,840
I heard there was a family occasion.

704
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,560
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.

705
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,360
That animal inside me,

706
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,240
it comes out and I can't stop it.

707
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,000
Fuck, Linda.

708
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Without you, I...

709
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,880
Come inside, please.

710
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,680
His name was Frederick.

711
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,120
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

712
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,480
He just listened.

713
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,200
And now he has no face.

714
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,720
He's as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

715
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,560
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

716
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,200
in fucking hell.

717
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,880
Arthur.
