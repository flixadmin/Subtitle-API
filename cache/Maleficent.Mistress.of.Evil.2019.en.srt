1
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,580
Tie it off, come on!

2
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,230
Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.

3
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,520
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

4
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,230
Stay close.

5
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,330
Here we are.

6
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,950
Get on his back.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Hurry up.

8
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,610
There he is. Go get him.

9
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,240
You'll pay for that.

10
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,550
No. No, please.

11
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
Please, no.

12
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,740
Hold it there.

13
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,890
I only got one...

14
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,890
but he's a fine specimen.

15
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,150
-That's all?
-Yeah.

16
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,020
That shroom bit me twice.

17
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,910
Tomb Bloom.

18
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,720
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

19
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,980
<i>or perhaps twice upon a time,
for you may remember this story...</i>

20
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,520
<i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.</i>

21
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,450
<i>For some reason, the mistress of evil
and protector of the Moors...</i>

22
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,620
<i>was still hated after all this time.</i>

23
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,630
<i>True, she had cursed the princess,
Aurora...</i>

24
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,630
<i>but that was before she found light
in the heart of a human child...</i>

25
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,550
<i>and raised the girl as her own.</i>

26
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,470
<i>After all, it was Maleficent's love
which broke that very same curse.</i>

27
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,810
<i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.</i>

28
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,360
<i>For as the tale was told
over and again throughout the kingdom...</i>

29
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,530
<i>Maleficent became the villain once more.</i>

30
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,250
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

31
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,500
-It's the big day! Let's go!
-Come on.

32
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,260
Wake up. Wake up.

33
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,840
Come on.

34
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,020
Hurry up, wallerbogs! It's time!

35
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,540
Do you both remember the secret plan?

36
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,920
I've got it all right here.
When do I tell the queen the secret?

37
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,670
You must be patient, Thistlewit.

38
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,500
Do you think Queen Aurora's awake yet?

39
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,840
Well, she's not "Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

40
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,470
I see what you did there.

41
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,530
Next item of business, the missing fairies.

42
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,360
I've sent more sprites
to search the Tomb Bloom field.

43
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,950
They'll report back to me at nightfall.

44
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,370
We will keep searching until we find them.

45
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,500
Please don't raise your roots at me, Lief.

46
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,830
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

47
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,090
Diaval, you're supposed to be on my side.

48
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,010
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

49
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,520
We must all learn a little kindness.

50
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,230
Coming through.

51
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,770
Excuse us.

52
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,980
Official pixie business.

53
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,270
A word, Your Majesty.

54
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,820
-Maybe two.
-Aunties...

55
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,110
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

56
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,150
-No!
-This can't wait, Your Grace.

57
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,570
Not for a moment.

58
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,160
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

59
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,990
Is that...?

60
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,330
Pinto!

61
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,040
She's come bearing gifts.
The first sap from the warming trees.

62
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,340
It's for the big day!

63
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,300
Quiet, Thistlewit.

64
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,010
What big day?

65
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,140
Hey! My crown!

66
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,430
I'm not in the mood for this.

67
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,190
Pinto!

68
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,620
Come on.

69
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,120
Where are you going, aunties?

70
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,790
I don't have time for games, Pinto.

71
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,730
What's gotten into all of you?

72
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,990
There she goes, Your Majesty.

73
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,910
Come back here.

74
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,460
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

75
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,420
Look at me.

76
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,800
Philip. What are you doing here?

77
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,220
I was looking for you.

78
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,350
-Well, hello.
-Hello.

79
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,640
I'm really sorry, I can't talk right now.

80
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,560
The Moors have turned to madness.
I've got a castle full of complaints.

81
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,900
I know how busy you are.

82
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,690
-I wanted to ask you something.
-Yes.

83
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,320
Do you think there could be a union
between Ulstead and the Moors?

84
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,700
A union?

85
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,620
To connect both lands.

86
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,910
To bring harmony and peace.

87
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,120
I've been imagining a bridge.

88
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,040
A bridge.

89
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,870
Yes, a bridge.

90
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,250
A union's a wonderful idea...

91
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,300
if both sides are willing.

92
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,300
Well, I'm working on that part.

93
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,880
He's going to blow it.

94
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,140
Give him time. He's warming up.

95
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,260
Wait.

96
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,640
That's your formal coat.

97
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,560
You're in on all of this, aren't you?

98
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,900
If you're busy, I could always come back.

99
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,780
No. No, no.

100
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,150
I'm not busy at all.

101
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,610
No, because I'd hate to...

102
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,410
Really. All ears.
What did you want to talk about?

103
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,620
You're right.
He's blowing it.

104
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,460
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

105
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,750
I've decided to reclaim this day for us.

106
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,420
I've loved you since the moment I met you
and every day since.

107
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,180
If love has a truth, here is mine.

108
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,050
There is no magic nor curse that could
ever tear me away from you, Aurora.

109
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,560
-Are you sure this is a good time?
-Philip.

110
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
He's on his knee.

111
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,570
He took his sweet time about it.

112
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,400
Will you marry me?

113
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,610
Yes.

114
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,370
-Yes?
-Yes.

115
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,370
Yes!

116
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,700
Yes, just stand up. Kiss me.

117
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,590
We're having a wedding!

118
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,340
A secret surprise wedding.

119
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,850
Of course, we have to tell our parents.

120
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,940
Do we?

121
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,090
Mistress.

122
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,590
What?

123
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,890
I have a little bit of news.

124
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,180
Well, on with it.

125
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,980
It's nothing of any real consequence...

126
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,810
and it's certainly no reason to overreact.

127
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,770
It's just that...

128
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,400
Prince Philip has...

129
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,240
Disappeared?

130
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,410
No. No. Philip has...

131
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,990
Yellow fever? No, wait!

132
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,580
Leprosy!

133
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,370
No, Mistress.

134
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,000
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

135
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,830
Don't...

136
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,960
ruin my morning.

137
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,840
Mistress, please.

138
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,760
Stay calm!

139
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,560
<i>So, tell me, sire...</i>

140
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,110
am I to be a best man,
or did you choose a creature from the Moors?

141
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,780
General, if that's your way of asking me
if she said yes, then I...

142
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,860
I know she said yes, sire.

143
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,530
What human wouldn't want to leave that place?

144
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,290
What do you have against Moor folk, Percival?

145
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,700
"Moor folk"?
Is that what we're calling them now?

146
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,080
Winged beasts, murderous trees.

147
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,920
Guard your tongue, General.

148
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,290
You know nothing about them.

149
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,250
I know that Maleficent is a killer of men...

150
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,920
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

151
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,640
She's not like that.

152
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,140
It's my job to protect this kingdom.

153
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,890
And I will do so, old friend...

154
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,390
without hesitation.

155
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,690
Walk on.

156
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,280
Open the gates!

157
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,410
Your Majesty, spoils from the annexation
of the Midlands have arrived.

158
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,290
Weapons.

159
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,380
No. We have no need of arms.

160
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,210
Our days of war are over.

161
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,050
Ingrith...

162
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,930
you see where I've had you placed.
Right behind me.

163
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,640
And that's where I'll always be.

164
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,110
Ingrith, I said we had no need of arms.

165
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,940
One can never be too careful.

166
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,820
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

167
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,950
Is it, now?

168
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,040
-Father, Mother.
-Well?

169
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,500
What did she say?

170
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,920
She said yes.

171
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,210
Yes!

172
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,800
That is wonderful news.

173
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,590
Two kingdoms united at last.

174
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Yes.

175
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,350
Yes.

176
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,100
Perhaps I've been selfish...

177
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,560
looking at this the wrong way.

178
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,780
You've made your choice.

179
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,570
Now is a time to celebrate.

180
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,370
I'm glad you finally approve.

181
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,700
Much more than that.

182
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,000
I am ready to welcome your fiancée
with open arms.

183
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,250
She shall come to dinner.

184
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,460
That would be incredible.

185
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,210
Under one condition.

186
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,760
She will bring her godmother.

187
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,420
Your Majesty, I strongly...

188
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,390
We will meet the one who raised her
right here in this castle.

189
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,800
Yes. The queen is right.

190
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,060
I'm not sure her godmother will...

191
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,770
No, but I insist.

192
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,020
After all, we will soon be family.

193
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,560
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

194
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,730
that my son is to marry Aurora.

195
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,240
And Maleficent is coming to dinner.

196
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,530
I shall send word straightaway.

197
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,890
Incoming.

198
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,440
Hold on to your petticoats!

199
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,580
Well, well.

200
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,580
So?

201
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,750
So.

202
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Godmother...

203
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,470
Philip asked me to marry him.

204
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,970
Poor thing.

205
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,800
He'll recover.

206
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,850
My answer was yes.

207
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,690
No.

208
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Yes.

209
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,020
No.

210
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,400
I wasn't really asking.

211
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,650
Nor was I.

212
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,700
What's next?

213
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,530
You'll turn him into a goat?

214
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,280
Stop.

215
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,950
Why don't you like Philip?

216
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Well, for one thing, he's human.

217
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,540
I'm a human.

218
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,590
And I have never held that against you.

219
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,920
Until I fell in love.

220
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,220
Love doesn't always end well, Beasty.

221
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,890
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

222
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,680
A very handsome and charming prince.

223
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,270
I'm just asking you to trust me.

224
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,570
Please give him a chance.

225
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,400
Let us prove you wrong.

226
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,490
Philip is thoughtful...

227
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,030
he's very kind...

228
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,490
Kind of what?

229
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,450
The king and queen are celebrating tonight...

230
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,080
and they have invited both of us
to the castle.

231
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,420
You want me to meet his parents?

232
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,090
It's just a dinner.

233
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,960
They don't want me in Ulstead.

234
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,920
Why on earth would I go?

235
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,180
Because his mother wishes to meet mine.

236
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,180
Please.

237
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,820
Philip.

238
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,070
I want you to wear this tonight.

239
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,700
Your sword?

240
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,490
Because of you,
Ulstead and the Moors will be united at last.

241
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,210
Father, my love for Aurora
has nothing to do with politics.

242
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,630
Yes, but your love...

243
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,550
will ensure peace for generations.

244
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,050
Now take it. And wear it...

245
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,180
to know that you will never have to use it.

246
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,300
My son.

247
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,140
I've never been more proud.

248
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,190
And what about Mother?

249
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,480
Is she okay with this?

250
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,490
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

251
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,800
Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.

252
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,230
I'm losing my patience.

253
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,980
Your Majesty.

254
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,900
You need to move faster, Lickspittle.

255
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,070
Aurora said yes.

257
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,250
It's all coming together...

258
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,960
perfectly.

259
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,800
Hello.

260
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,510
Hello.

261
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,100
Hello.

262
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,020
Try it with a little less fang.

263
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,150
How's this?

264
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,820
Try the greeting.

265
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,330
How kind of you to invite me this evening.

266
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,370
Remember, it's not a threat.

267
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,330
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

268
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,290
Yeah. Better.

269
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Try it with a curtsy.

270
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,260
We can skip that part.

271
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,100
She really loves that boy, you know.

272
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,770
You're doing her a great kindness.

273
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,440
Kindness?

274
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,570
Mistress...

275
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,210
Doesn't she look lovely?

276
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,260
I have something for you.

277
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,180
For your horns.

278
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,390
I just thought it might make Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

279
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
And you, as well.

280
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,650
Maybe it's a bad idea.

281
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,520
No, it's...

282
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,530
It's all right.

283
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,330
I'm so excited.

284
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,750
It's more than I can bear.

285
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,370
It's Maleficent!

286
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,920
Pitchforks?

287
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,840
Humans are hilarious.

288
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,430
It's getting better.

289
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,410
-Anyone leaves their post gets hung.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,040
They're here.

291
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,390
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

292
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,760
I think I'd make quite an impressive one.

293
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,180
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

294
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,140
Why are we talking about bears?

295
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,730
Presenting Queen Aurora of the Moors.

296
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,070
Thank you.

297
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,870
-You look wonderful.
-I'm so happy to be here.

298
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,330
Aurora, this is truly an honor.

299
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,250
Welcome to Ulstead.

300
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,260
Such a beautiful girl.

301
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,430
I can see how you stole Philip's heart.

302
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,890
Your Majesty.

303
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,060
The flowers in your hair. I'm allergic.

304
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,650
I'm so sorry.

305
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,150
Oh, no. No, no. It's all right.
They're beautiful.

306
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,490
Presenting Maleficent.

307
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,790
Maleficent, it's wonderful to see you again.

308
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,260
This is my father, King John of Ulstead.

309
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,300
And my mother, Queen Ingrith.

310
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,800
Welcome to our home.

311
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,310
It's so very kind of you to invite me
this evening.

312
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,100
Don't smile.

313
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,400
And I would like to introduce you to Diaval.

314
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,200
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

315
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,030
Why would I have trouble?

316
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,950
He's making small talk.

317
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,290
I'll explain it later.

318
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,290
No trouble at all.

319
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,670
Your Majesties, ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

320
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,340
Please, make yourselves at home.

321
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,660
Bird.

322
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,290
Delicious.

323
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,430
Is there a problem?

324
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,720
It's iron.

325
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,020
Majesty, as you are sensitive to flowers,
she is averse to iron.

326
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,400
I had no idea.

327
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,020
Take it away at once.

328
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,240
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

329
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,540
Such a warm spell of weather, isn't it?

330
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,160
It certainly is.

331
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,670
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

332
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,510
to celebrate their
glorious future together.

333
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,480
I simply can't wait to have a little one
running through the castle again.

334
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,780
This castle?

335
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,320
Yes, of course.

336
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,660
This will be their home.

337
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,700
I hear Aurora has a castle of her own.

338
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,540
Yes, sir, I do.

339
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,080
Yes...

340
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

341
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,210
I made her queen.

342
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,300
Her castle is quite stunning.
You must see it.

343
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,390
Yes, but in fact, she has another castle.

344
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,010
Does she not?

345
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,350
Mother...

346
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,440
One in the Moors,
and one left behind by her father.

347
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,610
King Stefan, was it not?

348
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,490
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

349
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,280
So, you're also a true princess.

350
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,530
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

351
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,490
Remind me, did he die or was he killed?

352
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,620
Both.

353
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,580
Yes, you're right, it is very warm recently.

354
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,590
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

355
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,800
A baby cursed to sleep...

356
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,050
and never wake up.

357
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,640
Really?

358
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,390
Who would do such a terrible thing
to an innocent child?

359
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,730
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

360
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,980
I'm sure your kind would agree.

361
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,820
What do you mean, my kind?

362
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,450
She means humans.

363
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,450
There are fairies missing from the Moors.

364
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,160
What I'm missing is some wine.

365
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,040
Stolen by human poachers.

366
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,500
That's the first I've heard of it.

367
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,000
Someone gave the order.

368
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,050
It sounds as if you're accusing the king.

369
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,590
No, she never said that.

370
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,180
Wait...
Sorry, who would steal a fairy?

371
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,720
Your Majesty, I must report
that two peasants were found dead...

372
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,680
just outside the Moors.

373
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,520
They'd been missing for several days.

374
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,690
I see.

375
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,690
Yes, we all see.

376
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:31,190
The borders are open, but humans
are not welcome. Isn't that right?

377
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,610
What exactly are you implying, Your Majesty?

378
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,910
Innocent men are being slaughtered
on the Moors...

379
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,080
and she's talking about fairies.

380
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,420
Contain your animal.

381
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,380
Or I will.

382
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,630
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were making a threat.

383
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,840
Well, do you?

384
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,840
Do I what?

385
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,970
Know better?

386
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,140
Enough.

387
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,560
Put her down.

388
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,980
Please, put her down.

389
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,110
We're here to celebrate.

390
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,190
Forgive me, he's right.

391
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,320
Let's not forget why we're here.

392
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,410
The start of a new life for Aurora.

393
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,910
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

394
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,710
You have done an admirable job, Maleficent...

395
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,920
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

396
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,380
But now...

397
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,970
Aurora will finally get...

398
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,470
the love of a real family.

399
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,680
A real mother.

400
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,150
Because the one thing I regret...

401
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,980
is never having a daughter of my own.

402
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,990
But tonight changes that.

403
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:01,570
Tonight, I consider Aurora my own.

404
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,010
Guards!

405
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,220
We have opened our home to a witch!

406
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,850
Stop!

407
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,310
There is no union.

408
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,940
There will be no wedding.

409
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,780
-Maleficent!
-We must protect the king!

410
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,570
Maleficent, please, stop now.

411
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,070
John, I'm so frightened.

412
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,700
What has she done to me?

413
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Father!

414
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,170
John!

415
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,130
We go home.

416
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:55,960
John!

417
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,170
It's a curse.

418
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,050
It's a curse!

419
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,430
Maleficent has cursed the king!

420
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,310
What have you done?

421
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,270
I've done nothing.

422
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,560
Aurora, we go home now.

423
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:31,580
Aurora!

424
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,290
Wake him!

425
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,340
Wake him, please.

426
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,090
Stand aside!

427
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,630
To the bedroom!

428
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,010
This magic, we have no tools to reverse it.

429
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,730
There must be a lesion.

430
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,140
Proof of her witchery.

431
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,480
Please, leave His Majesty his dignity.

432
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,610
We all saw what Maleficent did to him.

433
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,940
I'm so sorry.

434
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,530
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

435
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,660
All he wanted was peace.

436
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,660
This is all my fault.

437
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,580
You have nothing to apologize for, my dear.

438
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,130
Maleficent is a threat to everyone.

439
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,380
Especially you.

440
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,840
We'll do our best to protect you.

441
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,090
There must be a way to reverse this.

442
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,270
Mother, could you try kissing him?

443
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,350
True love and all that.

444
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,400
I doubt that would work.

445
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,820
It could save him.

446
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,610
-A kiss is just a kiss.
-Please, Mother.

447
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,410
Very well.

448
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,040
You wanted peace...

449
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,550
now rest in peace forever.

450
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,390
I told you.

451
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,520
This is no fairy tale.

452
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,230
I have to return to the Moors.

453
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,440
It's the only way.

454
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,820
Wait, wait. Come here.

455
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,440
I have to find her.

456
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,610
It's the middle of the night.

457
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,450
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

458
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,240
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

459
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,830
No. You should stay with your family.

460
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,330
You are my family.

461
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,330
Let her go, Philip.

462
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,790
Maybe she can save him.

463
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,390
Maleficent!

464
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,690
Maleficent!

465
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,910
Godmother!

466
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,080
Please come back.

467
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
She's not in the Moors.

468
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
Diaval.

469
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,970
No one's seen her.

470
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm so happy to see you.

471
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,970
She's nowhere to be found.

472
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,180
What if she never comes back?

473
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,520
I could be stuck as a human forever.

474
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,310
I have to find her.

475
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,150
She's the only one who can break the curse.

476
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,590
Tell me she's dead.

477
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,930
The iron pierced her flesh.

478
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,680
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

479
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,930
Then where is her head?

480
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,390
There was something else.

481
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,600
Another creature.

482
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,900
It pulled her from the depths of the sea.

483
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,110
What did it look like?

484
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,690
Her.

485
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,490
It carried her up into the sky.

486
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,370
A wounded animal lashes out
and now she's not alone.

487
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,160
We must be ready for war.

488
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,960
Maleficent has cursed the king!

489
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Stay inside!

490
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,600
Maleficent has cursed the king!

491
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,450
If Conall hadn't found her,
she would be dead.

492
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,120
They tried to kill her with this.

493
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,890
Do you hear it?

494
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,270
Do you hear it?

495
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,730
It's a message from the humans.

496
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,030
I hear it loud and clear.

497
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,990
Time for us to die.

498
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,700
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

499
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,240
And we are almost extinct because of it.

500
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,120
Killing peasants on the Moors
will only lead to more conflict, Borra.

501
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,290
They've pulled the iron from the earth...

502
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,130
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

503
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,630
But this...

504
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,050
This will finish us.

505
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,760
Our people are safe here for now.

506
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,680
But for how long?

507
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,720
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

508
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,520
I call for war.

509
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,690
I call for war!

510
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,900
Right now!

511
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,230
There are too many humans.

512
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,820
Too many kingdoms.

513
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,910
Conall, they will keep finding
new ways to destroy us.

514
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,660
We can't win.

515
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,000
We can't win!

516
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,710
Not this way.

517
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,260
No. You're wrong, Conall.

518
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,550
We have something they didn't plan on.

519
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,810
We have her.

520
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,810
She holds powers none of us possess.

521
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,530
She is wounded, Borra.

522
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,280
Who are you?

523
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,050
You reek of human.

524
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,590
Maybe I was wrong about you.

525
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,600
Or maybe Conall should have left you
for dead at the bottom of the sea.

526
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,770
No.

527
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,310
It's there, isn't it?

528
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,150
It's inside you.

529
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,300
You see?

530
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,720
You see what's inside her?

531
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,180
That is what will save us all.

532
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,820
You saved me.

533
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,750
Come.

534
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,790
Let me show you who we are.

535
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:03,940
We're Dark Fey.

536
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,020
Same as you.

537
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,990
We're all that remain.

538
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:24,330
Unseen here, far away from mankind.

539
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,750
Look!

540
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,880
As more human kingdoms emerged,
we went into hiding...

541
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,670
from every corner of the earth...

542
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,840
doing what we had to, to survive.

543
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,930
But many were lost.

544
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,870
Only a few generations ago...

545
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,290
our kind roamed every part of the world.

546
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,960
The tundra.

547
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,420
The forest.

548
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,960
The jungle.

549
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,930
The desert.

550
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,180
Now, our only refuge is here...

551
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,940
in this cave.

552
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,150
Our nest of origin.

553
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,110
Listen. Play in the wind.

554
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,860
Go!

555
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,390
Those children should be soaring
over the trees and rivers.

556
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,470
Instead, they are raised in exile.

557
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,560
I could protect them.

558
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,980
How? By waging war against the humans?

559
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,070
I've been at war with them my whole life.

560
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,280
Not all of them.

561
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,570
There was one you raised as your own.

562
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,910
Maybe we don't have to hide from the humans.

563
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,990
Maybe we can exist without fear...

564
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,950
and war.

565
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,790
Find a way together.

566
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,290
That will never happen.

567
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,430
Gotcha!

568
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:15,600
Welcome to your new home.

569
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,040
We've been worried about you, dear.

570
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,090
Your Majesty.

571
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,920
I couldn't find her.

572
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:44,720
My heart breaks for you.

573
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,180
She has brought a cloud of darkness
upon your happiness.

574
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,720
I know she was against this marriage.

575
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,190
Never trusted your instincts as a queen.

576
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,270
When I saw her at dinner...

577
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,360
with her horns covered...

578
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,490
bent cowering...

579
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:15,870
Well, it's no wonder that she lashed out.

580
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,420
I just don't know what to do.

581
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,750
You do truly love him, don't you?

582
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,340
My son.

583
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,840
Deeply.

584
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,760
It is love that will heal you.

585
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,180
It's what heals us all.

586
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:35,230
Let's move forward together...

587
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,770
as a family.

588
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,080
<i>To all who live on the Moors...</i>

589
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,170
What is that noise?

590
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:04,300
<i>...and kingdoms far and wide,
the king and queen invite you...</i>

591
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,510
<i>to attend the wedding...</i>

592
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:10,010
<i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.</i>

593
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,550
<i>All are welcome.</i>

594
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,140
<i>And all are expected!</i>

595
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,900
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

596
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,150
I knew Aurora wouldn't abandon us!

597
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,400
I always knew I'd be invited.

598
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,700
Just glad you two made the cut.

599
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,280
Who's getting married?

600
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,330
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

601
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,500
The queen is right.

602
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,010
We owe it to everyone...

603
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,680
especially the king.

604
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,510
What about Maleficent?

605
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,770
She's gone.

606
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,950
The Phoenix.

607
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,450
It is said the Dark Fey began with her...

608
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,870
evolved over centuries.

609
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,960
You are the last of her descendants.

610
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,130
Her blood is your own.

611
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,550
You are her.

612
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,260
In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...

613
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:40,230
destruction and rebirth.

614
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:47,230
But nature's greatest power
is the power of true transformation.

615
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,280
You transformed when you raised Aurora.

616
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,370
When you found love...

617
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,620
in the middle of your pain.

618
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,960
I'm asking you to take all of your fury...

619
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,420
all of your pain...

620
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,420
and not use it.

621
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:12,880
Help us broker peace with the humans.

622
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,800
Because peace...

623
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,140
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

624
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,780
The Moors are our last true nature on earth.

625
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,240
And yet you named a human as queen.

626
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,530
A daughter you cared for.

627
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,790
I have no daughter.

628
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,790
She has chosen her side.

629
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,850
We've just heard.

630
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,100
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

631
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,900
Humans will come from all over.

632
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,280
That's when we attack.

633
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,190
We'll kill the king and queen of Ulstead...

634
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,360
and their young prince.

635
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,240
Their kingdom will fall.

636
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,410
And the Fey will rise again.

637
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,890
The fairies made it.

638
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,450
I wore it when I married the king.

639
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,040
I'm sure it's perfect.

640
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,000
So am I.

641
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:22,260
Your Majesty, she's absolutely lovely.

642
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,390
Considering how she was raised.

643
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,930
By the same evil witch who cursed her.

644
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,230
It's a miracle Prince Philip came along.

645
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,360
It's a miracle
the poor child is alive at all.

646
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,570
Thank you so much.

647
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:37,740
It's exquisite.

648
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:09,890
<i>When I'm older...</i>

649
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,850
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

650
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,360
Then we can look after each other.

651
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,590
-Tell me what's troubling you.
-It's nothing.

652
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,340
Aurora, I know you better than that.

653
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,390
This jewelry...

654
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,640
my hair...

655
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,890
all these rules.

656
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,560
I can't breathe.

657
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,230
I feel like
I'm not Queen of the Moors anymore.

658
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,610
I feel like a different person.

659
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,190
Listen...

660
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,200
I fell in love with a girl in the forest
and only her.

661
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:06,870
You don't have to change.

662
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,160
I don't want you to change.

663
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,460
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

664
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,980
Ah, yes.

665
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,110
Well...

666
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,070
Does it work?

667
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,030
I only have a handful of fairy specimens
to work with...

668
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,660
and the extraction process is painstaking.

669
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,370
Extraction from what?

670
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,500
Tomb Bloom flowers.

671
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,500
They grow from a fairy's grave,
contain their very essence.

672
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,510
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

673
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,470
the resulting dust ends a fairy's life.

674
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,260
We will need thousands more.

675
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,430
Show me.

676
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:14,520
Show me.

677
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:15,980
Very well.

678
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,110
So...

679
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,160
Finally, the Moors will be mine.

680
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:17,660
No more fairies.

681
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,160
Stay alert, men.

682
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,010
This is where I found them.

683
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,180
Excellent.

684
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,390
But what if the winged one returns?

685
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,470
Don't you worry about that.

686
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,390
We'll be ready.

687
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,730
Take the Tomb Blooms.

688
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,400
Get to work!

689
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,160
Sentries, stay alert!

690
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,580
Keep your weapons on hand.

691
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,560
Move it!

692
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:13,990
Maleficent...

693
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,910
This is where we bury our dead.

694
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,080
They've destroyed it.

695
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,710
This is what the humans do.

696
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,460
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

697
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:14,300
We have to stop them.

698
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,050
You spent years caring for a human...

699
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,220
now it's time to care for your own.

700
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,820
Fire!

701
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,300
Reload! We go again!

702
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,560
Fire!

703
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,650
Reload! There's another one!

704
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,470
Everyone, stay together!

705
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,310
We're about to leave the Moors.

706
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,940
Grab the hand or the wing...

707
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,480
or the tail of whoever is closest to you.

708
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,030
Hey, over here! Yeah, over here!

709
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,570
Hold formation, guards. Hold formation.

710
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,820
-Excuse me, sir.
-Stop right there.

711
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,030
I'm with the bride.

712
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,290
We've been told to let the other kind
find their seats first.

713
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,540
But I'm not a human.

714
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,460
-I'm a raven.
-What?

715
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,750
A raven. The black bird.

716
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,500
This rice is delicious.

717
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,210
You're supposed to throw it
at the bride and groom.

718
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,800
What? And waste good rice?

719
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:44,220
What's the hold up?

720
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,220
Let me in!

721
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:48,350
Why can't humans come in, too?

722
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,600
Why can't we come in?

723
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,940
I know it's bad luck...

724
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,780
but I had to see you.

725
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,610
For you.

726
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,450
A Tomb Bloom?

727
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:07,570
Where did you get this?

728
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,700
From my mother.

729
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:12,080
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

730
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,920
<i>From my mother.</i>

731
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,800
Where should we sit, Flittle?

732
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:14,840
On the left.
We're with the bride.

733
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,510
Yes, we are.

734
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,430
But the groom's lovely, too.

735
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,270
Yes, he is.

736
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,560
I'm with both.

737
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:33,610
Now.

738
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,760
What's this?

739
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:00,600
Nobody is allowed in here except me.

740
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:03,520
And I'm already here, so go away!

741
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,200
Maleficent, please stop.

742
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:31,960
Maleficent.

743
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,550
She didn't do it.

744
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:38,260
Get out!

745
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,140
Before I call the guards!

746
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,610
The missing fairies.

747
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,020
I said get out. Did you hear me?

748
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:52,570
What have you done?

749
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,870
You're a pixie.

750
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,330
How dare you call me that?

751
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:03,450
I'm Lickspittle, the nobleman...

752
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,370
and I serve the queen.

753
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,330
She took your wings.

754
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,380
We have to release them.

755
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,590
They belong on the Moors.

756
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,760
As you do, Aurora.

757
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:22,310
A human who has betrayed her kind.

758
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,770
You put the curse on the king.

759
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,520
Oh, dear.

760
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:34,980
You may be queen...

761
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:36,900
but you are very young.

762
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,910
Ruling humans is a bit more complicated...

763
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:44,290
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

764
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,170
When I was young...

765
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:53,290
my family's kingdom bordered the Moors.

766
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,720
And one particularly harsh winter...

767
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,510
our crops died...

768
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,470
and the people began to suffer.

769
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:05,930
And as we looked over our walls...

770
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:09,140
we could see the fairies thriving.

771
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:13,060
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

772
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:18,360
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

773
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,160
Choosing peace over our people,
he sent my brother to do his bidding.

774
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,870
He never came back.

775
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:28,830
Those savages...

776
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
creatures who could barely grunt,
let alone engage in talks, killed him.

777
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,090
I don't believe that.

778
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,550
Our people became fearful.

779
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:39,340
They overthrew my father.

780
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:42,470
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

781
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:47,720
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

782
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:52,310
Another weak king
speaking of tolerance and civility.

783
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,190
And now, my own son...

784
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,570
corrupted with visions of harmony.

785
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,820
But peace will not be our downfall.

786
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,700
Now lock her up.

787
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,830
A war is coming.

788
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:19,590
No! No!

789
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,430
I wish you could be here with me.

790
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,150
Conall wanted peace...

791
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,120
<i>and they filled him with iron.</i>

792
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,990
Now, we will have our war.

793
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,210
Our fight begins now!

794
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,960
We will rise together!

795
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:00,260
We fight together.

796
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:04,880
And we will show them no mercy!

797
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,030
Come on! Go!

798
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:30,030
Go! Go!

799
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:34,000
Go! Go! Go!

800
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,640
Where are all Philip's guests?

801
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,020
Humans are poor timekeepers.

802
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,960
Start the music.

803
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,400
Come on! Come on!

804
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,500
She's gone.

805
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,170
Hey!

806
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,060
It's a trap! Get down!

807
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,210
Your Majesty...

808
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:24,710
they're coming from the sea.

809
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:35,390
She escaped!

810
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,100
Down this way, come on!

811
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:53,110
Your Highness.

812
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,700
Upon my command.

813
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:06,500
Check every room!

814
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,050
She can't be far!

815
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,000
Wait.

816
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,620
Wait.

817
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:12,030
What's going on?

818
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,320
Now.

819
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,740
Fire!

820
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,460
No!

821
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,280
They look just like her.

822
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,790
Withdraw!

823
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:06,000
Withdraw!

824
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,670
Pull back!

825
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,210
Maleficent's starting a war.

826
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,540
First my father, and now this.

827
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,880
Philip! She didn't curse him.

828
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,670
-Maleficent.
-What?

829
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:18,880
She never cursed him.

830
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,640
It was your mother.

831
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,010
What are you saying?

832
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,390
It was the spindle.

833
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,190
The curse is still in it.

834
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,190
Your mother used it against your father.

835
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,360
Look.

836
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,740
It's the same.

837
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:44,160
She's locked the Moor folk in the chapel.

838
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,540
This isn't a wedding.

839
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,700
It's a trap.

840
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,840
Remember where you came from.

841
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:57,800
Remember who you are.

842
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:02,970
I've made my choice.

843
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,100
You'll have to make yours.

844
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,920
Stay low!

845
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:39,340
Divide!

846
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,130
Follow me!

847
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,140
Attack!

848
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,020
Attack!

849
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,830
-Ignite!
-Ignite!

850
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:20,170
No!

851
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:05,930
Aunties!
Aunties!

852
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,470
It's too heavy!

853
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:13,020
Aurora!

854
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,390
Diaval! You're here.

855
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,190
What's happening?

856
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:41,170
Weapon change!

857
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:44,300
Weapon change! Go!

858
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:25,670
Mother!

859
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:27,970
You have to stop this.

860
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:29,590
We are at war.

861
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,640
This isn't a war. It's a massacre.

862
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,300
Philip, you don't understand.

863
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:36,140
These creatures stand between us...

864
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:38,890
and everything we need to survive.

865
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,310
You're wrong.

866
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,850
We can stand together.

867
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,730
Well, you're a fool to believe that.

868
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:48,190
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

869
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,410
You lied to me.

870
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:53,410
I am protecting the kingdom...

871
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,830
and your throne.

872
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,450
What about Father?

873
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:02,130
Were you protecting him, too?

874
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,880
The prince is not feeling well.

875
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:09,920
See him to his chambers.

876
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:14,760
Now.

877
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:20,480
Sire, stop!

878
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,710
Yield! Yield!

879
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,590
My mother cursed the king
so she could destroy the Moor folk.

880
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:54,180
Your men are paying heavily for it.

881
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:03,100
We have to do something!

882
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:08,480
Goodbye, girls.

883
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:11,610
No, come back!

884
01:28:11,950 --> 01:28:13,700
Flittle! No!

885
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:27,590
No!

886
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,590
Hey, you, stay with your own!

887
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:31,760
Run, Aurora, run!

888
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,590
Let him go!

889
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:40,310
No! No!

890
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,210
Godmother.

891
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,230
For Flittle!

892
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:18,950
We've got her!

893
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,710
Go! Go!

894
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:11,420
This way! This way!

895
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,540
Go!

896
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:57,170
Stand down!

897
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,380
This is not my fight.

898
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:03,720
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

899
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:08,390
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

900
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,580
There will be no Fey blood on my hands.

901
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,480
This way!
This way!

902
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,520
Maleficent's back!

903
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:03,650
She's going for the queen.

904
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:11,240
Yield! Yield!

905
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:12,410
Stand down!

906
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:13,910
Lower your weapons!

907
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:29,010
There's the evil that I promised them.

908
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,230
Your kind is more predictable than humans.

909
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,780
Stop!

910
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:44,570
Stop!

911
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,860
Well, almost.

912
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,240
Stop.

913
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:51,410
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

914
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,540
There's another way.

915
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:54,910
I know who you are.

916
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:59,790
I know you.

917
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:01,840
You do not.

918
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,470
Yes, I do.

919
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:08,890
You're my mother.

920
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,300
No!

921
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:03,570
Do you know what
makes a great leader, Aurora?

922
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,940
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

923
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:09,320
and then use that fear...

924
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:10,450
Your Majesty.

925
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:14,240
...against your enemies.

926
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:15,990
So...

927
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:20,370
I spread the story of the evil witch...

928
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:23,210
and the princess she cursed.

929
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:27,920
It didn't matter who woke Sleeping Beauty.

930
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,760
They were all terrified.

931
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:34,050
And the story became legend.

932
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:38,430
I know you think I'm a monster.

933
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:43,980
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

934
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:47,730
I did for Ulstead.

935
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:52,360
You are a traitor to your kind,
and you will pay for it.

936
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:55,530
Maleficent is dead!

937
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,750
We will never again live in fear!

938
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:03,250
Get back here!

939
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:09,380
Ulstead is free at last!

940
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:12,260
Let me go!

941
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:21,980
What's happening?

942
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,480
Well, well.

943
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,600
Hello, Beasty.

944
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:12,290
I missed you.

945
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,540
Did you bump your head, then?

946
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,210
I did.

947
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:21,510
Philip.

948
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:23,380
Yes?

949
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:27,060
Do you love my daughter?

950
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:31,350
With everything I have.

951
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:41,780
Good.

952
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:53,670
I believe this belongs to you.

953
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:02,420
Curses don't end.

954
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:04,300
They're broken.

955
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,450
It ends.

956
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:39,540
There will be no more fighting.

957
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,590
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

958
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,050
And from this day on...

959
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:47,050
we move forward...

960
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:49,800
and find our way...

961
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:52,310
in peace.

962
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:54,270
Together.

963
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,900
Today, there will be a wedding.

964
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,690
Not just a union of two people...

965
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:06,860
but a union of two kingdoms.

966
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:08,530
And all are invited...

967
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,580
all are safe...

968
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:13,950
and all are welcome.

969
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:49,860
Hello, there.

970
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:33,870
We cannot live amongst monsters...

971
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:42,500
Someone should really cover those horns.

972
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:01,310
If only Conall could see you.

973
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,480
Borra...

974
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:08,860
it's time to come home.

975
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:16,740
Hello.

976
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:20,290
Can you come here?

977
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,880
Yes?

978
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,600
Will you give me away?

979
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:37,430
Never.

980
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,930
No.

981
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,020
Will you walk me down the aisle?

982
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:47,650
Yes.

983
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:13,170
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

984
01:45:25,770 --> 01:45:26,560
Is that...?

985
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,190
She can change her back.

986
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,150
I suppose.

987
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,820
Only if we wanted to.

988
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:37,030
Father.

989
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:43,910
I'm so glad to see you.

990
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,120
I've dreamed of this moment.

991
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:48,540
Two kingdoms united at last.

992
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:51,300
And it's because of you.

993
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:54,630
I'm so proud of you. So proud.

994
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:25,250
She looks better in green.

995
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:26,540
Pink, you mean.

996
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:31,000
No, in green.

997
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,590
Pink.

998
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,050
-Green.
-Pink.

999
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:38,590
Flittle!

1000
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,050
It's perfect.

1001
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:27,230
Let her go.

1002
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:43,240
Pull yourself together.

1003
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:46,700
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

1004
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:48,500
divided by fear.

1005
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:54,420
Today, you teach us
we are not defined by where we are from...

1006
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:56,800
but by whom we love.

1007
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:00,430
The bands, please.

1008
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:18,940
-Do you, Philip, take Aurora...
-I do.

1009
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:22,860
-And do you, Aurora, take...
-I do.

1010
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:27,160
Then I pronounce you husband and wife.

1011
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:29,370
You may kiss the bride.

1012
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:01,190
You're smiling.

1013
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:25,800
It's a new day.

1014
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:30,010
It is.

1015
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:42,650
Morning.

1016
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:45,610
Will you stay awhile?

1017
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:47,030
A little while.

1018
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:49,330
But don't worry...

1019
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:52,000
I'll see you at the christening.
