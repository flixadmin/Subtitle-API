1
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,377
Five, four, three,

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,104
two, one.

3
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,745
Ready or not, here I come!

4
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:24,453
Hey, dad?

5
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:27,661
Dad!

6
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:32,029
You'll stay with Aunt May

7
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,967
and Uncle Ben for a little while.

8
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,333
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

9
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,814
He doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches

10
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,247
and he likes to sleep
with a little light on and I—

11
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,546
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

12
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,259
Dad.

13
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:55,790
Be good.

14
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:14,408
Sorry.

15
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,409
Morning, Flash.

16
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:20,856
Good morning, Parker.

Hey. It's, uh, Peter, right?

21
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,361
Mm-hm.

22
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:33,026
I really like your photos.

23
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:34,466
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

24
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:35,970
Uh, listen,

25
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:37,473
are you busy Friday night?

26
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,037
Uh...

27
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,984
Cool. Uh, can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

28
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,143
I just, you know,
I really wanna frame a good one

29
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:49,379
for his birthday.

30
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:53,014
That's really nice of you. Wow,
that's such a nice thought. Um...

31
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:55,160
Yeah, I'll have a look
at the old, uh...

32
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,057
The old schedule.
Okay.

33
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,358
Parker.

34
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,559
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

35
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,226
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

36
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:04,733
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

37
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,031
Like that?

38
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:07,936
- That's it.
- Okay.

00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,699
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

49
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,278
Eat your vegetables, Gordon. Come on!

50
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,913
Come on!

51
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,242
Hey, Parker, come on!

52
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:46,782
Get a picture of this, come on.

53
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:50,113
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man. Put him down, man.

54
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,257
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it. Don't eat it.

55
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:53,448
Take the picture, Parker.

56
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,093
Put him down, Flash.

57
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:56,853
Take the picture.

58
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:59,588
Put him down, Eugene!

59
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:01,094
Aw...

60
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:04,001
Hey, man.

61
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:05,402
Oh!

62
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:06,465
Come on!

63
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:07,299
Get up, Parker!

64
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:10,736
Get up!

65
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,538
Come on! Come on!

66
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:13,373
- Get up!
- Ooh!

67
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,648
Still not taking the picture.

68
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,517
Stay down, Parker!

69
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,489
Who wants one more?

70
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:23,249
- One more? Huh?
- Flash!

71
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,270
Flash,

72
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,809
we still on for after school today?

73
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:29,255
My house, 3:30?

74
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,522
I hope you've been doing
your homework. Last time, I was...

75
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,446
very disappointed in you.

76
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,563
- Okay, move.
- No. Flash, how about we go to class?

77
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:36,933
Hm? How about it?

78
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:41,300
Whatever.

79
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,604
I thought that was great,
what you did back there.

80
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,906
It was stupid,

81
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:12,386
but it was great.

82
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:13,946
You should probably go to

83
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,843
the nurse. You might
have a concussion.

84
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:18,883
What's your name?

85
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:20,578
You don't know my name?

86
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,719
No, I know your name.

87
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,618
I just want to know
if you know your name.

88
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:27,885
Peter.

89
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:31,161
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

90
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,404
I'd still go to the nurse though.

91
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:41,837
You're Gwen, right?

92
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,205
Gwen Stacy.

93
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,205
All right.

94
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:48,144
Hey.

95
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:51,115
I'm making spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

96
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:53,917
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

97
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:57,822
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

98
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,025
- Oh my God.
- What's up?

99
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:01,722
- What happened to your face?
- Oh,

100
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:04,265
I'm all right.
Just... I fell, skating.

101
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:06,035
It's all right.

102
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:08,738
Ben Parker, don't you even

103
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,876
think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

104
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,067
These are my bowling trophies.

105
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,769
Oh, well, then, by all means,

106
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:16,438
please leave that
filthy box in my kitchen.

107
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,082
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

108
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:21,045
Why you kids ride
those things, I'll never know.

109
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,979
'Cause it's stupid and dangerous.

110
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:24,782
Remember when we were
stupid and dangerous?

111
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:25,747
No.

112
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:28,053
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

113
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,127
Hey, where's the flood?

114
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:30,786
Follow me. I'll show you.

115
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:32,193
- You serious?
- Yes.

116
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:33,959
All right.

117
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:37,627
I think it's the condenser tray.

118
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,740
Oh, too much water for the condenser's
tray or the heat exchange tubing.

119
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:42,641
This has got to be the fill line.

120
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,211
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

121
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:46,711
Can you fix it?

122
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:50,115
No, not tonight. I'll go by
the hardware store tomorrow.

123
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:52,720
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

124
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:56,419
How's the other guy look?

125
00:08:57,983 --> 00:09:01,123
Come on, I know a right
cross when I see one.

126
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:05,098
Yes or no? Do I have
to call somebody's father?

127
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:06,568
No, no.

128
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:07,795
All right.

129
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,065
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

130
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,509
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

131
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,935
Hey, before you come up, see

132
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:19,349
-  if there's anything else worth saving.
- Sure.

133
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:38,496
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Oh yes, they fix them.

134
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,265
They fix pipes and
they pump things. They—

135
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,272
If you ask them to—

136
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:49,209
I forgot all about that thing.

137
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,282
It was your dad's.

138
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,503
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe for him.

139
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:59,692
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

140
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:03,524
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old
kid need with a briefcase?

141
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:05,491
And guess who sold it to him.

142
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,329
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

143
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:08,562
That's how they met.

144
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,537
He asked you to keep—

145
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:12,676
Keep this safe? Why?
There is—there's nothing in here.

146
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,572
Have you looked in here?
There's nothing in here.

147
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,871
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

148
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,549
Yeah, I know.

149
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:26,556
Who's that?

150
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,249
Do you know who that is?

151
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:29,757
Some guy who worked with

152
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,054
your dad, I guess.

153
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,869
Just take this off the table, all right?

154
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:41,063
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

155
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:43,106
- Now.
- All right.

156
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:44,299
Go on.

157
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:21,551
<i>I need you to be a good boy, Peter.</i>

158
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:22,810
Where are you going?

159
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,147
There's something, uh...

160
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:26,345
There's something
your mom and I have to do.

161
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,714
What is this?

162
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,853
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

163
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,292
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

164
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,069
Come in.

165
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,572
You okay?

166
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,076
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh my God.

167
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,543
You look just like him.

168
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,508
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

169
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,855
Listen, um,

170
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:00,492
I don't have much education.

171
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,093
You know that, Peter.

172
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,963
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

173
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,701
What I'm trying to say is...

174
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:11,602
I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

175
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:13,938
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

176
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:17,575
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not all right.

177
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:21,242
I wish I could
change it, but I can't.

178
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,517
Curt Connors.

179
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,918
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

180
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:30,423
They worked together
for years and they were close.

181
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:32,993
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

182
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,086
He never even called.

183
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:36,492
Not once.

184
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,594
Go figure.

185
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:45,201
She's pretty.

186
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:51,638
Uncle Ben.

187
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:53,078
What?

188
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,141
You're a pretty great dad, all right?

189
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:52,511
Excuse me.

190
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,479
What?

191
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,209
- Can I help you?
- Oh, uh...

192
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,047
I don't know. I'm here to see Dr.—

193
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:58,688
- Dr. Connors.
- Right.

194
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:00,721
You'll find yourself to the left.

195
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:04,323
You are here for the internship?

196
00:15:05,285 --> 00:15:06,559
Yeah. Yeah.

197
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,823
Okay.

198
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:09,864
You'll find your badge to the left.

199
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,364
Oh.

200
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:17,436
Are you having trouble finding yourself?

201
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:18,408
No.

202
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,907
Yeah, I got it.

203
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:21,941
Okay,

204
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:23,814
Mr. Guevara.

205
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:25,714
Gracias.

206
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,514
De nada.

207
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:29,047
<i>Welcome to Oscorp.</i>

208
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:32,055
<i>Born in the mind
of our founder, Norman Osborn,</i>

209
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:35,890
<i>the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.</i>

210
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:40,758

the boundaries of defense, biomedical</i>

212
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:45,798
Welcome to Oscorp.

213
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:48,006
My name's Gwen Stacy.
I'm a senior at Midtown Science

214
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:50,576
and the most head
intern to Dr. Connors.

215
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,446
So I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

216
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:53,744
Where I go, you go.

217
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:56,612
That's the basic rule.
If you remember that,

218
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,252
- all will be fine.
- Come on!

219
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:58,785
- but if you forget that then—
- Listen!

220
00:15:58,943 --> 00:15:59,887
Look, listen.

221
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,394
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is down here.

222
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Please, just tell them
Rodrigo Guevara is down here!

223
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,422
My name's Rodrigo!

224
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:09,228
Well I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget that.

225
00:16:09,688 --> 00:16:10,459
Shall we?

226
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:19,602
Come around this way.

227
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:24,975
Good afternoon, Gwen.

228
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:26,116
Dr. Connors.

229
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,050
Welcome.

230
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,985
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

231
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,419
And yes, in case you're
wondering, I'm a southpaw.

232
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,821
- Hahaha.
- I'm not a cripple,

233
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:38,328
I'm a scientist, and I'm the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

234
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:41,263
That's reptiles, for those
of you who don't know.

235
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:42,902
But like the Parkinson's patient

236
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,766
who watches on
in horror as her body

237
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:49,342
slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration

238
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:53,345
whose eyes grow dimmer
each day, I long to fix myself.

239
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,350
I want to create
a world without weakness.

240
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:00,489
Anyone care to venture
a guess just how?

241
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,854
Yes.

242
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:02,990
Stem cells?

243
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,751
Promising. But the solution

244
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:07,726
I'm thinking of is more... radical.

245
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,524
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

246
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,005
Person gets Parkinson's

247
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,545
when the brain cells
that produce dopamine

248
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:25,716
start to disappear.

249
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,635
But, a zebra fish has the ability

250
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:29,948
to regenerate cells on command.

251
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:32,015
If you could somehow give this ability

252
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,058
to the woman you're talking
about, that's that. She's...

253
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:37,459
She's curing herself.

254
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:40,489
Yeah, you just have to look
past the gills on her neck.

255
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:45,264
A-and you are...?

256
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,307
He's one of Midtown Science's

257
00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:50,967
- best and brightest.
- Really?

258
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,134
Second in his class.

259
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:53,075
Oh.

260
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:55,077
- Second?
- Yeah.

261
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,078
Are you sure about that?

262
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:57,716
I'm pretty sure.

263
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:05,091
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you
in the more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

264
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:07,156
Nice meeting you all.

265
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,766
If you'd like to gather round.

266

<i>Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.</i>

267

<i>Our planet's tree of life is immense.</i>

268
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:19,232
<i>At Oscorp's</i>

269
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:21,105

270

<i>we endeavor to explore
exciting new methods...</i>

271
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,910
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

272
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,215
Oh, yeah.

273
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,617
What are you doing here?

274
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:33,950
I work here. I don't.

275
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,717
I was gonna say I work here,

276
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:39,091
but it seems like you in fact
work here. So you know that I don't.

277
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,128
You following me?

278
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,426
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

279
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,796
Why would you be here?

280
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,801
I just snuck in because...

281
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,405
I love science.

282
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,371
- You love Science.
- I'm passionate about it.

283
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,136
So you snuck in...?

284
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,472
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

285
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:57,583
So I'm gonna ask you more about
this later. Do not get me in trouble.

286
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,980
- I promise you, I won't.
- Stay with the group.

287
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:04,113
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

288
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,419
Sorry. Yo.

289
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:11,924
Sorry.

290
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:38,953
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

291
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:41,926
They were disappointing.

292
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:48,831
Sir, define "disappointing".

293
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:50,335
Another dead end.

294
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:52,166
It's the decay rate algorithm.

295
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,838
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

296
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,341
You said you were close.

297
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:58,674
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

298
00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:00,078
He doesn't have time.

299
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:02,549
Norman Osborn is dying, Dr. Connors.

300
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:04,315
Save him.

301
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:08,489
Or we'll both lose our heads.

302
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:28,347
All right, give me the badge.

303
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:31,880
Give it to me.

304
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:36,954
Sorry.

305
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,220
Aah! Aah, aah.

306
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:40,224
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

307
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:42,956
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

308
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:44,563
I didn't mean to...

309
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,461
I didn't... I didn't...

310
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,962
Get your hand off her!

311
00:23:49,158 --> 00:23:50,796
I'm trying to get my...

312
00:23:54,464 --> 00:23:55,408
Are you kidding?

313
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:56,373
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:57,739
Are you freaking kidding me?

315
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:00,042
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

316
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:04,479
Man, I'm sorry!

317
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:05,745
Man, are you all right?

318
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,215
- Take him down!
- Come on.

319
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,430
Get him, man! Get him!

320
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,462
No, man, no.
Not my board.

321
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,932
Please, dude, don't...

322
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:22,931
Sorry!

323
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:27,905
Sorry. Sorry.

324
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,341
I'm so sorry.

326

<i>Next and final stop, Coney Island.</i>

327
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,667
Ah... Hey.

328
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:53,170
Hey. Hey.

329
00:24:53,328 --> 00:24:54,534
Sorry. I'm late.

330
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:56,368
- I got...
- We've been so worried.

331
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:57,670
I know. I'm sorry.

332
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,177
Watch out!

333
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,449
That's a fly, Peter.

334
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:13,152
Yeah.

335
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:19,628
I'm so sorry

336
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:20,963
I kept you guys up.

337
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:24,470
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible

338
00:25:24,996 --> 00:25:26,408
and I'm hungry.

339
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,508
Meat loaf.

340
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,246
Drinking?

341
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:37,479
What's this?

342
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:39,021
I don't think so.

343
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,852
This is your meatloaf.

344
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:45,086
This beats all other meat loafs.

345
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:48,389
Something is very wrong.

346
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,062
Yeah.

347
00:25:50,224 --> 00:25:52,295
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

348
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,935
I got it.

349
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,816
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

350
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:07,816
I noticed that.

351
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:11,586
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meatloaf?

352
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:14,055
You could have said that
to me 37 years ago.

353
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:16,891
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

354
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,892
Aah!

Peter.

364
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:11,320
- Mm.
- What are you doing up there?

365
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:13,013
I'm, uh...

366
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:15,092
Homework.

367
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:16,785
Be careful.

368
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:18,555
Sure.

369
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:29,174
Dr. Connors.

370
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:31,243
Uh...

371
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,673
You don't remember me. I, uh...

372
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:34,108
You're the intern from the other day.

373
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:36,343
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

374
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,815
I'm sure you're a very nice
young man, but this is a home.

375
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:41,319
I ask you to make
an appointment with my office.

376
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:42,854
I'm Richard Parker's son.

377
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:51,325
Peter?

378
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:54,628
I'm afraid

379
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:58,104
I can't help you much, Peter.
I don't know why they left or where they

380
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,003
were going.

381
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,279
Good reflexes.

382
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,811
Thank you.

383
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,880
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

384
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,522
- Oh?
- Yeah.

385
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,851
It's something, you know.

386
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,823
So you really think

387
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,691
- it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course but

388
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:22,333
for years, your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

389
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,231
And not just in the community
at large but at Oscorp, as well.

390
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:27,531
They called us mad scientists.

391
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:31,042
And then your father bred the spiders

392
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,576
and everything changed.

393
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,406
The results were beyond encouraging.

394
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:36,548
They were spectacular.

395
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:41,679
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

396
00:30:41,844 --> 00:30:43,824
Including my own.

397
00:30:44,313 --> 00:30:45,883
Then it was over.

398
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:49,696
He... he was gone.

399
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:52,366
Took his research with him.

400
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:56,029
And I knew without him, I...

401
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:05,209
I...

402
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,943
I was angry.

403
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,289
So I stayed away from
you and your family.

404
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:17,393
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

405
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,396
Say...

406
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:29,131
Say it worked.

407
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:31,469
Say you got it to work.

408
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:35,936
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

409
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:38,976
What could the side effects be?

410
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,784
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

411
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:47,590
The problem was always...

412
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:49,194
The decay rate algorithm?

413
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:53,623
- Right.
- Right.

414
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:56,161
Can I, uh...?

415
00:31:56,325 --> 00:31:57,998
Of course.

416
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:21,861
Extraordinary.

417
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,330
How did you come up with this?

418
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:33,634
Peter, how would you feel
about coming to see me at the Tower

419
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,746
- one day after school?
- Yeah.

420
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:39,677
Thank you.

421
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:01,336
Number one, Reggie.

422
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:02,406
Run it, buddy.

423
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,134
Let's go, Reggie.

424
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:08,310
Rejected!

425
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,680
You did that on purpose, Flash!

426
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:14,914
No, but I should've.
You better watch your back.

427
00:33:18,882 --> 00:33:20,555
Hey.

428
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,397
All right?

429
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:30,935
Give it up, Parker.

430
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:37,539
Come on, man.

431
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:39,279
Oh...

432
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:40,439
One sec.

433
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,256
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

434
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,690
That's right, Flash. Take it, man.

435
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:53,458
Go ahead. Take it.

436
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:05,741
Oh!

437
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:15,285
Just take it.

438
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:19,854
All right, how about this?

439
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,651
All right?

440
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,761
How about that?

441
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,129
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

442
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,432
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

443
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:32,938
Yo, Flash, let's go.

444
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:34,599
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash!

445
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:36,506
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash, come on!

446
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,375
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

447
00:34:40,105 --> 00:34:40,913
What you doing, man?

448
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:46,013
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

449
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:01,199
Peter's behavior is just

450
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:02,168
unacceptable.

451
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:03,205
They're not gonna make us pay

452
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:06,206
- for the backboard, you know.
- I don't care about the backboard.

453
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,106
- Was that true?
- What?

454
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:10,044
What I heard in there just now.

455
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:13,185
Did you humiliate that boy?

456
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,213
Yeah, I did.

457
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,388
- But...
- But what?

458
00:35:17,545 --> 00:35:19,024
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

459
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,922
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

460
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:24,492
Is he?

461
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:26,496
Yeah, yeah, but...

462
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:28,726
So all this is about getting even.

463
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:32,729
If so, I guess you must feel pretty
good about yourself now, right?

464
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:33,930
Am I right or wrong?

465
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,502
Yeah, I thought so.

466
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:40,479
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours,

467
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,584
I had to change shifts at work

468
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,449
so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

469
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,388
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

470
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,253
Okay, good.

471
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:53,722
She looks familiar.

472
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,733
She's the girl on your computer.

473
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,562
Yeah.

474
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,706
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

475
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:05,103
Don't forget Aunt May.

476
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:10,609
Okay.

477
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,221
He's a character.

478
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:17,377
That's my uncle.

479
00:36:17,544 --> 00:36:19,581
He um, he's a pathological liar.

480
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,123
And he thought you were someone else.

481
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:23,785
Oh, man. You don't have
me on your computer?

482
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:27,091
Oh yeah I mean, like, I had—I took a photo of the
debate team, and you're in the debate team, so...

483
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:28,962
- Right.
- So...

484
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:31,501
He must have seen...
I was touching up stuff.

485
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:33,796
- You're touching up stuff?
- Come on.

486
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:36,635
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

487
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:41,247
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

488
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:43,611
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

489
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:49,785
Um, so you want to uh...
I don't know...?

490
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:51,220
Um...

491
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:52,155
Want to what?

492
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:54,057
I don't know.

493
00:36:54,218 --> 00:36:55,925
Just, uh...

494
00:36:57,922 --> 00:36:59,924
Um...

495
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:03,638
I don't know... we could—I
don't know... we could uh...

496
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:06,609
Or, we could do something
else, or we could...

497
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:09,245
- If you don't feel like, we could...
- Yeah.

498
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:10,937
-Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

499
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:14,078
- Really?
- Sure.

500
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,181
Okay.

501
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:17,685
All right, good. Sounds good.

502
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:18,822
Cool.

503
00:37:19,345 --> 00:37:20,847
Okay.

504
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,356
- I uh—You know I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

505
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:25,689
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too. Ugh.

506
00:37:28,055 --> 00:37:30,865
But, uh, maybe, uh...

507
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,197
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

508
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,034
- Time, all right.
- Ha-ha-ha. Okay.

509
00:37:35,196 --> 00:37:36,869
- Bye.
- All right.

Whoo!

537
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:07,535
We have protein structure,
rDNA, chromatography,

538
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:09,769
transgenics testing, that's X-ray video.

539
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,210
That's the only one on the planet.
We have, um...

540
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,150
- Human line testing over he—
- I remember that.

541
00:39:16,306 --> 00:39:17,979
I've seen that before.

542
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:19,450
The Ganali device.

543
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:22,319
Yeah, I remember a picture
of that in my dad's office.

544
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,983
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

545
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:28,630
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighborhood, even an entire city.

546
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:32,201
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

547
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:33,328
That's incredible.

548
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:37,770
Well, others disagreed. You know, what
if the device were loaded with a toxin?

549
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,933
What if you wanted to opt out?

550
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,513
You can't run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

551
00:39:44,404 --> 00:39:46,975
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

552
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,350
And many of these wonderful
creatures have so brilliantly adapted

553
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:53,014
that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

554
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:55,023
You can imagine my envy.

555
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:57,127
We're trying to harness this capability

556
00:39:57,285 --> 00:39:59,526
and transfer it into our host subject:

557
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,962
Freddy, the three-legged mouse.

558
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:04,334
Enter the algorithm now.

559
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,340
Do you need to take that?

- Preempt the immune response.

00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:04,395
our three-legged mice.

583

Here you go.

584
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:12,038
Hey, buddy. I got you.

585
00:41:13,736 --> 00:41:14,680
Okay.

586
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:16,908
Careful, don't want to
stick you by mistake.

587
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:18,949
Human trials aren't until next week.

588
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:22,753
There.

589
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:31,895
Oh, hey.

590
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:34,434
Hey, I thought you, uh...

591
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,538
Didn't you forget something?

592
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,068
What?

593
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:42,442
Now, don't answer that.
But I'm glad to know it's working.

594
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,416
You owe your aunt an apology. Bigtime!

595
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,418
Be a man.

596
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:52,283
Get in there and apologize.

597
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:57,261
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I, uh...

598
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,455
Honestly, you don't have
to apologize to me. It's your...

599
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,429
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

600
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:05,166
Look, I'm sorry, Uncle Ben.
I, uh, I got distracted—

601
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:07,270
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

602
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:11,168
Your aunt, my wife, had
to walk 12 blocks alone

603
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:14,178
in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station

604
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:15,608
because you got distracted.

605
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,443
Ben, sweetheart. Honestly,

606
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:19,643
I am completely capable of walking home—

607
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:21,845
You will not defend this boy!

608
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,318
- I'm not defending—
- You are defending him!

609
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:25,981
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

610
00:42:26,147 --> 00:42:27,684
You're a lot like your father.

611
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:30,363
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing,

612
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:33,659
but your father lived by
a philosophy, a principle, really.

613
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:37,169
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people,

614
00:42:37,327 --> 00:42:39,807
you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

615
00:42:39,963 --> 00:42:41,533
That's what's at stake here.

616
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:42,699
Not choice.

617
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:44,901
Responsibility.

618
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:49,541
That's nice. That's great.

619
00:42:50,475 --> 00:42:52,682
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

620
00:42:53,544 --> 00:42:55,785
- What?
- Where is he?

621
00:42:56,114 --> 00:42:57,890
Where's my dad?

622
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,554
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here and tell me this himself?

623
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,063
Oh, come on, how dare you?

624
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:04,963
How dare I? How dare you!

625
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:10,563
Where you going?

626
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,539
Peter, come back here, please.

627
00:43:22,076 --> 00:43:25,216
Ben, leave him alone for
a little while. He'll be all right.

628
00:43:38,226 --> 00:43:39,228
Peter!

629
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:43,468
Peter?

630
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:50,474
Peter!

631
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:56,524
It's $2.07.

632
00:43:59,983 --> 00:44:01,019
It's $2.07.

633
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,529
Yeah. No, I know.

634
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,531
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

635
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,000
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

636
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,368
- What?
- You can leave

637
00:44:10,419 --> 00:44:13,135
a penny anytime. You have to spend 10 dollars

638
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:15,245
to take a penny. Store policy.

639
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:17,813
- You gonna pay? You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

640
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:19,641
You can't afford your milk, just step aside.

641
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:22,082
What, daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

642
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,585
Just 2 cents. We're talking about 2 cents.

643
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,779
Just step aside, kid.

644
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:32,723
Really?

645
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,472
Yo, not cool, bro.

646
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:51,344
Hey, man, stop!

647
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,986
Somebody stop that guy!

648
00:44:53,143 --> 00:44:54,520
Hey kid, little help?

649
00:44:54,677 --> 00:44:56,088
Not my policy.

650
00:44:56,479 --> 00:44:57,685
Somebody stop that dude!

651
00:44:58,681 --> 00:44:59,352
Hey!

652
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:00,823
Hey, stop!

653
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:03,624
- Somebody stop that dude!
- Oh!

654
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:13,173
Hey!

655
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:45,575
Oh God, oh God.

656
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,303
Uncle Ben? Uncle Ben?

657
00:45:47,902 --> 00:45:49,540
Call an ambulance!

658
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:52,150
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

659
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,413
Oh, God! Oh my God.

660
00:45:58,113 --> 00:45:59,820
Oh God.

661
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:04,562
No...

662
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,703
Oh, Jesus.

663
00:46:12,629 --> 00:46:16,578
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

664
00:46:20,938 --> 00:46:22,781
No, I don't know him.

665
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:27,518
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives are on it.

666
00:46:27,678 --> 00:46:30,453
- We'll see what they turn up.
- Okay.

667
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:37,433
Can I... Can I have that?

668
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,967
Sure.

669
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:43,274
There's one other thing: he has a star

670
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:45,604
tattooed on his left hand.

671
00:47:13,095 --> 00:47:17,601
<i>Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately</i>

672
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,911
<i>and I'm sorry about that.</i>

673
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,711
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

674
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:40,497
Hey, Parker.

675
00:47:41,493 --> 00:47:43,632
- Not today, Flash.
- Come on, man. I just want to talk.

676
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,745
It feels better, right?

677
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:53,240
Look, your uncle died.

678
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:55,352
I'm sorry.

679
00:47:55,508 --> 00:47:56,987
I get it.

680
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:58,947
I'm sorry.

681
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:00,883
Okay?

682
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:08,462
Peter.

683
00:48:51,336 --> 00:48:53,112
- Get—
- Listen. Stay away from him.

684
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,283
- You understand me?
- Hey!

685
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,885
- Stay away from Joey, you understand me?
- Hey!

686
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,418
You like beating on girls?

687
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:01,122
You like beating on old men?

688
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:01,951
Hey, pal,

689
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:02,923
just keep on walking.

690
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:05,529
- You're in the wrong place, buddy.
- When was the last time you were in Queens?

691
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,359
I asked you a question, man.

692
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:08,431
Nicky, no!

693
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:09,293
That the gun?

694
00:49:09,456 --> 00:49:10,560
You gonna kill me too?

695
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,698
Hey! Stop it!

696
00:49:14,595 --> 00:49:15,539
Hey, get off!

697
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:17,939
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

698
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:19,339
Back up!

699
00:49:20,468 --> 00:49:22,106
This guy is crazy!

700
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:23,975
Get him!

701
00:49:28,477 --> 00:49:30,753
Get back here, man! Get him!

702
00:49:37,487 --> 00:49:38,363
Follow him!

703
00:49:42,058 --> 00:49:43,732
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

704
00:49:53,104 --> 00:49:53,878
Go, go, go!

705
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:56,413
There he is!

706
00:49:56,575 --> 00:49:57,417
You can't get away!

707
00:50:14,026 --> 00:50:15,904
<i>He has a star tattooed on his left hand.</i>

708
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:28,651
Oh, yeah?

709
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:29,811
Come on—

710
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:38,789
I know what you look like!

711
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,729
You hear me?

712
00:50:41,157 --> 00:50:43,535
I've seen your face!

713
00:51:21,267 --> 00:51:22,974
Is that all you got?

714
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:26,106
Just take it, take it.

715
00:51:31,478 --> 00:51:34,288
<i>Engineered from genetically
enhanced spiders,</i>

<i>of the lightweight cable.</i>

00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,245
Aah! Mother...

721
00:52:55,771 --> 00:53:00,447
<i>Attention, all units in the

<i>Last seen on foot heading

727
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:33,149
Hey.

728
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:42,923
You got a description?

729
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:44,329
Well, no, he... he wears a mask.

730
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:46,097
A mask?

731
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:47,927
Yeah and most of his victims are suspects.

732
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,864
Some of them with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

733
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,543
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

734
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:56,341
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

735
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:57,608
Please get me out of here!

736
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,383
Hey, look!

737
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,466
Spandex. Spandex.

738
00:54:14,257 --> 00:54:15,258
Everything.

739
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:16,301
Spandex.

740
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:18,798
Extraordinary velocity
vector is a function

741
00:54:18,962 --> 00:54:20,805
of both mass and acceleration.

742
00:54:20,964 --> 00:54:22,773
Oh, come on!
You know better than anyone

743
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:25,413
that the weight of the bob on any
pendulum has no effect on strength speed.

744
00:54:25,569 --> 00:54:29,312
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum!

745
00:55:05,712 --> 00:55:07,158
Hey, Aunt May.

746
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:09,658
Yeah. Eggs?

747
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:11,118
Organic, got it.

748
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:45,824
You know, in the future,
if you're gonna steal cars,

749
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,971
don't dress like a car thief, man.

750
00:55:48,126 --> 00:55:49,662
What are you? You a cop?

751
00:55:50,496 --> 00:55:54,740
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

752
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,402
You know, you're... You're... You're...

753
00:55:57,169 --> 00:55:58,581
You've got a mind

754
00:55:58,771 --> 00:56:00,216
of the true scholar, sir.

755
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:02,785
I was going more for
the guys who do the luge.

756
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:04,413
Good thinking, good thinking.

757
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:06,147
Get the window. Get out the window.

758
00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:09,055
There you go, you got it. Whoa.

759
00:56:16,023 --> 00:56:17,434
Crotch!

760
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:22,605
- Just let me go.
- That a knife? Is that a real knife?

761
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:23,935
Yes, it's a real knife.

762
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:25,601
My weakness, it's small knives.

763
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,370
- Just let me go.
- Anything but

764
00:56:27,536 --> 00:56:29,448
knives! Oh, it's so simple.

765
00:56:29,605 --> 00:56:31,084
- That was cool.
- What the hell is this?

766
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,846
Webbing that I developed myself.
I don't think you really want to know.

767
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:34,681
Come on, let me go!

768
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:38,286
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

769
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:39,187
Knock it off, man. No!

770
00:56:40,851 --> 00:56:43,127
Come on, let me go! Stop it!

771
00:56:44,221 --> 00:56:45,029
That isn't funny!

772
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:46,633
- It is kind of funny.
- No! Help!

773
00:56:46,857 --> 00:56:47,597
Shh.

774
00:56:57,535 --> 00:56:58,980
This could've gone a lot worse.

775
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:01,118
Now, hold still.

776
00:57:05,244 --> 00:57:06,052
Oh!

777
00:57:06,645 --> 00:57:07,988
Boys in blue here!

778
00:57:08,147 --> 00:57:10,650
- Yo, I got him!
- Freeze!

779
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:12,659
- He's not going anywhere.
- You in the tights, don't move!

780
00:57:12,852 --> 00:57:13,830
You serious?

781
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:15,159
Who are you?

782
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:17,296
No one seems to grasp
the concept of the mask.

783
00:57:17,457 --> 00:57:18,265
Freeze!

784
00:57:21,261 --> 00:57:22,866
I just did 80 percent of your job, huh?

785
00:57:23,397 --> 00:57:24,137
And that?

786
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:25,242
That's how you repay me?

787
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:30,007
Hold it right there!

788
00:57:49,492 --> 00:57:50,596
Woo-hoo!

789
00:57:50,793 --> 00:57:52,101
Oh well, that was fun!

790
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,168
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

791
00:57:59,136 --> 00:58:00,274
What are you doing?

792
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:04,685
Whoo!

793
00:58:04,843 --> 00:58:05,947
Hey, watch out!

794
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:07,215
I'm swinging here,

795
00:58:07,412 --> 00:58:08,914
I'm swinging here!

796
00:58:14,854 --> 00:58:19,064
Woo-hoo!

797
00:58:24,031 --> 00:58:26,807
So, 38 of New York's finest

798
00:58:26,967 --> 00:58:30,141
versus one guy in a unitard.

799
00:58:31,071 --> 00:58:32,243
Am I correct?

800
00:58:46,255 --> 00:58:47,825
You don't have to
wait up for me, you know.

801
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,264
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

802
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,436
Yes, I do.

803
00:58:50,592 --> 00:58:51,935
- Okay.
- Where were you?

804
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:53,164
I was out.

805
00:58:53,328 --> 00:58:55,275
Did you get the eggs?

806
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,335
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

807
00:58:58,501 --> 00:58:59,707
I'm gonna get them now.

808
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,439
No, you most certainly will not.

809
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,606
Not at this hour.

810
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,353
Look at me, Peter.

811
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,686
Take off the damn hood and look at me.

812
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:22,468
Peter... where do you go?

813
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:24,106
Who does this to you?

814
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:26,071
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

815
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:28,234
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please,

816
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:30,438
please, please go to sleep.

817
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,721
I can't sleep!

818
00:59:31,803 --> 00:59:33,641
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

819
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:47,656
Peter, listen to me.

820
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:49,595
Secrets have a cost.

821
00:59:49,758 --> 00:59:51,294
They're not for free.

822
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:53,666
Not now, not ever.

823
01:00:01,403 --> 01:00:03,349
Cross-species genetics is finally working.

824
01:00:03,672 --> 01:00:06,846
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

825
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:08,613
It's a miracle.

826
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:10,349
No, it's hard work and promise.

827
01:00:10,547 --> 01:00:14,461
- And it's a step closer to the primate lab.
- But he doesn't have time for every little step.

828
01:00:14,618 --> 01:00:15,528
Little?

829
01:00:15,685 --> 01:00:17,255
I just mean he can't wait.

830
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,094
Well, he'll have to.

831
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,163
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

832
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:23,202
That's not what I'm saying.

833
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:24,567
So, what are you saying?

834
01:00:25,196 --> 01:00:27,506
You have to start human trials.

835
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:28,974
Now.

836
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:31,307
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

837
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,450
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

838
01:00:34,706 --> 01:00:36,652
Even Norman Osborn.

839
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:37,810
We are not finished.

840
01:00:37,976 --> 01:00:39,547
Human trials?

841
01:00:39,712 --> 01:00:42,318
Where on Earth are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

842
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:45,053
What? As far as anyone's
concerned, it's for a winter flu shot.

843
01:00:45,218 --> 01:00:48,131
I might think the Veterans'
Hospital is a place to start.

844
01:00:48,288 --> 01:00:49,631
You've gotta be kidding me.

845
01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:51,828
I don't think I am.

846
01:00:58,299 --> 01:01:00,576
It's a little late for
shock and indignation, Curt.

847
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,873
About 15 years late.

848
01:01:02,103 --> 01:01:03,912
I have no idea what you're talking about.

849
01:01:04,105 --> 01:01:05,584
Richard Parker wore it well.

850
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,584
On you, it's a cheap suit, as it was then.

851
01:01:08,743 --> 01:01:10,222
I had nothing to do with that.

852
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:11,915
Is that what you told his son, Peter?

853
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,894
I don't know what you're saying.

854
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:21,627
You don't know, or you don't wanna know?

855
01:01:23,094 --> 01:01:25,435
I'll remind you what happened.

856
01:01:25,629 --> 01:01:29,076
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

857
01:01:31,436 --> 01:01:34,645
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

858
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,381
I, um...

859
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:46,655
I won't.

860
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:50,458
Fine.

861
01:01:55,061 --> 01:01:57,769
The formula is ours now anyway.

862
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:01,744
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

863
01:02:01,902 --> 01:02:03,439
I'm shutting you down.

864
01:02:03,604 --> 01:02:06,551
Have your office
cleared out by the morning.

865
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:10,211
Your toys could be
taken away too, you know.

866
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:13,418
Right, Freddy?

867
01:02:28,631 --> 01:02:29,666
- Hey.
- Hi.

868
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:30,640
How's it going?

869
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,637
Where you headed?

870
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,574
- Uh... Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

871
01:02:36,073 --> 01:02:37,677
- It's Thursday?
- What happened to your eye?

872
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:39,514
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

873
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:40,950
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

874
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:42,749
Maybe I got a rash or...

875
01:02:42,913 --> 01:02:44,689
It's pretty bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

876
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:46,487
Mm-hm.

877
01:02:46,952 --> 01:02:48,659
Do you like branzino?

878
01:02:49,721 --> 01:02:51,029
Like, a fish.

879
01:02:51,222 --> 01:02:53,031
Mm-hm. No, no. I know, I know.

880
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,432
Well, if you want,

881
01:02:55,594 --> 01:03:00,100
you can come to this
address at 8:00 tonight.

882
01:03:00,866 --> 01:03:02,539
My mom's making branzino.

883
01:03:03,035 --> 01:03:04,480
So...

884
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,513
Oh, it's apartment 2016.

885
01:03:06,538 --> 01:03:08,016
I didn't... I didn't write that part down.

886
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:08,918
I don't know why.

887
01:03:09,676 --> 01:03:11,519
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

888
01:03:11,678 --> 01:03:12,713
2016.

889
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:22,324
Hi.

890
01:04:23,824 --> 01:04:25,064
How did you get out there?

891
01:04:25,926 --> 01:04:27,462
The fire escape.

892
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,132
Your doorman's intimidating.

893
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,704
It's 20 stories.

894
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:34,479
Yeah. It's all right.

895
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,643
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

896
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,481
Books.

897
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:44,156
Shoes.

898
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:46,285
Oh, hey, uh...

899
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:48,726
I got your mom, um,

900
01:04:48,884 --> 01:04:50,262
these.

901
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:51,488
Oh, lovely.

902
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:53,328
- Yeah, beautiful, right?
- They're beautiful.

903
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,901
They were nice.

904
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,833
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

905
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:59,770
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

906
01:04:59,931 --> 01:05:01,467
I'm gonna keep these.

907
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:03,678
You have your suit in there?

908
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,410
My suit?

909
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:10,952
It's for dinner. Are you gonna...?

910
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,248
Are you gonna wear that?

911
01:05:12,411 --> 01:05:13,412
- That's, um...
- Hey, hon.

912
01:05:19,017 --> 01:05:19,961
You must be Peter.

913
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:21,963
Dad, this is Peter.

914
01:05:24,624 --> 01:05:25,830
Hey, nice to meet you, sir.

915
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:28,164
Nice to meet you.

916
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:29,932
Dinner's ready.

917
01:05:30,698 --> 01:05:32,041
Hope you like branzino.

918
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:33,769
Who doesn't?

919
01:06:33,266 --> 01:06:34,609
<i>Emma, it's Curt.</i>

920
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:37,575
<i>- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.</i>

921
01:06:37,737 --> 01:06:40,581
<i>The car is taking him to
the Veterans' Hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

922
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,946
No, no, no, no. He can't, Emma.

923
01:06:42,108 --> 01:06:44,419
You have to stop him. He...

924
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:46,388
<i>I would, but I always lose
him when he's on the bridge.</i>

925
01:06:47,548 --> 01:06:50,119
<i>I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.</i>

926
01:07:00,128 --> 01:07:03,473
I'm going to Holton Avenue
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

927
01:07:03,632 --> 01:07:05,704
Okay, you want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

928
01:07:05,868 --> 01:07:07,108
Bridge! Take the bridge.

929
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,613
All right, we gon' do that.

930
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:10,710
Hey man, you all right back there?

931
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,748
Are you tweaking, man?

932
01:07:14,878 --> 01:07:16,516
Just drive.

933
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:18,287
Okay.

934
01:07:24,555 --> 01:07:26,058
You're having trouble there?

935
01:07:26,224 --> 01:07:27,497
Actually, the head goes on the other—

936
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,595
Simon, help Gwen's friend with his fish.

937
01:07:29,761 --> 01:07:30,967
Oh, I...

938
01:07:31,129 --> 01:07:32,233
I have no idea.

939
01:07:32,397 --> 01:07:33,933
First time.

940
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:35,670
- Branzino.
- George,

941
01:07:35,835 --> 01:07:38,611
- why don't you tell us about your day?
- Oh yeah, Dad, did you catch that spider guy yet?

942
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:40,341
No, we didn't catch him yet.

943
01:07:40,539 --> 01:07:42,416
But we will. He's an amateur

944
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:45,283
who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

945
01:07:45,444 --> 01:07:47,322
He's clumsy, he leaves clues, but

946
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:48,858
he's still dangerous.

947
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,195
He's assaulting people?

948
01:07:53,053 --> 01:07:54,031
I'm not sure.

949
01:07:54,187 --> 01:07:55,666
I mean, I saw that video

950
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,803
with him and the car thief, and...

951
01:07:57,959 --> 01:08:01,099
I think most people
would say that he was

952
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:03,206
providing a public service.

953
01:08:03,931 --> 01:08:05,877
Most people would be wrong.

954
01:08:07,169 --> 01:08:10,639
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

955
01:08:10,806 --> 01:08:12,080
So why wasn't he then?

956
01:08:16,078 --> 01:08:17,113
Let me illuminate you.

957
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,886
See, the car thief was leading
us to the people who run

958
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,290
the entire operation.
It's been a six-month-long sting.

959
01:08:22,452 --> 01:08:25,456
It's called "strategy".
I'm sure you're aware of the term "strategy"?

960
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,826
- You've probably heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

961
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:28,668
Good.

962
01:08:29,327 --> 01:08:30,067
I know.

963
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,702
Well, obviously he didn't
know you had a plan.

964
01:08:32,997 --> 01:08:35,338
You seem to know an awful lot about this case.
You know something that we don't know?

965
01:08:35,499 --> 01:08:37,809
- I mean, whose side are you on here?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

966
01:08:37,968 --> 01:08:39,916
- I saw a video on the Internet...
- Oh.

967
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:41,400
You saw a video on the Internet.

968
01:08:41,406 --> 01:08:43,113
Well, then the case is closed.

969
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,652
Well, no. I'm just saying
if you watch the video,

970
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:46,189
maybe send you a link?

971
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:48,018
- It looks like...
- It looks like he's really trying to help.

972
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:51,060
Yeah sure, on the Internet he's being made out
to look like some kind of masked hero or something.

973
01:08:51,217 --> 01:08:51,888
No, no.

974
01:08:52,051 --> 01:08:53,758
I'm not saying he's a hero.
I don't think he's a hero at all.

975
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,264
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm saying he's trying to help and it looks like

976
01:08:56,422 --> 01:08:57,765
he's trying to do something
maybe the police can't.

977
01:08:57,924 --> 01:08:59,336
Something the police can't?

978
01:08:59,493 --> 01:09:01,029
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do all day?

979
01:09:01,195 --> 01:09:02,731
You think we just sit around, eating doughnuts

980
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:04,705
with our thumbs planted firmly up our asses?

981
01:09:04,865 --> 01:09:06,902
- Daddy.
- George. George.

982
01:09:07,134 --> 01:09:07,839
- Up your what dad?
- Howard.

983
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:09,845
I think he stands for what you stand for, sir.

984
01:09:10,004 --> 01:09:11,540
Protecting innocent people from bad guys.

985
01:09:11,706 --> 01:09:13,777
I stand for law and order, son.
That's what I stand for.

986
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:15,546
Okay? I wear a badge.

987
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,748
This guy wears a mask like
uh you know, like a, like an outlaw.

988
01:09:18,913 --> 01:09:21,451
He's hunting down a bunch of criminals
that all look the same,

989
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:23,789
like he's got some sorta personal vendetta.

990
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:26,957
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

991
01:09:27,156 --> 01:09:28,965
Let's get some air, Peter.

992
01:09:29,592 --> 01:09:31,766
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

993
01:09:34,164 --> 01:09:36,973
Thank you for having me.
I'm sorry if I insulted you.

994
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:38,407
It was not my intention.

995
01:09:38,602 --> 01:09:41,914
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

996
01:09:42,073 --> 01:09:44,178
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

997
01:09:45,877 --> 01:09:48,414
- Dad.
- Yeah?

998
01:09:55,187 --> 01:09:57,098
Well, that was something.

999
01:09:58,557 --> 01:10:01,630
I'm sorry. You know, I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

1000
01:10:01,795 --> 01:10:04,435
Nah, I wouldn't have let him arrest you.

1001
01:10:09,202 --> 01:10:11,113
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

1002
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:12,074
Oh.

1003
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:15,014
Okay.

1004
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:21,455
I've been bitten...

1005
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:26,664
So have I.

1006
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:33,539
Okay.

1007
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:37,534
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

1008
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,476
I gotta tell you this
one thing, and it's about

1009
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,496
- the vigilante and the car thief, alright?
- Oh, okay.

1010
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,328
What?

1011
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:46,732
No, no, no. I don't want to talk about that.

1012
01:10:46,893 --> 01:10:48,566
Okay no, forget that.
I'm not gonna talk about that.

1013
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:51,002
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

1014
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:55,010
It's impo—I wish I could just...

1015
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,408
I can't. It's hard to say.

1016
01:10:56,569 --> 01:10:57,570
Just say it.

1017
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,875
- No.
- Say it.

1018
01:11:02,709 --> 01:11:04,017
What? What?

1019
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,187
What?

1020
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:15,096
Okay, then forget it.

1021
01:11:23,229 --> 01:11:24,708
You...?

1022
01:11:25,064 --> 01:11:26,566
Shh, shh.

1023
01:11:33,339 --> 01:11:35,444
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

1024
01:11:40,446 --> 01:11:41,948
Gwen?

1025
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:45,423
Gwen... Uh...

1026
01:11:45,585 --> 01:11:47,531
Your father wants you
to come inside, right away.

1027
01:11:47,921 --> 01:11:49,127
Okay.

1028
01:11:49,322 --> 01:11:50,323
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1029
01:11:53,092 --> 01:11:54,127
Gwen.

1030
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:55,965
I'm coming.

1031
01:12:27,293 --> 01:12:29,261
Oh, I'm in trouble.

1032
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:55,698
Will you please go and find out
what is going on, Alfred?

1033
01:13:01,662 --> 01:13:03,005
Oh...

1034
01:13:03,163 --> 01:13:04,005
Excellent.

1035
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:08,312
Hey!

1036
01:13:11,438 --> 01:13:12,439
Hey! What is that?

1037
01:13:12,606 --> 01:13:14,483
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

1038
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:16,053
Get back in the car!

1039
01:13:21,148 --> 01:13:22,525
Help!

1040
01:13:24,218 --> 01:13:25,128
Help!

1041
01:14:05,225 --> 01:14:07,398
Incoming!

1042
01:14:28,415 --> 01:14:29,120
Somebody help!

1043
01:14:29,983 --> 01:14:31,621
Help me! My kid is trapped!

1044
01:14:41,395 --> 01:14:42,567
I want my dad!

1045
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:43,931
Dad!

1046
01:14:44,098 --> 01:14:45,475
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Help!

1047
01:14:45,632 --> 01:14:46,303
Hey, buddy.

1048
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,638
- It's okay. It's alright.
- Get away.

1049
01:14:48,602 --> 01:14:49,740
- Help!
- Hey, look.

1050
01:14:51,271 --> 01:14:53,148
Just a normal guy, all right?

1051
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:55,751
Wanna hold onto this?

1052
01:14:57,444 --> 01:14:58,252
Hold my mask.

1053
01:14:58,879 --> 01:14:59,789
All right.

1054
01:15:01,315 --> 01:15:02,794
What's your name?

1055
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:03,758
Jack?

1056
01:15:04,651 --> 01:15:06,324
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

1057
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:09,462
Okay, stay very still.

1058
01:15:09,623 --> 01:15:10,465
All right.

1059
01:15:10,624 --> 01:15:11,898
Okay, I got you.

1060
01:15:16,296 --> 01:15:16,967
Okay now, look.

1061
01:15:17,131 --> 01:15:19,869
I'm gonna undo the belt. You're gonna
hold on to that seat in front of you.

1062
01:15:19,872 --> 01:15:20,969
Okay, on three?

1063
01:15:21,235 --> 01:15:23,909
- All right.
- Okay. One, two, three.

1064
01:15:25,073 --> 01:15:28,178
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1065
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:30,083
All right, okay.

1066
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:45,033
Jack, climb. Now.

1067
01:15:45,192 --> 01:15:46,830
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1068
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:54,201
Put it on, the mask.

1069
01:15:54,368 --> 01:15:55,813
It's gonna make you strong.

1070
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:57,713
Jack, trust me.

1071
01:15:57,871 --> 01:15:58,849
Put it on.

1072
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,530
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy. That's it.

1073
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:03,546
Okay, now. Climb.

1074
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:04,711
Come on, Jack.

1075
01:16:08,482 --> 01:16:09,153
Do me a favor.

1076
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:10,818
A little faster, okay, bud?

1077
01:16:11,084 --> 01:16:13,394
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1078
01:16:13,587 --> 01:16:14,658
That's it. Keep coming.

1079
01:16:14,823 --> 01:16:16,234
Keep it coming.

1080
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:17,461
Keep coming.

1081
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:19,702
No!

1082
01:16:34,342 --> 01:16:36,049
Jack. Oh, God.

1083
01:16:36,211 --> 01:16:37,713
Thank God.

1084
01:16:39,414 --> 01:16:40,757
You okay?

1085
01:16:43,818 --> 01:16:45,263
My son. My son.

1086
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,224
Oh, my son.

1087
01:16:47,388 --> 01:16:49,163
My son.

1088
01:16:53,661 --> 01:16:54,696
Who are you?

1089
01:16:57,131 --> 01:16:58,610
Spider-Man.

1090
01:17:45,713 --> 01:17:47,693
Beautiful.

1091
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,891
Settle down, guys.

1092
01:17:57,892 --> 01:17:59,496
Settle down, boys.
Settle down.

1093
01:17:59,694 --> 01:18:01,002
- Come on.
- Listen.

1094
01:18:01,996 --> 01:18:05,466
At approximately 9 p.m. last night, an incident
took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1095
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,599
<i>Much of what occurred is
merely speculation at this point.</i>

1096
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:10,812
<i>However, several eyewitnesses</i>

1097
01:18:10,972 --> 01:18:13,099
<i>to the crime, as well as our
own preliminary findings</i>

1098
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:17,516
<i>have positively placed
one individual at the scene.</i>

1099
01:18:17,712 --> 01:18:19,157
<i>Which is why this morning,</i>

1100
01:18:19,314 --> 01:18:20,759
<i>I am issuing an arrest warrant</i>

1101
01:18:20,915 --> 01:18:24,260
<i>for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.</i>

1102
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:33,867
<i>And lastly, city council members
met with homeowners and airport officials</i>

1103
01:18:34,028 --> 01:18:35,829
<i>in the first of four meetings...</i>

1104
01:18:42,564 --> 01:18:44,381
It's so beautiful.

1105
01:18:44,539 --> 01:18:46,382
Knows how to bite though.

1106
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:48,316
Who else knows about this?

1107
01:18:48,476 --> 01:18:49,352
Just you.

1108
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:50,784
Really?

1109
01:18:53,247 --> 01:18:55,158
Hey, you don't...

1110
01:18:55,883 --> 01:18:58,489
You don't believe what
the police are saying, do you?

1111
01:18:59,354 --> 01:19:00,856
Of course not.

1112
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,233
Does it scare you?

1113
01:19:04,392 --> 01:19:06,269
What you can do?

1114
01:19:08,763 --> 01:19:10,071
No.

1115
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,303
No.

1116
01:19:13,301 --> 01:19:15,372
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1117
01:19:15,903 --> 01:19:18,383
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1118
01:19:18,773 --> 01:19:20,309
You gotta lay low.

1119
01:19:21,075 --> 01:19:22,486
No, can't do that.

1120
01:19:22,677 --> 01:19:24,213
You've got to.

1121
01:19:25,046 --> 01:19:26,548
I mean, why...?

1122
01:19:26,881 --> 01:19:29,361
Because of last night.

1123
01:19:29,517 --> 01:19:31,519
Those people on the bridge.

1124
01:19:31,686 --> 01:19:35,691
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1125
01:19:37,358 --> 01:19:38,029
So I...

1126
01:19:38,192 --> 01:19:39,865
I gotta go after it.

1127
01:19:41,362 --> 01:19:42,397
That's not your job.

1128
01:19:43,831 --> 01:19:45,401
Maybe it is.

1129
01:19:50,038 --> 01:19:51,881
I really liked kissing you.

1130
01:19:54,509 --> 01:19:56,011
You're an amazing kisser.

1131
01:19:58,814 --> 01:19:59,952
Well, you know, it was...

1132
01:20:00,115 --> 01:20:02,117
It was good for me too.

1133
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:06,424
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1134
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:15,335
Yo!

1135
01:20:15,864 --> 01:20:16,968
Who did that?

1136
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,721
Hello!

1137
01:20:49,364 --> 01:20:51,571
It's not nice to snoop.

1138
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:56,381
I gave everyone the week off.

1139
01:20:58,607 --> 01:20:59,278
Yeah.

1140
01:21:00,509 --> 01:21:01,886
Shouldn't you be at school?

1141
01:21:03,612 --> 01:21:05,649
No, I got a free track.

1142
01:21:05,814 --> 01:21:07,816
I wanted to ask you a question.

1143
01:21:08,517 --> 01:21:11,025
How would a predator track a reptile?

1144
01:21:11,186 --> 01:21:15,413
Oh, they don't. Most reptiles are at
the top of their respective food chain.

1145
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:17,126
Kings of their domain.

1146
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:18,794
They gotta have vulnerabilities, right?

1147
01:21:18,961 --> 01:21:21,532
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1148
01:21:25,033 --> 01:21:26,341
Just asking a question.

1149
01:21:26,502 --> 01:21:29,346
I got school stuff.

1150
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:31,507
Biology profiles to do.

1151
01:21:31,707 --> 01:21:34,187
- Mm.
- So because of the cold blood,

1152
01:21:34,343 --> 01:21:36,289
would they react to
sudden changes in temperatures?

1153
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:37,822
Oh, you'd have to catch one first.

1154
01:21:38,714 --> 01:21:42,025
Did you know there's a rumor
of a new species in New York?

1155
01:21:42,184 --> 01:21:43,686
Beautiful and quite large.

1156
01:21:44,853 --> 01:21:46,833
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1157
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:48,991
No, it's not yet classified.

1158
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,962
But it can be aggressive...

1159
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:55,806
if threatened.

1160
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:04,813
Doc, you all right?

1161
01:22:04,973 --> 01:22:07,579
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1162
01:22:07,743 --> 01:22:09,313
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1163
01:22:09,478 --> 01:22:12,220
I'm afraid I have to ask you
to leave. I have a new project

1164
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:14,827
I'm working on. I need to be alone.

1165
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,726
Good. Good, good.

1166
01:22:18,253 --> 01:22:20,096
Good.

1167
01:22:20,689 --> 01:22:23,602
Don't worry, Mr. Parker. I'll be back.

1168
01:22:24,593 --> 01:22:26,732
Wonderful things are coming.

1169
01:22:27,996 --> 01:22:29,771
Wonderful things.

1170
01:22:44,346 --> 01:22:45,620
Fred?

1171
01:22:50,419 --> 01:22:52,626
Mr. Mayor, I can assure you,
if there was a giant dinosaur

1172
01:22:52,788 --> 01:22:55,291
running around the streets in Manhattan,
you would be the first to know.

1173
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:58,027
So tell your son he
can rest easy, all right?

1174
01:22:58,193 --> 01:23:00,230
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1175
01:23:00,395 --> 01:23:02,602
Okay. Bye-bye.

1176
01:23:02,764 --> 01:23:04,641
Mr. Parker, why are you

1177
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,643
- not in school?
- Got a free track.

1178
01:23:06,802 --> 01:23:09,477
Okay well, I do not have a free track,
so make your point quickly.

1179
01:23:09,638 --> 01:23:12,050
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around in Manhattan,

1180
01:23:12,207 --> 01:23:14,483
but there is something more
dangerous, and I know who it is.

1181
01:23:14,643 --> 01:23:16,247
- You know who it is?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

1182
01:23:16,411 --> 01:23:17,788
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

1183
01:23:17,946 --> 01:23:19,448
- That's right.
- Okay. Dr. Connors,

1184
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:21,617
who's also my daughter's mentor.
Is that who you're talking about?

1185
01:23:21,783 --> 01:23:22,989
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1186
01:23:23,151 --> 01:23:26,462
You know, recently, Dr. Connors gave
Gwen a glowing college recommendation.

1187
01:23:26,622 --> 01:23:28,659
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1188
01:23:28,824 --> 01:23:30,997
But you would have me believe that he,

1189
01:23:31,159 --> 01:23:33,400
in his spare time, is running around
dressed up like a giant dinosaur?

1190
01:23:33,562 --> 01:23:37,237
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a giant lizard.

1191
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:42,006
Let me ask you a question.

1192
01:23:42,171 --> 01:23:45,311
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1193
01:23:45,475 --> 01:23:47,955
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1194
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:51,149
This man has worked for his whole
life on cross-species genetics.

1195
01:23:51,314 --> 01:23:54,852
He lost one arm, he's been trying to grow it back,
but there was something imbalanced about the equation.

1196
01:23:55,051 --> 01:23:57,497
And he has turned into a full lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1197
01:23:57,654 --> 01:24:01,363
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1198
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:04,003
Okay. All right, I get it.

1199
01:24:04,861 --> 01:24:05,931
Here's what we're gonna do.

1200
01:24:06,429 --> 01:24:09,171
You're gonna go back to meeting up
with the citizens of Tokyo,

1201
01:24:09,332 --> 01:24:11,107
and I'm gonna go back to

1202
01:24:11,267 --> 01:24:13,770
protecting the citizens
of this fine, fair city of ours.

1203
01:24:13,936 --> 01:24:16,177
Sergeant Butler, would you please
please escort Mr. Parker

1204
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:17,784
- back to school.
- Captain Stacy,

1205
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,317
I'm not messing around.

1206
01:24:19,475 --> 01:24:22,513
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1207
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:24,317
He is a danger to everybody.

1208
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,721
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1209
01:24:31,087 --> 01:24:32,828
- Jimmy.
- Mm?

1210
01:24:33,623 --> 01:24:36,502
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1211
01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:39,194
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1212
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,566
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1213
01:25:06,723 --> 01:25:08,259
Current temperature: 89.7.

1214
01:25:08,424 --> 01:25:09,903
Steady for 48 hours.

1215
01:25:10,059 --> 01:25:14,402
Blood panels reveal lymphocyte and monocyte
readings consistent with subject's past.

1216
01:25:20,169 --> 01:25:21,842
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1217
01:25:22,004 --> 01:25:25,016
Marked enhancement in muscle response,

1218
01:25:25,174 --> 01:25:26,551
strength and elasticity.

1219
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:36,455
Eyesight similarly improved.

1220
01:25:36,652 --> 01:25:39,155
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1221
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,406
This is no longer about curing ills.

1222
01:25:46,929 --> 01:25:49,568
This is about finding perfection.

1223
01:25:58,808 --> 01:26:00,913
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse,

1224
01:26:01,077 --> 01:26:04,820
dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1225
01:27:39,643 --> 01:27:41,384
You stopped me once.

1226
01:27:42,279 --> 01:27:44,589
You won't stop me again.

1227
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:49,587
I'm getting stronger every day!

1228
01:28:28,358 --> 01:28:29,894
Oh, that sucked.

1229
01:28:41,338 --> 01:28:42,976
Peter Parker.

1230
01:29:00,657 --> 01:29:02,227
Come in.

1231
01:29:04,661 --> 01:29:06,004
You should maybe, uh,

1232
01:29:06,163 --> 01:29:08,006
consider coming in
through the lobby.

1233
01:29:09,633 --> 01:29:12,671
Also, my father is under the impression

1234
01:29:12,869 --> 01:29:15,679
- that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1235
01:29:15,939 --> 01:29:17,509
Peter.

1236
01:29:18,075 --> 01:29:19,076
What happened?

1237
01:29:19,242 --> 01:29:20,585
You should see the other guy.

1238
01:29:22,412 --> 01:29:26,827
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1239
01:29:26,984 --> 01:29:27,985
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1240
01:29:28,151 --> 01:29:29,095
Do you want cocoa?

1241
01:29:29,252 --> 01:29:30,356
Howard's making some cocoa.

1242
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,124
Shh.

1243
01:29:34,558 --> 01:29:36,369
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1244
01:29:36,526 --> 01:29:38,199
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1245
01:29:38,395 --> 01:29:39,203
Okay.

1246
01:29:39,396 --> 01:29:43,405
I just thought I remembered somebody saying last week
that her fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1247
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:45,045
Well, that's impractical.

1248
01:29:45,202 --> 01:29:46,647
And fattening.

1249
01:29:49,906 --> 01:29:50,976
Chocolate house.

1250
01:29:53,844 --> 01:29:55,653
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1251
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:58,622
I just—I can't um... have cocoa
right now because I'm working—

1252
01:29:58,782 --> 01:30:01,854
I'm doing this, um...

1253
01:30:02,019 --> 01:30:03,657
I have uh... I have cramps.

1254
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:06,558
- Oh.
- I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1255
01:30:06,723 --> 01:30:09,033
- I don't know, like, emotional. Like I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1256
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:10,933
It's brutal.

1257
01:30:11,795 --> 01:30:13,138
You don't want to know. Trust me.

1258
01:30:13,146 --> 01:30:14,468
- It's like, bad.
- Got it.

1259
01:30:14,631 --> 01:30:16,577
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1260
01:30:41,692 --> 01:30:44,104
Easy, bug boy.

1261
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,272
What'd you call me?

1262
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:53,211
I'm going to be all right.

1263
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:56,078
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1264
01:30:57,474 --> 01:30:59,954
I know what this is.

1265
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:01,487
What is it?

1266
01:31:02,412 --> 01:31:05,553
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father

1267
01:31:05,717 --> 01:31:10,025
has left every morning and
he's put a badge on his chest

1268
01:31:10,188 --> 01:31:12,498
and strapped a gun to his hip.

1269
01:31:15,126 --> 01:31:17,538
And every day,
for as long as I can remember,

1270
01:31:17,695 --> 01:31:20,141
I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1271
01:31:29,707 --> 01:31:31,550
I got you.

1272
01:31:32,777 --> 01:31:33,949
Okay?

1273
01:31:36,647 --> 01:31:37,648
Okay?

1274
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,321
I gotta stop him, though.

1275
01:31:42,019 --> 01:31:44,932
I have to, because I created him.

1276
01:31:48,226 --> 01:31:49,671
What do you mean?

1277
01:31:51,095 --> 01:31:53,166
I gave him an equation....

1278
01:31:55,733 --> 01:31:57,838
that made all of this possible.

1279
01:32:05,476 --> 01:32:08,355
Something my father had
been working on, you know.

1280
01:32:08,546 --> 01:32:11,550
Secretly. Now I realize
why he kept it a secret.

1281
01:32:14,318 --> 01:32:16,798
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1282
01:32:20,124 --> 01:32:22,297
I have to fix it.

1283
01:32:25,363 --> 01:32:27,070
Peter.

1284
01:32:28,099 --> 01:32:29,806
Hey.

1285
01:32:33,104 --> 01:32:35,209
Let's get out of here.

1286
01:32:35,373 --> 01:32:37,182
Let's just get out of here.

1287
01:32:37,341 --> 01:32:39,082
Just for a minute. Can we?

1288
01:32:39,777 --> 01:32:41,723
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1289
01:32:41,879 --> 01:32:43,051
- Yes.
- No.

1290
01:32:43,214 --> 01:32:44,386
Yes.

1291
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:47,085
If my parents see me leaving, I'm dead.

1292
01:32:51,656 --> 01:32:53,727
Your parents aren't gonna see you leaving.

1293
01:33:07,104 --> 01:33:08,708
<i>Peter Parker.</i>

1294
01:33:08,873 --> 01:33:10,546

01:33:10,908 --> 01:33:14,152
<i>I'm not the one who needs help!</i>

1296
01:33:14,345 --> 01:33:16,018
<i>There will be no more loneliness,</i>

1297
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,659
<i>no more outcasts.</i>

1298
01:33:17,815 --> 01:33:21,558
<i>Species-wide distribution could enhance</i>

1299
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:24,131
<i>humanity on an evolutionary scale.</i>

1300
01:33:24,555 --> 01:33:26,899
<i>One has to adapt to survive.</i>

1301
01:33:30,228 --> 01:33:33,004
"That, changing like
the snake, I might be free

1302
01:33:33,164 --> 01:33:36,771
to cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined."

1303
01:33:36,934 --> 01:33:41,249
<i>Would you give it all up after
all you know you could do?</i>

1304
01:33:41,405 --> 01:33:44,045
<i>All the power you feel.</i>

1305
01:33:47,545 --> 01:33:49,890
<i>I can save them!</i>

1306
01:33:56,027 --> 01:34:00,728
<i>You're not gonna get in the way
of my plan, Peter Parker!</i>

1307
01:34:27,118 --> 01:34:28,392
Go. Go!

1308
01:35:04,756 --> 01:35:06,758
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1309
01:35:24,309 --> 01:35:26,717
All these souls, lost and alone.

1310
01:35:26,878 --> 01:35:27,788
I can save them.

1311
01:35:27,946 --> 01:35:29,550
I can cure them.

1312
01:35:29,748 --> 01:35:32,393
There's no need to stop me, Peter.

1313
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:44,031
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1314
01:35:47,766 --> 01:35:49,370
Stop this. This isn't you!

1315
01:35:54,539 --> 01:35:55,517
Let's talk this out.

1316
01:35:56,641 --> 01:35:57,381
Doc!

1317
01:36:03,482 --> 01:36:04,517
Oh, boy.

1318
01:36:09,888 --> 01:36:10,998
Alright, so you don't want to talk?

1319
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:13,526
There you go.

1320
01:36:16,895 --> 01:36:17,566
Don't...

1321
01:36:19,164 --> 01:36:20,734
make me...

1322
01:36:20,899 --> 01:36:21,900
have to...

1323
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:23,379
hurt you!

1324
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:32,586
That's disgusting.

1325
01:36:42,621 --> 01:36:44,032
Gwen.

1326
01:37:07,946 --> 01:37:10,153
- I'm gonna throw you out the window now.
- What?

1327
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,234
Uh-oh.

1328
01:37:23,395 --> 01:37:26,269
Somebody's been a bad lizard.

1329
01:38:13,145 --> 01:38:15,216
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City

1330
01:38:15,413 --> 01:38:18,860
Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1331
01:38:28,026 --> 01:38:30,028
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1332
01:38:41,674 --> 01:38:42,982
- Hey.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

1333
01:38:43,142 --> 01:38:44,052
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1334
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:47,589
I'm down in the sewer, I'm tracking him.
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1335
01:38:47,597 --> 01:38:48,885
But we need an antidote.

1336
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:51,654
- Do you know how to run a serum?
<i>- Yeah, I do it for Connors all the time.</i>

1337
01:38:51,667 --> 01:38:54,229
Okay, great, great, great, great.
Okay. Listen, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1338
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:57,391
<i>I need you to access the
cross-species file. It's a blue serum.</i>

1339
01:38:57,557 --> 01:38:59,696
File 12389.

1340
01:38:59,859 --> 01:39:00,929
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

1341
01:39:01,093 --> 01:39:02,868
On my way.

1342
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:37,967
<i>I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness,</i>

1343
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:40,303
<i>without outcasts.</i>

1344
01:39:40,499 --> 01:39:43,036
<i>I sought to create
a stronger human being,</i>

1345
01:39:43,202 --> 01:39:45,113
<i>but there's no such thing.</i>

1346
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:50,381
<i>Human beings are weak, pathetic,
feeble-minded creatures.</i>

1347
01:39:50,543 --> 01:39:54,421
<i>Why be human at all
when we can be so much more?</i>

1348
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,890
<i>Faster. Stronger.</i>

1349
01:39:57,049 --> 01:39:58,460
<i>Smarter.</i>

1350
01:39:58,618 --> 01:40:01,462
<i>This is my gift to you.</i>

1351
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:11,635
Oscorp.

1352
01:40:13,899 --> 01:40:15,003
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1353
01:40:15,167 --> 01:40:17,647
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed

1354
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:20,010
- toward Canal Street Station.
- What about Spider-Man?

1355
01:40:20,172 --> 01:40:21,412
He's inside the high school.

1356
01:40:21,574 --> 01:40:23,485
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1357
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,957
<i>The lizard creature has
released a biological agent.</i>

1358
01:42:13,152 --> 01:42:14,928
<i>All efforts to stop him have failed</i>

1359
01:42:15,088 --> 01:42:18,297
<i>and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.</i>

1360
01:42:22,295 --> 01:42:23,205
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hey. Where are you?

1361
01:42:23,363 --> 01:42:24,637
<i>Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.</i>

1362
01:42:24,798 --> 01:42:26,573
You have to get out of there right now, okay?

1363
01:42:26,733 --> 01:42:29,111
- The antidote is cooking.
<i>- No, no, no, no.</i>

1364
01:42:29,269 --> 01:42:31,749
<i>Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.</i>

1365
01:42:31,905 --> 01:42:34,442
He needs to disperse from the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1366
01:42:34,608 --> 01:42:35,780
It's eight minutes left.

1367
01:42:35,812 --> 01:42:38,479
<i>You're gonna wait there for eight minutes
after what I just told you? People are gonna die.</i>

1368
01:42:38,678 --> 01:42:39,586
You leave right now.

1369
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:41,215
<i>That is—that is an order, okay?</i>

1370
01:42:41,381 --> 01:42:42,451
I'm gonna get everybody out.

1371
01:42:42,616 --> 01:42:44,118
<i>Did you hear wh...?</i>

1372
01:42:44,284 --> 01:42:47,322
Gwen! Gwen! You mother hubbard.
Are you serious?

1373
01:43:03,837 --> 01:43:05,009
He's heading south.

1374
01:43:15,782 --> 01:43:17,784
Stand down now,
or we will open fire.

1375
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:21,230
You are surrounded.
There is no escape.

1376
01:43:21,655 --> 01:43:23,100
Go, go!

1377
01:44:25,018 --> 01:44:26,395
Clear!

1378
01:44:26,553 --> 01:44:27,691
Clear up top!

1379
01:44:29,523 --> 01:44:30,763
Clear, sir!

1380
01:44:30,924 --> 01:44:32,096
All clear here, sir!

1381
01:44:57,584 --> 01:44:59,120
Freeze!

1382
01:44:59,819 --> 01:45:00,957
Down on the ground.

1383
01:45:01,121 --> 01:45:02,600
Your hands behind your head.

1384
01:45:02,756 --> 01:45:04,394
Now!

1385
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:09,240
Parker.

1386
01:45:11,097 --> 01:45:12,098
It's headed to Oscorp!

1387
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:14,643
And your daughter's there right now.

1388
01:45:27,414 --> 01:45:28,722
You gotta let me go.

1389
01:45:43,296 --> 01:45:44,070
Hold your fire!

1390
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:53,640
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1391
01:45:53,807 --> 01:45:56,254
I won't venture to say exactly
what it is that's crawling up

1392
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:58,321
the north side of the Oscorp Tower,

1393
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:01,756
but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1394
01:46:18,032 --> 01:46:20,034
<i>Time remaining: one minute.</i>

1395
01:47:33,007 --> 01:47:35,078
<i>Antidote complete.</i>

1396
01:47:47,922 --> 01:47:49,629
Oh, man.

1397
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:52,464
<i>We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.</i>

1398
01:47:52,626 --> 01:47:54,299
<i>The New York Police Department</i>

1399
01:47:54,495 --> 01:47:56,475
<i>has called for
a city-wide evacuation,</i>

1400
01:47:56,630 --> 01:47:58,610
<i>everything south of 54th Street.</i>

1401
01:47:59,433 --> 01:48:01,242
<i>If you are south of 54th Street,</i>

1402
01:48:01,402 --> 01:48:03,882
<i>you have to move out
of the area immediately.</i>

1403
01:48:13,314 --> 01:48:15,920
<i>Spider-Man appears to
be heading towards Oscorp.</i>

1404
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:19,958
<i>He looks injured and it's really
not clear if he's gonna make it.</i>

1405
01:48:20,121 --> 01:48:22,765
That's the guy who saved
my boy on the bridge.

1406
01:48:22,923 --> 01:48:24,300
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1407
01:48:24,458 --> 01:48:26,904
Something bad's going down in Midtown.

1408
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:29,632
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator down on 6th Avenue?

1409
01:48:29,797 --> 01:48:31,743
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1410
01:48:31,899 --> 01:48:33,970
The cops are evacuating everybody.
Who the hell cares?

1411
01:48:34,135 --> 01:48:36,342
Get him on the phone for me.

1412
01:48:53,954 --> 01:48:56,594
Hey Charlie, get me
Enriquez on 54th Street!

1413
01:48:56,757 --> 01:48:58,828
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1414
01:48:58,993 --> 01:49:01,337
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1415

<i>All tower cranes on 6th,</i>

<i>swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.</i>

1417

<i>Spider-Man needs those

<i>Let's give him a clear approach. Over.</i>

1419
01:49:47,008 --> 01:49:48,681
Come on, Parker.

1420
01:51:44,426 --> 01:51:45,131
Hey.

1421
01:51:45,427 --> 01:51:46,497
Dad!

1422
01:51:46,661 --> 01:51:48,834
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in the car, let's go.

1423
01:51:48,997 --> 01:51:50,840
- No, no, no. It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1424
01:51:50,999 --> 01:51:53,878
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1425
01:51:54,035 --> 01:51:56,311
Your boyfriend is a man of many masks.

1426
01:51:56,471 --> 01:51:57,643
I get it.

1427
01:51:57,806 --> 01:51:58,876
Give me this.

1428
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,883
Get in the car.

1429
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:06,550
Please make sure he's okay.

Poor Peter Parker.

01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:57,900
No mother, no father, no uncle.

1434

All alone.

1435
01:54:02,164 --> 01:54:03,165
He's not alone.

01:55:53,108 --> 01:55:54,781
No.

1452
01:55:56,278 --> 01:55:58,280
No!

1453
01:57:09,352 --> 01:57:10,490
The captain.

1454
01:57:12,055 --> 01:57:13,557
Captain!

1455
01:57:16,192 --> 01:57:17,637
The Lizard.

1456
01:57:17,794 --> 01:57:18,499
It's okay.

1457
01:57:18,662 --> 01:57:19,868
We stopped him.

1458
01:57:20,563 --> 01:57:21,439
Okay.

1459
01:57:21,448 --> 01:57:22,805
Let's get you out of here.

1460
01:57:23,967 --> 01:57:24,645
Come on.

1461
01:57:25,101 --> 01:57:26,444
Okay, okay, okay.

1462
01:57:26,603 --> 01:57:28,048
Look at me. Stay with me.

1463
01:57:28,204 --> 01:57:30,309
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1464
01:57:30,473 --> 01:57:33,977
You need to be gone when they get here.

1465
01:57:34,144 --> 01:57:35,487
Okay?

1466
01:57:35,645 --> 01:57:36,953
I'm not going anywhere.

1467
01:57:37,514 --> 01:57:39,960
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1468
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:42,186
This city needs you.

1469
01:57:44,187 --> 01:57:45,791
Here.

1470
01:57:45,955 --> 01:57:47,127
You're gonna need this.

1471
01:57:51,528 --> 01:57:53,508
You're gonna make enemies.

1472
01:57:55,899 --> 01:57:57,742
People will get hurt.

1473
01:57:59,336 --> 01:58:01,247
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1474
01:58:05,175 --> 01:58:07,177
So I want you to promise
me something, okay?

1475
01:58:09,112 --> 01:58:12,889
Leave Gwen out of it.

1476
01:58:15,418 --> 01:58:17,056
Promise me that.

1477
01:58:19,155 --> 01:58:21,032
Huh?

1478
01:58:22,692 --> 01:58:24,365
You promise me.

1479
01:58:33,069 --> 01:58:34,912
Oh...

1480
01:59:38,067 --> 01:59:41,506
<i>An eerie calm has set in over New York City.</i>

1481
01:59:41,704 --> 01:59:46,143
<i>Apparently, some sort of aerosolized
antidote was launched from</i></i>

1482
01:59:46,309 --> 01:59:49,518
<i>Oscorp Tower, which seems
to have counteracted the biotoxins.</i>

1483
01:59:49,712 --> 01:59:52,659
<i>Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully,</i>

1484
01:59:52,816 --> 01:59:54,818
<i>knowing that the alleged mastermind</i>

1485
01:59:54,984 --> 01:59:58,625
<i>of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.</i>

1486
01:59:58,788 --> 02:00:02,769
<i>We've got John Niles on the street
for a report in Lower Manhattan.</i>

1487
02:00:02,926 --> 02:00:04,963
<i>John, what do you see?</i>

1488
02:00:37,827 --> 02:00:39,864
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1489
02:00:42,031 --> 02:00:43,908
It's all right.

1490
02:00:45,001 --> 02:00:46,412
It's all right.

1491
02:00:46,903 --> 02:00:47,882
Rough night.

1492
02:00:49,974 --> 02:00:51,647
It's gonna be all right.

1493
02:01:45,396 --> 02:01:47,103
Where have you been?

1494
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:51,704
Hi.

1495
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:58,144
My father died.

1496
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:03,887
There was a funeral.

1497
02:02:05,349 --> 02:02:11,428
They shot off rifles and they made speeches.

1498
02:02:14,959 --> 02:02:16,939
Two of my teachers showed up.

1499
02:02:18,362 --> 02:02:19,739
And Flash showed up.

1500
02:02:24,635 --> 02:02:27,275
Everyone was there but you.

1501
02:02:41,885 --> 02:02:43,990
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1502
02:02:46,256 --> 02:02:48,293
I'm sorry. I can't, um...

1503
02:02:48,459 --> 02:02:49,870
What are you saying?

1504
02:02:50,027 --> 02:02:51,904
I can't see you any more.

1505
02:02:53,831 --> 02:02:55,310
I can't.

1506
02:03:20,924 --> 02:03:22,926
He made you promise, didn't he?

1507
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:30,810
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1508
02:03:57,261 --> 02:03:59,172
What a pretty girl.

1509
02:03:59,329 --> 02:04:00,501
Yeah.

1510
02:04:00,664 --> 02:04:02,473
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1511
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:05,173
Did you ask her out?

1512
02:04:08,906 --> 02:04:10,249
Why?

1513
02:04:11,341 --> 02:04:12,786
Can't.

1514
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:15,489
Why?

1515
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,755
I'm just no good for her.

1516
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:26,390
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1517
02:04:27,424 --> 02:04:30,501
Anyone has a problem
with that can talk to me.

1518
02:04:48,213 --> 02:04:52,622
<i>Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately,</i>

1519
02:04:52,784 --> 02:04:54,889
<i>and I'm sorry about that.</i>

1520
02:04:55,286 --> 02:04:58,267
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

1521
02:04:58,423 --> 02:05:00,994
<i>Ever since you were a little boy,</i>

1522
02:05:01,159 --> 02:05:05,608
<i>you've been living with
so many unresolved things.</i>

1523
02:05:06,798 --> 02:05:09,108
<i>Well, take it from an old man:</i>

1524
02:05:09,667 --> 02:05:12,773
<i>Those things send us down a road.</i>

1525
02:05:12,937 --> 02:05:15,276
<i>They make us who we are.</i>

1526
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:20,785
<i>And if anyone's destined
for greatness, it's you, son.</i>

1527
02:05:21,346 --> 02:05:23,792
<i>You owe the world your gifts.</i>

1528
02:05:24,349 --> 02:05:27,262
<i>You just have to figure
out how to use them.</i>

1529
02:05:27,786 --> 02:05:31,131
<i>And know that wherever they take you,</i>

1530
02:05:31,289 --> 02:05:33,599
<i>we'll always be here.</i>

1531
02:05:34,425 --> 02:05:36,996
<i>So come on home, Peter.</i>

1532
02:05:37,862 --> 02:05:39,705
<i>You're my hero.</i>

1533
02:05:39,864 --> 02:05:41,366
<i>And I love you.</i>

1534
02:05:49,808 --> 02:05:51,515
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1535
02:05:51,676 --> 02:05:53,155
Hey. How's it going?

1536
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:55,489
You coming along, man?

1537
02:05:57,081 --> 02:05:57,889
Cool shirt.

1538
02:05:59,784 --> 02:06:00,888
Yeah.

1539
02:06:01,085 --> 02:06:02,564
Dude's crazy.

1540
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:04,131
But chicks dig him.

1541
02:06:06,891 --> 02:06:09,633
Come on, guys, you heard
the bell. Get to class.

1542
02:06:19,103 --> 02:06:21,982
<i>I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students</i>

1543
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:25,383
that there were only 10
different plots in all of fiction.

1544
02:06:26,344 --> 02:06:28,415
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1545
02:06:28,613 --> 02:06:30,024
There is only one:

1546
02:06:30,915 --> 02:06:32,417
"Who am I"?

1547
02:06:33,151 --> 02:06:35,062
Mr. Parker.

1548
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:36,221
Tardy again.

1549
02:06:38,189 --> 02:06:40,032
Well, at least we can
always count on you.

1550
02:06:40,191 --> 02:06:42,933
Sorry Miss Ritter, won't
happen again, I promise.

1551
02:06:43,127 --> 02:06:45,198
Don't make promises
you can't keep, Mr. Parker.

1552
02:06:47,432 --> 02:06:49,605
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1553
02:06:49,767 --> 02:06:51,610
Okay, class, open your books.

1554
02:06:51,769 --> 02:06:53,771
Let's begin on page one.

1555
02:09:49,048 --> 02:09:51,619
Hello, doctor.

1556
02:09:51,817 --> 02:09:53,125
Did you tell the boy?

1557
02:09:53,318 --> 02:09:54,353
Tell him what?

1558
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:58,263
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1559
02:09:59,925 --> 02:10:00,801
No.

1560
02:10:00,959 --> 02:10:02,563
Well, that's very good.

1561
02:10:02,895 --> 02:10:05,107
So we'll let him be or now.

1562
02:10:06,131 --> 02:10:08,236
You should leave him alone!
