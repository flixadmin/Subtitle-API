1
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,547
Uncle: Ha-cha!
I see the mansion!

2
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,616
All the treasures
of the entire estate

3
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,084
will soon be in my shop.

4
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,720
Uncle has made
- the deal of the century.

5
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,057
This place is like
Chinese transylvania!

6
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,458
Cool!

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,028
You have seen
too many movies, Jade.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,764
Jade? Jade?!

9
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,198
Boo!

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,266
Gah!

11
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,970
Heh heh.
Hello, tohru.

12
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,211
Creep-o-rama.

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,349
Betcha it's crawling
with mummies...

14
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,419
Or wolfmen...Or vampires!

15
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:57,156
Sorry, Jade,
but monsters like that
do not--

16
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,261
aah! Wolfman!

17
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,583
Wolfman!

18
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,084
Jade, run!

19
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,752
Tch, from a rug?

20
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,593
You have come
for the antiques, yes?

21
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:11,063
Oh, you should not
sneak up on people
like--

22
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,598
greetings.
Aah!

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,032
Don't do that!

24
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,336
I'm Mr. lam,
executor of the estate.

25
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:22,374
My assistant will
load the acquisitions
onto your cart

26
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,109
while you render
payment.

27
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,912
Not so fast!

28
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,947
I must first
appraise the items.

29
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,850
I do not want my shop
to be full of junk.

30
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,852
Then how'd it get
so full of junk?

31
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,090
Be assured
all the heirlooms

32
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,058
are of the finest
quality.

33
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,629
Then you will not mind
if I take time
to examine them.

34
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,831
They have already been--

35
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,899
not by me they haven't.

36
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,000
You have my word that--

37
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,301
even so, I would--
just take them and--

38
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,802
I will do no such--
please.

39
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:51,870
No.
But--

40
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:52,938
no.
But--

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,106
no!

42
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,108
I will
- appraise everything,

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,143
or purchase nothing!

44
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,814
The customer's always right.

45
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,120
We will settle your account
when you're satisfied.

46
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,089
Enjoy your stay
in tsong tse manor.

47
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,400
Perhaps we should
warn them.

48
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,834
Do not be foolish.

49
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,504
If they knew what was hidden
among those relics,

50
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,806
they would never
take it off our hands.

51
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,420
This mansion is a gold mine!

52
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,088
We must begin work at once.

53
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,389
Every last item is--

54
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,924
spookyriffic.

55
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,660
Aah!

56
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,796
Can you believe
we get to spend the night?

57
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,030
Yes, Jade.

58
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:55,067
And can you believe
it is past your--

59
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,501
bedtime!
Aah!

60
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,004
We creatures of the night
never sleep.

61
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,506
(Evil laughter,
giggles)

62
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:03,976
Jade!

63
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,647
Gotta give Jackie
one last scare
before bed.

64
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,451
Perfect.

65
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,589
Jackie: You are not going
to scare me, Jade!

66
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,791
So don't even try!

67
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,793
Jade?

68
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,908
This isn't
a coffee table.

69
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,013
It's a coffin table!

70
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,616
Cool! But why would
a coffin have a lock?

71
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,531
Jackie!

72
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,768
Jackie!

73
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,236
There's
a vampire--aah!

74
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,738
I told you
you would not scare me.

75
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,206
It was a real vampire,
Jackie,

76
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,975
with fangs and claws,
and it tried to grab me,

77
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,510
but I slammed the lid,
and it's trapped inside the--

78
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,778
(gasps)

79
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,548
Vampire on the loose!
We gotta get outta here.

80
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,187
Ok, aah. I am so scared.

81
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,455
Now will you go to bed?

82
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,625
Jackie, I'm totally serious.
There's a real--aah!

83
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,826
There it goes!

84
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,699
But it was--
Jade, please--

85
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,567
it's late, and--
- look!

86
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,470
It--

87
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,939
I'm sure this is very funny
to you, Jade, but--

88
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,541
Jackie, look!
He's right--please--

89
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,642
Jade!
- Just--

90
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,843
you said that last--
no.

91
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,511
I've had enough.

92
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,447
But--
no "buts."

93
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,581
Bed.

94
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,154
Jackie, uncle is ready
to begin the appraisals.

95
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,857
(Growling)

96
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,058
Jackie?

97
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,030
Hello?

98
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,001
(Muffled noises)

99
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,070
Jackie?

100
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,674
(Growling)

101
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,343
(Gasps)

102
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,746
(Moaning)

103
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,487
You can't leave me alone!

104
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,122
Don't you ever watch
scary movies?!

105
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,023
The beautiful girl is
always the first to--

106
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,258
(thud)

107
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,197
I'm sure it was just
a little thunder, Jade.
Now--

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,267
ohh.

109
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,436
The vampire got tohru!

110
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:47,372
Hmm. No.
Jet lag got tohru.

111
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,741
Our flight was
18 hours long, Jade.

112
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,009
He is tired.

113
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,344
(Moaning)

114
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,849
Hello! Does this look
like "tired" to you?!

115
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,386
How can uncle appraise
with no helpers
and so much yell--

116
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,023
(gasps)

117
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,758
Aiya!

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,261
Jackie, guard the door
in case it returns.

119
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,395
"It"?

120
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,197
Hidden inside
of an antique,

121
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,066
Mr. lam tried
to trick us
into taking it.

122
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,902
What is "it"?

123
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,503
A kiang chi.

124
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,905
A vampire.

125
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,041
Told ya.

126
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,344
Did a little monster
put you up to this?

127
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,613
Chinese vampire drain chi--

128
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,849
life energy from their prey,

129
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,784
making the vampire stronger

130
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,120
and turning their victims
into servant.

131
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,956
Without any chi,
tohru will soon transform

132
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,992
into a fiendish Minion
of darkness!

133
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,728
We must perform
a chi transfusion.

134
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,833
Transfusion? You want
to put someone else's chi
in tohru's body?

135
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,634
Tch, where are you
gonna find someone

136
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,736
with that much extra--whoa!

137
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,272
You have abundant
youthful energy--

138
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,241
chi to spare.

139
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,377
It is the only way
to prevent tohru
from serving the undead.

140
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,247
(Chanting in Chinese)

141
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,725
Cool.

142
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,194
Are you sure
it is not jet lag?

143
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,497
I have not seen
this vamp--aah!

144
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,312
Aah!

145
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,488
Oh, thank you, tohru.

146
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,857
I just slam-dunked
a chi-sucker.

147
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,492
I rule!

148
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,395
Go, tohru!
Go, tohru!
I'm the bomb!

149
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:54,199
Hmm. It appears
the chi transfusion
was successful.

150
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,234
Go, Jade! Go, Jade!

151
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,036
Lotta-chi girl
saving tohru!

152
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,437
(Growling)

153
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,943
It can fly?

154
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,445
Not for long it--aw!

155
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,381
This is
a Chinese vampire.

156
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,416
A wooden stick
will not harm it.

157
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,484
Then how
do we stop--

158
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,552
(growling)

159
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,719
Whoa!

160
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,788
Do not breathe.

161
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,893
The kiang chi is blind.

162
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,896
It can only find you
if it smells
your breath.

163
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,337
You are making this--
(Gasps)

164
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,332
Gi-gi-gi--

165
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,403
gi-ee!

166
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,112
Ah-choo!

167
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,747
Aah!

168
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,882
Unh!

169
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,589
(Gasps)
- No!

170
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,891
Jade!

171
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,665
Give it back, you chi-hog!

172
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:38,770
Whoa!

173
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:39,904
Unh!

174
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,074
So unfair.

175
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,243
Hurry uncle

176
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,914
uncle, you have to perform
another transfusion.

177
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,726
(Moaning)

178
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,461
Jade cannot
hold her breath.

179
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,864
The vampire will
follow her
and find us.

180
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,532
Then let's roll!

181
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,573
We will be safe
on the other side
of the river.

182
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,376
The kiang chi
cannot cross
running water.

183
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,079
Where are you getting
these rules from?

184
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,284
(Chanting in Chinese)

185
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,188
(Chanting stops)

186
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,005
Cart surfing!

187
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,376
(Chanting)

188
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,382
Whoa!

189
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,184
Aah!

190
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,553
Oops.

191
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,954
(Chanting)

192
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,125
(Moaning) Huh?

193
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,394
The transfusion spell
is com--

194
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,274
hello! Duck!

195
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,085
(Moaning)

196
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,754
Uncle!

197
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,357
Hang on! We're almost...

198
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,893
There.

199
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,037
How are we gonna save uncle
without uncle?

200
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,206
We must do research.

201
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,176
You've gotta
be kidding me.

202
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,817
He's starting to go
all fangy.

203
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,152
(Moaning)

204
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,855
Uncle is turning into
the vampire's Minion.

205
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,924
Use my chi
for the transfusion.

206
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,025
Ow!

207
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,527
I do not know such spells.

208
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,028
Jade has uncle's chi,

209
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,630
not his brains.

210
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,071
(Moaning)

211
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,676
Ok, he's, like, really
freaking me out now.

212
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,013
Ha-cha!
You found a spell?

213
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:38,550
No, but I know
how to get our chi
back from the vampire.

214
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,419
Later, we need
- a transfusion spell now.

215
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,021
Uh, actually...

216
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,893
I think we just
ran out of time.

217
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:03,374
I will vanquish you
and feed your
chi to my master.

218
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,576
Aiya!

219
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,811
He is a servant
to the vampire.

220
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,880
Duh!
Uncle,

221
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,315
we are your friends,

222
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,484
your family,
and I know you
do not want to harm--

223
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,223
uncle, we will not
fight you.

224
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,592
(Snarling)
Aah!
- Unh!

225
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:23,528
Tch, like he's
giving us a choice.

226
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,198
You must keep him busy
while I learn how
to subdue him.

227
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,168
My master will feast
upon your chi.

228
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,970
Please, learn fast!

229
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,072
(Yelling)

230
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,682
Whoa! Oof!

231
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,851
Unh.

232
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,087
Ha-cha!

233
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,727
Remember books,
uncle?

234
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,362
You love books.

235
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,030
Ha-cha!

236
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,803
As long
as the parchment spell
is in place,

237
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,538
uncle cannot move.

238
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,980
You are doomed!

239
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,115
Aah!

240
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,484
One more thing--

241
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,885
he can still talk.

242
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,021
You may have defeated
the servant,

243
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,323
but you shall never
defeat the master.

244
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,526
The glorious one
will devour
every last bit

245
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,762
of your delicious chi.

246
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,832
Shoulda put that paper
over his mouth.

247
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,103
We must all reclaim our chi
before sunrise,

248
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,473
or it will belong
to the vampire forever.

249
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,576
You mean,
I'd be stuck
in Jade mode?

250
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,612
You would rather have
uncle's chi?!

251
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,315
I cannot stop thinking
about digestion!

252
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,920
Then my master
will drink you dry.

253
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,388
Drink you--
(Muffled)

254
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,791
How do we
take back the chi?

255
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,760
Easy,
we just hunt down
count jerkula and--

256
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,133
no! Magic must
defeat magic.

257
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,869
We must
collect a toadstool
from a graveyard,

258
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,305
place it inside
the vampire's left sock,

259
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,307
and throw the sock
into a river.

260
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,210
You're making this up.

261
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,013
You want to stop
the kiang chi, yes?

262
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,481
Then do what Jade tells you!

263
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,617
One more thing--

264
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,988
we must hurry.
The sunrise is
in 13 minutes.

265
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,122
Come on, Jackie.

266
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,658
It's vampire butt-kick time.

267
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,393
This is too weird.

268
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,830
Quickly, Jackie.

269
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,931
We must
find the toadstool

270
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,066
before the vampire
finds us.

271
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,134
Boo!

272
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,335
Aah!

273
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,670
Heh heh.

274
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,771
Couldn't help
myself.

275
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,374
It is my master
who will help himself

276
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:52,276
to a heaping helping
of your succulent chi.

277
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,016
Ha-cha! I have found
a toadstool!

278
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,884
Now, we just
have to find the--

279
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,152
tohru, please
stop playing.

280
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,286
Aah!

281
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,323
Jackie!
- The vampire!

282
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,591
Master!

283
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,163
I see you.

284
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,167
You can see?!
You can talk?!

285
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,102
With so much chi
to nourish me,

286
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,437
I have grown stronger.

287
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,272
I can
withstand anything,

288
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,207
even the light of day.

289
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,276
(Grunting)

290
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,118
Huh?

291
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,821
Got it!

292
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,492
The other left sock,
tohru.

293
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,660
Oops.

294
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,998
Excellent kick,
o dark one.

295
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,166
Whoa!

296
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,403
Master! I have fallen...

297
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,306
And I cannot get up.

298
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,713
In moments,
the collective chi
will be mine for--huh?!

299
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,949
Heh heh. Nice shoe.

300
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,350
(Growling)

301
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,521
Jade may have
uncle's chi,

302
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,490
but Jade is still Jade.

303
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,029
Boo!

304
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,434
Hyah!

305
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,943
(Chanting)

306
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,682
¶ We knocked
your socks off ¶

307
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:38,749
(sniffing)

308
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,884
Eww!

309
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,358
(Sniffing) Master,
is that your sock?

310
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,707
(Screaming)

311
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,846
Cool!

312
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,922
Who stuck
special parchment
to uncle's head?!

313
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,664
Um, maybe you should
get out of the sun.

314
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,445
So everybody's chi is
back where it belongs?

315
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,781
Thank you
for the loan, Jade.

316
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,917
It was...Cool.

317
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,151
No problem, big t,

318
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,121
but I don't think uncle
got all his chi back.

319
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,958
I have this monster craving
for mung beans.

320
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,961
I am just glad
this horrible trip
is over.

321
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,730
Horrible?!
What do you mean,
"horrible"?!

322
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,098
Because of the kiang chi,

323
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,002
uncle bargained Mr. lam
down to half price.

324
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:09,907
And he threw in
a very nice table
for no extra charge.

325
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,218
Hey, Jackie,
why do you think
it's so important

326
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,653
to be defensive
rather than offensive?

327
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,256
On the bus,
somebody come to grab you--

328
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,891
bom! Always defense.

329
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,427
When they touch you,
you just turn, turn.

330
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,996
You know, protect.
Everything to protect.

331
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,098
It's better
than fight somebody,

332
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,335
because
for one small argument,

333
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,338
you hurt somebody.
You never happy
in your whole life.

334
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,507
So that's why in my movie,
you can see there's a lot
of protect things.

335
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,042
In the real life...

336
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,612
Defense better than...

337
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,548
To hit somebody.
Remember. Yeah.
