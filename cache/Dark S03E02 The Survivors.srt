1
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,458
Get changed.

2
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,750
Martha?

3
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,164
This can't be.

4
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,466
You...

5
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,375
You're alive.

6
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,273
That isn't Martha.

7
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,403
What's going on?

8
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,501
He's right.

9
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,326
I'm not Martha.

10
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,206
Not your Martha.

11
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,496
I promised to make
everything right again,

12
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,914
so none of it happens.

13
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,876
So you don't die in my world,
and I don't die in yours.

14
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,123
So that Ulrich... Dad...

15
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,125
Mikkel...

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,164
so they all come back.

17
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,416
So everything finally comes to an end.

18
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,923
THE SURVIVORS

19
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:55,745
22 SEPTEMBER 1987

20
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,706
<i>- This is Ines...
- And Michael Kahnwald.</i>

21
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,208
<i>We're not at home right now.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

22
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,039
<i>Mrs. Kahnwald, this is Mr. Dietmann
from the Federal Postal Service.</i>

23
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,664
<i>I've been trying to reach
you for three months.</i>

24
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,196
<i>We'll disconnect the line next month</i>

25
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:16,126
<i>if you don't pay the outstanding bills.</i>

26
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,331
<i>Please call me back as soon as you can.</i>

27
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,923
MISSING FOR 3 MONTHS

28
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,375
I think you did the right thing.

29
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,211
Even if the coffin is empty.

30
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,673
To... to get closure.

31
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,038
At least you've got each other.

32
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,578
For support.

33
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,498
At least we've got each other.

34
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,498
Now we can stand hand in
hand by an empty coffin

35
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
and finally get closure.

36
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,958
Tell them where you were
when Mads disappeared.

37
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,373
He was fucking her!

38
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:53,375
When my son disappeared, he
was screwing Claudia Tiedemann.

39
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,789
If only you'd put as much
energy into finding your own son

40
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,206
as you're wasting on
finding your mistress...

41
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,778
Then maybe Mads would be back by now.

42
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,190
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

43
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,006
WHERE IS CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN?

44
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,668
"I have no idea what
you're talking about".

45
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,498
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT HEAD
MISSING SINCE 26 JUNE,

46
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,710
THE DAY HER FATHER
WAS FOUND DEAD AT HOME.

47
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:30,421
22 SEPTEMBER 2020

48
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,664
<i>The world's scientists are
still seeking an explanation</i>

49
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,248
<i>for the events of 27 June 2020.</i>

50
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,998
<i>The epicentre of the global catastrophe</i>

51
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,456
<i>is still thought to be
the small town of Winden.</i>

52
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,664
<i>A French research team
believes it is possible</i>

53
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:54,623
<i>that our world stood still for a
fraction of a nanosecond on 27 June.</i>

54
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,581
<i>Tidal forces may have
diverged as a result.</i>

55
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,164
<i>This would explain the
global spring tides,</i>

56
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,373
<i>weather phenomena, and
disturbances of electrical systems,</i>

57
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,706
<i>which in turn could explain the
great number of aeroplane crashes</i>

58
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,006
<i>and the simultaneous
loss of power supply</i>

59
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,956
<i>to nuclear power plants worldwide.</i>

60
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,478
<i>There is no sign of the
situation stabilising...</i>

61
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,486
How are you?

62
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,746
Mum...

63
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,890
You're leaving again already?

64
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,168
I'll be back before the sun sets.

65
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,501
In 5 days all this will be closed off.

66
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,956
We're evacuating the entire area.

67
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,418
We have orders to seal
off the restricted area.

68
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,425
Seal off?

69
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,358
Walled in.

70
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,871
Why are you doing this to her?

71
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,878
- You're from a parallel world?
- Where Mikkel doesn't disappear?

72
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,128
I'm mute?

73
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,661
And Jonas doesn't exist?

74
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,580
Where we're all already dead because
your world ends just as ours does?

75
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,775
That's bullshit.

76
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,873
I'm not dead.

77
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,075
I'm here.

78
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,798
How did you find us?

79
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,978
How did you know where we were?

80
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,846
Jonas told me.

81
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,808
I thought Jonas didn't
exist in your world.

82
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,615
He travelled there.

83
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,185
From your world to mine.

84
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,835
You're lying.

85
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,280
I was never in your world.

86
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,010
Did you write the letter?

87
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,185
What do you really want?

88
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,414
Did Adam send you?

89
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,466
What did you use to travel? I want
to know what you used to travel!

90
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,883
You're running late today.

91
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,471
The machines aren't running yet.

92
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,545
You have a visitor.

93
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,914
So you're the reason

94
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:11,346
for his mood being even
worse today than usual.

95
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,289
Don't let me scare you.

96
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,039
People may say

97
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,956
I'm not quite right in the head,

98
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,808
but I assure you...

99
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,706
that I see more

100
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,498
than those among us who can see.

101
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,745
- Do you know this boy?
- Nope.

102
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,664
- Do you know this boy?
- No. Sorry.

103
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,716
- Do you know this boy?
- No. I'm sorry.

104
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,675
- Do you know this boy?
- Nope.

105
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:53,958
Ulrich?

106
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,398
Do I know you?

107
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,036
Do you maybe know where this boy is?

108
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,873
WHO HAS SEEN MICHAEL
KAHNWALD? 12 YEARS OLD

109
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,225
Maybe the madman got him after all.

110
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,206
What madman?

111
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,338
Don't touch me, Typhoid Mary!

112
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,783
Hey, Ulrich.

113
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,825
Ulrich?

114
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,770
I thought you weren't coming today.

115
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,325
Katharina.

116
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,376
We'll be late for history class.

117
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,831
Katharina Albers?

118
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,833
Hello?

119
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,101
I remember.

120
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,785
What's with her?

121
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,216
The old bat's not all there.

122
00:17:58,791 --> 00:17:59,791
Come on.

123
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,814
Hey!

124
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:02,873
Hey!

125
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,355
What madman?

126
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,501
What madman?

127
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,873
A guy escaped from the
nuthouse this summer.

128
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,375
He tried to drag Michael into the cave.

129
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,735
It was in the paper.

130
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,164
You keep your mitts off Mikkel!

131
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,366
And Ulrich!

132
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,038
VISITOR'S PASS
NIELSEN, TRONTE

133
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,868
I've already told all
this to the police.

134
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,278
It won't take long.

135
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,075
I promise.

136
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,986
And this is supposed
to be for the newspaper?

137
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,116
The week before Claudia disappeared...

138
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,203
did you notice anything?

139
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,831
Her appearance was always
very important to her.

140
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,283
So neat.

141
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,425
But that week...

142
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,341
she wore outfits twice.

143
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,293
She forgot appointments. Her hair...

144
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,525
I think...

145
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,766
it all had to do with
the old woman and the dog.

146
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,956
She showed up a few days before
Mrs. Tiedemann disappeared.

147
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,578
She said the dog belonged to her,

148
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,380
but didn't take it with her.

149
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,276
After that, Mrs. Tiedemann
was somehow...

150
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,616
different.

151
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,448
Excuse me.

152
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,623
We're looking for...

153
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,123
a woman, late 40s.

154
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,345
Blonde hair.

155
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,623
And a girl. 17 years old.
Red hair.

156
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,164
If they're not on the wall, then...

157
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,716
they're not here.

158
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,706
This is good.

159
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:24,538
If they're not here, then...

160
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,498
Maybe they travelled.

161
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:41,164
CALL FOR WITNESSES
WE ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE

162
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,706
MISSING
TIEDEMANN, CLAUDIA

163
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,200
Hey!

164
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,393
The man from the asylum.

165
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,664
Why didn't you tell me?

166
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,116
I thought I'd already made that clear.

167
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,248
You can barge in here
as often as you want

168
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,498
demanding information on the
whereabouts of Michael Kahnwald.

169
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,081
You won't get any.

170
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,873
Someone tried to kidnap
my son this summer.

171
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,075
Your son?

172
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,414
You can neither identify yourself

173
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,748
nor do you have any proof
you're actually the boy's mother.

174
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,914
You're not registered anywhere.

175
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,748
You don't have a birth certificate.

176
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,039
And, astonishingly, you don't
even want to reveal your name.

177
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,531
No one has seen him for 3 months.

178
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,248
He doesn't go to school.

179
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,880
He's not at home.

180
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,990
The man from the psychiatric ward...

181
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,846
I remember that.

182
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,039
My mother told me about it.

183
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,414
Maybe...

184
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,706
maybe he tried to do it again.

185
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,588
Now listen very carefully.

186
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,373
The boy hasn't disappeared.

187
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:54,748
Child Protective Services know where
Ines and Michael Kahnwald are.

188
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,712
After this summer's
events it was decided

189
00:23:56,714 --> 00:23:59,120
it was best to give
the boy some time out.

190
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,498
And the madman is back
in the closed ward,

191
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,910
as he has been for the past 34 years.

192
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,298
What did you just say?

193
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,498
Just to make it absolutely clear,

194
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,831
if I see you here again, I'm
putting you in protective custody.

195
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,748
- What's his name?
- Goodbye.

196
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,380
What's the man's name?

197
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,146
Hello, Regina.

198
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,086
Is that your dog?

199
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,306
It was my mother's.

200
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,788
Could I give you a ride?

201
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,740
Strange.

202
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,993
Looks like Gretchen.

203
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,098
I think that's why she kept her.

204
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,226
Do you think...

205
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,513
the disappearance of
Mads and my mother...

206
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,130
that they're connected?

207
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,626
I don't know.

208
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:24,333
The week before she
disappeared, did she...

209
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,665
say anything to you about an old woman?

210
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:35,216
And...

211
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:38,813
did she say anything to you about me?

212
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,675
I...

213
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:53,056
just thought maybe she'd said something.

214
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:59,066
I'll...

215
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,965
get out just up ahead...

216
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,248
and walk the rest of the way.

217
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,450
Well...

218
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,893
if you need anything...

219
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,789
My name is Claudia Tiedemann.

220
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:23,131
I am one of the few survivors of
the apocalypse of 27 June 2020.

221
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,998
Almost 3 months have
passed since the catastrophe.

222
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,498
It's still unclear what exactly
led to the events in Winden.

223
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,081
But the God Particle...

224
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,353
if we can stabilise it,
maybe it is a way back.

225
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,155
Back to the past.

226
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,328
Maybe we can save them.

227
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,566
All of them.

228
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:34,033
I'll take a look around upstairs.

229
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,650
I'm looking for food.

230
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,408
And you?

231
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,785
MUM AND SISTER

232
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,625
Where do you sleep?

233
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:16,325
CAVE

234
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,426
What's going on?

235
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,333
Why are you here?

236
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,141
Are you following us?

237
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:38,076
I told you, we want
nothing to do with you.

238
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,835
You want to protect her, I know.

239
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,150
So do I.

240
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:52,231
And I will.

241
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,890
After you were killed.

242
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:15,876
TANNHAUS MACHINERY FACTORY

243
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,501
I'm sorry.

244
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,830
About Jonas.

245
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,133
Since we've been here...

246
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,025
he's...

247
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,683
he's been different.

248
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,216
How did you get here?

249
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,603
We travelled.

250
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,596
Exactly at the moment
everything blew up.

251
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,040
He didn't want to come here.

252
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,446
It just happened.

253
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,715
The device is empty.

254
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:29,241
It's not that easy to get nuclear
fuel from the future in 1888.

255
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,491
And this?

256
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,206
What is this?

257
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,748
The workshop?

258
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:43,581
The blind man?

259
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,800
Does he know who you are?

260
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,128
Where you come from?

261
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,450
Come along.

262
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I need to show you something.

263
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,508
The young woman.

264
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,988
Is she one of you?

265
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,075
A traveller?

266
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:29,426
When I found you, it was a sign.

267
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,786
A godsend.

268
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,081
Whatever that woman means to you,

269
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:39,081
don't forget what we
are going to create.

270
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,583
Paradise.

271
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:46,123
Every calamity can be reversed.

272
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,495
Every pain, destroyed
before it even comes to be.

273
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,998
A perfect world.

274
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,914
<i>Sic mundus...</i>

275
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:05,826
<i>creatus est.</i>

276
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,783
Excuse me.

277
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,275
Can I help you?

278
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,555
Can I help you?

279
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,831
I...

280
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,033
I...

281
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,505
I'd like to visit someone.

282
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,041
He's been here for 34 years.

283
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,136
The inspector?

284
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,718
Do I know you from somewhere?

285
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,883
Somehow you look familiar to me.

286
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,180
Are you related to him?

287
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,291
He's my husband.

288
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,066
I see.

289
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,681
You're one of them.

290
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:57,706
One of those women who
go for madmen or prisoners

291
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,938
because they can't find anyone else.

292
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,539
I'm off duty. Come back tomorrow.

293
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,431
That's St. Christopher.

294
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,340
The patron saint of travellers.

295
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:17,995
He renounced the devil and
carried the creator into the world.

296
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,793
My mum had one just like that.

297
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,731
I've travelled a very long way.

298
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:30,456
Let me see him.

299
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,458
Please.

300
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,780
He was just released from solitary.

301
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,090
My colleague will let you out.

302
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,750
Ulrich.

303
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:46,333
Katharina.

304
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,468
I'll get you out of here.

305
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:20,375
I promise.

306
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,633
Excuse me?

307
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,583
Excuse me,
what are you doing here?

308
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,875
What do you want?

309
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,998
I...

310
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,660
I'll call security.

311
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,041
No.

312
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,316
You won't do that.

313
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,416
Jasmin.

314
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,541
Right?

315
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,080
Hell is empty.

316
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,838
And all devils are here.

317
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,718
At some point you have to decide.

318
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,833
For us.

319
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,383
Or against us.

320
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,550
I...

321
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,695
saw Regina.

322
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,683
She's all grown up.

323
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,578
I've wondered all these years...

324
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,065
if she...

325
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:19,486
Claudia never said who the father was.

326
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,031
You're right.

327
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,340
I have to decide.

328
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,293
Mum?

329
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,168
Tronte.

330
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:40,791
Regina.

331
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,445
What are you doing here?

332
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,439
I'm so sorry.

333
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,623
But it has to happen.

334
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,475
I don't understand.

335
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,414
She said...

336
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:11,536
it's the only way to save you.

337
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:41,291
MUM AND SISTER
CAVE

338
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:50,543
What did he say to you?

339
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,039
What do you mean?

340
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:55,311
The boy.

341
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,430
Forget him.

342
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,128
I'm not a little kid anymore.

343
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,998
Why do you carry that
around everywhere you go?

344
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,748
What's in there?

345
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,460
Where are Mum and Franziska?

346
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,048
We'll find them.

347
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:23,246
22 SEPTEMBER 2053

348
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:36,035
Everything will be okay.

349
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,761
Clear the table.

350
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,135
I said, clear the table.

351
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,931
Must I always repeat myself?

352
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,118
What is this?

353
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,130
This is a kind of secret lodge.

354
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,421
Old Tannhaus is the only member left.

355
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:11,286
His father was convinced he could
override the rules of space and time.

356
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,175
He dedicated his entire life to this.

357
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,795
And so did his son.

358
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:24,338
They tried to build a time machine?

359
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:31,878
Jonas is trying to rebuild
things the way he saw them.

360
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,473
He's been here before.

361
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,275
Not now.

362
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,923
In the future.

363
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,723
He asked you something earlier.

364
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,893
Whether Adam had sent you.

365
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,358
He said...

366
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,290
that Adam killed Martha.

367
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,791
Who is this Adam?

368
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,183
He didn't tell you guys?

369
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,555
He is Adam.

370
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:16,806
Jonas.

371
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,633
We don't know our end.

372
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:35,483
But our end...

373
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:38,465
knows us.

374
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,051
Salvation...

375
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,951
or damnation.

376
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,920
We can indulge in the
illusion of free will,

377
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:56,921
but we cannot escape
our ultimate destiny.

378
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,955
The choices we make in this
world may be different...

379
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,873
but nevertheless,

380
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:21,128
they converge on the same moment.

381
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:28,498
Things may not happen in the same way,

382
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,240
or at the same time.

383
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:32,385
But they happen.

384
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:38,271
You believed a world without
you would be a better one.

385
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,038
But they will all die.

386
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Mikkel.

387
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:51,326
Mikkel will die.

388
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,265
Everyone will die.

389
00:54:56,625 --> 00:55:00,123
The apocalypse takes place in my world

390
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:02,195
just as it does in yours.

391
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,643
But in mine, that's in just 3 days.
