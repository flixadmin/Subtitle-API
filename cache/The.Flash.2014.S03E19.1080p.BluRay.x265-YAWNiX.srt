<i>Previously on</i>
The Flash...

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,764
Despite your feeble efforts
to change the future, you can't.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,007
Everything's the same.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,531
<i>The future has not changed.</i>

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,006
If the answers that we need

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,481
to stop Savitar and save you
are in the future,

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,681
<i>then that's where I need to go.</i>

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,006
Caitlin? Somebody help!

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,449
She's gone.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,649
- Stop! That's not what she wanted!
- I don't care!

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,766
2024.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,726
According to the future article
in the time vault,

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,082
I'm still in Central City.
There's no mention of Savitar.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,801
I probably trapped him
in the Speed Force by then.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,289
That's the time I need to travel to, 2024.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,601
If I trapped him,
I must've figured out who he was, right?

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,721
Iris?

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,606
What are you doing?

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,608
Uh, sorry, I was just thinking.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,841
About what?

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,690
<i>Same as you, the future.</i>

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,121
And my dad.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,766
What about him?

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,043
I need you to make me a promise, okay?

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,170
If things don't go our way,

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,811
if Savitar kills me...

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,240
- He won't.
- If he does...

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,563
- He won't!
- If he does, Barry,

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,127
promise me that you will be there
for my dad.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,451
Don't let him push Cecile away.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,328
Don't let him spiral out of control.
Make sure that him and Wally...

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,124
Stop, okay?
We're not gonna talk about this.

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,890
You're not gonna die.
I told you, I have a plan.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,043
Barry, I need you to promise me, okay?

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,605
I'm serious.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,641
Promise me

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,768
that you're gonna make sure
that my dad is okay.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,166
I promise.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,121
S.T.A.R. Labs.

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,889
We... We should go.

41
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,571
- You think?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,927
Oh, probably should've made
that out of carbyne.

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,480
Rookie mistake.

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,886
You do not want to hurt me, Caitlin.

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,048
You know, you probably should've spent
a little more time

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,527
finding a cure for what ails me.

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,081
- I care about you, Caitlin.
- Show me.

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,725
- Julian!
- Come on. Come on.

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,566
Oh, boys!

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,090
<i>Where are you?</i>

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,282
- What are you doing?
- Buying us some time.

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,481
Hey, dummies, my palm scan still works.

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,640
I don't wanna have to do this.

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,009
<i>I know you don't,</i>

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,241
but I do.

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,641
Stop!

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,684
Aww, come to save the day?

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,968
Good. Now I can get rid of you, too.

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,842
Caitlin, you can fight this.

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,162
I know, but I don't want to.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,361
<i>Anything?</i>

62
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,682
I searched the whole building. She's gone.

63
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,446
Hey, Julian, how about next time

64
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,290
you decide to release
my friend's inner ice demon,

65
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,720
you do it sometime in July?

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,011
I know you're not being serious.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,646
I was trying to save her life, Cisco.

68
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,330
Iris was right. Even H.R. was right.

69
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,124
- We should've taken her to a hospital.
- Brilliant idea!

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,810
Yes, expose her meta-human status
to the world!

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,844
- That would've been great, wouldn't it?
- Guess what! She's gonna do that anyway!

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,041
- Do you even...
- Guys!

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,484
Arguing isn't gonna help us find her.

74
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,406
Maybe we should just take five.

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,561
Yeah.

76
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,120
Yeah, probably right.

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,846
I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna run to the future.

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,561
Wait, what?

79
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,050
- You wanna do this now?
- Mmm-hmm.

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,924
Barry, Caitlin is still out there.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,366
<i>I know, but we're running out of time.</i>

82
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,926
If I can find my future self,

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,083
I can find out who Savitar is,
how he defeated him.

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,763
Besides, I can run to the future
and be back like I never even left.

85
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,251
All right, what do you need us to do?

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,243
Just keep everybody else
away from the pipeline.

87
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,286
Barry, last time you went to the future
it was by accident.

88
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,561
How are you supposed get there now?

89
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,761
With your help.

90
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,806
You sure this is gonna work?

91
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,443
I calculated the force from the explosion
that propelled me to the future last time.

92
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,451
At your fastest speed,
you can create three times that force.

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,564
It's more than enough to get me
where I wanna go.

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,441
All right.

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,761
Just run as fast as you can.

96
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,762
I'll try to keep up.

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,761
Good luck, man.

98
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,211
2024.

99
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,887
I made it.

100
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,483
What is it, Throwback Thursday?

101
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,008
Haven't seen that outfit in a while,
have we, honey?

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,404
Haven't seen him in a while, either.

103
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,522
Guess we get to relive the past,

104
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,203
kick his ass like we used to.

105
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,840
You've been gone for a while,
so let me remind you.

106
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,849
This is my town.

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,883
Our town, baby.

108
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,050
That's right. Our town. My mistake.

109
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,847
Not anymore.

110
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,041
What was that?

111
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,247
Did you say something, Flash?

112
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,888
You're in for a world of pain.

113
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,089
You better run, Flash.

114
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,566
Next time,

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,083
we're gonna put him in something
he can't get out of.

116
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,641
I knew it was you.

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,281
Cisco.

118
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,801
Barry Allen.

119
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,808
Hang on. How did you know I was here?

120
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,326
I had a feeling.

121
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,530
A feeling I have not felt in a long time,

122
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,482
and so I hacked into the security cameras,

123
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,166
and I saw you fighting
Top and Mirror Master

124
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,725
in your OG suit

125
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,089
with the white emblem.
2017 edition, of course.

126
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,005
But being here...

127
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,645
This is no accident, is it?

128
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,006
Um...

129
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,167
I came here for some information,
and then I'm going back.

130
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,481
What's the information?

131
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,726
Oh!

132
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,160
Time travel.

133
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,843
Yeah. Yeah, you say something,
you might mess something up, right?

134
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,562
Don't worry, my powers of deduction
have improved since 2017.

135
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,000
2017...

136
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,721
Savitar.

137
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,361
I need to talk to me.

138
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,361
Do you know where he is?

139
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,531
So H.R. stopped the S.T.A.R. Labs museum?

140
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,367
H.R. went onto other things.

141
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,881
What about Caitlin?

142
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,363
Once she became Killer Frost,
she never stepped in this building again.

143
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,564
So I shut down this place?

144
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,961
My friend, you shut everything down.

145
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,491
S.T.A.R. Labs, Team Flash.

146
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,727
<i>You didn't want us around,</i>

147
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,565
- so you pushed us away.
- Why?

148
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,803
You said it was
because of what we represented,

149
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,846
that we were a constant reminder
to you of what you lost,

150
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,407
but you weren't the only one
who lost something.

151
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,646
Are you sure he's here?

152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,245
He never leaves this place.

153
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,803
Well, what are you doing?
Aren't you gonna come with me?

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,931
Man, I shouldn't even be here.

155
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,448
Look, just get what you need,
but don't leave without saying goodbye.

156
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,767
All right.

157
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,791
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

158
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,006
Why are you here?

159
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,086
I need your help.

160
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,408
You're from before she dies, aren't you?

161
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,126
You can't save her.

162
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,128
Yes, I can. And I'm going to!

163
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,606
No, you can't. Go home.

164
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,929
Just tell me who's in the suit.
All right, that's all I need.

165
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,010
You tell me that,
we'll be able to track him down.

166
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,611
We'll learn his weakness.

167
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,729
We'll stop him before he even tries.

168
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,490
Just tell me who Savitar is.

169
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,601
I can't.

170
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,241
What do you... Why?

171
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,605
Because I don't know the answer.

172
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,564
I'm sorry you ran all this way
for nothing.

173
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,689
<i>You want some advice? Go home.</i>

174
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,843
<i>Spend as much time with Iris as you can</i>

175
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,371
because pretty soon,

176
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,770
you'll never see her again.

177
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,886
You sure you can't stay?

178
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,690
I'm not gonna get what I came for.

179
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,530
- Look, we could really use you.
- Cisco.

180
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,803
I mean it. Mirror Master and Top
are not the only villains in the city.

181
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,371
Barry, we don't have a Flash here,
not anymore, okay?

182
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,561
Well, Cisco...

183
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,886
I can't.

184
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,407
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,209
Look, it's good to see you in any time,
all right?

186
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,526
Yeah. You, too.

187
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,403
You okay? What's wrong?

188
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,801
I don't know.

189
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,364
A portal won't open. I can't get back.

190
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,644
I can't get back to the past.

191
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,491
What's happening, Cisco?

192
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,807
I don't know.

193
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,287
I mean, why can't I open a portal?
Wasn't I running fast enough?

194
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,687
Well, I'm not sure.
We don't have the telemetry for this suit.

195
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,405
Okay, well, I mean,
we've got to figure this out.

196
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,051
- I have to get back.
- We're gonna get you back home,

197
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,810
not to worry, but good news...

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,970
Good news, you can always go back
to the exact time in which you left,

199
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,164
no matter how long you stay here.

200
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,321
Yeah.

201
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,770
Maybe it was Scudder or Dillon.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,651
They seemed a little different
than the last time I fought them.

203
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,802
I mean, look around you.
Everything's different.

204
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,047
<i>Except you.</i>

205
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,410
Maybe this means
we can get the team back together?

206
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,161
Why haven't you done that?

207
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,361
I've tried.

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,684
Believe me, I've tried.

209
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,327
But, you see, Caitlin's not the only thing
Killer Frost took.

210
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,971
No hands, no vibes.

211
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,206
Without my powers,

212
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,241
without you...

213
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,401
What happened?

214
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,125
What about everybody else?

215
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,289
Julian, Wally, Joe?

216
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,004
It's been a while, gentlemen.

217
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,726
Especially you, Flash.

218
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,000
More than you know.

219
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,321
Allen?

220
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,721
Yeah, it's me, Julian.

221
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,201
<i>From the past.</i>

222
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,285
2017.

223
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,930
2017.

224
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,685
The year it all began.

225
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,761
I'll assume you're here
for some answers, then, are you?

226
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,371
Something like that.

227
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,090
Well, you brought him
to the wrong place, mate.

228
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,886
I just want him to understand.

229
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,766
<i>Julian.</i>

230
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,846
Can I see her?

231
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,924
I tried to find her something more humane,

232
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,441
but this was the best I could do.

233
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,850
Caitlin, it's me.

234
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,644
Barry Allen.

235
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,288
- I'm...
<i>- From the past.</i>

236
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,481
<i>I can tell.</i>

237
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,087
There's no hate in your eyes...

238
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,327
Yet.

239
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,484
So to what do we owe
the pleasure of your visit?

240
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,163
Come to see how things turn out
for Team Flash?

241
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,610
I wanted to see what happened
to my friend.

242
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,846
I am not your friend, Flash.

243
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,249
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

244
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,210
- I should have saved you.
- I'm glad that you did this to me.

245
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,441
Caitlin wasn't.

246
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,166
I failed her,

247
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,728
but I won't when I go back.
I'm gonna find you,

248
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,446
<i>and I'm gonna help you.</i>

249
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,966
You're no match for the God of Speed.

250
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,282
You didn't tell him, did you?

251
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,081
<i>Well,</i>

252
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,126
secrets always were our thing,
weren't they?

253
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,963
When I became Killer Frost,

254
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,529
Savitar appeared to me
and showed me the way.

255
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,284
We made one hell of a team.

256
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,001
Why would you help him?

257
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,044
Because he gave me the thing
that you couldn't,

258
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,364
the cure to my illness.

259
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,211
Embracing who I really am.

260
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,166
You know who he is.

261
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,081
Who is he?

262
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,806
Tell me who he is.

263
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,890
I'll never tell.

264
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,602
You are gonna be so surprised
when you find out.

265
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,846
You know, I think your protégé
went toe-to-toe with Savitar.

266
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,011
<i>Maybe he can help you out.</i>

267
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,566
I need to see Wally.

268
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,766
Hello?

269
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,051
Hi, um, I'm looking for Wally West.

270
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,767
I recognize you from Joe's photos.

271
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,287
- You're Barry, right?
- Barry, yeah.

272
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,000
This is Cisco.

273
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,168
- Hey, Beth.
- Hey, Cisco.

274
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,169
I'm Beth. Come on in.

275
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,409
I'll be upstairs if you need anything,

276
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,491
and stay as long as you'd like.

277
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,251
We don't get very many visitors.

278
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,281
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

279
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,447
<i>I brought a friend.</i>

280
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,241
Wally.

281
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,920
Hey, it's me.

282
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,046
It's Barry.

283
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,561
Hey.

284
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,246
Can you hear me?

285
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,801
What happened to him?

286
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,451
Iris died,

287
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,931
and that sent him into this rage,

288
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,324
and he went after Savitar
by himself one night.

289
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,928
<i>Joe found him the next day</i>

290
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,560
with a shattered spine.

291
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,484
No one knows what he saw that night,
but whatever it was,

292
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,570
he's been like this ever since.

293
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,926
I'm so sorry.

294
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,401
- Listen, Barry, you and Joe...
- Where is he?

295
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,086
Well, he's not here,

296
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,449
which means there's only one other place
he can be.

297
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,520
Hey, Joe.

298
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,606
Why are you here, Barry?

299
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,804
I just wanted to see you.

300
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,045
Just wanted to see how you were doing.

301
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,526
Now you wanna know?

302
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,200
After all this time, now?

303
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,011
Uh, Joe, um...

304
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,966
I'm doing my best.

305
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,721
What happened to us?

306
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,247
My daughter's life was taken.

307
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,006
My son's.

308
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,570
<i>And then you left me, Barry.</i>

309
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,562
The last piece of who I was left,

310
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,843
<i>turned his back and ran away.</i>

311
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,886
I wasn't there for you?

312
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,241
Why start now?

313
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,085
I'm gonna need you to leave, Barry.

314
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,441
Please!

315
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,641
You promised.

316
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,642
You promised her
that you would be there for Joe.

317
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,806
You don't understand.

318
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,407
I don't understand what,
that you abandoned him?

319
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,651
That you abandoned him and everybody else?
You made a promise!

320
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,927
That I couldn't keep!

321
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,724
Not after everything I'd lost.
I was just as broken as Joe was!

322
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,291
- I don't care.
- You will!

323
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,721
You...

324
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,481
You Will.

325
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,764
You want answers, Barry?

326
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,766
How's this?

327
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,411
You will go back.

328
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,161
You will do everything
that you can think of to save her.

329
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,164
You're even gonna create time
remnants of yourself,

330
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,811
but he's gonna kill them all, mostly.

331
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,243
And then on the night of May 23rd,

332
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,522
Iris West will die in your arms.

333
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,290
- No.
- And in that moment,

334
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,369
when she takes her last breath,

335
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,764
it'll feel like an eternity.

336
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,205
And it will break you.

337
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,849
She's the love of your life, Barry.

338
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,807
She was the love of my life.

339
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,044
There'll be nothing left at all
but stopping Savitar.

340
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,564
So, no, you won't be there for Joe.

341
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,846
<i>You won't be there
when Caitlin becomes Killer Frost,</i>

342
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,044
<i>when Savitar destroys Wally.</i>

343
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,843
<i>You won't be there for any of them.</i>

344
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,409
But then, one day, you'll stop him.

345
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,881
You'll lock him
in the Speed Force forever.

346
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,205
But at that point,

347
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,651
he already won.

348
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,561
Because everything that you've ever loved
is gone,

349
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,760
<i>including you.</i>

350
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,410
Go home, Barry.

351
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,931
There's nothing for you here.

352
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,921
<i>Cisco,</i>

353
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,887
did you figure out what's keeping me here?
I need to go home.

354
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,531
What? You're leaving? Now?

355
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,250
He's... He's...

356
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,965
He's not gonna help me, man. He's broken.

357
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,931
And if Caitlin's working with Savitar,
I need to get back. I need...

358
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,931
Before she's lost to us forever.

359
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,202
But what about everyone else?
Don't you wanna help them?

360
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,606
I can't help them!

361
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,801
I should've known.

362
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,965
No matter what I do,

363
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,609
you're gonna abandon
the ones close to you.

364
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,964
Cisco, it's not like that. I just...
I can't stay here.

365
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,971
But you want me to.

366
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,640
To get the team back together.

367
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,322
It wasn't Mirror Master or Top
that did something to me. It was you,

368
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,081
wasn't it?

369
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,286
Yeah.

370
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,766
What did you do?

371
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,482
You know the resonance field you create
when you run?

372
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,000
This disrupts that.

373
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,083
I may not be able to use my powers,
but I still know something about tech.

374
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,841
Why would you keep me here?

375
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,886
Because I miss my friend.

376
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,281
Cis...

377
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,125
If you wanna go, I'm not gonna stop you.

378
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,569
I don't know why I expected you
to be the same Barry Allen I remember.

379
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,563
That guy still had some fight left in him.

380
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,647
You were right.

381
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,964
This isn't the future that I wanted.

382
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,040
I can't go back
knowing I let it stay like this.

383
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,891
You wanna help me try to fix it?

384
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,045
I thought you'd never ask.

385
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,285
Well, let's get the team back together.

386
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,527
Even H.R.

387
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,121
Continuing with the H.R.
Romance series,

388
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,647
<i>The Streak versus Mr. Reflecto.</i>

389
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,282
"Just as the villain was about to go in
for the fatal blow,."

390
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,121
"Florence felt strong hands
around her waist,"

391
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,165
"lifting her like she was a feather."

392
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,289
"She was whisked away,"

393
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,364
"the wind blowing through her hair"

394
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,007
"as her mystery hero
finally set Florence down"

395
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,004
"on a mountaintop."

396
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,565
I love that part! I was in the zone. Ah.

397
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,841
"She, uh..."

398
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,085
<i>"Florence"</i>

399
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,524
"was..." And the mountaintop.
Back to the mountaintop!

400
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,046
"I have to have you."

401
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,929
Okay. You know what? We, uh...

402
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,640
We should threesome... Do someone...

403
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,569
Something else, I think.

404
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,402
Julian. H.R. What the hell is going on?

405
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,326
I would like to know the very same thing.

406
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,722
I was about to check
one of the most important boxes

407
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,685
a man can check in his life!
And who brought us here?

408
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,041
I brought you all here.

409
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,921
Ah, it's you again.

410
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,321
Barr.

411
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,324
You... You look...

412
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,761
Young.

413
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,560
He's from the past, Detective.

414
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,649
<i>2017, to be precise.</i>

415
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,008
I knew something felt weird
in the cemetery.

416
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,049
You hadn't visited Iris in years.

417
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,406
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

418
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,209
Cisco told me, or showed me,

419
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,763
that you all haven't been a team
in a long time.

420
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,923
<i>And I know that I'm the reason for that.</i>

421
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,769
Iris' death shouldn't have driven me
away from you all. It...

422
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,929
I mean, it should've driven me closer.

423
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,931
<i>This isn't what she would want.</i>

424
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,888
But I'm here now to tell you that,
no matter what happens in the past,

425
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,005
I will not abandon you.

426
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,288
- What's that?
- It's the meta-human app.

427
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,124
Mirror Master and Top are at it again.

428
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,761
Let's get them.

429
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,483
Us? As in Team Flash?

430
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,685
Guys, we have a chance to put
some hope back into our lives.

431
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,000
And I...

432
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,281
I really need it right now,

433
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,451
<i>and I think you do, too.</i>

434
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,686
<i>So what do you say?</i>

435
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,164
You ready for Team Flash
to take down the bad guys again?

436
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,161
Team Flash.

437
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,961
Team Flash.

438
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,481
On three. One, two...

439
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,241
Thank you!

440
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,889
Baby, you're a rock star.

441
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,650
Just like to shine for my man.

442
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,681
Yeah, I don't know.

443
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,680
<i>It looks a little tacky from over here,</i>

444
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,805
but I am old-fashioned.

445
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,649
We told you to stay away, Flash.

446
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,845
Yeah, well, I try not to listen
to criminals, or stupid people.

447
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,971
You guys hearing me all right?

448
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,884
Yeah, Barr, I can hear you loud and clear.

449
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,531
Man, it's good to be back.

450
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,164
Well, that's... What the...
This is not...

451
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,329
- What... What are you doing?
- I just...

452
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,206
- I had a...
- What are you looking for?

453
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,925
I just... I found... Oh.

454
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,961
Now I'm ready.

455
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,011
Should've done as you were told, Flash.

456
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,330
It's two versus one.
Odds aren't in your favor.

457
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,801
I'll take that bet.

458
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,287
Give him a little ride, hon.

459
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,481
With pleasure.

460
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,411
Okay, that's new.

461
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,526
- He can't move.
- They're using their powers

462
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,165
- at the same time.
- What are we gonna do?

463
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,401
Can't he phase or something?

464
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,204
- That doesn't work on these guys.
- Well, what will?

465
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,521
Give me that thing in your hands.

466
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,446
The other thing.

467
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,926
That makes more sense.

468
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,129
I can rejigger this
to mimic the resonance fields

469
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,561
from Scudder's portals, make it
so Barry can manipulate the mirrors.

470
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,091
- But what about Top?
- This will also restore

471
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,611
whatever rarefaction affect she's causing.

472
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,847
Yes, Cisco, that's brilliant.

473
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,806
But without opening another breach,

474
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,769
how could we possibly get it
into his hands in time?

475
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,600
<i>I'll take it to him.</i>

476
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,208
I saw what you were doing
from the time vault.

477
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,529
You need help. Give it to me.

478
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,921
Go.

479
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,928
I thought it was about time
I did something.

480
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,969
Cisco made it.
Now her powers won't affect us,

481
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,085
and we can go anywhere he does.

482
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,407
Well, the odds seem pretty even now, huh?

483
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,729
Go. Go.

484
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,001
You mind?

485
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,647
Be my guest.

486
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,367
Got you.

487
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,405
<i>In a bizarre twist and the first sighting
in years, eyewitnesses claim</i>

488
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,087
<i>not one but two scarlet speedsters
were responsible</i>

489
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,810
<i>for apprehending Sam Scudder</i>

490
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,527
<i>and Rosalind Dillon,
aka Mirror Master and Top.</i>

491
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,806
<i>I'm sure I speak for all residents
of Central City when I say this.</i>

492
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,764
<i>Flash, if you're watching,</i>

493
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,571
<i>it's good to see you again.</i>

494
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,321
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

495
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,091
- Team Flash, back at it again.
- Yeah!

496
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,042
I think this was a good first step, Cisco,

497
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,049
but, yeah, we have a ways to go.

498
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,847
Especially me.

499
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,086
I heard what you said.

500
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,767
And you were right,

501
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,560
Iris wouldn't have wanted this.

502
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,202
<i>She would've wanted us to stay a family.</i>

503
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,805
<i>I broke that promise to her,</i>

504
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,527
to all of you.

505
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,331
You made me realize,
even though Savitar is gone,

506
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,205
I've still been letting him win.

507
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,686
<i>I was wrong to do that.</i>

508
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,250
And if you're all willing

509
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,325
to try to be a family again,

510
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,926
I think I can, too.

511
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,401
I don't know which...

512
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,205
Which one of you to hug first.

513
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,287
Him.

514
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,410
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm in.

515
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,370
H.R., what do you say?

516
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,722
Yeah, I got a lot of coffee tastings
and some book readings.

517
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,241
Lot of women left to charm, but I'm in.

518
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,487
You know what?

519
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,848
Free coffees for the gang at H.R. Jitters!

520
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,208
Maybe 10% off. On me, let's go!

521
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,961
Thank you.

522
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,887
Thank you.

523
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,491
I know how hard this must be.

524
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,449
No, you don't. Not yet.

525
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,087
That's the problem.

526
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,921
And neither of us can change
what's gonna happen.

527
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,968
I wish I could help you. Believe me, I do.

528
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,489
But you trapped Savitar
in the Speed Force.

529
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,841
Just tell me how you did it.

530
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,730
- I had help.
- Help from who?

531
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,440
A physicist. Her name is Tracy Brand.

532
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,844
She made the Speed Force trap for me.

533
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,491
Why wouldn't you tell me this before?

534
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,127
Because she didn't figure out
the technology until four years ago.

535
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,170
Four years after Iris died.

536
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,481
Mmm-hmm.

537
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,361
Hang on.

538
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,808
I don't know where she is...

539
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,849
and I don't understand anything
that's on here.

540
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,329
But that's got all her information on it.

541
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,486
Maybe when you go back,
you can find her, and...

542
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,402
I don't know,
she could decipher it for you.

543
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,569
I hope so.

544
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,121
But if not...

545
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,202
Just make some good memories with Iris.

546
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,002
Hold onto them as tight as you can.

547
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,447
Good luck.

548
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,971
Weird.
Feels just like <i>Back to the Future,</i>

549
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,168
which would make me Doc Brown.

550
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,089
You're not gonna give me
some kind of letter, are you?

551
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,246
No, I will not.

552
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,410
I'm gonna do something to fix that.

553
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,847
You're too good of a superhero
to lose those powers.

554
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,321
Hey. You know you're my BFF, right?

555
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,081
You, too, man.

556
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,046
Whoa.

557
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,327
Wait. Did you...

558
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,286
- Did it not work? Do we need to try again?
- No, I went. I'm back.

559
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,280
You're back?

560
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,691
I went to the future.

561
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,086
How far?

562
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,486
Eight years from now.

563
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,804
I needed to talk to myself
and find out who Savitar was.

564
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,967
Did you?

565
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,247
No.

566
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,965
But I got a lead, something we can use.

567
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,491
Something that'll help us stop him.

568
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,688
Right.
Did you learn anything about Caitlin?

569
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,210
She aligned herself with Savitar.

570
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,446
Why would she do that?

571
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,927
I don't know,

572
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,771
but we need to find her
before she's lost to us forever.

573
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,691
All right, I'll get to CCPD.

574
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,009
Yeah. And we'll...
We'll dive in here, right?

575
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,765
<i>Right, Team? Team Flash!</i>

576
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,807
On three.

577
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,048
Okay. Okay.

578
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,281
Joe.

579
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,047
I love you.

580
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,691
I love you, too.

581
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,081
You okay?

582
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,850
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

583
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,167
I just want you to know that,
no matter what happens,

584
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,010
I'm always gonna be there for you.

585
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,680
I know that, Barr.

586
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,361
I know.

587
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,561
Thank you.

588
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,523
What was that about?

589
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,088
I'm just keeping that promise
I made to you.

590
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,122
I've been waiting for you.

591
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,923
Fear not, my child.

592
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,602
I have come only
to offer you what you desire.

593
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,847
And what's that?

594
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,765
Salvation.

595
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,566
You wanna cure me?

596
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,723
Turn me back into Caitlin Snow?

597
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,127
No.

598
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,570
I want to make sure Caitlin never returns.

599
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,649
Why should I trust you?

600
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,210
What do you need me to do?

601
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:08,234
