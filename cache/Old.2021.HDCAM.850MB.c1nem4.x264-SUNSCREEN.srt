2
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:59,673
Somewhere on the edge of sleep

3
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:03,381
There is a taste of peace

4
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:07,965
Every night,
we dance in my dreams

5
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,923
But Cupid's an archer

6
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:14,881
His violent departure

7
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:17,965
Leaves us at the altar

8
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:21,465
Wounded, weak
and ready to bleed...

9
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,673
Sing it, girl.

10
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:26,298
Mom, now I can't.

11
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,006
Her spontaneity
has been stripped from her.

12
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,465
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,298
You have such a beautiful voice.

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,631
I can't wait to hear it
when you're older.

15
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,965
Will this place
have scuba diving?

16
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,506
How old does a child have to be
to do scuba diving?

17
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:41,381
I don't know, Trent.

18
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:42,840
I think you're a bit too young.

19
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,048
You're a baby.

20
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,548
You said five minutes.

21
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,840
Technically, it's been way,
way more than five minutes.

22
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,298
Are we close?

23
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,006
Stop wishing away this moment.

24
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:54,717
Look out the window.
Look how pretty it is.

25
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,675
Prisca.

26
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,465
Work stuff?

27
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,381
Yeah.

28
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,675
Lead by actions, Mom.

29
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,590
Wow.

30
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:19,175
This is much better than Cancún.

31
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,173
Mr. and Mrs. Capa,

32
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:31,465
welcome to our version
of paradise.

33
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:32,965
Wow.

34
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,467
Hello.

35
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,048
So, this is Madrid.
She'll take care of you.

36
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,798
From your food and beverage
preferences you selected,

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,215
we've made you cocktails
to welcome you.

38
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:47,840
Wow.

39
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,423
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:52,381
Look how big you guys are.

41
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:54,715
We have a drink fountain
for you two.

42
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,048
Can we go?

43
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,298
- Mm.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,842
Let's go. Let's go.

45
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:03,508
Can you believe
I found this online?

46
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:17,423
My favorite thing:

47
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:20,506
open 24 hours,
the candy station.

48
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:22,758
Oh, my God. Come on, Trent.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,592
Mix the vanilla
and strawberry in it.

50
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:34,215
Say hi, Trent.

51
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:35,631
Hi.

52
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,298
I'm Idlib.

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,340
My uncle's
the resort manager here.

54
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:41,673
He's Trent. I'm Maddox.

55
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:43,548
I can do a 1,000-piece
jigsaw puzzle,

56
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,215
which is a considerable
thing to do.

57
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:47,048
My dad and I put
clear glue on them

58
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,673
and hang them on my wall.

59
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:51,256
I collect conch shells.

60
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:53,258
I have 42 conch shells.

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,175
Amazing.

62
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,590
- Okay.
- I might need a little help with this.

63
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:01,300
Right, so you do
strawberry and vanilla?

64
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,423
Hi.

65
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:15,673
Thank you.

66
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,215
Yes. Ah, okay.

67
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:18,631
Okay, I got it.

68
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,923
Okay. Come on.

69
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,298
Thank you.

70
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,465
Great job helping.

71
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,008
Yes.

72
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:31,923
You!

73
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,631
I touched your jacket.
That counts.

74
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:34,965
Hey.

75
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,465
There's 250,000
furniture-related injuries

76
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,465
in the United States per year.

77
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:43,298
25% of those...
coffee table injuries.

78
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,506
Hey. Hey!

79
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:47,425
- Fine.
- Okay.

80
00:04:56,425 --> 00:05:00,381
Warren and Warren must be
affiliated with this resort.

81
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,425
They must have conventions here.

82
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:07,673
We love this
pharmaceutical company at work.

83
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,256
We're considering
asking our clients

84
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,715
to use Warren and Warren drugs

85
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:12,425
as a way to lower
their insurance rates.

86
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:16,717
Ah, hmm. Yeah.

87
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,340
"No kids allowed on the beach"?

88
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:23,048
What? Hold on.

89
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,340
"No Kids Week"?

90
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:26,006
- That's not true!
- It says no ki...

91
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,506
- Let me see that!
- Prisca, you should've checked.

92
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:28,840
- Let me see that!
- It's your mom's fault.

93
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:30,090
- Let me see!
- No, no, no, really.

94
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:31,548
- No, it says this. No.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

95
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,256
- She should've checked. It says this.
- Let me see!

96
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:34,715
- Yes, of course.
- Let me see!

97
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,256
I know this is very painful news

98
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:38,298
- for you all to bear, but now...
- Let me see!

99
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,298
- ...now I've gotten power.
- No!

100
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,006
Yes. And you have to do it.

101
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,506
Yes, you have to understand.

102
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:45,423
It's like this.
Life is like this.

103
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:48,508
It's tough, and sometimes things
don't go the way you want.

104
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,425
Oh, my gosh.

105
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:34,756
Come on. Blue team's winning.

106
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:36,467
Ah, good hit.

107
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,631
What's your name, and what
do you do for a living?

108
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,840
Hey, guys. I'm Annette.

109
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,465
And what's your name?

110
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,715
I'm Trent. This is Idlib.

111
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,673
Hey, nice to meet you.

112
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:47,048
- Bye.
- Bye.

113
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,592
Bye.

114
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,548
Hi. I'm Trent. This is Idlib.

115
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,965
What are your names, and what
do you do for a living?

116
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,840
Oh, well, I'm Sophia Watson.

117
00:06:57,842 --> 00:06:59,090
I'm a chef.

118
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:00,756
I'm Greg Mitchell. I'm a cop.

119
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:02,006
Cool.

120
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:03,298
And I'm Malin Mitchell.

121
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,756
I'm a dancer.

122
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,090
Wow. That's cool.

123
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,965
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

124
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,173
- Bye.
- Bye.

125
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:10,883
Hey, let's go over there.

126
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:26,717
Truth-telling game. Go.

127
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:29,550
I can't do a push-up. Go.

128
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,008
I don't have friends.

129
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,548
I'm your friend.

130
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,006
You'll leave.

131
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,840
My mom might let me
FaceTime you.

132
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:41,673
Then we can be friends.

133
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:44,590
You can come over to my house
and make up stories.

134
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:47,298
Then we can go
to the same college together

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,717
and become neighbors
with mortgages.

136
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:52,050
Cool.

137
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,758
It's weird.

138
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:01,090
I know.

139
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:04,048
It's hanging over me.
I can barely eat.

140
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,217
And I don't feel anything?

141
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,506
We agreed... we'd give them

142
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:12,923
one last vacation
before telling them.

143
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,381
I can't understand why

144
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,131
we don't take
into consideration...

145
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,133
That shouldn't affect anything.

146
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:22,256
The doctor said
it's a nonfactor.

147
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:24,592
It's probably been there
for years, he said.

148
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,590
We were on a course to separate.

149
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,215
That's confusing enough for us.

150
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:36,758
Let's not bring an irrelevant
medical condition into this.

151
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,965
Let's get through this, Guy.

152
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,090
Compartmentalize.

153
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:44,923
It's only for three days.

154
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,256
You found a place?

155
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,881
Yes.

156
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:49,967
Oh, Prisca, come on.

157
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,340
You're always thinking
about the future!

158
00:08:57,342 --> 00:09:00,131
It makes me feel not seen!

159
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,256
You're always thinking
about the past.

160
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,550
You work in a goddamn museum!

161
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,300
I think they stopped.

162
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,842
Why don't you play?

163
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,048
Good morning.

164
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,965
What would you like
for breakfast?

165
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,965
I'll have
the Calcium Bomb juice drink.

166
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,340
I have a calcium deficiency.

167
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,548
So, is it really calcium-rich
or just a catchy name?

168
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,798
It has all
calcium-rich vegetables, ma'am.

169
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,173
Sit up, Kara, honey.

170
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:51,590
- Okay.
- All right?

171
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:53,715
You don't want to be hunched
when you grow up, baby.

172
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,631
It's very unattractive.

173
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:58,215
Boys will get turned off.

174
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,425
Give me the Calcium Bomb juice.

175
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:05,508
And maybe you could
recommend one of these.

176
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:10,215
This one.

177
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:12,758
I recommend the granola parfait.

178
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,340
Um, it's a good choice.

179
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,548
Okay.

180
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,548
So, how is the Capa family?

181
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,631
Any plans today?

182
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,506
Well, one of our kids
wants to do Jet Ski,

183
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:26,840
- and the other one...
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:28,592
...wants to do
anything but that.

185
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:33,548
Well, there's, um...
there's a private beach

186
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,798
on the nature preserve side
of the island.

187
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,215
It's impossible to find.

188
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:39,006
It's surrounded
by stunning rocks,

189
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,923
- very unusual minerals.
- Oh.

190
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:43,631
Oh, it's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, so...

191
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,550
A natural anomaly.

192
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:49,465
I only recommend it
to certain guests.

193
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,548
But I liked you guys
immediately.

194
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,131
All right? You're a nice family.

195
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,340
So I-I could arrange
a van to take you, if...

196
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,548
Hmm. Yeah.

197
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,840
Sounds like
a great memory for us.

198
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:02,256
It's our little secret.

199
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:04,050
I'll make all the arrangements.

200
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,508
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

201
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:11,923
Okay, so I think we should get

202
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,715
the Calloway Kale-away
for Trent.

203
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,256
Idlib, what did I tell you

204
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:17,217
about being in here
when you shouldn't?

205
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,881
You can't... You know,
I told you so many times.

206
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,383
You know, we have certain...

207
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:34,256
I'm a doctor.

208
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:35,798
My wife has epilepsy.

209
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,881
I'm a nurse.

210
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:37,925
My name is Jarin.

211
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,673
Right, she's having
a grand mal seizure.

212
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:42,883
Keep things away
from her, please.

213
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,923
Patricia?

214
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,506
Doll?

215
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:51,006
All right, Jack,
I think if you just leave her

216
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,506
lying here for a while,
put something under her head,

217
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:53,590
I think she'll be fine.

218
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:54,881
Thank you, Doctor.

219
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:56,133
It's Jarin, by the way.

220
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:02,633
For my next act,
I'll spin my head around 360.

221
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,548
I'm sorry I ruined
everyone's breakfast.

222
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,467
You always want to be
the center of attention.

223
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:12,965
My goodness.

224
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,631
Let's get you
something to drink?

225
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,300
Yeah.

226
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,050
Idlib?

227
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:41,215
Oh, can't be
that secret of a beach.

228
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:42,756
We were told to keep it quiet.

229
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:44,465
- So were we.
- Sit down, Gustav.

230
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,298
Good boy.

231
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,592
Come. Stay.

232
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:54,131
Okay, guest checklist.

233
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,048
Books, sunscreen.

234
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,756
Did everybody leave
their passports in their safes?

235
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:00,465
I don't want anybody
to lose anything.

236
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:01,673
Yeah.

237
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,342
What are your names
and occupations?

238
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:39,548
Okay, my friends.

239
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,631
You can just call us,
and we'll pick you up

240
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,506
whenever you're ready
to come back.

241
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,465
Or I'll pick you up at 5:00 p.m.

242
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,840
Just follow the path
down to the beach.

243
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:50,423
- Is that also food?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:53,423
Wow. That's a lot of food.

245
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,381
Well, kids eat a lot of food.

246
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:57,090
And you got
three of them with you.

247
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:58,965
Okay.

248
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:01,592
Seems like a waste,
but thank you.

249
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:07,256
Could you help us carry
some of these bags, please?

250
00:15:07,258 --> 00:15:09,506
We've got an elderly person
here and a child.

251
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,423
I'm sorry. I got to get back.

252
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:13,256
But it's not far.
Just walk down.

253
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:14,965
You'll see a beautiful
slot canyon.

254
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,840
Walk through that, and in
a few minutes, you'll be there.

255
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:18,090
Enjoy, everybody.

256
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:20,131
- Do you think there's...
- Come on.

257
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,298
Do you think there's snakes?

258
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,381
Of course.

259
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:24,800
Cool. I want to see one.

260
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:30,258
- Gorgeous.
- Wow.

261
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,175
Okay.

262
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,256
You okay?

263
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:40,258
Yeah?

264
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,756
Could, uh,
someone please tell me

265
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,131
what just happened?

266
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,381
Look out.

267
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:04,798
Oh, this is so exciting.

268
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,133
Careful, Maddox.

269
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:18,550
- Let's go!
- I'm gonna win.

270
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:47,590
Wow.

271
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,133
I just got chills.

272
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:52,673
Come on, darling.

273
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,967
Let's show Gustav the sea.

274
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,840
Hey. Maddox, Maddox, look.

275
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:00,673
Listen, I...
Let's move somewhere else.

276
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:02,715
I think it's much nicer
closer to the water, right?

277
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,340
- No, but I...
- No, it's...

278
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:06,092
Look, it's beautiful.

279
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:21,883
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

280
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:28,967
They were right to send us.

281
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,300
Lie down.

282
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,925
Good boy.

283
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,881
Kids, look at
the beautiful coral.

284
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,131
I'm gonna get... Aah! Stop!

285
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,631
What are you going to do?

286
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,215
Now I'm gonna splash you.

287
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:46,131
Just keep on reading, I guess.

288
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,048
You just splashed me.

289
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,423
Stop!

290
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,673
I didn't mean to splash you.

291
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,925
- Guy?
- Yeah.

292
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,925
What book am I reading?

293
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,592
I don't know.

294
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,342
Why?

295
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:09,008
No reason.

296
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,883
Prisca, I wanted
to tell you something.

297
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,256
No, never mind.

298
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:24,967
I'll tell you later.

299
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:32,340
Oh, my God.

300
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:34,590
That's Mid-Sized Sedan.

301
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,298
What? Mid what?

302
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,798
He's a rapper.

303
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,465
"More Dough for the Cookin'"?

304
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,798
- Mid-Sized Sedan?
- Begin an activity.

305
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,506
- Dad, I have to. I have to!
- Yes. Okay.

306
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:44,756
You and Mom on one side.

307
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:45,965
No, no, no, no, no. Leave him.

308
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,256
Sounds like fun. Come on.

309
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:48,548
No, because it's, like,
a private, you know...

310
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,840
No, Dad, stop! I need to say hi.

311
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:51,048
He's on vacation.
He's on vacation.

312
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,092
What's his surname? Sedan?

313
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:58,256
Oh! Oh.

314
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,006
Whoa.

315
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,090
Whoa. All right.

316
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:03,131
Here's a big one. Aah!

317
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,967
Help me with this.

318
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:09,092
We should have
a housewarming party.

319
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,925
Isn't our house so beautiful?

320
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,798
- Boo!
- Aah! You!

321
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,633
- Come. Come back here!
- No!

322
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:32,590
Not gonna get me!

323
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:34,923
Kara, you know,
I'm gonna get you right now.

324
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,506
Come on.

325
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,340
- Not gonna get me!
- No, I am.

326
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:41,092
Come on, Kara.

327
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:44,215
Whoa! Oh, my God.

328
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,008
Caught you.

329
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:50,800
Ha. Never gonna catch me.

330
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,173
Honey, I'm home.

331
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:57,798
I told you,
I don't want to live like this.

332
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,881
I'm gonna live in a condominium.

333
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:02,175
I'm going for a drive
to calm down.

334
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:05,756
I'm really, really hungry.

335
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:08,465
Me, too. My stomach's growling.

336
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,092
Me, too.

337
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:27,340
Wow.

338
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,342
Who would leave this?

339
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:32,465
Hey, Mom!

340
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:34,381
From the hotel!

341
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:36,048
They're so rusted.

342
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,673
Put that down!

343
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:41,131
You can get infected
or you'll cut yourself.

344
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,881
Come away.

345
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:44,631
- Next activity.
- What's happening?

346
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,173
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
- I don't know.

347
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:48,300
They found stuff
from the hotel in the sand.

348
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:53,506
18, 19, 20.

349
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:55,967
- No fish.
- Ready or not, here we come!

350
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,133
Mom!

351
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,465
Mom! Mom!

352
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:21,050
Mom! Mom! Mom!

353
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,715
What is it? What is it?

354
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,381
- Trent?
- Someone over there.

355
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:28,675
Over where?

356
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,800
Come on, give me a hand.
Get the legs.

357
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:52,673
Make your list.

358
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:54,173
- Make your list.
- Okay.

359
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:55,715
- Red and orange.
- Red, orange.

360
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:57,548
Come away from here, babies.

361
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,298
Let the doctor try
and help this lady, yeah?

362
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,092
- Green.
- Green.

363
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,506
- Tan.
- Tan.

364
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:06,756
- Purple.
- Purple.

365
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,048
- What happened?
- It's okay.

366
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,090
- Blue.
- Blue. Blue is good.

367
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:11,590
- In there.
- Green.

368
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:12,798
- Green, yes.
- Yellow.

369
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,173
Yellow. I love yellow.

370
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:16,131
Call the police, right?

371
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:18,631
I'll get my mobile.

372
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,592
Oh, damn.

373
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:42,256
What happened to her, Mom?

374
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:43,883
I don't know.

375
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:47,258
- I'm still hungry.
- Me, too.

376
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:50,756
Was she with you?

377
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:52,715
I was waiting for her.

378
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:54,715
She swam out by herself.

379
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:58,298
Yo, I don't know
what the hell happened.

380
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,798
I ain't saying nothing else.

381
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,215
Did you strike him?

382
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:03,840
I don't need to know
the context of...

383
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,673
What? No. Of course not.

384
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,298
So why's your nose bleeding?

385
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,133
I told y'all, I ain't got
nothing to say to you.

386
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,592
My chest feels funny.

387
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:20,048
Well, you know,

388
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,798
we should've gotten a yacht,
like I suggested, Agnes.

389
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,798
You shouldn't have
fought me on that.

390
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,673
You see? Now we're mixed up
in some island issue.

391
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,300
I mean, I...

392
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:38,381
Mom, my swimsuit is hurting.

393
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,965
I have to take it off.

394
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,092
Well, just loosen your...

395
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,298
We're from Philadelphia.

396
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,631
I'm on a break here with
my wife and kids. That's them.

397
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:54,258
That... Well, yeah, over there.

398
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,548
And for the record, I know
most people who die on vacation

399
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,215
die from sun exposure,
overexertion,

400
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:05,881
overindulgence
of food or alcohol

401
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:09,090
or-or a mixture of all
of the above 99.4% of the time.

402
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:11,090
- How you know all this?
- I'm an actuary.

403
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,090
I calculate people's
insurance rates

404
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:15,092
based on their risk profile.

405
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:18,800
I ain't do nothing, man.

406
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:23,258
She was into me.

407
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,715
Somebody will figure this out.

408
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,173
We'll just have to wait
for them to get here.

409
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:34,256
No reception at all.

410
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:36,798
I guess our beach day's over.

411
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,092
You got to keep an eye
on him and the body.

412
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:45,673
Oh, my goodness.

413
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:47,425
Wow.

414
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:52,090
Did you just get
dropped off by the resort?

415
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:53,631
Yeah. We were supposed
to come earlier,

416
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:55,548
but we rested in the room first.

417
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,173
Great. We have to get
the resort people

418
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:58,590
before they leave.

419
00:24:58,592 --> 00:25:00,381
I think we will all
have to leave this beach.

420
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:01,631
Wait. Why?

421
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,923
They left already.

422
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:04,258
What happened?

423
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:18,173
We really don't know
what happened.

424
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:20,340
Well, I think this man had
something to do with it.

425
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:21,715
Man, if I was involved,

426
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:23,131
why would I be
standing around, bro?

427
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:24,673
- Damn.
- His nose is bleeding.

428
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:26,506
I think he got that when she
was trying to defend herself.

429
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:28,298
I don't like
this dynamic at all.

430
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,298
Yo, my nose has been bleeding
for hours, man.

431
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,298
I don't know why
it's doing that.

432
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,923
Charles, something's wrong
with your mother.

433
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:35,925
She's asking for you, honey.

434
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,798
Well, we're all in this now.

435
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,965
We are responsible
for that woman.

436
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:43,631
And I've got nothing
against this man.

437
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:46,590
I'm just doing
what needs to be done.

438
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:48,923
No cell phone reception
on this beach.

439
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:50,215
You stay here.

440
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,673
I'll go to the clearing
in the jungle

441
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,131
where they dropped us
and try to call.

442
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,006
They obviously have
a signal out here.

443
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:57,467
- How else do people call to go back?
- Right.

444
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,340
Oh, my God.

445
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,548
You stumbled back out.
You were holding your head.

446
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,465
You looked like
you were in pain, babe.

447
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,008
You blacked out.

448
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:27,133
I felt this pressure in my head.

449
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,425
Are you okay?

450
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,465
I'm fine, Charles.

451
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,883
I-I think it's the shock.

452
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,048
Try to help Gustav,
or he'll be sick.

453
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,590
Yeah, of course it's the shock.

454
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:42,881
Listen, I'm gonna get a van
to take us back to the resort,

455
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:45,256
but first, I've got to deal
with all this, all right?

456
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:46,881
Are you okay?

457
00:26:46,883 --> 00:26:48,506
Yeah.

458
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:50,798
I know you've been stressed.

459
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,381
Don't let this upset you.

460
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:55,800
Help these people
through this, Charles.

461
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:59,133
So, what did you hear?

462
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:03,090
Help these people
through this, Charles.

463
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:04,925
Excuse me.

464
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:09,840
Excuse me. I saw you were
talking to my husband.

465
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:12,548
I know you're dealing with a
lot with that woman right now,

466
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,548
but something is wrong
with my son.

467
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,465
- Some kind of reaction.
- Is... is it severe?

468
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,173
I don't have time for this.

469
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:20,006
What kind of doctor are you?

470
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:22,465
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon
and chief medical officer.

471
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,756
You don't know me.

472
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:27,756
I curate exhibits for museums.

473
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,965
I'm telling you this
because I want you to trust me

474
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,965
and not think I'm being
hysterical when I say

475
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,590
there's something very wrong
with my child.

476
00:27:34,592 --> 00:27:36,800
He seems fine to me.
He's playing with my daughter.

477
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:40,048
You look different, too.

478
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,798
How?

479
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,631
Uh, I don't know.

480
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,467
You just look different.

481
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:48,465
Hold my hand.

482
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,342
Okay.

483
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:54,173
Willow.

484
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:57,131
Japanese maple. Evergreen.

485
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,300
If you get scared,
just tell me, okay?

486
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:02,798
What do you keep looking at?

487
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
- There.
- Where?

488
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:09,173
Way, way up there
on the side of the hillside.

489
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:10,798
What do you see?

490
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,340
I thought I saw
something shiny.

491
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:14,758
Here comes Mom.

492
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:21,798
Charles, she stopped breathing!

493
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
She stopped breathing!

494
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:27,965
I didn't do anything, Charles.

495
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,090
You guys just...
you just walked away,

496
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:32,465
and she just stopped breathing
all of a sudden.

497
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,131
She... I mean, she was peaceful.

498
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,381
Can you step back, please?

499
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,590
We'll take the kids
away from here.

500
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,550
Is this happening?

501
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,550
She couldn't take the shock.

502
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:59,008
She-she saw a murdered woman,
and her heart couldn't take it.

503
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,590
What are your names
and occupations?

504
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,965
I'm Jarin. I'm a nurse.

505
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,506
I'm Patricia.
I'm a psychologist.

506
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:09,423
He remembers everyone's names

507
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:11,798
and things about them.

508
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,923
Everything's gonna be okay.

509
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,590
What's your name?

510
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,173
I'm Trent.

511
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,840
This is my sister Maddox.

512
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,506
How old are you guys?

513
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,506
I'll guess. I'm good at this.

514
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,715
You're 11, right, Trent?

515
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,923
I'm six.

516
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:29,465
No.

517
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,506
Really, are you ten, 11?

518
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:34,256
He's not lying. He's six.

519
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:37,506
I'm specifically
six and a quarter.

520
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:39,798
She's 11.

521
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,131
They're feeling unsafe.
There is a lot going on here.

522
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:44,965
They're playing with us.

523
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,590
Let's leave it.

524
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:49,590
Okay, what's
your best friend's name?

525
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:51,423
Maddox.

526
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:53,298
How sweet.

527
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,342
Have you seen my children?

528
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:59,298
Is-is everyone trying
to play a joke on us?

529
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,881
- What?
- Aren't these your children?

530
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,883
I'm right here, Mom.

531
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:08,133
Mom?

532
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:10,717
Mom.

533
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:20,925
Why are you looking
at me like that?

534
00:30:30,925 --> 00:30:33,506
Prisca.

535
00:30:33,508 --> 00:30:35,673
I think we should leave.

536
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:37,673
Get the kids back to the resort.

537
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:39,342
Guy.

538
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:59,008
- Maddox?
- Yeah. Dad, it's me.

539
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:04,425
What's going on?

540
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,925
You see? You see?

541
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:12,173
Damn.

542
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:15,423
- How'd we get here?
- Take it easy.

543
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:17,256
Intense cranial pressure.

544
00:32:17,258 --> 00:32:19,258
It's like being deep underwater.

545
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:24,133
Hey, can you get up?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy.

546
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:27,965
Charles?

547
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,506
- Yeah, no, I'm-I'm all right.
- You okay?

548
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:30,798
I'm fine. I'm all good.

549
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,881
We're leaving right now,
and we're taking our kids.

550
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:35,756
For some reason, people are
blacking out going this way.

551
00:32:35,758 --> 00:32:37,590
Three people
have blacked out now.

552
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,048
- That's ridiculous. Come, move.
- No, no, no.

553
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,881
I saw it, Prisca.
I saw Jarin black out.

554
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:44,548
What I know is that we have to
get these kids to a hospital.

555
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,423
Now.

556
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,548
Look, let's stop
talking about it.

557
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,381
The kids are scared.

558
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:53,881
I can stay here with them,
but everyone else should try

559
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:57,340
and find a different pathway
off this beach.

560
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,340
Break off into groups of two

561
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:01,300
in case people black out.

562
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,758
Chrystal, go with me.

563
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,173
Whoa.

564
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:24,673
Whatever you do,
just stay close.

565
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:27,256
- I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.
- Just... Hmm?

566
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:28,798
Don't get up too quickly.

567
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,256
Kids, let Mom and Dad talk
for a second.

568
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:34,090
No. Mom, we're scared.

569
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:37,006
Please, stay right here.

570
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:38,467
Okay?

571
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:41,298
If I cry,
please don't let them see.

572
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,590
I won't.

573
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:43,756
Your hands are shaking.

574
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,090
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

575
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:47,092
- Yeah, they are.
- Yeah. You okay?

576
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:50,965
We're on a beach
with two unrelated dead bodies.

577
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,090
That is just
statistically impossible.

578
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:55,006
All three kids are reacting
to something.

579
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:56,590
Only the kids.

580
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:58,717
I mean, look at
the doctor's daughter.

581
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:03,048
The kids are reacting
to something they ate.

582
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,423
Or they caught something.

583
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:08,090
We're on a remote,
undeveloped island,

584
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:11,131
but we have a doctor here, so...

585
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,342
let's get the doc
to look at the kids.

586
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,756
I still can't get any reception.

587
00:34:23,758 --> 00:34:26,423
Doctor, before we do
anything else,

588
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:28,467
can you take a look
at our children, please?

589
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,008
He's got a knife!

590
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,506
There's a damn hole in my cheek.

591
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,131
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

592
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,173
Put that down right now, Doctor.

593
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:42,175
Watch out, Jarin.

594
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,965
Listen, I don't know
why I did that.

595
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:48,006
I thought he was
gonna hurt me. Sorry.

596
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:49,215
Sorry.

597
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:51,215
- What's he talking about, "sorry"?
- Okay.

598
00:34:51,217 --> 00:34:53,465
- Let me see that laceration.
- Man, that's assault, man!

599
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,923
- Just-just...
- Calm down.

600
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:58,506
What's your name?

601
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:00,342
Mid-Sized Sedan.

602
00:35:02,425 --> 00:35:04,090
I must be in shock. I'm numb.

603
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:05,881
I'm not feeling
the pain no more.

604
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:08,133
Please, let me see.

605
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,881
No, this is not making
any sense, Prisca.

606
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:20,133
I need to get my ass
to a hospital now.

607
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,758
What's with all y'all faces?

608
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,633
It's hard to explain.

609
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:32,631
This is messed-up, man.

610
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,173
Where'd it go?

611
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,173
This is some kind
of parlor trick.

612
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,465
Yo, I know I tried to dip,

613
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:40,800
but I am freaked, man.

614
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:44,048
I just want to go back
to my hotel room.

615
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,173
This was supposed to be
a zen trip, man.

616
00:35:47,175 --> 00:35:48,923
She and I only started talking

617
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:50,715
because she was sick
and so am I.

618
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:52,590
She had just been
diagnosed with MS,

619
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:54,298
so we started rapping
about that.

620
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,506
I didn't do nothing
to that girl, man.

621
00:35:57,508 --> 00:35:59,965
She was like Michael Phelps
swimming out there,

622
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:01,423
backstroking and whatnot.

623
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,048
She swam way the hell out.

624
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,631
What did you say?

625
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,631
No, I-I-I don't know, man.
Maybe it was butterfly stroke.

626
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,173
I don't watch
the Summer Olympics like that.

627
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:09,590
You came vacationing here
because you were sick,

628
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:10,756
- and so did she?
- Yes.

629
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:12,215
I thought that was
a cool coincidence.

630
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:14,798
Maybe this is some kind
of group psychosis.

631
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,423
I've studied this.

632
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:19,173
We're all emotionally shaky
from our lives.

633
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:22,508
We don't believe
we can leave this beach.

634
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:29,006
Mom, is there any more food?

635
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:30,381
I'm still hungry.

636
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:32,256
Well, she's definitely aged.

637
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:34,256
Honey, how can you
still be hungry? We just...

638
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,631
I'd put her biological age

639
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:37,173
somewhere between 12 and 13,

640
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:39,923
and she turned six
two weeks ago Tuesday.

641
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:42,215
What?

642
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:43,842
We're older?

643
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:47,090
Am I okay?

644
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,715
I don't know what's happening

645
00:36:48,717 --> 00:36:50,590
to the three of you, sweetheart.

646
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:52,798
For now, I have
another swimsuit in my bag,

647
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,173
and maybe you should
change into that.

648
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:58,048
Uh, it might be a virus, maybe.

649
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,798
Could be mosquitoes where...

650
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,840
the way they behave
on this part of the island.

651
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:04,590
Something's happening to her
that's triggering her hormones.

652
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:06,590
- The dog has died!
- Oh, my God.

653
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,756
Oh, my God.

654
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:10,256
He was only just alive.

655
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:11,673
Kara, hold on to me, baby.

656
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:13,298
What's happening?

657
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,381
Who thinks they can swim

658
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:19,881
a hundred lengths of a pool
against currents

659
00:37:19,883 --> 00:37:22,840
and then turn and swim
an unknown amount

660
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:25,131
along the coast
till we find another shore?

661
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,548
That's what I'm guessing
the distance is

662
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,550
to swim out
and get around this cove.

663
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,215
It looks too far, babe.

664
00:37:44,217 --> 00:37:46,506
It's not safe.

665
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:48,506
My name is Brendon.

666
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:51,006
I went to private school,
my mom is an attorney,

667
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:53,548
and my dad is a dentist.

668
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,298
- Yo, I just wanted somebody to know that.
- Okay.

669
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,298
I have a problem with my blood.

670
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,215
A rare issue with its clotting.

671
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:02,631
I came to this island
to see the ocean

672
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:06,715
and remember I'm connected
to something bigger.

673
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,840
That's beautiful, Brendon.

674
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:11,465
I don't feel the same way

675
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:13,173
I felt yesterday
or this morning,

676
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:15,592
and I don't think
my parents would understand.

677
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,883
My thoughts have
more colors in them now.

678
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,340
Yesterday, I had a few colors
and they were really strong,

679
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,798
and now I have more
and they're quieter.

680
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,133
Okay!

681
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:31,215
Everyone, gather!

682
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:33,298
Come on, come on, come on.

683
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,048
Everyone needs to have
a voice here.

684
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,173
Are you sure
we have time for this?

685
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:39,715
We will make
destructive decisions

686
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,340
if we don't feel safe
with each other.

687
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:43,173
I know we don't have time,
but...

688
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:45,381
why don't we start with you two?

689
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:47,300
Why are you here?

690
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,673
We've been having
a tough time...

691
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:53,256
Chrystal.

692
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:54,881
W-We've been going
through something.

693
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:56,715
He's under a lot of stress
as a doctor.

694
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:58,506
- He needed some time away.
- Everyone does.

695
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,506
- I'm not unusual in that.
- Charles, it's okay.

696
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:02,298
I'm not gonna say anything else.

697
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,756
Good!

698
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,756
It's nice to hear from you both.

699
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:07,717
How about you guys?

700
00:39:11,508 --> 00:39:12,923
Prisca?

701
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:14,798
It's nothing.

702
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,256
We just have to make a decision.

703
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:19,381
The kids are reacting
to something.

704
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:22,217
It's a virus.
It's-it's probably a virus.

705
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:25,465
I just need to catch my breath.

706
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,506
I just started feeling weird
a minute ago.

707
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:28,923
Are you okay, Mom?

708
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:30,506
- Mom?
- What's wrong?

709
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:32,215
- Um...
- Are you okay, Mom?

710
00:39:32,217 --> 00:39:33,798
I don't think it's the...

711
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,715
- She has a tumor.
- What?

712
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:37,715
But it's benign. It...
They said it's benign.

713
00:39:37,717 --> 00:39:39,758
- Oh, my God.
- Mom...

714
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:43,715
- Wow. Um...
- Is it... Where?

715
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:44,881
Mom?

716
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,090
It's okay.

717
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,590
Can I...

718
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,798
I can feel it.
It's the size of a golf ball.

719
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,173
No, it's supposed
to be three centimeters.

720
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:54,048
All right. Let-let me see.

721
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,381
- Whoa, whoa.
- Mom!

722
00:39:55,383 --> 00:39:56,673
- Prisca.
- She's gonna faint.

723
00:39:56,675 --> 00:39:58,548
- She's gonna faint.
- Wait. - Prisca. - Mom. Mom!

724
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,258
Wake up, Pris. Don't do this.

725
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:05,923
It's there.

726
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:08,548
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.

727
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,465
Jesus.

728
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:11,881
- It's grown.
- What?

729
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:13,756
- What's happening to Mom?
- It's okay.

730
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:15,548
- Trent, it's okay. It's okay.
- Dad.

731
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,548
- What's happening to Mom?
- Trent, why don't you two guys

732
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,256
go play somewhere else
on the beach, okay?

733
00:40:19,258 --> 00:40:20,923
Okay?
Mom's just a little bit tired.

734
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:22,548
Would you do that for me, tiger?

735
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,965
The first adult's
being affected.

736
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,590
Okay, what if we cut it out?

737
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:27,090
- Dad!
- Not possible.

738
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,506
Actually, it is.

739
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:30,006
- But it's Guy's call.
- No!

740
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,381
No, no, no. No.

741
00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:33,131
I don't want to make
this decision. No.

742
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:35,340
No, I...

743
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,383
I don't know what to do.

744
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,298
- Do we have alcohol?
- Yes.

745
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,298
Some bottles from the minibar.

746
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,840
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand that, right?

747
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:49,840
Yes.

748
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:52,173
Okay. Well, I mean, does anyone
have a needle and thread?

749
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:53,798
We're gonna have to sew this up.

750
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,423
Um, yeah, yeah. Uh...

751
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:57,173
Here. Here.
Is this the right decision?

752
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:58,590
Maybe we should all
talk about this.

753
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,590
I can't think.

754
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,300
This tumor is going to kill her.

755
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:10,756
Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?

756
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:11,925
Oh, no.

757
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,298
What is he saying?

758
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,756
Wh-What was the name
of that film?

759
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:17,340
- Charles, breathe.
- Are you okay?

760
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:18,506
Yes.

761
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:20,340
Will you just let me
do my job, please?

762
00:41:20,342 --> 00:41:21,675
Is he okay?

763
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:44,923
Cut her again.

764
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:47,298
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.

765
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,381
Guy, I can help, brother.

766
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:51,131
No. No, I'll take care of her.

767
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,756
Does anyone know
the name of that film?

768
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:55,173
It was with Jack Nicholson...

769
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:57,381
and Marlon Brando.

770
00:41:57,383 --> 00:41:58,798
Both!

771
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,340
Try again, Doctor.

772
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:02,548
Oblique incision
on the side of the belly.

773
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,342
Four to six inches.
You can do this.

774
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:09,298
Put your fingers
inside the incision.

775
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,923
Okay.

776
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:12,842
Can you open it
a little wider, please?

777
00:42:13,883 --> 00:42:15,715
It's closing around my fingers.

778
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:17,423
Keep pulling it apart.

779
00:42:17,425 --> 00:42:19,006
That's it.

780
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:21,590
I'm lifting the tumor out.

781
00:42:21,592 --> 00:42:23,256
Wow!

782
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:24,881
It's the size of a cantaloupe.

783
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,673
W-Wait.

784
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:29,006
It's attached to something.

785
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:30,215
Muscle tissue.

786
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,798
Okay. You, um,

787
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,675
hold the incision open
a little wider, if you would.

788
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,548
I'm so sorry, Pris.

789
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,967
Just cutting
underneath the tumor.

790
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,425
Okay. Got it.

791
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,092
Mom.

792
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:00,883
Prisca?

793
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:03,633
Mom?

794
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:21,715
It's okay.

795
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:23,550
I just fainted.

796
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,381
We took the tumor out.

797
00:43:27,383 --> 00:43:29,342
It was going to kill you.

798
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:33,967
Your husband made
a fast decision.

799
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:47,425
Guy, I feel better.

800
00:44:07,883 --> 00:44:09,675
Damn.

801
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,092
Come on, y'all, look at this!

802
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,675
Hurry!

803
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,673
Damn.

804
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:23,675
Come on, y'all.

805
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:34,506
Can we all agree
I didn't do that?

806
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:36,131
What happened to her?

807
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,465
The body has decomposed.

808
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,798
- How quickly can that happen?
- A long time.

809
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,423
Mom knows this stuff.

810
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:44,756
I'm not a forensic pathologist,

811
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:47,298
but from excavations
for the museum,

812
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,548
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.

813
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,548
My best guess... an exposed body,

814
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,756
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.

815
00:44:57,758 --> 00:44:59,756
And this happened in what,
three hours?

816
00:44:59,758 --> 00:45:01,173
I know.

817
00:45:01,175 --> 00:45:03,131
And bones, we found,
will disintegrate

818
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,090
in 30 years more.

819
00:45:05,092 --> 00:45:06,840
The hell, man?

820
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:08,881
On this beach, less than
20 hours after you die,

821
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:10,467
you just return to dust.

822
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,131
What exactly are we saying?

823
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:15,256
Something is going on
with time on this beach.

824
00:45:15,258 --> 00:45:16,800
Time?

825
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:24,592
You have wrinkles.

826
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:39,800
I'm scared.

827
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:47,506
It's best to focus
on specifics in the present

828
00:45:47,508 --> 00:45:49,340
in unsettling situations.

829
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:50,590
Mm-hmm.

830
00:45:50,592 --> 00:45:51,800
Like breathing.

831
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,840
What's happening to us?

832
00:45:55,842 --> 00:45:57,423
Are we sick, too?

833
00:45:57,425 --> 00:45:58,923
No, I don't think so.

834
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:01,381
I think we're just growing.

835
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,840
Going by Trent and Maddox's ages

836
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:05,840
and the time we spent
on this beach,

837
00:46:05,842 --> 00:46:08,340
half an hour is equivalent

838
00:46:08,342 --> 00:46:11,090
to something like one year
of our lives.

839
00:46:11,092 --> 00:46:12,756
This must be true for all of us.

840
00:46:12,758 --> 00:46:14,673
We just don't see it
on everyone.

841
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:16,298
You know, it's the first time

842
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,923
- they wished they were Black.
- Mm-hmm.

843
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:20,506
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.

844
00:46:20,508 --> 00:46:24,506
They need to grow an enormous
amount of mass quickly.

845
00:46:24,508 --> 00:46:26,673
We're staying roughly
the same mass.

846
00:46:26,675 --> 00:46:28,715
Our cells are just aging.

847
00:46:28,717 --> 00:46:31,131
I don't feel the same.

848
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:34,090
It's like my mind
is changing, too.

849
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:37,133
I'm getting many thoughts
at the same time.

850
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:39,842
It's weird.

851
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:46,342
I'm not as scared about
what's happening to us.

852
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:49,465
What about our hair and nails?

853
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:52,215
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?

854
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:54,631
Maybe it has to do
with the fact that the cells

855
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:56,590
in hair and nails are dead

856
00:46:56,592 --> 00:46:59,048
and they aren't reacting
in the same way.

857
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,423
On this beach,
60 minutes is two years.

858
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:06,715
We'll age almost 50 years
in one day here.

859
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:09,342
Almost a lifetime.

860
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,800
I think it could be the
rock that surrounds this beach.

861
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:18,881
If our cells are being affected,

862
00:47:18,883 --> 00:47:22,465
speeding up in their processes,

863
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:25,298
then us trying to leave is like

864
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,090
swimming to the surface too fast
after being deep in the ocean.

865
00:47:29,092 --> 00:47:31,965
Our bodies can't reacclimate.

866
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:34,800
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.

867
00:47:36,383 --> 00:47:38,590
Maybe...

868
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:42,215
we could slowly walk
through the canyon.

869
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,340
Take a step, stand still.

870
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:49,340
Do it over eight to ten hours.

871
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:51,342
Let our bodies acclimate.

872
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:55,590
But according to
Prisca's timeline,

873
00:47:55,592 --> 00:47:58,381
who would be willing to give up
20 years of their life trying?

874
00:47:58,383 --> 00:48:00,340
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.

875
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:02,550
Let's not shut down
everyone's experience.

876
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:05,050
Wait. Where are the kids?

877
00:48:09,008 --> 00:48:10,298
Trent!

878
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,631
Kara!

879
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:13,923
Answer us now!

880
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,256
We need you here!

881
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:16,550
There they are.

882
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,758
- Want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

883
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:22,381
Hey.

884
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:24,258
Mom! Dad!

885
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,215
Kara?

886
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:45,131
What did you do?

887
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:46,965
We were just playing. It's okay.

888
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:48,340
I just got a little fat.

889
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:49,717
Mom, you're better.

890
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,548
Maddox?

891
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,965
Maddox.

892
00:49:54,967 --> 00:49:56,258
It's okay, Trent.

893
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,133
Just let Mom and Dad
figure this out.

894
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:05,423
My God, Guy.

895
00:50:05,425 --> 00:50:07,173
It's okay, right, Mom?

896
00:50:07,175 --> 00:50:11,173
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando

897
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,798
were in a movie together.

898
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,256
If she walked into
the emergency room,

899
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:19,048
I'd say she's about
five months pregnant.

900
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,631
- What?
- What?

901
00:50:20,633 --> 00:50:22,381
Just stay calm, Trent.

902
00:50:22,383 --> 00:50:24,923
She'll only be pregnant
for about 20 minutes

903
00:50:24,925 --> 00:50:26,590
from the time of conception.

904
00:50:26,592 --> 00:50:27,965
Why do you keep looking at me

905
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,340
like you want
to steal my wallet?

906
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:31,006
Do you want me
to punch you in the face?

907
00:50:31,008 --> 00:50:32,215
Calm down.

908
00:50:32,217 --> 00:50:33,840
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

909
00:50:33,842 --> 00:50:36,840
All right.
Let's just concentrate

910
00:50:36,842 --> 00:50:38,798
on the issue at hand.

911
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,256
Do you know about movies?

912
00:50:40,258 --> 00:50:42,548
Dad, Mom tells you to sit down
when you get like this.

913
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,631
Okay, we need to get her help.

914
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:46,590
Okay? This cannot happen here.

915
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:48,131
- It's gotten bigger.
- Kara.

916
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:50,173
- It's Kara, right?
- Yeah.

917
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,423
- Lay down on a blanket.
- It's gonna be okay.

918
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:54,423
There's a lot of people here
that can help you.

919
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:55,965
We're all like your family now.

920
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:58,590
Oh, God.

921
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:00,631
Our cells are aging
very fast here.

922
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:02,881
Something to do with the rocks
around the beach, we think.

923
00:51:02,883 --> 00:51:04,506
Just lay down on the sand. Okay.

924
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:05,965
Whatever would have
happened to us

925
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:07,590
is happening to us really fast.

926
00:51:07,592 --> 00:51:09,090
Okay.

927
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:10,673
What you did is
how babies are made.

928
00:51:10,675 --> 00:51:12,465
I know, but I thought
you had to do that

929
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:14,340
ten times or something.

930
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:16,090
Did I get that wrong?

931
00:51:16,092 --> 00:51:18,342
Look, it can happen
after only once.

932
00:51:20,008 --> 00:51:22,006
We didn't get a chance
to talk about all this.

933
00:51:22,008 --> 00:51:24,048
Are Trent and I having a baby?

934
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,590
Did I get it wrong?

935
00:51:25,592 --> 00:51:28,006
Only a couple
of minutes left if we're right.

936
00:51:28,008 --> 00:51:30,006
- Is that the baby?
- You got it. Okay.

937
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:31,548
- Mom.
- Charles!

938
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,006
- Kara?
- I...

939
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:34,465
I need to think about
what to do.

940
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,590
- Mom, I think I...
- No. I need to help her.

941
00:51:36,592 --> 00:51:37,798
Mom!

942
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,131
- I'm scared!
- It's okay.

943
00:51:39,133 --> 00:51:40,798
- Kara. - Wait.
- Mom, it's coming.

944
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,215
Stay with me. Stay with me.

945
00:51:42,217 --> 00:51:43,798
Come on, baby.

946
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,840
- Can you hold her hand? Kara?
- I've decided...

947
00:51:45,842 --> 00:51:48,256
I'm gonna marry her, and we are
never gonna yell at each other,

948
00:51:48,258 --> 00:51:50,006
and we are never
getting divorced!

949
00:51:50,008 --> 00:51:52,215
Trent, listen to me.
She's going to feel pain.

950
00:51:52,217 --> 00:51:54,215
Intense pain. Okay?

951
00:51:54,217 --> 00:51:55,923
Like she never felt before.

952
00:51:55,925 --> 00:51:57,798
But then it's going to pass.

953
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,175
Okay? It's going to pass.

954
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:04,923
Chrystal.

955
00:52:04,925 --> 00:52:07,506
Chrystal!

956
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:09,715
Hey, you blacked out.

957
00:52:09,717 --> 00:52:12,256
You can't go that way.

958
00:52:12,258 --> 00:52:14,090
Come on. You're okay now.

959
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:15,798
Come on.

960
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,215
Get up.

961
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,881
Come here.

962
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:20,800
Look.

963
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:28,173
You're okay. Come on. Come on.

964
00:52:28,175 --> 00:52:30,215
- Babies crying helps them breathe.
- It's here.

965
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:32,092
We looked that up,
remember, Mom?

966
00:52:43,842 --> 00:52:46,131
We put him
on the towel to clean him up.

967
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:49,715
He looked around
and closed his eyes.

968
00:52:49,717 --> 00:52:52,756
We had him on the towel
for one minute.

969
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:54,756
He died from lack of attention.

970
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:56,756
Things are moving too fast here

971
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,923
for a baby to survive.

972
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,048
No. No, you're lying.

973
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,590
You're lying! You're all lying!

974
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:04,590
- Trent. Shut up, Trent!
- You're lying! You're lying!

975
00:53:04,592 --> 00:53:07,217
- You're lying!
- Hey, hey, hey.

976
00:53:09,175 --> 00:53:12,383
Maybe we should all talk
about what just happened.

977
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:16,881
Charles.

978
00:53:16,883 --> 00:53:18,715
- Get us out of here!
- It's my baby.

979
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:20,465
Get us out of here now!

980
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:22,506
You were supposed to protect us!

981
00:53:22,508 --> 00:53:24,715
You didn't protect us!

982
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:27,340
Kara's hurt!

983
00:53:27,342 --> 00:53:29,631
I will make these decisions.

984
00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:31,508
Just give me a second.

985
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:37,965
I used to see you
in our neighborhood.

986
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:39,675
Who... who are you?

987
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,008
I'm Jarin!

988
00:53:44,717 --> 00:53:46,842
I-I don't know where you live.

989
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:51,633
Don't condescend to me.

990
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,925
Put some makeup on your face.

991
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:18,217
I'm sorry about the baby.

992
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:23,217
When I was your age,
I was in love with a man.

993
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:27,133
His name was Giuseppe.

994
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,342
He wasn't very handsome,
and I left him.

995
00:54:32,758 --> 00:54:35,925
We looked silly together,
he and I.

996
00:54:45,217 --> 00:54:47,092
He had nothing to offer.

997
00:54:49,967 --> 00:54:52,842
For some reason,
I think about him a lot here.

998
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,258
Leave me alone.

999
00:55:16,883 --> 00:55:19,548
Charles, stop!

1000
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,258
Stop! Stop!

1001
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,756
He's gone.

1002
00:55:34,758 --> 00:55:36,508
Oh, God.

1003
00:55:47,175 --> 00:55:49,758
Bring your bag. Okay, come here.

1004
00:56:00,508 --> 00:56:03,008
I'm just going to take it...

1005
00:56:08,008 --> 00:56:10,048
- ...now.
- It's okay.

1006
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,508
Everything will be okay.

1007
00:56:31,175 --> 00:56:33,758
I'll find another beach,
and I'll try to find help.

1008
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:37,131
She needs her medicine.

1009
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:38,965
We're lucky she hasn't
had a seizure yet.

1010
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,758
It must be the beach,
whatever it's doing to my body.

1011
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:45,508
Guy, I was on the swim team.
I'll make it.

1012
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,050
I'll make it.

1013
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:57,050
Watch him.

1014
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,425
Maybe I could climb that rock.

1015
00:57:17,592 --> 00:57:19,715
Maybe the effect,
the blacking out,

1016
00:57:19,717 --> 00:57:22,006
doesn't happen if you go up.

1017
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:24,090
You can't do it.

1018
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:26,006
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, he's strong.

1019
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:27,840
- He can do it. He can do it.
- Yeah.

1020
00:57:27,842 --> 00:57:30,298
No. I won't allow
my son to do that.

1021
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,965
Prisca's right.
It's too dangerous.

1022
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:33,673
It's a last resort.

1023
00:57:33,675 --> 00:57:36,465
Mom...

1024
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:40,840
I do feel overwhelmed.

1025
00:57:40,842 --> 00:57:45,217
I'm managing,
but no one must know.

1026
00:57:47,675 --> 00:57:50,756
They'll try to stop me
from working.

1027
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,465
What should I do?

1028
00:57:53,467 --> 00:57:56,050
Mom, tell me what to do.

1029
00:57:57,883 --> 00:58:01,131
Prisca,
something's bothering me.

1030
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:04,715
Charles' family knew he had
some kind of mental disorder.

1031
00:58:04,717 --> 00:58:07,631
Someone in each group was sick.

1032
00:58:07,633 --> 00:58:09,631
How did you first hear
about this place?

1033
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:12,131
I don't know. I-I fell upon it.

1034
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,756
A random sweepstakes.

1035
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:16,090
It came with a receipt
at the pharmacy.

1036
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,923
I just followed it up online,
started getting emails.

1037
00:58:18,925 --> 00:58:20,756
They know our medical condition.

1038
00:58:20,758 --> 00:58:22,715
They chose us.

1039
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:24,381
They have our passports.

1040
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,173
We could just disappear.

1041
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,631
They sent us a special car
to the airport.

1042
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:30,423
- A plane.
- They can...

1043
00:58:30,425 --> 00:58:33,633
They can make it look like
we never left our house.

1044
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:51,965
You were thinking
about leaving Dad,

1045
00:58:51,967 --> 00:58:54,383
weren't you?

1046
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,383
Yes.

1047
00:59:03,758 --> 00:59:06,175
I didn't want you two to suffer.

1048
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,967
Was there someone else?

1049
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:25,008
Did Dad know?

1050
00:59:36,258 --> 00:59:38,590
Maddox.

1051
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:40,798
Please.

1052
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,590
I found out about this tumor,

1053
00:59:43,592 --> 00:59:45,923
and I got scared.

1054
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:49,673
I stare at the remains of
nameless people in glass cases,

1055
00:59:49,675 --> 00:59:52,798
and I kept thinking I'm going
to be one of those people.

1056
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,467
Does that make any sense?

1057
00:59:56,258 --> 00:59:59,967
I feel different
than I felt yesterday.

1058
01:00:01,883 --> 01:00:04,340
What I did feels like
an illusion.

1059
01:00:04,342 --> 01:00:05,758
I swear.

1060
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:10,092
Do you hate me now?

1061
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:14,883
I just need some time, Mom.

1062
01:00:20,508 --> 01:00:22,675
We don't have that, baby.

1063
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:27,008
Look at you.

1064
01:00:29,675 --> 01:00:31,675
You're an adult.

1065
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:36,842
Be strong for everyone.

1066
01:00:41,217 --> 01:00:43,633
Connect to something bigger.

1067
01:01:43,258 --> 01:01:44,590
Here, here. Dad.

1068
01:01:44,592 --> 01:01:46,467
Lay him down. Lay him down.

1069
01:02:09,633 --> 01:02:12,092
He must have gone
unconscious swimming.

1070
01:02:14,508 --> 01:02:16,967
Brendon didn't do anything
to that woman.

1071
01:02:18,008 --> 01:02:20,717
We can't swim out, Prisca.

1072
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,092
We're not getting
off this beach.

1073
01:02:33,133 --> 01:02:37,006
We never had a prom.

1074
01:02:37,008 --> 01:02:38,590
Or a graduation.

1075
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:41,342
There are so many memories
we didn't have.

1076
01:02:43,258 --> 01:02:45,092
It's not fair.

1077
01:02:49,342 --> 01:02:51,342
He needs to rest now.

1078
01:03:26,717 --> 01:03:28,425
Kara.

1079
01:03:30,883 --> 01:03:32,508
Kara.

1080
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:35,548
Wait. What if you get
dizzy up there?

1081
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,715
- You might black out.
- Trent, we are in charge now.

1082
01:03:37,717 --> 01:03:39,548
My dad could hurt more people.

1083
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,465
I have to get him
off this beach.

1084
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:43,465
Kara! Don't climb that.

1085
01:03:43,467 --> 01:03:45,090
Come down!

1086
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:47,173
We'll find another way.

1087
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:49,381
- No, don't! Trent.
- Listen to Mom.

1088
01:03:49,383 --> 01:03:50,923
I have to go with her!

1089
01:03:50,925 --> 01:03:52,756
Kara, wait! Don't climb!

1090
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:54,215
Let me get your mother!

1091
01:03:54,217 --> 01:03:55,631
- Kara!
- It's not the way.

1092
01:03:55,633 --> 01:03:57,381
She's panicked and desperate.

1093
01:03:57,383 --> 01:03:59,090
Talk to each other.

1094
01:03:59,092 --> 01:04:02,631
Kara, you and I
should just stay together.

1095
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:03,965
What if we spend
this whole time trying

1096
01:04:03,967 --> 01:04:05,758
to get out of here
and we still don't make it?

1097
01:04:07,717 --> 01:04:09,798
It'll be too short
if we don't try.

1098
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,381
No, Kara, please!

1099
01:04:11,383 --> 01:04:13,383
Please just stay with me,
please.

1100
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,258
If she makes it to the ledge,
she might have a chance.

1101
01:04:32,883 --> 01:04:34,842
Go to the ledge and rest!

1102
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:42,256
There has to be a way out.

1103
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:45,508
It's a mathematical certainty
there must be a way out.

1104
01:04:56,383 --> 01:04:57,673
No. Why is she stopping?

1105
01:04:57,675 --> 01:04:58,675
No.

1106
01:05:00,842 --> 01:05:03,298
No. Kara! Kara, wake up!

1107
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,840
Kara, wake up!

1108
01:05:04,842 --> 01:05:06,383
Wake up!

1109
01:05:50,342 --> 01:05:51,967
Kara.

1110
01:05:57,508 --> 01:05:59,508
Daddy.

1111
01:06:18,092 --> 01:06:20,548
Let's all stay together.

1112
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:23,508
Nobody in this family
goes alone anywhere.

1113
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,881
I think I figured it out.

1114
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:29,883
I'm using these to swim out.

1115
01:06:33,883 --> 01:06:35,881
I have a sister.

1116
01:06:35,883 --> 01:06:37,340
She's a therapist, too.

1117
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:39,465
I need to get to my sister.

1118
01:06:39,467 --> 01:06:41,840
We never talk.
We had a fight a long time ago.

1119
01:06:41,842 --> 01:06:45,092
She's older, but now I am.

1120
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:49,050
The fighting seems
ridiculous now.

1121
01:06:54,092 --> 01:06:55,756
Patricia.

1122
01:06:55,758 --> 01:06:57,300
Patricia.

1123
01:06:58,758 --> 01:07:00,131
No.

1124
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:01,756
Wh-What's happening to her?

1125
01:07:01,758 --> 01:07:03,090
What's going on?

1126
01:07:03,092 --> 01:07:04,965
She was fine.
What-what's happening?

1127
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:07,300
She keeps stopping and starting.

1128
01:07:10,383 --> 01:07:13,467
No. Dad, do something.

1129
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:04,717
Oh, no.

1130
01:08:06,008 --> 01:08:07,800
Kara?

1131
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:12,342
Kara, where are you?

1132
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,175
Somebody's done this
to us, Kara.

1133
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,131
I can't protect you anymore.

1134
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:27,133
Kara!

1135
01:08:37,175 --> 01:08:38,756
No, you don't know.

1136
01:08:38,758 --> 01:08:40,256
Jarin went in a different way.

1137
01:08:40,258 --> 01:08:42,423
He went on, and I... and I'm
a better swimmer than he is.

1138
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:44,756
He's older than me.
I-I can probably swim...

1139
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:47,298
Trent, stop it. No. No.

1140
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,590
No, you're not
a better swimmer than him.

1141
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:51,006
Yeah, but let me try.

1142
01:08:51,008 --> 01:08:52,842
Listen. Listen.

1143
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:09,548
We're not gonna let you.

1144
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,756
Stop. It won't work.

1145
01:09:11,758 --> 01:09:13,215
Well, I don't want to give up.

1146
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:14,965
- I really don't want to give up.
- We're not giving up.

1147
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:16,342
And I think,
if you let me try...

1148
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:35,798
My back.

1149
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,673
I need my calcium.

1150
01:09:37,675 --> 01:09:39,506
Chrystal?

1151
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,923
Chrystal, stay with us.

1152
01:09:41,925 --> 01:09:43,883
Don't look at me.

1153
01:10:01,508 --> 01:10:04,675
Prisca, I have to
tell you something.

1154
01:10:10,258 --> 01:10:12,842
I saw your text messages
one day.

1155
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:19,800
He says romantic things.

1156
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,842
I'm sorry.

1157
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:34,840
I don't know who I would have
been okay with, but...

1158
01:10:34,842 --> 01:10:36,675
with that guy?

1159
01:10:39,342 --> 01:10:41,131
He's-he's a joke.

1160
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:43,756
He's a pretend person.

1161
01:10:43,758 --> 01:10:46,383
You deserve someone
so much better than that.

1162
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:51,131
I should have said something
when I saw it.

1163
01:10:51,133 --> 01:10:53,881
I hide from everything.
I'm a fucking coward.

1164
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:57,673
This was no one's
responsibility but me.

1165
01:10:57,675 --> 01:11:01,050
Your anger should be aimed
at me, just me.

1166
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:12,633
There's no place
I want to be but with you.

1167
01:11:14,467 --> 01:11:16,883
Do you believe me?

1168
01:11:18,967 --> 01:11:20,800
I want to be here...

1169
01:11:24,633 --> 01:11:26,467
...right now.

1170
01:11:46,925 --> 01:11:48,800
It's notebooks.

1171
01:11:52,717 --> 01:11:55,715
Well, maybe we can use
some of the empty pages

1172
01:11:55,717 --> 01:11:58,300
for the fire,
keep Mom and Dad warm.

1173
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:05,381
Whoever it was wanted
to be a science fiction writer.

1174
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:08,173
It's full of story ideas.

1175
01:12:08,175 --> 01:12:11,506
"Birds that can make you
black out when they scream

1176
01:12:11,508 --> 01:12:15,467
fly too close to an Emirates
commercial plane one day."

1177
01:12:16,508 --> 01:12:19,133
He realized he was never
getting off this beach.

1178
01:12:21,258 --> 01:12:23,842
He's trying to figure out
what's going on.

1179
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:30,590
"Magnetism of this exact spot
on the Earth

1180
01:12:30,592 --> 01:12:34,381
"with the rocks on this beach
submerged beneath the ocean

1181
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,798
"for millions of years
deposited with special minerals

1182
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,756
"are causing our cells
to age at a rapid rate.

1183
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:44,840
"Are there other places
like this?

1184
01:12:44,842 --> 01:12:46,717
Who found this place?"

1185
01:12:47,842 --> 01:12:51,715
Well, maybe we can make
a metal tube that we can get in

1186
01:12:51,717 --> 01:12:54,090
that stops the effects
on our cells.

1187
01:12:54,092 --> 01:12:55,798
Like at a dentist's office,
you know,

1188
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,381
when they put a metal vest
on us before an X-ray.

1189
01:12:58,383 --> 01:13:01,090
I mean, then we could just
walk out with it on us and...

1190
01:13:01,092 --> 01:13:02,715
I mean,
we'll get dizzy at first,

1191
01:13:02,717 --> 01:13:04,340
but then, slowly,
we'll get used to it

1192
01:13:04,342 --> 01:13:06,217
and we can leave, right?

1193
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,883
Where are we gonna make
a metal tube?

1194
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:14,006
He wrote down a list of all
the names and the addresses

1195
01:13:14,008 --> 01:13:15,967
of the people with him
on the beach.

1196
01:13:25,383 --> 01:13:27,383
Maddox, that's a camera.

1197
01:13:29,217 --> 01:13:31,175
They're recording us.

1198
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,800
Why would they do this?

1199
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:15,923
Who is that?

1200
01:14:15,925 --> 01:14:18,050
Prisca, who is that?

1201
01:14:25,842 --> 01:14:28,050
You're gonna tell them
what I did.

1202
01:14:29,092 --> 01:14:32,423
The man with the tattoos,

1203
01:14:32,425 --> 01:14:36,508
he was gonna steal things
from my home.

1204
01:14:41,592 --> 01:14:43,298
Guy!

1205
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,465
No!

1206
01:14:44,467 --> 01:14:47,048
I can't let you tell them.

1207
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,590
I'm a good doctor.

1208
01:14:48,592 --> 01:14:49,673
He was gonna follow us.

1209
01:14:49,675 --> 01:14:51,465
He was gonna steal things
from our home.

1210
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:52,842
Why don't you believe me?

1211
01:14:54,092 --> 01:14:55,133
I stopped him.

1212
01:14:57,925 --> 01:14:59,800
Tell me where
the knife is, Prisca!

1213
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,673
I keep having these thoughts.

1214
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:08,840
Listen, they keep coming to me.

1215
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:10,675
Don't tell anyone.

1216
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,840
Prisca!

1217
01:15:15,842 --> 01:15:18,425
Hide the kids! I'll protect you!

1218
01:15:22,717 --> 01:15:24,381
Yes.

1219
01:15:24,383 --> 01:15:26,673
Maddox! Trent!

1220
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:30,423
I need you two to go
and find somewhere to hide now!

1221
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:32,340
Somewhere where
someone can't find you.

1222
01:15:32,342 --> 01:15:34,173
- I need you to go right now.
- Mom, what...

1223
01:15:34,175 --> 01:15:35,756
And don't ask any questions.

1224
01:15:35,758 --> 01:15:37,800
Now, go! Hide!

1225
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:40,550
Go!

1226
01:15:51,717 --> 01:15:53,300
Shh.

1227
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,925
There's someone in here with us.

1228
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,590
My body hurts to move.

1229
01:16:05,592 --> 01:16:07,008
I miss Giuseppe.

1230
01:16:08,717 --> 01:16:10,381
Don't look at me!

1231
01:16:10,383 --> 01:16:12,675
Turn off the light!

1232
01:16:16,258 --> 01:16:18,675
I don't want to be seen!

1233
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:24,298
Kara's dead, isn't she?

1234
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,258
Whoever did this killed her,
didn't they?

1235
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:31,300
Kara died.

1236
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,717
It was an accident.

1237
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,048
Don't look.

1238
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:06,006
God, it's already healed
in the wrong position.

1239
01:17:06,008 --> 01:17:07,965
Turn off the light!

1240
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,592
Go.

1241
01:17:11,175 --> 01:17:12,631
Turn the light off.

1242
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:15,090
I'm chief medical officer

1243
01:17:15,092 --> 01:17:16,881
of my hospital!

1244
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:18,175
I am not gonna let...

1245
01:17:19,342 --> 01:17:21,092
...take it away from me!

1246
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:21,800
It's rust.

1247
01:18:23,092 --> 01:18:26,133
It acts like poison when it
gets into your bloodstream.

1248
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,217
I'm sorry you were
on this beach.

1249
01:18:53,925 --> 01:18:56,258
But this is my family.

1250
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:07,133
Dad, Mom, you guys
got to stay hydrated.

1251
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,381
Mom.

1252
01:20:10,383 --> 01:20:12,008
Mom.

1253
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,050
Are you warm enough?

1254
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:23,175
But Cupid's an archer

1255
01:20:24,508 --> 01:20:28,256
His violent departure

1256
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:32,256
Leaves us at the altar

1257
01:20:32,258 --> 01:20:37,215
Wounded, weak and ready to bleed

1258
01:20:37,217 --> 01:20:41,840
I'll wash away someday

1259
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:44,131
No monuments

1260
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:46,631
Made in my name

1261
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:50,592
There is no life I'd trade

1262
01:20:51,633 --> 01:20:58,090
You are my reason to remain

1263
01:20:58,092 --> 01:21:01,633
I will remain.

1264
01:21:17,258 --> 01:21:19,633
Were we fighting
about something?

1265
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:24,842
We were.

1266
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:31,425
Well, whatever it was, uh,
I'm not mad anymore.

1267
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,175
I can't remember.

1268
01:21:45,842 --> 01:21:48,508
Why did we want
to leave this beach?

1269
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,467
So beautiful.

1270
01:22:00,508 --> 01:22:02,425
It doesn't matter.

1271
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,133
It's funny.

1272
01:22:12,967 --> 01:22:14,756
I...

1273
01:22:14,758 --> 01:22:17,631
forget...

1274
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:19,300
the word.

1275
01:22:22,092 --> 01:22:24,508
It's about my feelings for you.

1276
01:22:27,925 --> 01:22:29,842
I know.

1277
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,217
- Dad.
- Dad?

1278
01:23:47,092 --> 01:23:49,133
Mom?

1279
01:23:53,217 --> 01:23:54,842
Oh, Mom.

1280
01:25:27,217 --> 01:25:29,215
We have about...

1281
01:25:29,217 --> 01:25:31,800
13 hours left, do you think?

1282
01:25:43,758 --> 01:25:46,967
We just got three days older
while you held my face.

1283
01:25:52,758 --> 01:25:55,258
Should we keep trying
to get out?

1284
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:00,342
I guess so.

1285
01:26:05,008 --> 01:26:07,592
Want to make a sandcastle first?

1286
01:26:32,633 --> 01:26:35,006
I wonder if everybody

1287
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:39,381
continues to feel like a kid
when they're our age, or...

1288
01:26:39,383 --> 01:26:42,133
is it because
we were kids yesterday?

1289
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:46,673
Idlib sent me
a message I never decoded.

1290
01:26:46,675 --> 01:26:50,258
Yeah, we thought
we were so smart.

1291
01:26:52,425 --> 01:26:54,217
Decode it.

1292
01:27:15,675 --> 01:27:17,675
Each symbol means a letter.

1293
01:27:19,342 --> 01:27:21,342
We thought we were like spies.

1294
01:27:30,508 --> 01:27:32,550
What was the big message?

1295
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:45,592
What's it say?

1296
01:28:03,133 --> 01:28:04,965
The coral might protect us

1297
01:28:04,967 --> 01:28:07,215
from the effects of the rocks.

1298
01:28:07,217 --> 01:28:10,298
Maybe that's like
our metal tube.

1299
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,715
Maybe we're just making up
what we want to hear.

1300
01:28:12,717 --> 01:28:15,548
Well, maybe he heard
they took people to this beach.

1301
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:17,548
Idlib heard something
he shouldn't have.

1302
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:21,175
He has no idea what it means,
but he knows it's bad.

1303
01:28:24,175 --> 01:28:26,673
He's trying to help us.

1304
01:28:26,675 --> 01:28:28,340
Wait.

1305
01:28:28,342 --> 01:28:30,425
I need to get something.

1306
01:30:47,758 --> 01:30:49,383
Both of them drowned.

1307
01:30:50,675 --> 01:30:52,215
For a second,
I thought they were

1308
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:54,215
gonna get through the coral.

1309
01:30:54,217 --> 01:30:56,173
I don't know how they suddenly
thought about going there.

1310
01:30:56,175 --> 01:30:58,256
Theo, are you sure
they didn't make it?

1311
01:30:58,258 --> 01:30:59,840
We can't have another incident.

1312
01:30:59,842 --> 01:31:02,465
Sidney, relax. I watched
for a minute and a half.

1313
01:31:02,467 --> 01:31:04,423
And the one person
who got through last year

1314
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:06,131
ended up drowning anyway.

1315
01:31:06,133 --> 01:31:08,048
We're fine.

1316
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,798
Final members of trial 73
are deceased.

1317
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,256
Observation's complete.

1318
01:31:13,258 --> 01:31:15,883
Bringing drives back,
returning to base.

1319
01:32:34,133 --> 01:32:37,048
All rooms for this trial
have been cleared.

1320
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:39,673
Uh, home computer devices
have been wiped.

1321
01:32:39,675 --> 01:32:42,217
Three home computers
still waiting to be scrubbed.

1322
01:32:49,842 --> 01:32:51,631
Hello.

1323
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:56,633
Uh, a moment of silence
for the members of trial 73.

1324
01:33:04,925 --> 01:33:06,258
Thank you.

1325
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,756
Mm.

1326
01:33:09,758 --> 01:33:12,342
I'll try not
to be dramatic. Uh...

1327
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:17,423
Because of this beach,

1328
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,631
we have been able to save
hundreds of thousands of lives

1329
01:33:20,633 --> 01:33:22,965
with new medicines.

1330
01:33:22,967 --> 01:33:26,008
Before we're done,
it will be millions.

1331
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:29,881
As you know,

1332
01:33:29,883 --> 01:33:32,967
we do trials
and fail constantly.

1333
01:33:35,258 --> 01:33:37,881
But not today.

1334
01:33:37,883 --> 01:33:39,717
Tell them, Sidney.

1335
01:33:42,842 --> 01:33:45,131
One of this cohort, uh,

1336
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:48,673
was a woman with
the epileptic seizures.

1337
01:33:48,675 --> 01:33:50,673
Her name was
Patricia Carmichael.

1338
01:33:50,675 --> 01:33:53,381
She suffered debilitating
seizures her whole life.

1339
01:33:53,383 --> 01:33:55,423
Nothing could help her.

1340
01:33:55,425 --> 01:33:57,631
The medicine we gave her
when she arrived

1341
01:33:57,633 --> 01:34:00,381
turned out to be
the exact mixture.

1342
01:34:00,383 --> 01:34:03,925
She didn't have a seizure
for eight hours and 17 minutes.

1343
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:07,550
16 and a half years.

1344
01:34:08,717 --> 01:34:11,173
We cured her of her epilepsy.

1345
01:34:11,175 --> 01:34:15,215
We'll now fast-track trials,
make that medicine

1346
01:34:15,217 --> 01:34:17,798
and share it
with the whole world.

1347
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,758
Every single person
that needs it.

1348
01:34:24,008 --> 01:34:27,631
Nature made that beach exist
for a reason.

1349
01:34:27,633 --> 01:34:29,506
Warren and Warren was
meant to find it

1350
01:34:29,508 --> 01:34:31,090
on their research expedition.

1351
01:34:31,092 --> 01:34:33,715
We were meant to test
medicines in one day

1352
01:34:33,717 --> 01:34:36,465
instead of a lifetime.

1353
01:34:36,467 --> 01:34:39,881
Lots more work to be done,
everyone.

1354
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:43,967
Let's do what nature
wanted us to do.

1355
01:34:51,258 --> 01:34:53,256
Mr. and Mrs. Brody will arrive

1356
01:34:53,258 --> 01:34:56,090
at 11:00 a.m.
with six nontargeted guests.

1357
01:34:56,092 --> 01:34:58,842
Joseph Brody has
early-onset Parkinson's.

1358
01:34:59,883 --> 01:35:02,048
Florence Brody will be
accompanying him.

1359
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:04,298
I'm gonna be a broken record
about this, Nills.

1360
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,298
We should separate
the pure medical subjects

1361
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,215
from the mental illness
subjects.

1362
01:35:08,217 --> 01:35:09,715
Our violent
schizophrenic patient

1363
01:35:09,717 --> 01:35:11,548
cost us the data
on our blood clot patient.

1364
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:14,381
Sidney, I doubt we'll alter
protocol at this point,

1365
01:35:14,383 --> 01:35:16,673
but, uh, put it in a form

1366
01:35:16,675 --> 01:35:18,883
and submit it
to Warren and Warren again.

1367
01:35:42,717 --> 01:35:44,133
How are you?

1368
01:35:46,675 --> 01:35:48,131
Those kids went home.

1369
01:35:48,133 --> 01:35:49,465
They don't matter.

1370
01:35:49,467 --> 01:35:51,840
I tell you which kids
you can play with.

1371
01:35:51,842 --> 01:35:53,548
You have to trust me.

1372
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:55,090
And don't ask question.

1373
01:35:55,092 --> 01:35:56,550
Okay?

1374
01:35:57,592 --> 01:35:59,715
- Okay.
- Good.

1375
01:35:59,717 --> 01:36:01,881
Now, those kids are fine.

1376
01:36:01,883 --> 01:36:04,048
See, you can play with them.

1377
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,840
Okay.

1378
01:36:05,842 --> 01:36:07,633
Good.

1379
01:36:23,925 --> 01:36:25,925
You're a police officer.

1380
01:36:28,217 --> 01:36:29,925
Yeah.

1381
01:36:48,592 --> 01:36:50,840
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1382
01:36:50,842 --> 01:36:55,006
Welcome to our version
of paradise.

1383
01:36:55,008 --> 01:36:57,340
Thank you.

1384
01:36:57,342 --> 01:36:59,881
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Thank you.

1385
01:36:59,883 --> 01:37:02,090
This is Madrid.

1386
01:37:02,092 --> 01:37:04,840
From your food and beverage
preferences that you selected,

1387
01:37:04,842 --> 01:37:08,050
we've made you cocktails
to welcome you.

1388
01:37:09,508 --> 01:37:10,756
Sorry.

1389
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:12,381
Oh, no worries,
Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1390
01:37:12,383 --> 01:37:14,048
We'll just make a new set.

1391
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:15,715
It'll only take a few moments.

1392
01:37:15,717 --> 01:37:17,506
I wouldn't take
anything they give you.

1393
01:37:17,508 --> 01:37:19,592
They left us all to die.

1394
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,756
My name is Trent Capa.

1395
01:37:24,758 --> 01:37:27,092
I'm Maddox Capa.

1396
01:37:32,175 --> 01:37:34,800
All three are missing persons?

1397
01:37:35,842 --> 01:37:38,092
Sending you the rest
of the names now.

1398
01:37:43,758 --> 01:37:47,631
Our parents are
Guy and Prisca Capa.

1399
01:37:47,633 --> 01:37:51,215
We live at 707 Pine Street,
Philadelphia, USA.

1400
01:37:51,217 --> 01:37:53,048
Also with us was

1401
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:55,673
Jarin Carmichael,
who was a nurse;

1402
01:37:55,675 --> 01:37:58,425
Patricia Carmichael,
who was a psychologist...

1403
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,631
Listen, we have to get security.

1404
01:38:07,633 --> 01:38:09,758
What's happening?
Are you listening to me?

1405
01:38:48,217 --> 01:38:49,925
May I help you?

1406
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:53,173
Gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1407
01:38:53,175 --> 01:38:54,506
Gentlemen, we have a problem.

1408
01:38:54,508 --> 01:38:56,006
I need your assistance
immediately.

1409
01:38:56,008 --> 01:38:58,298
Two of our guests need
your attention.

1410
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:00,842
Solve this problem. Now.

1411
01:41:11,508 --> 01:41:13,590
We've arrested everybody here.

1412
01:41:13,592 --> 01:41:15,256
Subpoenas are being served

1413
01:41:15,258 --> 01:41:17,758
at Warren and Warren's
headquarters this week.

1414
01:41:23,258 --> 01:41:25,090
Let's get them to the airport.

1415
01:41:25,092 --> 01:41:28,131
Your aunt will be waiting
for you when you land.

1416
01:41:28,133 --> 01:41:29,881
How's she handling things?

1417
01:41:29,883 --> 01:41:33,048
How would you feel
if a 50-year-old man called

1418
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:35,550
and told you he was
your six-year-old nephew?

1419
01:41:40,508 --> 01:41:42,342
We'll be okay.

1420
01:42:11,015 --> 01:42:14,171
