1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,080
You left me the virus.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,120
You've got two options.
You can take the virus.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,440
And find the strength
and get out of there.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,720
<i>Or you can make that coffin
your permanent home.</i>

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,000
- Fish! Why are you here?
- I was alive.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,760
Goodbye, Fish!

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,480
- Then, I was dead.
- Let's try subject 13, shall we?

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,920
And then I was alive.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,400
<i>- Impossible.</i>
- Nothing is impossible.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,760
Things are looking up.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,800
My little Penguin
and I will be leaving.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,760
<i>This detonator
will trigger the bomb.</i>

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,560
1000's will be infected with a virus.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,680
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,680
I won't have him turn you
into a murderer.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,320
No, you will press it.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,040
When you're ready,
come and find me.

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,680
Oh, my.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
- What is that?
- What's happening out there?

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
My, my money.

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,640
- My money, my savings. My savings...
- Excuse me, what?

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
My, my money, my savings.
I want them. My money, my savings...

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,840
- My whole life.
- What's your account number?

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,720
My money, my savings.

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,840
My money, my savings.
My money, my savings.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,320
This account was closed

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,080
- due to unpaid fees.
- No, no, my money,

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,080
- my savings, my life, everything!
- You have no money,

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,400
- the account is closed.
- I have to...

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,840
- Give me my money, now!
- Oh, god. Security!

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Hey! What are you...

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,880
My money! My savings! Now!

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,880
- Get out!
- Stop it.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,400
- Come here!
- Stop this!

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,320
Come back! Buy our cookies!

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Move on!

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,000
{\an5}<i>Killer.</i>

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
{\an5}<i>Killer,</i>

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,320
<i>you're a killer.</i>

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
<i>Killer.</i>

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
<i>Killer.</i>

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
<i>Killer!</i>

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,640
- Jim?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,520
{\an5}- You okay?
- Fine.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,400
{\an5}I'm fine, Harvey.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,160
{\an5}Listen,
I hate to do this to you, pal.

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,120
{\an5}But I'm going to have
to ask for your gun.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,960
{\an5}This virus is tearing the city apart.
You need me. I can control this.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
{\an5}That's why I'm not asking
for your badge.

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,120
{\an5}Some of the guys are talking.

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,360
{\an5}These cops are going to be watching
you for the smallest sign.

53
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,160
{\an5}Okay? And if you've got a gun
they'll be double jumpy.

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,720
{\an5}It's for your own protection.

55
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,280
{\an5}- Any word on Lee?
- Nada.

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,720
{\an5}What happened after the bombing?

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,760
{\an5}A mob of infected swarmed
the clock tower.

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
{\an5}- She disappeared in the chaos.
- I don't get it.

59
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
She went through all that effort

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,760
{\an5}to get you infected
with the virus and she just bolts?

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,280
{\an5}She saw I was fighting it.

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
{\an5}She's waiting for me
to give over to it.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,480
{\an5}Prove her wrong.

64
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,600
{\an5}Where's Bruce?

65
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,360
Detective Gordon.

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,960
Alfred.

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,440
Has he said anything?

68
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,400
No, no, he just sits there staring.

69
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,120
I need to talk to him, Harvey.

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,160
- We sure that's not the clone?
- No, that's Bruce.

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,000
God knows what those
bastards done to him

72
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,520
but he's only brainwashed.

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,160
Are you really the best person
to talk to him?

74
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,920
I mean, from what you said,
you killed his mentor or something.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
He might be a bit peeved.

76
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,880
Listen, whatever they did to him,
that is Bruce Wayne in there.

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,000
That boy is stronger than
you can possibly imagine.

78
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,800
I just need to make him remember...

79
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,560
Who he is.

80
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,800
As long as he doesn't
leave the precinct.

81
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,520
Harvey, something
you need to see.

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,080
An antidote?
Lucius, I could kiss your face.

83
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,280
Before you do that,
I don't actually have the formula.

84
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,080
But there is an antidote?
That's what you're saying?

85
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,360
I was going through
the papers you recovered

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,600
from the Owl leader's house.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,600
They suggest that while Strange was
working to weaponize the Tetch virus

88
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,720
he was also working
on a parallel project

89
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,720
tailoring different antiviral agents
to his own ends.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,920
- Strange was designing an antidote.
- That makes sense.

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,000
The Court was careful
to protect its own.

92
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,840
They would want a safeguard.
We need to talk to Strange.

93
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
Is he still here
or has he been moved?

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,640
Well, when you were buried
in the coffin

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,360
and the city was
about to be virus-bombed

96
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,040
- some decisions had to be made.
- Harvey...

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,360
I told Alfred to question Strange.
In exchange for him telling us

98
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,520
where the bombing was
going to go down

99
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,960
Alfred let Strange walk.

100
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,280
Yes, I'm blaming it on the butler.

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,440
All right. Strange is a weasel.

102
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,480
He'd try to get as far away
from this as possible.

103
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
Union Station is shut down.

104
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Downtown train station's
our best bet.

105
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,560
Okay. Wait up.

106
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
- Harvey?
- Lucius,

107
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,120
I know what you're going to say,
all right?

108
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,480
He can handle this.
Hell, Barnes had the virus

109
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,120
for weeks before anyone knew.

110
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,880
What I was going to say,
from all I see here

111
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,160
Strange's virus is an accelerated
version of the Tetch virus.

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,080
Why do you think people
are reacting so quickly?

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,040
Gordon isn't going to be able
to fight this for long.

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,560
Well, we'll just have
to wait and see?

115
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,360
You keep working on that antidote.

116
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,880
One second, one second,
one ticket at a time...

117
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,040
- Two.
- Keep the change.

118
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
Sir, excuse me!

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
Excuse me.

120
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
Oh, no.

121
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,280
I think you mean,
"Hello, Fish. I miss you."

122
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,680
And don't worry, sweetheart.
The fun has just begun.

123
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,800
"As the flames of hedonism

124
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
licked the very foundation
of its society

125
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,680
"Nero" played and sang...

126
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,800
"The Destruction of Troy."

127
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,280
I will say this
about the Court of Owls,

128
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,560
they have style.

129
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,320
Not to mention they've handed us
the perfect opportunity.

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,560
- For what?
- The city is in total disarray.

131
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,560
What better time
to consolidate power?

132
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,400
Barbara, I've told you again
and again

133
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,400
I have no interest
in running Gotham.

134
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,880
- I only want...
- To kill Penguin, yes.

135
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,640
I got it the first billion times.

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,440
And where is he now?
Oh, that's right, with Fish Mooney.

137
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,920
- So we find her.
- And then what?

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,960
You blast through her army of goons
until you get to Oswald?

139
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,800
You're going to need muscle, honey.

140
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,200
- Which you provide.
- Oh, so you expect my help?

141
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,960
But when I need yours

142
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
to take advantage
of an opportunity of a lifetime...

143
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Nothing.

144
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Baby.

145
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,680
Listen, all I ask
is that you use this beautiful

146
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,920
big brain of yours

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,440
to help me, finally...

148
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,920
Get this city under my thumb.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,560
And afterwards,

150
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,720
I will help you
pry Penguin away from Fish.

151
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Deal?

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
I will give you a day.

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,240
I thought we were friends.

154
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
When the Court of Owls calls,
no-one does not refuse.

155
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,880
Still, I'm not upset.

156
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
I knew when your old masters
summoned you

157
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,240
it was to cook up some horror,
and here's the thing,

158
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,080
I need horror.

159
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,960
They're responsible
for all of this, aren't they?

160
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,840
At the behest of the Court,
I weaponized a virus

161
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,240
that releases
a person's darkest urges.

162
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,880
1000's have been infected.

163
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,960
So, where is this virus?

164
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,840
I know there's more.

165
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
It has all been used.
Please, I must go.

166
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,680
Don't.
You will give me the virus.

167
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,360
You will make me the army
you promised.

168
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,520
You will do everything I say

169
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,880
until this city
is in the palm of my hand.

170
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
Are we clear?

171
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,640
Yes, madam.

172
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,000
Sorry, folks, this exit's off...

173
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,520
I'll look around for the station cop,
see if he found Strange.

174
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Hello?

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,360
Oh, geez. He's right here.

176
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,040
- This is Gordon.
<i>- Hi, Jim.</i>

177
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,720
<i>I was just checking in,
seeing how you're feeling.</i>

178
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
<i>Crazy day?</i>

179
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,440
- Lee, where are you?
<i>- Somewhere very familiar to you.</i>

180
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,520
I know how you're feeling.

181
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,920
All that blood rushing
through your veins

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,880
your heart beating faster
and faster.

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Listen to me you need
to turn yourself in, it's not safe.

184
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
<i>The infected are being killed
all over the city.</i>

185
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,640
Wow, you're really fighting this?

186
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,040
<i>You know, you don't have to.</i>

187
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,400
<i>The cage is finally open, Jim.
You're free.</i>

188
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
- No.
- <i>I thought you loved me.</i>

189
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,720
I thought you wanted us
to be together.

190
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
Not like this.

191
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
<i>Well.</i>

192
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
This is the only way, Jim.
Just listen to the whispers.

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
<i>Killer.</i>

194
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,520
They'll lead you to me,

195
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,960
tell you who you are.

196
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
<i>Killer.</i>

197
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,000
- That's not who I am.
<i>- I wonder what they're saying.</i>

198
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,120
<i>That you like hurting people,
killing people?</i>

199
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,280
<i>- Killer.</i>
- See how well I know you, Jim.

200
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,040
<i>Now, I'm going to go have some fun.
We'll catch up soon.</i>

201
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Promise.

202
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,400
<i>Killer, killer, you're a killer.</i>

203
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,360
Jim! Jim.
Someone spotted Strange.

204
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,800
Just don't shoot
any innocent bystanders.

205
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,960
Or me. Especially me.

206
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,040
- GCPD!
- Don't move!

207
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,640
Fish?

208
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
What a surprise.

209
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,440
My goodness, Harvey, you look awful.

210
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,080
It's good to see you, too.

211
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,440
We just want Strange.
You can walk away.

212
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Yeah. Oh, no.

213
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,720
Fish, I know in your own sick way,
you love this city

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
and Gotham is bleeding to death.

215
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,080
- We need this dirtbag to fix it.
- Enough talking. Hand him over.

216
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
He has it.

217
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,440
It's in his eyes.

218
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,080
- He has the virus.
- Really?

219
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,240
So tell me, James
what's it feel like?

220
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,320
Like it's taking all my willpower
not to kill you.

221
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
Oh, my.

222
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,240
Harvey, when you say Hugo here
can save the city

223
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,000
does that mean there's a cure
for this virus?

224
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,120
Fish, I swear to god,
if you don't step back

225
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,800
I will shoot you
and these two nimrods right here,

226
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,440
- right now!
- Hugo, is it true

227
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,480
that you're the only one
that can stop this madness?

228
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,200
- Obviously, I can't give him up now.
- Fine, you had your chance.

229
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,400
Did you really think
that I would come without backup?

230
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,640
<i>- You're a killer.</i>
- Jim, dial it down, buddy.

231
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,080
Victor, looks like our little
Detective Gordon is overheating.

232
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,920
Perhaps you should cool him off.
Both of them.

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,840
Marvelous. Just marvelous.

234
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,720
There he is,
the real James Gordon.

235
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,320
Nice to meet you, at last.

236
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,960
There we go, Master Bruce.
Two lumps, just how you like it.

237
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,000
You hungry, mate?

238
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,960
Can I whip you up a sandwich?

239
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,080
Anyway, if all goes well,
we should be able to

240
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,200
head back to Wayne Manor tomorrow.

241
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,000
Although, I was thinking
that we could go abroad.

242
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,640
We could go to Switzerland.

243
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,920
I mean, we used to go with your mum
and dad this time of year.

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Stop it.

245
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,760
Your attempts
to elicit an emotional response

246
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,880
by reminding me of shared memories
is clumsy and pathetic.

247
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,960
The last memory, I have is
of you killing the best friend

248
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,480
and teacher I ever had.

249
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,960
You mean that old geezer
that kidnapped you,

250
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,880
poisoned your mind then tried
to turn you into a mass murderer.

251
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,880
Let me tell you something,
Master Bruce

252
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
that man...

253
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,000
Lied to you.

254
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,120
Him and his bloody Court of Owls

255
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,640
they tried to use you,
they tried to manipulate you.

256
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,040
You say he was a liar.

257
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
How?

258
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,680
By taking away the pain
I've carried for years?

259
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,080
By giving me revenge against
the people

260
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,680
who killed my mother and father?

261
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
That's more than you ever did.

262
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,880
Anyway, the Court of Owls
does not matter.

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,080
They merely paved the way
for the one who is to come.

264
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,400
What do you mean?

265
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,160
Who, who's coming?

266
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,480
You'll see.

267
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,000
- I should cook him.
- They want him alive.

268
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,720
- So, I'll just cook part of him.
- Oh, no, my dear.

269
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,120
Let's be calm.

270
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
You don't have that kind of control.

271
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,120
And you do? In my hands,
this flamethrower is a scalpel.

272
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,400
Fine. We each take a foot.

273
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,640
Whoever goes above
the ankle loses.

274
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,080
- You're on.
- No. No, no. Stop!

275
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,480
- Ms. Mooney! Ms. Mooney!
<i>- Mooney's busy.</i>

276
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm here now.

277
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,960
Also, I think your children
are angry with you.

278
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,240
- Mr. Cobblepot.
- It's understandable.

279
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,720
You made them what they are...

280
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,800
Then abandoned them.

281
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,800
- You are working with Ms. Mooney?
- We're partners.

282
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
But you tried to kill her.

283
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,640
And she forgave me.
I know. Surprised me, too.

284
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,240
But, Mooney is not the old Mooney.
She has evolved.

285
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,520
And she has a vision for Gotham.

286
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
She sees a city
where people like myself

287
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,960
Victor, Bridgit freaks are in charge.

288
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,400
And you are going to help us
achieve that.

289
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,520
- I can't.
- Wrong, Professor!

290
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,320
This virus is tearing Gotham apart.

291
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,640
That makes your antidote
the most valuable thing in the city.

292
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,360
We could demand half of Gotham

293
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,680
and the city council deliver it
to us on a platter.

294
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,120
So, I'm going to ask you once,

295
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
where is it?

296
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,520
If I tell you
where the antidote is...

297
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,880
I have nothing.

298
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,720
I can't.

299
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,880
You can torture me all you want.

300
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
- Okay.
- What?

301
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,240
You know, when I was in Arkham,
I was tortured daily.

302
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,880
Well, that was therapy, Oswald.

303
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,800
Therapy.

304
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,280
And that device you used
to administer the therapy

305
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
remember that?

306
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,880
It gave the sensation
that your head was being torn open

307
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,600
so that hot lava could be poured
directly into your brain.

308
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,640
Afterwards...

309
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,760
Just thinking of it
would make me physically ill.

310
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,160
So, naturally, I had to have it.

311
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,360
One moment, Oswald.

312
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,280
- No!
- All right, all right! I'll tell you

313
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,440
anything you need to know.

314
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,120
I'll tell you where the antidote is.

315
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,280
I know.

316
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,960
- But not just yet, okay?
- What?

317
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,560
They're not answering
at the precinct.

318
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,720
They must be overwhelmed.

319
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,400
Well, we're not shooting
our way out.

320
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,280
<i>Killer.</i>

321
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,680
Jim, take it easy.
Someone will come!

322
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,800
Yeah, and by then,
Mooney will have gotten Strange

323
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,280
to give her the antidote!

324
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,560
We're running out of time!

325
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,040
<i>Killer.</i>

326
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
<i>Killer. Killer.</i>

327
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
<i>Killer!</i>

328
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,920
I knew you could do it.

329
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,360
Come on, Jim!

330
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,520
Fight the damn virus!
Not my car. That's my car!

331
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
Let me drive.

332
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,960
Alvarez, spread the word.

333
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,960
Mayor James has called
in the National Guard.

334
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,800
We don't want any soldiers
getting shot by mistake.

335
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,920
Leave me alone.

336
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,800
The hell's wrong with you?

337
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,320
- Alvarez, I'm talking to you.
- I said, leave me alone!

338
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
So, I will ask you again.

339
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Who's coming?

340
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,360
I mean, I thought the man
that I dispatched

341
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,320
at Wayne Enterprises
was the leader of the Court of Owls.

342
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,640
I want you to leave.

343
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
Yeah, well, that ain't going
to happen, is it, mate?

344
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,560
You can't get rid of me
that easy.

345
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,440
You have to remember
who you are.

346
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,800
I know who I am.

347
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,640
- I have a destiny.
- Now, you listen to me.

348
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,440
That man that wanted you
to detonate that bomb,

349
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,600
whatever he promised you

350
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,200
freedom from pain, power, none of it,
none of it was real.

351
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,760
I want you to remember what is real.

352
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,440
I know what's real!

353
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,400
I got vengeance
for my parent's murder.

354
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
That's real!

355
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
No.

356
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,560
No, that's not real.

357
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,720
What's real...

358
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,400
Is every time that you were sick
when you were a kid,

359
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,280
your mum used to sit up
with you all night

360
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,960
and read to you till you fell asleep.

361
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
That's real.

362
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,040
Or when you were seven

363
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,880
and you took
your silly rowing boat out

364
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,040
and you got lost in that storm

365
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,440
and me and your dad were out,
shouting and screaming

366
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,040
losing our minds.

367
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,800
And when your dad found you,
how he cried.

368
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,480
That's real.

369
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,400
Yes,

370
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,840
your parents died in that alley
three years ago

371
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,440
and maybe that man took away
the pain of that night.

372
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,360
But there is no life,
there is no love without pain.

373
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,400
He could not touch the love
that your mom and dad gave you

374
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,680
that you still have it in you,
that you still have in here.

375
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,240
The same love
that I have for you.

376
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,960
I love you, Master Bruce.

377
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,240
I would do anything for you.
I would die for you.

378
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
You must find that love again.

379
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,080
Come back to me, Master Bruce.

380
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,640
- Thank you very much.
- No, problem.

381
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Excuse me.

382
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,320
Oh, bloody hell.

383
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,480
What I'm saying is
if Penguin and Fish have hooked up

384
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,920
things are going to get real bad,
real fast.

385
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
- You want to run?
- No.

386
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,160
I'm saying maybe she takes care
of Barbara and Nygma for us.

387
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,400
I mean, we can even help
things along.

388
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Send word to Fish
about where Babs is weak.

389
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,840
This is our shot.

390
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
I'm not ready.

391
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,400
What the hell is she doing here?

392
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,480
One whiskey, here you go.

393
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,920
Well, this is a strange day.

394
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,040
Never thought I'd see you in here.

395
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,280
Had some time to kill
while my ex sees the light.

396
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,800
Figured I'd have a little fun.

397
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,160
- Where's Babs?
- What do you want with her?

398
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,720
None of your business, errand boy.

399
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,120
I'm sorry, what did you call me?

400
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm sorry, you're not an errand boy.
You're more of a shoeshine boy.

401
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,120
They should give you a little stand
in the front cute little hat.

402
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,040
- That's more your speed.
- Right. Out.

403
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Yeah.

404
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,640
You've got the virus.

405
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,280
Wow, you're not as dumb
as I've heard.

406
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,000
Are there any other glaringly
obvious remarks you'd like to make?

407
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,720
How about I cut your lungs out
and show them to you?

408
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,400
Wow, that's incredibly vivid.

409
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
I'd like to see you try it.

410
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,320
But I'm here for your boss,
the crazy blonde.

411
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,920
She's not my boss.

412
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,120
I may have a virus making me
freakishly strong and mildly insane,

413
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
but even I know that you were
a sidekick to your brother

414
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,040
and you're a sidekick to Barbara.

415
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
So...

416
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,960
Can you send her a message for me?
Would you?

417
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,240
Your boss...

418
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,320
Tell her next time I see her,

419
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,040
I'm going to rip her head
right off her body.

420
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Bye now.

421
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,120
- God.
- What, you need help?

422
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,000
Hey, wait for me.

423
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,880
<i>It's all criminal activity.</i>

424
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
<i>- Go back inside.</i>
- I got this guy.

425
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,600
<i>- Gotham Curfew.</i>
- Got him.

426
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,880
<i>Sun down.</i>

427
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,080
<i>All individuals must remain indoors.</i>

428
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,120
<i>Any activity outdoors</i>

429
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,240
<i>will be considered criminal activity.</i>

430
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
<i>Clear here.</i>

431
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,040
<i>Let's go, let's go. Clear out.</i>

432
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,000
He's following directions
or something.

433
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,920
I've got to find out
who's controlling him,

434
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,840
who's brainwashed him.

435
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
And then what?

436
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,400
I'm going to kill the bastard.

437
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,360
You two, wait here.

438
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,440
Professor, if this is a trap,

439
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,920
you will soon find yourself hanging
with the rest of the meat.

440
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,360
It's no trap.

441
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,920
I tested earlier versions
of the virus

442
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,960
and the antidote on livestock.

443
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,560
I made sure to set aside
a successful batch.

444
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,920
- This place gives me the creeps.
- I like it.

445
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,960
It's concentrated.
Once you dilute it

446
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,400
there is enough here to cure
every infected person in Gotham.

447
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,240
Oswald, you and I will rule
this city together.

448
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,200
Yes.
But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.

449
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,640
- He has to die.
- Oh, he will.

450
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,320
And all those
who try to stand in our way.

451
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
What's this?

452
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,440
Who's there?

453
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,720
Show yourself.

454
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Who are they?

455
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
Don't look at me, I don't know.

456
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,640
Really?
That's all you've got?

457
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,320
Hand over the antidote now.

458
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,280
I want the Strike Force
and all available units there now.

459
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm on my way.

460
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,520
Reports of an ice storm and fireball
at an East Side slaughterhouse.

461
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,320
- Do you think maybe...
- Just drive the damn car.

462
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,960
Sweet mother mercy.

463
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,080
<i>Killer.</i>

464
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,920
You damn fool.

465
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,200
Fish!

466
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,360
Oswald.

467
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,720
It's okay. It's, it's...

468
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,120
We can, we can
get you some help.

469
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,920
No, no, no.

470
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,080
I've done this enough times
to know I'm finished.

471
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,640
No, do not say that.

472
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,840
- We will get you help.
- Listen to me.

473
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,360
Listen to me.

474
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,840
Make this city yours...

475
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,440
Or you burn it to the ground.

476
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,440
People call me a monster.

477
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,120
You, Jim Gordon
you're the mons...

478
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,320
You're right. I am a monster.

479
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,920
<i>- GCPD!</i>
- Arrest them! All of them!

480
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,880
Strange.

481
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,640
You better tell me that you can make
more of that antidote.

482
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,760
Yes, yes. I just need one thing.

483
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
How's it hanging?

484
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,640
You sure about this?

485
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,440
According to my sources,
Fish Mooney and the GCPD

486
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,160
are scrambling to recover
the antidote to this virus.

487
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,200
But Fish is dead.

488
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,240
And Hugo Strange,
who designed the antidote

489
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,040
is setting up a lab in the GCPD

490
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,600
but they are missing one very,
very important element.

491
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,840
So, yes, I am sure that this bozo
is the key to controlling Gotham.

492
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,160
Are you my saviors?

493
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,280
Are you the ones to set me free?

494
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,360
Not exactly.

495
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,000
Let's make Gotham beg.

496
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,800
<i>Seek out the Yuyan building.</i>

497
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,880
<i>Find the demon's head.</i>

498
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,600
<i>Fulfill your destiny.</i>

499
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,680
Right. Find Bullock,
let him know where we are.

500
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,840
I'm going to follow Bruce.

501
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
<i>I wouldn't touch that, Bruce.</i>

502
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,560
You know, who I am?

503
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,520
<i>Who do you think told the Sensei
to send you here?</i>

504
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,240
He's dead.

505
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,840
He was murdered.

506
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,160
<i>He died.</i>

507
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,760
But he completed his task.

508
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,600
The Court of Owls is destroyed,
Gotham burns, and you...

509
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,520
...are here.

510
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,200
He told me to complete my training
to find the demon's head.

511
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,320
You already have, Bruce.

512
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm the one you seek.

513
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,440
I'm the demon's head.

514
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,120
I am Ra's al Ghul.

515
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Why have you come to me, Bruce?

516
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,880
The Sensei told me to seek you out.

517
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,440
That you would complete my training.

518
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,320
And did the Sensei tell you
who I am, what I seek?

519
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,040
I know you are not a part
of the Court of Owls

520
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,760
that you only used them.

521
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,080
But I don't know why.

522
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,400
Then know that I have been alive
more years than you can imagine.

523
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,800
That I have seen and done things

524
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,760
that would shake the core
of everything you believe.

525
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,080
That I'm thought to be a demon,

526
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,800
a saint,

527
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,520
a ghost.

528
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,000
But for all my years,

529
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,200
all my travels,

530
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,320
there is one thing
that I have never found...

531
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,480
A true heir.

532
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,120
But I need to know if you're ready.

533
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I am.

534
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,360
The Sensei trained me.

535
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,920
Are you?

536
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,480
He set you a task.

537
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,520
He asked you to be the one
that released the virus

538
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,160
that now envelops this city.

539
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,440
- You failed.
- I would have.

540
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,520
- But, but Alfred, he distracted me.
- I know.

541
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,640
I know.

542
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
And that's why I'm going
to give you another chance

543
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,320
to complete your journey.

544
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Oh, don't look so surprised,
Master Bruce.

545
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,480
I told you,
you couldn't get rid of me that easy.

546
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,000
Just got a bit sloppy.
Got a bit of ring rust.

547
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,480
Let these little ninja monkeys
get one over on me.

548
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,840
You all right, mate?
What you come as?

549
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Enough.

550
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:46,640
This man is your past, Bruce.
Now, embrace your future.

551
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Kill him.

552
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,280
Join me.

553
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Fulfill your destiny.

554
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
He's wrong.

555
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,360
Master Bruce,
there's no other way to put it.

556
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,000
He's wrong. Your destiny
is to be Bruce Wayne.

557
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,600
And one day,
you're going to remember that.

558
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,640
And you're going to remember
how much I love you.

559
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,720
I remember the first time
your mum and dad brought you home.

560
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,000
They were so exhausted.
And they gave you to me.

561
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,480
This tiny,
defenseless little creature.

562
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,680
And they said, "Look after him,"
and I said, "Sure."

563
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,640
And I scooped you up in my arms

564
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,120
and I held you,
and you opened your eyes,

565
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,640
and you looked at me.

566
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,240
And at that moment, I decided
that I would do anything for you.

567
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,400
Anything.

568
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,760
So, if this is what you need to do
Master Bruce, you crack on.

569
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,680
You do it.
