with the perfect trick.

[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

4
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,779 X1:0
I'm a huge comic-book fan.
I have been all my life.

5
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,616
I probably read the first Trickster
when I was in grade school.

6
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,368 X1:0
He was a disgruntled acrobat...

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,580 X1:0
...who was never able to achieve the stardom
he felt he deserved...

8
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:45,044
...and developed this pair of trick boots
that shot jet streams of air...

9
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,257
...so that he could literally run
through the sky.

10
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:50,841
The original Skywalker, right?

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,302
It was crazy, like his namesake...

12
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:54,512
...Jesse James.

13
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,475
He's running along and boarding airplanes,
holding them up and then running out.

14
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,311
So when you're 9 years old, this is fantastic.

15
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,943
If you have this super-powerful
larger-than-life hero...

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:15,657
...conversely, you have to have super,
you know, over-the-top villains.

17
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:21,329
One of the signature Flash elements
was the team-ups.

18
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:25,417
You'd see Flash and--
Surrounding him with like nine villains.

19
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:27,752
You know, Trickster, Captain Boomerang
and all of them.

You really got your 12 cents' worth.

The trickster...

22
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:38,430
...that's a classic figure in literature.

23
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:44,518
The person who fools people
into doing what he wants.

24
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:47,854
He's someone that loves gimmicks
and gadgets.

25
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:53,400
He's more in the world of magic,
so sleight of hand, misdirection.

26
00:01:53,942 --> 00:02:00,949
There's sort of a perverse joy he gets
in annoying his adversaries.

27

You know,
you think that something really wonderful...

28
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:07,456

and it blows up in your face.

Bugs Bunny is a trickster.

30

like this one.

I had so much fun doing the original.

33
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:31,728
Right after they did the Trickster...

34
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:34,564
...they brought Mirror Master
and Captain Cold...

35
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:38,360
...and some of the more celebrated members
of the Rogues' Gallery.

36
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,111
And then I eventually came back
and did the season finale.

He's teaching me. Okay?

SHIPP: What's so fascinating
about the modern sensibility around comics...

57
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,761
...is that we go beyond just exploding cars...

58

brightly colored...

to what's going on inside with these people.
