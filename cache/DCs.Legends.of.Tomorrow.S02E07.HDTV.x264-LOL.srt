1
00:00:00,665 --> 00:00:02,296
Previously on "The Flash,"

2
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:04,132
"Arrow," and "Legends of Tomorrow"...

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,844
Since we learned of them,

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,498
we've been calling them the Dominators.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,666
You can't do this alone.

6
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:10,767
I don't plan to.

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,335
Guys, thanks for coming.

8
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:14,838
This is Kara Danvers. Supergirl.

9
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,542
I went back in time to
change the timeline.

10
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:20,635
It's called Flashpoint,

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,445
and now things here are different

12
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:24,047
than before I left.

13
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:26,549
You just erased a daughter from my life?

14
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,852
He took it upon himself
to change the timeline,

15
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:30,820
and, because of it,
my brother was killed.

16
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,889
There's no amount of feeling bad

17
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,457
that could ever make up for that.

18
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,726
I'm having memories of a stranger,

19
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,329
but she's not really a stranger.

20
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,998
What if, when you interacted
with your younger self in 1987,

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,467
- you...
- Inadvertently changed my past.

22
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,069
You're back!

23
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:47,737
Oh, it's so good to see you.

24
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,272
I love you, Dad.

25
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:50,363
Call Lyla.

26
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,809
Tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

27
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,814
Maybe they chose us because
we couldn't fight back,

28
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:59,741
because none of you are meta-humans.

29
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:01,150
What is their plan?

30
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,388
The phrase loosely translates to,

31
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,024
“We are nearing completion
of the weapon.”

32
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,797
I can't believe that you guys
escaped an alien spaceship.

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,399
Key words: alien spaceship.

34
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:17,934
- I have questions.
- They can wait.

35
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,502
Thanks for helping me get my sister home.

36
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:20,470
Yeah, man.

37
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:22,171
What's our status?

38
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,240
Nothing, since the Dominators
paid their little visit

39
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:26,676
- to mess with our heads.
- Why would they do that?

40
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:28,344
What if they were trying
to pit us against each other,

41
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:30,046
in order to gain intel about meta-humans?

42
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,080
Man, I wish they would just send us

43
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:32,280
an IM with a questionnaire.

44
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:34,484
Well, metas pose the biggest
threat to their invasion.

45
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:36,185
It would make sense they'd want
to get to know their enemies.

46
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:37,353
By kidnapping people.

47
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:38,755
Perhaps they were searching your minds

48
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:40,623
for potential meta-human vulnerabilities.

49
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,992
I think it's time we return the favor.

50
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:44,661
What do you want to do?
Kidnap one of them now?

51
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:46,396
Ever since we fought off that one ship,

52
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,964
they've kind of been in short supply.

53
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:51,167
Actually, I know where to find one.

54
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,269
I've been reviewing old Army footage

55
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:56,506
of their first encounters
with the Dominators,

56
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,808
and I think I pegged the fight to...

57
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:04,414
Redmond, Oregon. 1951.

58
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:20,163
You're suggesting we travel to 1951,

59
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:21,898
abduct a Dominator, and interrogate it

60
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,133
to determine their intentions.

61
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:27,437
They kidnapped us. Seems fair.

62
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,940
Whoa. Time travel. I'm definitely in.

63
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,061
Okay, hold on, though.

64
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,796
Professor Stein and Caitlin
have been talking about

65
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,101
a way to take down the Dominators.

66
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,553
They could probably use your help.

67
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:38,314
Pass.

68
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:39,849
Yeah, I mean, I'm with him, mostly 'cause

69
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:41,384
I just don't want to lose my geek cred,

70
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,052
but time travel!

71
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:45,755
I could take Amaya and Mick.

72
00:02:45,757 --> 00:02:47,056
Do it.

73
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:49,359
- Yeah!
- Okay.

74
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:51,155
And, uh, the new president called,

75
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,830
which would be cool under
different circumstances,

76
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:55,298
but she wants to meet with us.

77
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,033
Let's bring Ray and Sara as backup.

78
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:58,534
What about me? I can do backup.

79
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,737
Can I talk to you for a second?

80
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,540
I don't know.

81
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,480
I would like to minimize
your involvement in this.

82
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,648
Why? Because I'm an alien?

83
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,417
I also happen to be your biggest weapon.

84
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,919
You are an unknown quantity,
and this is not personal.

85
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:18,755
Except that's exactly how this feels.

86
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,656
Kara, when I started living this life,

87
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,891
it was just me.

88
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,493
I was going up against human threats...

89
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,861
That I could handle.

90
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:26,796
Then it was meta-humans,
and I can handle that.

91
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:28,631
Now I learn that there
are multiple Earths,

92
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,933
and I was brainwashed aboard
an alien spacecraft...

93
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:33,169
I am sure that was
unnerving, but I don't...

94
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,272
I don't get unnerved.

95
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,274
But when I go up against something new,

96
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:40,610
I push back.

97
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:42,645
Right or wrong, it is who I am,

98
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,280
and it is what I do,

99
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:46,282
so I'm asking for a little bit of space

100
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:49,919
because I have to draw
the line somewhere.

101
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:53,790
I need to claw back a sense of normalcy.

102
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,825
Please stay here.

103

104
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,775
This ship is everything!

105
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,477
What type of propulsion
system does it use?

106
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,697
- No idea.
- Oh, my God.

107
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,073
That construct on the bow
looks like it could be

108
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:18,714
- some sort of time sphere.
- Yeah, no idea.

109
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,667
To operate a ship of this size,

110
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:21,317
the deep-link nets would have to be...

111
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,393
Oh, my God, you'd have to use,

112
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,089
- like, a quantum neural chipset...
- Hey, guys, guys.

113
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:25,755
Amaya and Rory are waiting
for us on the bridge.

114
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:28,124
Can we just keep moving this along?

115
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,759
- This ship is...
- Automatic?

116
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:31,461
- Supersonic.
- Hypnotic.

117
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,830
Funky fresh.

118
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:38,972
Professor?

119
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,137
It's highly unlikely
we can fashion a weapon

120
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,172
with sufficient force to
overcome the Dominators.

121
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:44,841
I was thinking the exact same thing,

122
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:46,142
which is why I invited...

123
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:49,011
So what if, instead,
we try to attack them

124
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,880
with something infinitesimally small?

125
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:52,715
I'm... I'm sure you're familiar
with the story of the lion

126
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,317
with the thorn in his paw.

127
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,387
You used to love telling me
that story when I was a kid.

128
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,823
Oh. Hello.

129
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:03,326
The lion with the thorn
in his paw is a parable,

130
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:05,995
a story about a big, ferocious creature

131
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:08,498
that is felled by something small.

132
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,566
So what do you need help with?

133
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:12,735
Uh, I'm afraid it's... it's classified.

134
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:15,004
Oh, juicy.

135
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:18,808
Some sort of secret government
space weapon, no doubt.

136
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,643
Something like that,
only this sort of work

137
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:23,079
is slightly out of my wheelhouse.

138
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,415
Yeah, if only you knew someone
with a PhD in nanotechnology.

139
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,384
Uh-huh, unfortunately,

140
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,753
Raymond's busy working on other things.

141
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:33,990
- I was talking about me.

142
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:37,593
Did the six years I spent at
MIT magically slip your mind?

143
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:42,532
Of course not.

144
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:45,835
Good. Okay. Let's get to work.

145
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:48,237
Hmm.

146
00:05:56,581 --> 00:06:00,550
We made it. This is the '50s. Sick.

147
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:05,121
Severe time jumps can cause nausea,
temporary deafness...

148
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,824
Linguistic disorientation.

149
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,662
You. Clean it up.

150
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,930
We're gonna kidnap an alien.

151
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:15,264
Okay.

152
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,633
I know I did not just travel through time

153
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,235
so we could stay on the ship.

154
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:21,571
Ponytail, you're staying on the ship.

155
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,309
I'll take that as,
“Have fun storming the castle”"

156
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:27,777
Oh, for real?

157
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,679
You're gonna use "Princess
Bride" against me?

158
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,914
Against me?

159
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,317
Okay. I got you, girl.

160
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:39,655
Celebrating July 4th early?

161
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:41,190
Ray made it for me.

162
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,326
You look like a star-spangled idiot.

163
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:44,660
We need to find the Army.

164
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,503
I think we found 'em.

165
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:08,538
What are we waiting for?

166
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,907
Let's grab an alien and get out of here.

167
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:14,777
Just waiting for one of
the weaker ones in the herd.

168
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:22,652
I don't think there are any weak ones.

169
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:26,756
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

170
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:29,659
It's a real-life Spielberg movie,

171
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:32,261
and we're stuck in here.

172
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:34,063
Okay.

173
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,530
I think I know what's
really bothering you.

174
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:38,165
I'm having the worst case of FOMO

175
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,534
while everyone else is out
there kidnapping an alien?

176
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:41,769
No.

177
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:44,205
I think you escaped 2016

178
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:46,607
to get away from Barry.

179
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:47,608
Mm-mm. Excuse me.

180
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,876
I escaped 2016

181
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,578
so that I could come see the Waverider

182
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,880
and so that I could time travel.

183
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:54,882
And?

184
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:57,541
And also, yes,

185
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,080
I wanted to get away from Barry.

186
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:01,510
Ah! You realize that's insane, right?

187
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,948
You're holding a grudge
against your best friend

188
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,605
when the world is
potentially going to end.

189
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:05,698
I'm sorry. My “best friend”?

190
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:07,228
He only killed my brother.

191
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,896
- He didn't kill...
- Okay, you're right.

192
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:10,331
He didn't literally kill my brother.

193
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,066
What I mean to say is,
he was responsible.

194
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:14,468
Okay? He just needed to save his family,

195
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,871
and in doing that,
he ended up destroying mine.

196
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:29,216
You know, all this time traveling,

197
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,618
fighting aliens, this is the stuff

198
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,853
I used to dream about as a kid.

199
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,655
Heh. Yeah, me too.

200
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:38,492
But it doesn't feel like a dream.

201
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:41,295
It just feels weird.

202
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:45,833
Well, exactly, and it's
only gonna get weirder.

203
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:49,403
So that's why we have to be
able to rely on our friends.

204
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:53,908
I really wish I could
right now, Felicity.

205
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,678
But he's not my friend.

206
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:13,928
- They're taking off.
- I don't get it.

207
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,463
Why are the Dominators attacking us,
then just leaving?

208
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:19,500
It's an RIF mission.
“Reconnaissance in force.”

209
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:21,468
Ah, look.

210
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,904
A straggler.

211
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,709
We need him alive, Mick.

212
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,345
I'm just gonna rough him up a little.

213
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:38,786
Hey!

214
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,154
Whoa!

215
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:44,525
Aah! Squeal, you pig!

216
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,339
Hey, Dad?

217
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,841
Dad.

218
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:02,309
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

219
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,678
Can you hand me those induction clamps?

220
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:07,748
Yes.

221
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:11,919
You know, this reminds me of that time

222
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,287
we stayed up all night

223
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:15,723
building my seventh grade science project.

224
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,558
Remember how mad Mom
got when she found out

225
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,760
you let me drink coffee to stay awake?

226
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:22,129
No.

227
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:25,032
I mean, no, no, I should never...

228
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,868
never have let you do that.

229
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,104
Uh, I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

230
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,839
Are you okay, Dad?

231
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:36,210
I'm just preoccupied with
my work, that's all.

232
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,451
You know, you're really taking

233
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,854
this whole absent-minded
professor thing to a new level.

234
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,223
- I don't know what you mean.
- Your daughter.

235
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,891
Ever since you've come back,

236
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,860
you've treated her like a total stranger.

237
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:57,064
That's because she is a total stranger.

238
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:01,001
I'm sorry. It's just that,
when I last left 2016,

239
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:05,639
that young woman did not exist.

240
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:09,143
Wait, you're saying Lily
belongs to another timeline?

241
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,011
That, when Barry created Flashpoint, she...

242
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:13,213
Unfortunately, this is all my fault.

243
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,648
You see, a month ago, I interacted

244
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,384
with my younger self back in 1987

245
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:21,055
and unwittingly motivated him...

246
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:24,558
Me... To sire a child.

247
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,796
So it's because of my carelessness

248
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:31,098
that this Time Aberration exists.

249
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,000
She is not an Aberration.

250
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:36,971
She is brilliant and
funny and a lot like you,

251
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,439
just a little less uptight.

252
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,574
Please stop talking about her like this.

253
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,276
She is not a real person.

254
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:45,479
She is a real person.
She's your daughter.

255
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:48,082
Wait.

256
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,684
When we finish fighting the Dominators,

257
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:54,755
you're gonna go back in
time and... erase her?

258
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:57,558
No.

259
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,427
I am going to restore the timeline.

260
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,963
Unlike your friend Barry,

261
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:06,667
I have the luxury of fixing my mistakes.

262
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:18,846
Well done.

263
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,519
I see that you've managed
to catch us a specimen.

264
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:27,821
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to keep this one.

265
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:29,056
Who are you?

266
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,158
Just a humble civil servant.

267
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,827
- I don't like guys with badges.
- Easy, Mick.

268
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:36,196
We just want to ask a few questions.

269
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:37,831
We'd love to answer 'em, but...

270
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,401
- We're in a bit of a hurry.
- So are we.

271
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:47,174
Aah!

272
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:50,210
You don't understand.

273
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,813
We're here to save the future.

274
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:56,116
And you can tell me all about it...

275
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:58,585
When you wake up.

276
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:04,250
Crap, crap, crap.

277
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,337
Where do you think they're taking them?

278
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:06,540
Those “Men in Black”
types are probably gonna

279
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:08,637
take 'em to a secret lab
and run experiments on them.

280
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:11,253
- Have you seen “Stranger Things”?
- Maybe too much TV, Cisco.

281
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,102
Life imitates art, Felicity.

282
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:14,737
Either way, whether you like it or not,

283
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:16,405
we're gonna have to be
the ones to rescue them.

284
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,841
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But we're the tech support.

285
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:22,277
No. This is tech support.

286
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,758
Set your phasers to “stun.”

287
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,351
This is why I hate the government.

288
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:33,055
Can't you two use your powers
and get us out of here?

289
00:13:33,057 --> 00:13:35,758
Whatever they tranqed us with
is screwing with our powers.

290
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:40,729
Hey, he's still alive.

291
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:42,097
Although something tells me

292
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:44,700
none of us are gonna be alive for long.

293
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:47,202
Wait.

294
00:13:47,204 --> 00:13:51,206
This is the exact opportunity
we've been looking for.

295
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,941
To get captured?

296
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:56,512
No. To talk with one of the Dominators.

297
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:58,781
And find out what they
want with our planet.

298
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:00,349
Well, this is a first.

299
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:02,351
Talking with an alien.

300
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:08,090
Excuse me, Mr. Alien Guy.

301
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,731
So where's the president?

302
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,833
She's late.

303
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,545
Well, you got to figure
she's got a lot on her plate,

304
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:23,181
what with the whole alien invasion thing.

305
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:25,383
And her predecessor getting killed.

306
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,985
Hey, what'd you say to Kara earlier?

307
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:29,620
She seemed pretty angry.

308
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:32,066
I didn't know she was
capable of being angry.

309
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,924
We've got movement.

310
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:57,848
I'm sorry. President couldn't make it.

311
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,317
Who are you?

312
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:01,185
If I tell you...

313
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,056
I'll have to kill you.

314
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,428
Look,

315
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,997
we just want to know why
you attacked our planet.

316
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,433
I mean, we're just down here
minding our own business,

317
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:17,935
then you guys just drop
from the sky and attack us.

318
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:19,149
Why?

319
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:22,180
There has been a recent emergence

320
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:25,843
of meta-humans on your planet.

321
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:28,212
Wait. He's talking about the JSA.

322
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:31,048
We are here to determine

323
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,018
if your kind are a threat.

324
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:39,290
Let's start with him.

325
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:44,495
Rest of you will have to wait your turn.

326
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:49,200
Uh, I think we have a misunderstanding.

327
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:52,837
See, we're the good guys.
The president invited us here.

328
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,673
Barry, I think it's time we do something.

329
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:58,042
And fast.

330
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,860
- Sniper!
- On it.

331
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:47,958
We're trying to help you.

332
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
This is how you thank us?

333
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:51,529
You don't understand.

334
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,264
The reason the xenomorphs are here...

335
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:56,167
Because they have a
beef with the meta-humans.

336
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,868
Tell us something we don't know.

337
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,137
Like what exactly have we done to them?

338
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,106
Nothing. Yet.

339
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:05,076
But they see individuals
with powers such as yours

340
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:09,880
as a future threat,
and, frankly, so do I.

341
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,087
What do you think they're doing to him?

342
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,521
Same thing they're gonna do to us

343
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:18,956
unless we get out of here.

344
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,732
Oh, yeah! Y'all call for tech support?

345
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,902
Great. Saved by geeks.

346
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:34,305
Waverider's ready to
take us back to 2016.

347
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:40,978
If we leave him here,
they're gonna kill him.

348
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,913
So what? He's an alien.

349
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,682
Just 'cause they're douches
doesn't mean we have to be.

350
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:46,984
- Well...
- We got to send him home.

351
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:48,468
How?

352
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,421
Don't we have one of their
ships aboard the Waverider?

353
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:51,756
Yeah, but it's damaged.

354
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:53,324
Felicity's gonna help me fix it.

355
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:55,059
I am?

356
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:56,527
I'm gonna help him fix it.

357
00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:57,846
See?

358
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:59,797
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

359
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:02,500
Guys, it's up to us
to show the Dominators

360
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,869
we're better than this.

361
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:11,876
Fascinating.

362
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:15,179
The creature's nervous
system is not unlike our own,

363
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:18,649
which means it must be
capable of experiencing pain.

364
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:25,556
Maybe that's why he's screaming.

365
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:31,996
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you out of here.

366
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,873
Bye.

367
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,241
He didn't even say thank you.

368
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:45,338
What is that?

369
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:47,745
I think it's a transponder.

370
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:49,513
Where'd you get that?

371
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,982
I may or may not have stolen it.

372
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:53,417
From his ship.

373
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,508
What does it do?

374
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,387
I think we can use it
to communicate with him

375
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:57,655
when we get back.

376
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:59,423
Oh, my God, like an alien pen pal.

377
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:01,992
- Exactly.
- You kids finished?

378
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:05,796
- Gideon.
- Yes, Mr. Rory?

379
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:07,131
- Prepare for, um...
- Time jump.

380
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,599
- Time jump.
- Time jump.

381
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:12,203
Course plotted for Central City, 2016.

382
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,477
If you're such BFFs
with the Dominators...

383
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,345
Then why don't you call them off?

384
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:24,181
We know you sent them packing
once before, back in 1951.

385
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,250
That was just a reconnaissance mission.

386
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,252
What brought them back?

387
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:30,754
You did, Mr. Allen.

388
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,325
He knows who you are.

389
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:35,793
You threatened the entire universe

390
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,261
when you used your powers

391
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,396
to upset the normal course of time.

392
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:41,232
You're talking about Flashpoint?

393
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:42,399
How do you even know about...

394
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:43,501
They told us.

395
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:44,578
I made a mistake. Okay?

396
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:46,270
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

397
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,504
For the past 60 years,

398
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:51,475
we have enjoyed a truce with
your so-called Dominators.

399
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:54,111
You broke the truce.

400
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:55,346
What do they want?

401
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:58,249
I've negotiated a deal with them.

402
00:19:58,251 --> 00:20:01,886
If Mr. Allen surrenders himself...

403
00:20:03,756 --> 00:20:06,590
They will leave us in peace.

404
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:08,959
You really want to save the world?

405
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:11,562
Here's your chance.

406
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:28,912
I can't see. Why can't I see?

407
00:20:28,914 --> 00:20:30,247
At least you're not throwing up.

408
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:32,015
Oh.

409
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:35,919
- What's it doing?
- I don't know.

410
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:38,989
Either our food's ready or
this guy's trying to call us.

411
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,900
Hey, how... how do... How do I answer?

412
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,257
I...

413
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:48,131
Hey. Oh, my God. It's him.

414
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:51,568
He's even uglier than
the last time we saw him.

415
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,142
65 of your years ago,

416
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:57,541
you saved me from capture.

417
00:20:57,543 --> 00:20:59,343
Listen, you don't need to thank us.

418
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:00,477
Yeah, he does.

419
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,878
He can thank us by turning around

420
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,513
and heading home.

421
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:07,618
I will show you my gratitude
by sparing your lives,

422
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,810
but I cannot do the same for Barry Allen.

423
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:15,525
If your friend does not turn himself in,

424
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:19,563
we will have no choice
but to deploy a weapon

425
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:24,701
that will exterminate all meta-humans.

426
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:30,774
It's a trap.

427
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:32,643
If they're that threatened
by meta-humans,

428
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:34,611
it's hard to believe they'd
be satisfied with just one.

429
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:35,846
Yeah, well, if I know Barry,

430
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:37,176
he's gonna want to be that one.

431
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,049
Well, Oliver's trying
to talk him out of it.

432
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:40,450
And if he does,
what's the collateral damage

433
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:41,485
of the meta-bomb?

434
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:42,953
Projected casualty count

435
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:44,888
is around 2 million non-meta-humans.

436
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,657
Okay, so what if we negotiated with them?

437
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:47,982
Yeah, I don't know if you noticed,

438
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,559
but our last chat with
him didn't go so well.

439
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:50,894
Well, what've we got to lose?

440
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:53,263
Look, maybe we should contact them.

441
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:54,765
Then make it fast.

442
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,400
We've got incoming.

443
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,270
Dominator ships are coming in worldwide.

444
00:22:00,272 --> 00:22:02,039
Including Central City.

445
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:08,845
Yeah, but they're not moving or anything.

446
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:10,480
- They're just sitting there.
- For now.

447
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:13,650
So much for the truce
Secret Agent Man negotiated.

448
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:17,788
They're trying to leverage
us into handing Barry over.

449
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,656
Contact the Dominators.

450
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:23,727
Looks like your friend's
not calling you back.

451
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:25,696
No, he's not, but I got a plan B.

452
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:28,098
- Okay.
- If this came from the dropship

453
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,666
and the dropship came
from the mother ship,

454
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:31,702
theoretically, I could use
it to vibe us up there.

455
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,470
And if you can't?

456
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,806
Then I'd be vibing us into the cold,

457
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:37,607
unforgiving vacuum of space.

458
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:39,876
- So let's not do that.
- Yeah, let's not. Okay.

459
00:22:51,523 --> 00:22:54,191
What an unusual gift.

460
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:57,461
You appear to be a meta-human as well.

461
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:59,496
Yeah, well, I figured
you'd cut me some slack,

462
00:22:59,498 --> 00:23:02,332
seeing as how we saved you back in 1951.

463
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:03,800
Remember that?

464
00:23:03,802 --> 00:23:05,469
Much has changed on your planet

465
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,537
in the last 60 years.

466
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:11,508
The threat of your kind
has become imminent.

467
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,410
Listen, E.T. We're not a threat.

468
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:15,779
Metas are protecting this planet.

469
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:17,914
And besides, the guy who
tortured your ugly ass

470
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,816
back in 1951 was human.

471
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:23,153
But what happens when a man like him

472
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:26,490
inherits abilities like yours?

473
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:31,695
We have seen it happen on
countless other worlds,

474
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:35,832
which is why we must
exterminate your kind

475
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:39,136
before the scourge of your planet

476
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:42,839
becomes the scourge of ours.

477
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:50,414
Well, he's out of his giant mind.

478
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,775
What if he's right?

479
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,050
What if, in using our powers
to make the world better,

480
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:55,886
we actually end up destroying it?

481
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:57,454
Dude, I get it. Barry screwed up.

482
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:59,122
Yeah, so did we.

483
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:00,791
Back in 1951.

484
00:24:01,827 --> 00:24:03,727
We messed with time

485
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:05,395
when we freed the Dominator.

486
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:07,130
Who's now coming to kill us.

487
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:14,471
This whole time, I've been mad at Barry,

488
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:17,474
and now I'm the one who messed with time.

489
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:24,114
I just wanted to make things right,

490
00:24:24,116 --> 00:24:26,917
and we ended up making them worse.

491
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:34,491
I'm an idiot.

492
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:38,295
Can't stabilize the nanomolecular reaction.

493
00:24:39,331 --> 00:24:40,857
Damn it!

494
00:24:44,436 --> 00:24:45,802
Well...

495
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:49,139
Speaking as a daughter,

496
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:52,342
I'm not sure that outburst had
anything to do with our project.

497
00:24:52,344 --> 00:24:54,244
What, you think it's related to me?

498
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:56,379
She doesn't know that you
think she's an Aberration.

499
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:58,982
All she knows is that her father
is keeping her at arm's length.

500
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:00,717
The world is being invaded by aliens.

501
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,919
I don't think this is the
time for family therapy.

502
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:06,256
It is, when the world's best
chance at a workable weapon

503
00:25:06,258 --> 00:25:09,159
is focused on getting
her daddy to love her.

504
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:18,635
Lily?

505
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:23,039
I'm sorry.

506
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:26,343
Mom always said I got my temper from you.

507
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:30,780
No, no. I'm the one who owes the apology.

508
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:32,916
If it feels like I've
been keeping my distance,

509
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:36,186
I assure you, it's nothing personal.

510
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:38,955
Yeah, it... It feels personal.

511
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:42,792
No, I mean, it's not personal to you.

512
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:44,761
I'm sorry. I wish I could explain,

513
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:47,397
but my life has gotten
rather complicated lately.

514
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,299
So?

515
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:52,515
You raised me to enjoy complexity.

516
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,839
That's...

517
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,041
The nanomolecular reaction
keeps breaking down

518
00:25:58,043 --> 00:26:01,278
because the replication
is sequential, not...

519
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,847
Exponential.

520
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:07,484
The reaction requires greater complexity.

521
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:09,085
Yeah.

522
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,692
Why are you looking at me like that?

523
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,395
Because I truly believe

524
00:26:18,397 --> 00:26:21,464
I'm seeing you for the first time.

525
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,705
What is it?

526
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,576
My friend Barry.

527
00:26:32,578 --> 00:26:35,445
He's about to do something terrible.

528
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:39,049
This isn't up for debate.

529
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:42,352
It's not even a close call. I mean...

530
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:43,787
Turn myself over to the Dominators,

531
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:46,122
they leave the rest of the world alone.

532
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:48,258
Simple.

533
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,385
No, it's not simple.

534
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,161
Barry, it doesn't matter
what you've done.

535
00:26:51,163 --> 00:26:52,252
You can't do this.

536
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,230
It's been an honor to know all of you,

537
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:56,333
to fight alongside of you.

538
00:26:56,335 --> 00:26:59,970
Now it's up to you to keep our home safe.

539
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:06,576
Barry!

540
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:08,979
I'm not letting you leave.

541
00:27:10,282 --> 00:27:13,149
No offense, Oliver, but
you and what army?

542
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:18,054
This one.

543
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,993
Listen, Red. I don't like you.

544
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:24,961
But when you got a crew,

545
00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:27,430
you don't take a hit for the rest.

546
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,440
That was actually pretty inspiring.

547
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:38,738
I mean, up until the point

548
00:27:38,763 --> 00:27:40,910
that Mick compared us to a
bunch of criminals, but...

549
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:43,980
According to the Dominators,
we might as well be.

550
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:45,548
And maybe they're right.

551
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,983
Maybe we do more harm than good,

552
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:49,486
but this is our chance to find out.

553
00:27:49,488 --> 00:27:52,055
We're not letting you sacrifice yourself.

554
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,923
There's no way.

555
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:56,326
I don't care if that's
what it means to be a hero.

556
00:27:56,328 --> 00:27:59,029
You're not a hero to me.

557
00:28:00,332 --> 00:28:02,532
You're my friend.

558
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:06,136
Yo. Guys.

559
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:08,738
You know that ship that
landed in Central City?

560
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,341
It's opening up.

561
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:16,646
Here we go.

562
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:25,578
Reading reports of ships
opening all over the world.

563
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,166
- Oh, frak.
- Talk to me.

564
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:29,182
Something from the Dominators'
mothership just broke atmo,

565
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:31,017
and, not to get too technical,
but it's really, really big

566
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,285
and falling to Earth really, really fast.

567
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:33,359
It's the meta-bomb.

568
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:34,874
Why would the uglies drop ships on us

569
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,600
if they're just planning
on blowing us up?

570
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,825
Because the ships were a distraction

571
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:41,427
to keep us from stopping the meta-bomb.

572
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:46,165
Too bad, 'cause we're gonna stop it.

573
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:47,734
We're gonna stop it, right?

574
00:28:47,736 --> 00:28:49,135
Let's hope.

575
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,339
We have to keep the Dominators at bay.

576
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:54,232
This might help.

577
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:56,109
I've mass-produced a small device

578
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,977
that, when placed
on individual Dominators,

579
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:00,046
will cause indescribable agony.

580
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:02,882
Not the nicest invention,
but this is war.

581
00:29:02,884 --> 00:29:03,916
Nice going.

582
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:04,774
The caveat, of course,

583
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,218
is that if we activate the weapons

584
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:09,022
before all the devices are
placed on the Dominators,

585
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:10,523
they'll know what we're up to.

586
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:12,292
Well, we got to do it fast.

587
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,093
Only way I know how.

588
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:19,799
Whoa.

589
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,768
- Damn, that's big.

590
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,636
I didn't think it was gonna be so big.

591
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,438
- What are we gonna do?
- You got me.

592
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,675
I only know how to stab,
punch, or skewer things.

593
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:06,646
Fry, you freaks!

594
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,831
See you later, Dominator.

595
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,955
This thing has to have
a tractor beam, right?

596
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:50,022
Yep.

597
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,767
It's slowing down, but, like, barely.

598
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:03,836
Thank you, Cisco. I haven't noticed.

599
00:31:03,838 --> 00:31:05,204
Strap in.

600
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,174
Firestorm, if you're done playing

601
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:09,475
with your friends out there,

602
00:31:09,477 --> 00:31:10,810
we could really use your help.

603
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:12,178
- I'm on it.

604
00:31:27,862 --> 00:31:29,762
Oof!

605
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:51,617
Good work planting Professor
Stein's nano-weapons,

606
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,953
but we still got Dominators
all over the country.

607
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,656
This looks like a job for Supergirl.

608
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,394
Thanks, Felicity.

609
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:02,995
I'm not the least bit insulted.

610
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:04,864
Ah, sorry. I meant Supergirl and Flash.

611
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:06,499
This is totally a job for the both of you.

612
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:09,635
That's what I meant.
Supergirl and... Flash.

613
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:16,876
Firestorm, we're holding it up.

614
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:20,646
- But, like, barely.
- Not helping, Cisco.

615
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:25,184
- Firestorm, do it now!
- Do what?

616
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:26,953
I believe Ms. Lance intends for us

617
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:29,288
to transmute the meta-bomb
into something harmless.

618
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,991
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

619
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:43,903
All right, devices are being planted.

620
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:46,572
Let me know when I can bring the pain.

621
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:49,775
Come on, Firestorm.

622
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:55,448
Grey, I can't do it, man. It's too big.

623
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,884
Still waiting on that signal.

624
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,487
Do it!

625
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,757
Done.

626
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:11,297
- It's working.
- What about the superhero bomb?

627
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:17,270
I can't! I can't do it!

628
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:18,804
You must, Jefferson.

629
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:20,473
I have a daughter.

630
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:23,142
Her name is Lily,
and she's counting on you.

631
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:25,678
She's counting on both of us.

632
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,556
They did it!

633
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:39,158
They can do that?

634
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,893
They did that.

635
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,762
Ground, what's your status?

636
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:50,202
They're retreating.

637
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:51,837
It's not just them.

638
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:55,975
It's all around the world.

639
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,251
He did it.

640
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:08,487
- No, Oliver...
- We all did it.

641
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,846
Many responsibilities have fallen to me

642
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:32,017
since the president's passing
at the beginning of this crisis.

643
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:36,088
Sobering, sad responsibilities.

644
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,324
This is not one of them.

645
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:43,436
Today, it is my distinct
honor to bestow upon you

646
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:47,032
a small acknowledgement of the great debt

647
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:49,119
that the world owes to you all.

648
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:51,578
Is it just me, or is she really hot?

649
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,481
Although your brave efforts
must remain a secret...

650
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:55,682
She's hot.

651
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:58,418
Know that, meta-human or not,

652
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,555
masked or not,

653
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:05,826
each and every one of you is a hero.

654
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:14,167
Whoo!

655
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:15,669
Whoa.

656
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:16,937
Thank you.

657
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:23,844
Hmm, hmm? Let's go drink.

658
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:25,078
Cheers.

659
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:31,918
It's like looking into a mirror.

660
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,453
Yeah, you know what's funny?

661
00:35:33,455 --> 00:35:36,523
She really kind of looks like my cousin.

662
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:39,626
- Hey, hey. Guys.
- Hey.

663
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:41,328
Either of you ever save
the world before?

664
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,130
- Mm-hmm.
- Last year.

665
00:35:43,132 --> 00:35:44,631
It doesn't get old, does it?

666
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,841
Nope. It sure beats
screwing up the world.

667
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:48,911
Hey, you are too hard on yourself.

668
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:50,437
That's what people usually tell me.

669
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,806
And for good reason, I'm sure.

670
00:35:52,808 --> 00:35:56,743
But, back on my Earth,
it's just me and my cousin.

671
00:35:56,745 --> 00:35:58,945
Between the two of us,
we're more powerful than...

672
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:00,614
Yeah, everybody in this room combined.

673
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,116
No, no. That's the point.

674
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:06,086
That's what you've all proven here.

675
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:09,890
Meta-humans an not, superpowers or not,

676
00:36:09,892 --> 00:36:12,759
you are Earth's mightiest heroes.

677
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,262
Um...

678
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:18,031
I owe you an apology.

679
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:22,435
Keeping you at arm's length
was the wrong move, and...

680
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:24,171
Well, the truth is that this Earth

681
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:26,173
could probably use a Supergirl.

682
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:28,141
Well, that's... that's funny,
'cause I was just thinking

683
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:30,544
my Earth could use an Oliver Queen.

684
00:36:33,682 --> 00:36:36,149
I know you said you don't get unnerved...

685
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:40,086
But if you did,

686
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:45,058
I think hardship is what
makes us stronger.

687
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,626
That's probably why these people

688
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,562
look to you as their rock.

689
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:51,731
You guys feeling the group hug?

690
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:53,466
- No.
- Come on. Come on.

691
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:56,069
All right.

692
00:36:57,806 --> 00:36:59,239
Hey, Kara.

693
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:01,007
- I made you something.
- What?

694
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:02,609
- Cisco.
- Yeah.

695
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,047
What, uh... What is it?

696
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:08,582
Oh, it's a...

697
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:10,550
It's an inter-dimensional extrapolator.

698
00:37:10,552 --> 00:37:12,752
- Oh, I...
- It creates small breaches,

699
00:37:12,754 --> 00:37:15,155
so you can use it to
cross over to our universe

700
00:37:15,157 --> 00:37:16,456
any time you need to.

701
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:19,593
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

702
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:21,861
I also included
communication functionality,

703
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:25,565
so if you ever need any help,
you can always contact the team.

704
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,200
Hey, Skirt.

705
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:28,802
Call me.

706
00:37:39,848 --> 00:37:42,582
All right, Grey. Spill.

707
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:44,284
How is it you have a kid?

708
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:45,652
I didn't think I had to explain

709
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:47,020
such matters to you, Jefferson.

710
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:48,989
Come on. You know what I mean.

711
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:53,793
When we traveled back to 1987,

712
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:55,962
I gave my younger self a lecture

713
00:37:55,964 --> 00:38:00,066
about neglecting Clarissa, and he...

714
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:03,837
And he followed your advice
all the way to pound town.

715
00:38:05,173 --> 00:38:06,306
Wait.

716
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:08,375
You created an Aberration.

717
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:10,477
Which is why you cannot tell the team.

718
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,878
If you don't want me to tell the team,

719
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,747
that means you...

720
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:20,253
I do not want to lose my daughter.

721
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:29,262
Something tells me you
weren't invited here.

722
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:31,631
- Dr. Heywood.
- Don't “Dr. Heywood” me.

723
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,009
What the hell are you doing here?

724
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,835
I like parties,
and I'm here for the mop-up.

725
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:38,838
Cover-up. But you can't cover this up.

726
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,540
Agent Smith!

727
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:42,309
It's so funny seeing you here.

728
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:43,943
I was just having the loveliest chat

729
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:45,712
with your president about you.

730
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:47,213
I was telling her, on my Earth,

731
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:49,316
we have a Department of
Extranormal Operations,

732
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:52,252
which deals specifically with aliens.

733
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:54,421
She thought as an excellent idea.

734
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:55,989
She also loved my pitch

735
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:58,692
about reassigning you to Antarctica.

736
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,499
Maybe next time, you're a little nicer

737
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:08,935
to strange visitors from another planet.

738
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,406
Pack a jacket!

739
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,675
You ready to see if Cisco's gadget works?

740
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:17,110
Ready.

741
00:39:17,112 --> 00:39:19,479
And remember, if you guys ever need me,

742
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:20,847
I'm just a call away.

743
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:22,115
Same here.

744
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:36,796
It's weird to think
that all of this started

745
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:39,366
with the two of us.

746
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:41,301
You ever think what it would be like

747
00:39:41,303 --> 00:39:42,969
if we never got on that boat?

748
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:45,905
I don't know if I have to think about it.

749
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:47,407
I mean, maybe the Dominators showed us

750
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:49,642
what our lives would have been like.

751
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:53,736
I know it was a prison, but in a way...

752
00:39:53,761 --> 00:39:55,961
In a way, it was a gift.

753
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:04,858
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah.

754
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:13,199
There she goes, off to her spaceship,

755
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:16,136
time traveling as if it's totally normal.

756
00:40:16,138 --> 00:40:18,338
Well, John, it's like you said.

757
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,073
Normal sort of went out the window

758
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:22,542
when this one arrived.

759
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:26,579
I may never understand you, man, but...

760
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:29,015
you're one of the best men I know.

761
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:30,483
Thanks, Dig.

762
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,326
So... you forgive me for what I did?

763
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,324
Barry, it's like I keep telling this guy.

764
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:40,493
You have to forgive yourself.

765
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:42,529
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

766
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:44,397
Yeah, thanks.

767
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:47,967
Well, we got to do this more often.

768
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:49,484
Get together, I mean.

769
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:51,504
I don't know if the world could take it.

770
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:54,007
I meant, like, without the
world being threatened.

771
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:57,043
If the world wasn't being threatened,

772
00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:59,546
what would we do?

773
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:04,484
I'm just saying,

774
00:41:04,486 --> 00:41:06,586
next time, I'm gonna get you.

775
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:08,254
I'm just saying, I beat you twice.

776
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:11,090
- The first time was a tie.
- And the second time?

777
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:13,526
There were no witnesses the second time.

778
00:41:15,464 --> 00:41:17,897
Superspeed arrow duels...

779
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:20,233
Our lives aren't exactly normal.

780
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:25,338
I told Kara that I was
looking to reclaim some normal.

781
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:30,176
Thinking on it now, I'm... I'm not so sure.

782
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:32,078
I know what you mean.

783
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,516
We both got a look at what
life would look like normal.

784
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:38,751
It would've been happy.

785
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:40,854
But not full.

786
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:44,257
No. No, nowhere close.

787
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:48,394
To things not being normal.

788
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:49,762
To life being full.

789
00:41:57,841 --> 00:42:03,571
