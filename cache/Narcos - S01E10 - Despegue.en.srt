1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:21,106
When the public
found out about the excessive lifestyle

3
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:23,191
of the prisoners at La Catedral,

4
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:27,320
the police began an investigation
into the supposed capital crimes

5
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:30,490
being committed by Pablo Escobar
within the prison walls.

6
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:34,745
The central part of this investigation
involves the disappearance

7
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:36,872
of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.

8
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,710
- Agent Peña?
- What's this?

9
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:43,295
It's from upstairs.

10
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:45,547
Oh, I get a card.

11
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:50,051
Oh, CIA.

12
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:52,763
"Congratulations,
Central Intelligence Agency."

13
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:56,057
This is, uh... this is blowing up
a little bit more than we expected, no?

14
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,977
Well, hopefully,
the son of a bitch rots in jail.

15
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,562
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.

16
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,148
- I forbade you to leak this.
- How do you know it was us?

17
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,818
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.

18
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:08,570
Whoever did this, it doesn't really
matter now. What's done is done.

19
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:12,491
Ambassador, like you said, this is
a Colombian matter. What do we care?

20
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:15,368
I'm filing a report with the
Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.

21
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:17,370
- Ambassador...
- Good, report to Washington.

22
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,790
'Cause if something isn't done,
every American down here

23
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:22,835
associated with the government
is gonna look like a fool, including you.

24
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:26,839
I wasn't finished. Until further notice,
you're both suspended.

25
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:28,465
Go home.

26
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:32,552
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?

27
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,932
Mr. President,
I just spoke with the attorney general.

28
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:41,770
Moncada's wife reported
his disappearance from La Catedral.

29
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:45,231
It's clear that Escobar
killed those men in that prison.

30
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:50,946
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,033
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.

32
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,367
Forgive me, Eduardo...

33
00:01:56,326 --> 00:02:00,288
but I'm having a hard time
finding the silver lining in all this.

34
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:05,335
This is our opportunity
to end Pablo's vacation.

35
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,525
- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.

36
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,496
Ahh!

37
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:58,217
Good morning, boss.

38
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,137
Bad news.

39
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,033
Have the bodies disappeared?

40
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:38,173
Our agreement with him states
he can't be moved to another prison.

41
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:42,761
Excuse me, but killing people in prison
is a direct violation of our agreement.

42
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,888
Yes, yes,
but we have to tread carefully.

43
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:48,308
If he feels we're violating his terms,

44
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,144
he'll start putting bombs
on street corners again.

45
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:58,318
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats
against him from his biggest enemies.

46
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,613
That would give us the opportunity
to bring him to Bogotá

47
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,365
while we improve security
at La Catedral.

48
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:10,997
The fourth brigade,
commanded by General Ariza,

49
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:13,416
would be the best choice
to carry out this operation.

50
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,585
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.

51
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,463
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:19,589
Hm.

53
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,221
Can we trust him?

54
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,140
Yes, sir.

55
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,058
Success.

56
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,981
Sure, it cost me a suspension,
but who cares?

57
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:39,276
I just call it a week's paternity leave.

58
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,947
I was ready to crack a beer
and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.

59
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,574
See, because of me and Peña,

60
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,953
the Colombian government
was sending in the army.

61
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,580
Not the cops,
but the fucking army.

62
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,836
There was no way that Escobar
was getting out of this one.

63
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,173
But, then again, in Colombia...

64
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,967
nothing goes down
the way you think it will.

65
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:39,419
I'm calling him.

66
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:47,260
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.

67
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:55,601
I was just thinking
there's nothing in the world I'd love more

68
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:57,520
than to hear my wife's lovely voice.

69
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,939
Pablo, what's happening?

70
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:02,567
Why would something
be happening here?

71
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,818
The soldiers.

72
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:06,029
Soldiers?

73
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:10,116
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.

74
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,743
I don't know, Pablo.

75
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:15,372
Tell me what's happening.

76
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,167
No, my love, it's nothing.

77
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:20,919
Everything is cool.

78
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,799
I'll call back soon, all right?

79
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,845
I love you, baby.

80
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,474
Yes, my love.

81
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,864
Get out the weapons.

82
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:53,452
As you wish, sir.

83
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,687
Listen up, company!

84
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:26,359
You will be under the command
of Lieutenant Dominguez.

85
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,779
Let's secure the perimeter.

86
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,949
Tell your men
they have orders to shoot anyone

87
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:37,329
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- As you wish, General.

88
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:38,579
Dismissed.

89
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:44,002
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.

90
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,629
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!

91
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:50,425
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here

92
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:53,428
to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?

93
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:57,349
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!

94
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,351
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!

95
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,818
The car was
outside the garage, still idling,

96
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,153
the keys still in the ignition.

97
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:13,114
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?

98
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,992
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good. Don't.

99
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,327
What? Why not?

100
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:22,332
Nothing. I just... I don't wanna
ring any alarms before I check things out.

101
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,917
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...

102
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:28,213
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.

103
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm gonna take care of this.

104
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:35,053
I'll find out where he is, all right?

105
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,472
Look, I'll make you a drink.

106
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,277
Boss...

107
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,071
they're gonna
try to take you out of here

108
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:56,157
and look for evidence
on Moncada and Galeano.

109
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,784
If I leave this place,
someone will kill me.

110
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:04,416
Or the Americans will use their power to
restore extradition and send me to the US.

111
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,380
What the fuck,
let's give those bastards lead.

112
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,049
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.

113
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,926
For every one of our men,
they have 20!

114
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,012
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot. Wait for the boss!

115
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:20,806
Stop bickering in front of the boss.

116
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,226
We have the escape routes.

117
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:26,771
We could get into the hills
before they even know we're gone.

118
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:36,573
There is a time to fight...

119
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,951
and there is a time to be clever.

120
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,495
Yes, sir.

121
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:47,875
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.

122
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,502
Be smart.

123
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,632
Try to settle this matter peacefully.

124
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:58,344
If that fails?

125
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,518
What are you doing back here?

126
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,521
- I forgot my socks.
- I want you out in five minutes.

127
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,569
Son of a bitch. These Colombians
are knee-deep in a shit storm.

128
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,070
We gotta talk.

129
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:18,739
Back here.

130
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,453
What? You get a hooker pregnant?

131
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:25,622
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.

132
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,124
I checked all area hospitals,
police stations.

133
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,792
We were pursuing leads
on the Cali cartel.

134
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,752
It could be related to that,
or it could be Escobar.

135
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,713
Did you report it
to the Regional Security Office?

136
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,840
If I tell the ROS,
it becomes a five-alarm fire,

137
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,634
and whoever has him might panic.

138
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:40,845
If it is Escobar,
he's dead already.

139
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,724
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?

140
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:48,102
Jesus Christ.

141
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,605
Let me see what I can do.

142
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,320
General Ariza
has orders to secure Escobar.

143
00:12:57,403 --> 00:13:01,533
I want you to go there
and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.

144
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:05,077
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.

145
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,830
You'll reiterate
that this is a temporary relocation

146
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,083
while we renovate La Catedral
to make it safer for him.

147
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,127
We both know that's not true.

148
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:18,924
But it's what you'll tell Escobar
until he's safely inside a military brig.

149
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:20,885
Yes, Mr. President.

150
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:23,304
What's wrong?

151
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,851
I've got a bad feeling about this.

152
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,438
Eduardo, I trust you...

153
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:37,235
and this is too important to leave
to someone I don't trust completely.

154
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,408
I'm at your service,
Mr. President.

155
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,326
You know that very well.

156
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,455
Nothing will make me happier than to see
that asshole get the justice he deserves.

157
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:02,802
Checked my sources with the Colombian
military. Nobody knows jack shit.

158
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,347
So no indication Escobar had anything
to do with Murphy's disappearance?

159
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,557
It's time to sound the alarm.

160
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:11,936
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?

161
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,441
We call out the troops,
he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.

162
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:18,777
Thanks.

163
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,757
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet

164
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,967
until further notice, understand?

165
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,595
All right. What else do you have?

166
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:49,766
- I know that.
- Velasco.

167
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,434
I'll call you back.

168
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:54,145
Yes, boss?

169
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,022
What's happening outside?

170
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,026
We don't know.

171
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,871
I fucked up.

172
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,165
What's that, boss?

173
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,878
Gather the boys.

174
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:25,510
And tell the prison guards they're
to fire on anyone who tries to come in.

175
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:31,599
Boss, do you think the prison guards
will follow your orders?

176
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:35,561
They'd better. I hired them.

177
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:41,275
Excuse me. Boss, the people
from Medellín just informed me

178
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:44,904
that some guy named
Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.

179
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,032
Mm.

180
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,896
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?

181
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,022
General!

182
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,233
Let him through.

183
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,151
Good evening, General.

184
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,114
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?

185
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,909
Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.

186
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,037
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?

187
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,707
Inside the prison, obviously.

188
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,834
What do you mean,
he's in the prison?

189
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:42,879
I thought you were taking him into custody
when you arrived.

190
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:46,507
I'm sorry, sir,
but those were not my orders.

191
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,718
Then what were your orders?

192
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,680
My orders were to secure the perimeter,
not let anyone in or out,

193
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:54,473
and wait for you.

194
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,602
That's not what the president believes.

195
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:01,105
He's not going to be happy
to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.

196
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,024
I'm sorry,
but those were my orders.

197
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:11,908
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.

198
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:18,247
But since there is
no justice in this country,

199
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,458
he is the vice minister of nothing.

200
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,756
This is good.

201
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,135
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.

202
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,057
This is very good.

203
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:42,855
General, I don't believe
you understand your orders clearly.

204
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:46,818
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?

205
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:49,528
I'm going to try
to make a miracle happen.

206
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:53,491
I'm going in there to convince Escobar
this is a temporary transfer of location.

207
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:57,202
And I'm also going to say
that I'm here to guarantee his safety.

208
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:00,498
I can't allow you
to put yourself in danger.

209
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,752
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough
to kill the vice minister of justice

210
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:09,423
right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.

211
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,093
At least let me make a call
so they don't shoot you when you walk in!

212
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,848
Make it fast. Open the door.
You two are coming with me.

213
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,935
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door! General!

214
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,521
Listen to the vice minister! Hurry up!

215
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,772
Open it.

216
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,545
Vice Minister, good evening.

217
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:51,298
Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.

218
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,094
Wait here.

219
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,771
Good evening, Vice Minister.

220
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,233
It's been a while.

221
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:14,655
Good evening.

222
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:20,036
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.

223
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,081
My orders are to escort you
to a temporary prison in Bogotá.

224
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:26,166
The government has decided to make
some improvements here at La Catedral

225
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,627
for your safety
and everyone else's here.

226
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:29,837
Mm.

227
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:35,927
I would think Gaviria
could come up with a more believable lie.

228
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:42,892
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.

229
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,436
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.

230
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:49,523
And why should the government care
about some dispute between gangsters?

231
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,358
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.

232
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:55,071
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.

233
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,492
If your safety is a concern,
I will gladly escort you out myself.

234
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:04,830
We have an agreement,
and you're breaking it.

235
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,750
What guarantee do I have
that the Americans won't kidnap me

236
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,209
and take me to the US?

237
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:13,297
Bush would be very happy
to stick me in a gringo jail,

238
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,634
like he did to Lehder,
like he did to Noriega, right?

239
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,594
That's not gonna happen,
you have my word.

240
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,220
- Your word.
- Mm.

241
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,559
As vice minister of justice?

242
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:30,773
Yes. I give you my word
as vice minister of justice.

243
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:35,402
Haven't you noticed that the army
has completely surrounded this jail?

244
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,365
We can end this peacefully...

245
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:43,953
if you just cooperate
and walk out with me.

246
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:45,830
Don Pablo,
these bastards will kill you!

247
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,421
I respectfully decline your offer,
Vice Minister.

248
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,719
The press is saying I killed those men,
but that's a lie to sell newspapers.

249
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,976
If Gaviria wants me out of here...

250
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,482
he can come here...
and do it himself.

251
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,112
Meanwhile...

252
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:24,118
I'll view any incursion
as a declaration of war.

253
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,343
I'll inform the president
of your position.

254
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,349
Excuse me.

255
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,072
Mr. Vice Minister.

256
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:07,245
Why walk all that way
when I have a telephone in my office?

257
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,544
I'd rather call the president
from outside the prison, thanks.

258
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,302
Let me out!

259
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:27,723
Surely your mother taught you
never to turn down a polite invitation.

260
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,438
My mother taught me
an invitation is optional.

261
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:38,525
I hope you'll forgive me
for making this invitation mandatory.

262
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:44,364
It's not every day we're honored with the
presence of a vice minister of justice.

263
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,621
Come on, Vice Minister.

264
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,082
Calm down, let's go.

265
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:04,343
Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?

266
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,345
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.

267
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,098
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?

268
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,729
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,275
Just trying to hold it together.

270
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,948
God, I just wanna go home.

271
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,660
I want my husband back.

272
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,006
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.

273
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,929
No.

274
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,599
You're just not sure he's dead.

275
00:23:58,356 --> 00:24:01,317
What's taking this guy so long?

276
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,154
General, with all due respect,

277
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:08,532
I don't think we should've
let him go inside.

278
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,744
No.

279
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:16,957
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough
to fuck with the vice minister.

280
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,642
Can I get you something to drink?

281
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,229
I don't need anything.

282
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:41,023
Look, don't be so nervous.

283
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,279
As soon as you have the president
on the phone, you will make it clear

284
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:52,534
that if he doesn't remove the troops
surrounding the prison immediately,

285
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,454
there will be grave consequences.

286
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,292
But if he withdraws the troops,

287
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:04,463
we'll stay here quietly
and complete our sentence.

288
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,478
Good evening,
President Gaviria's office.

289
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:23,274
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.

290
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:24,900
One minute, please.

291
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,034
Mr. President,
excuse the interruption.

292
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:36,912
There is a call from
Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.

293
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,291
- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.

294
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,176
Hello?

295
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,055
Hello?

296
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:00,936
How long will I be here
as a hostage?

297
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:05,774
You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.

298
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,245
Escobar has Sandoval
inside the prison.

299
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:20,539
Hang up right now,
Mr. President.

300
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,167
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.

301
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,502
Mr. President,
hang up the phone.

302
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:27,796
If Escobar knows you're on the line,
he might force you to strike a bargain.

303
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,508
Or worse, if you lie to him,
he might kill Eduardo.

304
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,177
Hang up the phone. Sir!

305
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:42,769
Leave us alone.

306
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,153
- They hung up.
- Bullshit.

307
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,779
Shut up!

308
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,119
So, then...

309
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:04,875
the president is too busy
to speak with me.

310
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,046
I don't understand
how he ended up in that jail.

311
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,131
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.

312
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,301
What did he think, that he could convince
Escobar he was there to help him?

313
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:17,846
We agreed that Ariza
would have Escobar in custody.

314
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,640
Ariza must've had his reasons
for holding off.

315
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,603
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.

316
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,105
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.

317
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:32,194
Please, I suggest we call DAS
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.

318
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,988
Do I have your permission?

319
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,410
Good.

320
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:47,751
María Clara,
connect me with DAS, immediately.

321
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:51,338
- No. No.
- Cancel the call.

322
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:57,177
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.

323
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,222
If Sandoval dies...

324
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,726
I will have it on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

325
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:08,772
But my country comes first,
and I will not empower Escobar.

326
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,903
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.

327
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,826
I just realized something.

328
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:26,706
The president didn't just betray me...

329
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,418
he also betrayed you.

330
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,214
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.

331
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,133
There would be three options.

332
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:40,679
I leave with you, peacefully.

333
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:44,349
I take you hostage.

334
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,145
I shoot you,

335
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:53,358
and then, he really would
have a good excuse to kill me.

336
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,610
Right?

337
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,204
Either way, he wins. Right?

338
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,833
Maybe the president
is betraying us both.

339
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,876
You could be right.

340
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,878
But you know something?

341
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:17,841
I'll sacrifice my life
to make sure you're dead.

342
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:29,811
You think you're better than me,
but you're wrong.

343
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,359
I come from nothing.

344
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,904
I fought hard
to become what I am.

345
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:47,329
If the government
hadn't come after me...

346
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:53,210
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.

347
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:59,341
You and I are nothing alike.

348
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,427
You are a criminal.

349
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,681
And criminals can't run forever.

350
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,518
Sir.

351
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:28,453
Your friend Gaviria has ordered
Special Forces to raid the prison

352
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:31,081
while you're still inside.

353
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,126
I would have done the same thing.

354
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,193
Don't kill him.

355
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:08,326
If he dies... it will be
at the hands of his own government.

356
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,210
Good luck, Vice Minister.

357
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,120
Now what?

358
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,164
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.

359
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:55,707
Damn right we do.

360
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,543
Hey, partner.

361
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:03,089
Remember how I told you
that no one in their right mind

362
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,258
would ever kill a DEA agent?

363
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,178
Well, to be honest,
after they snatched me,

364
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:10,430
I'd forgotten that, myself.

365
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:14,934
But then, I calmed down and realized
that if they wanted to kill me,

366
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:18,104
they would've blown my brains out
right in front of my house.

367
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:21,107
This... was something different.

368
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,822
I figured this was Escobar
knowing that they were coming to get him,

369
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,408
and grabbing me.

370
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,119
Sit.

371
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:39,209
Man, you fucked up. You think
that they're gonna make a trade for me?

372
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,711
No. No!

373
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:45,089
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin'
prison and blow his fuckin' head off!

374
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,143
I'm sorry
you were taken against your will,

375
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:01,773
but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly,
given your last meeting with Navegante.

376
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,656
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see
your Cali cartel is doing so well,

377
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,449
but you've made a huge mistake.

378
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,827
I don't see it that way.

379
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,124
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking
the liberty of making you a cocktail.

380
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:24,337
I just learned how to do a really
interesting passion fruit daiquiri.

381
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,965
That's wonderful,
but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.

382
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:30,594
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.

383
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:33,972
Fine. I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.

384
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:37,308
I thought you might
like to see some pictures I have.

385
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:59,080
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you
calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo

386
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:02,876
to ID a location
where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.

387
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,879
Two hours later, they were dead.

388
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:12,636
Along with an innocent woman.

389
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:23,647
OK.

390
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:28,192
Poison will be at La Dispensaria

391
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,194
at around midnight with his crew.

392
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,786
Who's your contact at the embassy?

393
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:40,538
Did you know she had two kids?

394
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:44,417
What do you think our newspapers
will think of that?

395
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:50,715
Our government doesn't take too kindly
to American-backed death squads.

396
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,260
I could blackmail you
with these pictures.

397
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,972
You'd lose your career at the DEA,

398
00:34:57,055 --> 00:35:01,685
go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.

399
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,354
But don't worry.

400
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:06,773
I won't ask you or Javier Peña

401
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,985
to cross any line
you haven't already crossed.

402
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:14,739
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel
would be a good match.

403
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:18,076
There are many,
in every segment of Colombia,

404
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,829
who have been persecuted
by Pablo Escobar.

405
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,956
The families of Moncada and Galeano,

406
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,084
the families of judges and police...

407
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,587
people with resources
who need to be unified.

408
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,589
They want vengeance.

409
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:34,467
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.

410
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:41,599
I can't make any commitments right now.

411
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,936
But I can tell you this:

412
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,482
When Pablo goes down,
and he will go down...

413
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,485
you'll hear a knock at your door,

414
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,988
and it'll be me.

415
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:04,288
You haven't tried my daiquiri.

416
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,042
That Herrera's a pretty good host.

417
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:11,004
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you
door-to-door service right to the embassy.

418
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:13,548
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?

419
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,050
What'd he say?

420
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:18,136
You fuckin' gave him that information.

421
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:21,014
He's got pictures on me,
he's got tape on me, Javi.

422
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:26,519
Answer me.

423
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:30,273
- What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?

424
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:33,568
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?

425
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:36,362
That your version of "all in"?

426
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:40,491
Get Escobar.

427
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:44,370
That's not an answer.

428
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,958
Who gave him the fucking photos?

429
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,045
Hey.

430
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:03,807
See you around, Jav.

431
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,559
I'm gonna go call my wife.

432
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,804
Sir, I have her on the line.

433
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,352
- Hello, my love.
- Hello.

434
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:53,606
Look, we're having
a little problem here.

435
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,528
We're trying to solve it,
but you know what to do...

436
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:01,572
if it doesn't work out, right?

437
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:03,200
Yes, Pablo.

438
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,743
I love you very much.

439
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:08,872
Me, too.

440
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,500
- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.

441
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,944
We are bandits.

442
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:10,558
- Wait a minute! What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!

443
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,698
You've gotta get me out of here,
do you understand?

444
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:27,700
Come on, come on.

445
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:50,014
- Hurry up!
- Get down! No! Get in there!

446
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,830
Don't move, don't move!

447
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:31,848
- All clear!
- All clear!

448
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,975
- All clear!
- All clear!

449
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:58,582
- Don't move! Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.

450
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:03,129
Keep low, and no matter what happens,
keep moving.

451
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,183
Speak.

452
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,268
Yes, it's him.

453
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:19,979
Speak up, please,
I can't hear you.

454
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:21,731
Is that confirmed?

455
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,692
Wait a minute.

456
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:31,032
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.

457
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,495
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

458
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:43,794
And Escobar?

459
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:46,797
- All clear!
- All clear!

460
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:48,466
- All clear!
- All clear!

461
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,304
Look what we found.

462
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,231
Do you think he's OK?

463
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,610
I'm sure he's fine.

464
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,635
See you tomorrow.

465
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,138
Good night.

466
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:41,060
It's OK... it's OK.

467
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:42,979
It's OK.

468
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,149
Steve...

469
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,319
I just wanna go home.

470
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,997
This is home.

471
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,354
Less than an hour
after Escobar escaped La Catedral,

472
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:28,691
word had spread all over Colombia
that war was coming again.

473
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:31,194
But this time would be different.

474
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:34,322
This time,
there would be no surrender...

475
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:37,158
no negotiations...

476
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:38,909
no deals.

477
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:43,498
This time...
we were gonna kill him.

478
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:52,923
Escobar said, "Better a grave
in Colombia than a cell in the US."

479
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,927
Well, guess what, motherfucker?

480
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:59,180
That works for me.
