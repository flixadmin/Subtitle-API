1
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:55,771
Is there no one at home?

2
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:57,827
Grandma is. She's
hard of hearing.

3
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:01,267
Don't! That is her room.
This is mine!

4
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,600
-Good night!
-Hush!

5
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:06,100
I will be right back.

6
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:13,892
Chetan Bhagat! Chetan Bhagat!
Chetan Bhagat!

7
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:16,408
Oh!

8
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,768
The Perks of Being a Wallflower!
You read it?

9
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,100
I read the book. Watched the film.
And I am one!

10
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:26,670
What are you? A
wallflower or a perk?

11
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,642
You are a wallflower,
aren't you?

12
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:34,100
You find yourself a corner.
Hear and see everything

13
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:36,755
but never do anything.
I need to do something.

14
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,203
You read Sophie Kinsella?

15
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:43,127
I tried but couldn't finish.

16
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:43,913
Why?

17
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,985
It's too difficult Natasha
asked me to read it.

18
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:51,590
You understood Wallflower
and not Kinsella?

19
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,017
That was an easy read.

20
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,882
-A wallflower or a fly, it's the same.
-Wow!

21
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:58,461
Oh!

22
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,125
You are smart!

23
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,419
What's wrong?

24
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,115
Is this your first time?

25
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,282
Really?

26
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:38,888
Yes.

27
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:41,225
Let me teach you.

28
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:51,916
Coffee?

29
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:56,640
Tea?

30
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:11,636
What happened last night...

31
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,441
was good, right?

32
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,100
-Yes.
-Yes.

33
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:17,871
But it was fun, right?

34
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:20,848
It was natural, right?

35
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:24,580
Don't ruin it by
talking about it.

36
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,823
Don't talk about it.

37
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,831
I spoilt it by talking about it?

38
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,737
-You won't fall in love, right?
-No.

39
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,175
Don't over-think it.

40
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,746
Let's not make a
big deal out of it.

41
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:43,187
-Okay.
-All right?

42
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,058
I just really hope he
doesn't get emotional.

43
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:52,661
But...

44
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,339
Mihir told me that
the problem with guys

45
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,788
tend to get emotional after sex

46
00:06:57,948 --> 00:06:59,642
and they fall in love and...

47
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:02,293
you know, they get obsessed
and they start stalking you.

48
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,957
Like... why were you
talking with this guy...

49
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:07,519
why are you loafing
with that guy...

50
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,373
why don't you take
my phone calls?

51
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,909
I don't understand why they
can't separate between the two.

52
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:16,071
I'll see you in college?

53
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:16,813
Sure.

54
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,996
-Bye.
-Bye.

55
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:33,269
Hello! Sorry.

56
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,795
Sorry. Good afternoon.

57
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,216
Okay. Let's start where
we left yesterday.

58
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,307
What is it?

59
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,073
Why are you smiling?

60
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:56,996
Do we share a secret?

61
00:07:57,683 --> 00:07:58,461
No?

62
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:00,000
Page number 93.

63
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,851
Mihir and I got married,

64
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,271
when I was twenty-six.

65
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,395
He was 12 years older than me.

66
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,293
And Mihir was my
first boy friend.

67
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,838
I had never dated anyone.

68
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:14,778
But Mihir had dated many girls.

69
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:18,551
So it was an adventure for me...

70
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:21,767
marrying a guy twelve
years older than me.

71
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,201
My parents were against it.

72
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:26,543
He has so many stories to share!

73
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,939
Like he had gone somewhere...
there was a girl...

74
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,452
they saw each other...

75
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,876
and they started talking
and something happened.

76
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:36,950
His stories were
straight out of a movie.

77
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,083
It's like books.

78
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,945
I don't have any
of that in my life.

79
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:43,931
We talked and he made
me try to understand...

80
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,417
that you will
resent me if you...

81
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,750
meaning, I will resent him...
meaning...

82
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:52,584
if you did not live your life...
do what you wish...

83
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:54,975
Go and see... explore
what you feel...

84
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,626
Examine your life.

85
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:57,830
Like, take... Amrita Pritam...

86
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:01,510
She had a lover, Imroze,
who was younger than her.

87
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:03,645
They lived together,
they were happy together,

88
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:05,481
but the love of her life was...

89
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:06,843
Sahir Ludhyanvi.

90
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:08,414
Draupadi lived
with five Pandavas.

91
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:10,454
She loved them and perhaps,
they loved her too.

92
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:11,521
Meaning... whatever it is...

93
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,500
Mahabharata did not happen
between the Pandavas.

94
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,708
They all fought
for her together.

95
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:18,268
I feel like an animal, but
animals don't know sin.

96
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:21,189
I'm married and I cannot
be with anyone else.

97
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:23,305
What if I fantasize
about someone?

98
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:24,558
It's not okay.

99
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:27,338
How can you expect
everything from a person?

100
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,908
You want him to be your friend,

101
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:32,472
you play young with me,
you play older with me

102
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,965
like... I see something
else in Tejas...

103
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,208
and something else in Mihir.

104
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,876
Now can Mihir become Tejas
and Tejas become Mihir? No!

105
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:42,827
What do I do?

106
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:46,186
One more actress has
come out saying that

107
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:48,503
she was sexually
harasses by the producer.

108
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,889
It's good that they are
finally speaking out.

109
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:52,808
They remained silent
for so many years.

110
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,482
But how can they prove it?

111
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:57,058
People play the victim
card for publicity.

112
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:58,350
Did you read this?

113
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:01,407
American high school teacher jailed
for having sex with students.

114
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:04,198
The case opened when the
husband learnt of it.

115
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:05,433
He divorced her.

116
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:08,439
Here, we read that things
like that happen there often.

117
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:09,661
But it's wrong.

118
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:10,684
Just because it
keeps happening...

119
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:11,921
it's wrong. You cannot
say that it is okay.

120
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:14,512
Did you see the student's age?
The student must have an age?

121
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:17,238
-He is 18.
-So he is 18... an adult.

122
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,660
How does 18 justify it? If he is 18...
it's okay?

123
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,159
18 or 21...

124
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,065
you can't have a
relationship with a student.

125
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:25,081
That too a physical
relationship.

126
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:26,404
But at 18, he is an adult!

127
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:29,424
How do you know
it was consensual?

128
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,350
His silence means it
was not consensual.

129
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:35,361
If there is no consent,
then it is non-consensual.

130
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,236
Excuse me.

131
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,044
-Tejas Bhave?
-Yes.

132
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,389
I need to talk to you.

133
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:47,524
Don't you think she is weird?

134
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,230
Listen! How old are you?

135
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,073
Why?

136
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,456
-Just tell me your age!
-21.

137
00:10:57,748 --> 00:10:58,933
-Sure?
-Yes.

138
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:01,183
You did not increase it
during you admission?

139
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:03,353
-No.
-People say that. So I'm asking..

140
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,700
-I'm not sure.
-How can you not know?

141
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:08,030
Do you have your
birth certificate?

142
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:10,636
-Yes.
-Can you get it for me?

143
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:12,543
You can take it from
the college office.

144
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:13,767
I have to submit it there.

145
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:16,186
Should I ask the college that I
want Tejas Bhave's certificate?

146
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:17,951
What if they ask me why?

147
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:20,585
Why do you need it?

148
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:23,095
Listen.

149
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,662
What happened that night

150
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:26,627
was consensual, right?

151
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,040
I did not force you.

152
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:28,756
What do you mean?

153
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,847
Did I force you to have sex?

154
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,433
No. But...

155
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:34,788
What?

156
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:37,119
You made the first move!

157
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:40,644
Did you say no?

158
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:42,414
-No.
-Exactly.

159
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:44,061
So, it was consensual, right?

160
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:47,262
So, do something.

161
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,738
Say it. Say that
it was consensual.

162
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,546
What do I say?

163
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:52,747
Say that whatever happened
between us was consensual.

164
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,682
-Con... what is that word?
-Consensual!

165
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:56,582
-Consensual.
-Consensual. Yes. Say it.

166
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:57,643
It was consensual.

167
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:00,627
'Whatever happened between
us was consensual.'

168
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,711
-Whatever happened between us...
-Yes...

169
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,183
-Was consensual!
-Was consensual.

170
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,366
Say it in one go.

171
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:09,071
The complete statement?

172
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:09,602
Yes.

173
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:12,785
Say this. 'Whatever
happened between us,'

174
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:14,596
'Ms. Kalindi, was consensual.'

175
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:17,427
-Between us...
-'This is Tejas speaking. Ms. Kalindi...'

176
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,878
'Whatever happened between
us was consensual.'

177
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,067
Ms. Kalindi, this is Tejas speaking.
Whatever happened between us...

178
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:25,923
whatever happened...

179
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:27,475
whatever happened
was consensual!

180
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:28,752
Now say it properly!

181
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:32,418
Ms. Kalindi, whatever happened
between us was consensual.

182
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,523
-I am Tejas.
-Okay.

183
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:38,772
As if it's my fault!

184
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:41,003
If I go late, what can they do?

185
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:42,926
They have to hit me.

186
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:47,632
See! That's a... that's a...
that's a gutsy girl.

187
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,836
A gutsy girl is not
someone who screams out...

188
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:50,906
says masturbation.

189
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:51,952
You don't know, see...

190
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:53,358
Just go home today.

191
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,805
Play some sexy music.
Shut the door.

192
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:57,734
Wash both your hands first.

193
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:58,734
#

194
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,672
Okay. Think of Hrithik
Roshan and have a good time.

195
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,536
Can't you see, none of
these fuckers were guilty.

196
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:09,055
Now look here and there at her.

197
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,526
When I said masturbation
and she hid her face!

198
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:13,675
Ms. Kalindi!

199
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:15,741
I came by to apologize.

200
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:16,537
Why?

201
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,218
That day you I scared you when
I recorded your statement.

202
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,041
No. I did not
understand anything.

203
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:24,624
What was that word
'consensuous'?

204
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:25,655
Forget it.

205
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:29,702
-Listen, now we're friends, okay?
-Yes.

206
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,487
As in real friends...

207
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:34,954
who tell everything
and share everything.

208
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,098
Okay.

209
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,340
-But without benefits.
-What do you mean?

210
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,503
I mean I have a boyfriend now.

211
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,149
-Professor Neeraj!
-Yes.

212
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,117
-The Mathematics professor?
-Yes.

213
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:54,138
-Have you seen his hair?
-So nice, right?

214
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:58,536
He isn't like the other guys.

215
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,227
With someone in the night,
someone else in the morning.

216
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:02,642
Do you know what he says?

217
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:03,714
Did you know that

218
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,253
penguins are monogamous

219
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:12,393
and that helps them survive
in the extreme cold?

220
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,898
I want us to be penguins.

221
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,332
He believes in monogamy.

222
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,730
He does not wants to share
me with anybody else.

223
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:27,327
And he doesn't feel
that I'm weird.

224
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:29,012
Unlike what your Natasha feels.

225
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:31,683
-My Natasha?
-Yes! Your Natasha.

226
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,183
I know everything.

227
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:35,401
Anyway...

228
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,135
You don't hurt the
people you love.

229
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:40,346
I said, you're right.

230
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,274
Intentionally you don't.

231
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:44,786
But you always hurt
people that you love.

232
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,600
You can't hurt somebody
that you don't love.

233
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:47,823
If I love Mihir...

234
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:51,910
and if I love Tejas too,
what is wrong with that.

235
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:53,644
Anyway, we'll talk
about that later.

236
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,926
Because he's younger and all that,
but we'll talk about that later.

237
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:59,634
If I love Tejas and Neeraj
as well..., suppose...

238
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:03,091
Now... now... what was my point?

239
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:07,103
Now... now... will they feel...
bad...

240
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,153
and jealous and insecure?

241
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:10,193
Yes, they might.

242
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,774
But I will not ration my love.

243
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:15,140
I'm gonna give wholesale.

244
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,066
Like I'm gonna
give all of myself.

245
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:21,573
Hello.

246
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:23,300
Where are you?

247
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:25,649
Where are you?

248
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:27,941
Where the hell are you?

249
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:32,777
What happened?

250
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:37,478
What happened?

251
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,410
You called and
said it was urgent.

252
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,661
I took care of it.

253
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:46,225
-So easily?
-It's not working out with Neeraj.

254
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:47,258
What happened?

255
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:52,517
I thought he was so
smart, so intelligent!

256
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:53,957
That he knows everything.

257
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:54,927
Everything.

258
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,082
He knows physics, statistics...

259
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:01,017
But not chemistry.

260
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:05,825
He doesn't know when to finish
the viva and start practicals.

261
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:10,940
After 17 days, 16
hours and 32 minutes,

262
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,017
you know what he said to me...

263
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:13,318
I think...

264
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,482
I should...

265
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,340
fornicate.

266
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,860
Fornicate.

267
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:21,557
Fornicate?

268
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:22,952
I also asked him
the same question.

269
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:24,185
Fornicate?

270
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:26,310
Uh...

271
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:28,089
Coitus.

272
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:31,552
-You mean we should fuck?
-Huh?

273
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:34,239
Yes.

274
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:37,342
Yes!

275
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:38,366
Yes!

276
00:16:39,592 --> 00:16:41,805
Now, I think I should
take off my pant...

277
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:48,127
Light.

278
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:52,275
Okay? Now! Switch.

279
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,742
There... there's one more there.

280
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:03,827
Listen! Listen!

281
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,794
-Condom?
-Yes. In the drawer next to you.

282
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:09,523
-Should I put in on you?
-No.

283
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:10,571
I'll take it.

284
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:11,367
Okay.

285
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,683
-What happened?
-Nothing!

286
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:18,786
What happened?

287
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:25,897
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

288
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:32,188
Found it!

289
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,281
-Answer it.
-It's alright.

290
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:42,279
-Who called?
-I don't know.

291
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:44,859
-Was it Natasha?
-No.

292
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,464
So what's happening now...
you and Neeraj sir...

293
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,622
It's over.

294
00:17:59,142 --> 00:17:59,750
Over?

295
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:08,040
Did you have sex
with Natasha yet?

296
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:09,596
No.

297
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,715
Liar.

298
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:14,748
Why do you care?

299
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,412
-Don't I share my stories with you?
-Do I ask you to?

300
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:20,245
You yourself tell me.

301
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:22,434
You've made me your dustbin.

302
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,742
I'm just asking...

303
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,969
What's happening with Natasha?

304
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:27,714
Nothing.

305
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,388
Now that you and Neeraj
sir have broken up,

306
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:32,919
should we... again...

307
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:37,393
No?

308
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:54,534
Oh!

309
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,520
Did you come here to
Whatsapp or study?

310
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,894
Sorry, ma'am.

311
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:04,209
Give me your phone.

312
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:11,828
Type in your pass code.

313
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:14,313
Actually, I don't remember it.

314
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:17,784
Type the pass code.

315
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,142
See. I don't remember it.

316
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:31,391
Collect it from the office.

317
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:32,739
And get out of my class.

318
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:37,776
I said... get out of my class.

319
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:39,632
get out!

320
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:41,654
I am leaving.

321
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:42,576
Are you guys studying?

322
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,965
In the classroom,

323
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,393
You sit with Rahul, no?

324
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,214
In the cafeteria, with Aakash.

325
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:53,868
And here, with Tejas.

326
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,090
Your parents live in Dubai...

327
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:01,667
and they send you money, right?

328
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,716
Do you live alone in the flat?

329
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:08,565
How privileged?

330
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:11,494
What a waste.

331
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:21,995
I don't want to disturb you.
Please order.

332
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,116
Ma'am?

333
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:39,308
Why did you do that?

334
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:41,912
Why?

335
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:43,743
Is she your girlfriend?

336
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:45,804
No.

337
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:49,326
Oh!

338
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,379
Sorry.

339
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:54,377
Mihir, can you hear me?

340
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:02,963
No one is ever honest with
anyone, I'm telling you.

341
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:05,674
Even my mom and dad were
not honest with each other!

342
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:09,392
No sonofabitch in this
world is honest with anyone.

343
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:13,251
Inspite of the fact that Mihir
was with me, I was feeling guilty.

344
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:14,901
So then I thought,
let me explore that.

345
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:17,171
Let me explore the guilt.

346
00:23:17,338 --> 00:23:19,767
Okay. I'm feeling guilty.
Why am I feeling guilty?

347
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,538
Where is the guilt coming from?

348
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:23,372
You know...

349
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:24,675
Point is...

350
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:26,617
if you want to love,
love selflessly.

351
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:27,972
You know...

352
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,014
they say that if you love
somebody, set it free.

353
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:32,461
Selfless.

354
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,058
Mihir loves me like that.

355
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:07,243
Nothing!

356
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,260
Where are you?

357
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:43,842
Hello.

358
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,083
Shh. No! No.

359
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,494
I know you are dating Natasha,

360
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:53,683
so you might as well tell me.
Where are you?

361
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:57,121
Huh! Huh!

362
00:24:58,506 --> 00:24:59,681
Are you or aren't you?

363
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,864
Tell me! Are you or aren't you!
Answer!

364
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,988
-Go to sleep. Good night.
-Tell me...

365
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,779
He hung up on me?

366
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,083
That's what he
doesn't understand.

367
00:25:26,144 --> 00:25:27,704
That communication is the key.

368
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:31,078
You know...

369
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:33,714
Mihir and I...

370
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,800
we're having a long
distance relationship.

371
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:37,845
But we tell each
other everything.

372
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:41,525
If anything happens, he calls
me up and tells me everything.

373
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,710
Whatever is happening to me now,

374
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,266
I'm going to tell him.

375
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:47,876
Something happened
between Tejas and me.

376
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:49,707
We shared something.

377
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:51,850
So we owe this
much to each other.

378
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,459
When something happened
between me and Neeraj...

379
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:56,789
I went myself and
told him about it.

380
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,743
When he did not even know
the meaning of fornication,

381
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,383
I told him.

382
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,833
Even when I got fed up,

383
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,864
I went and loyally told him.

384
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,327
So why?

385
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:08,930
I mean...

386
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:11,965
I'm just sitting here wondering
where he is all the time.

387
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:14,267
I don't want to do that.

388
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:17,428
Romanticism has never
been judged properly.

389
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,464
Who is there to judge it.

390
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:21,017
The critiques?

391
00:26:24,006 --> 00:26:24,999
I am selfish.

392
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:28,639
I am selfish.

393
00:26:29,116 --> 00:26:30,103
I love Ayn Rand.

394
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:33,296
She said selfishness
is a virtue.

395
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:35,691
Of course, she said
it in another context.

396
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:36,845
But I feel it is...

397
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:38,539
applicable...

398
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,819
to my life. See,
I cannot be Mihir.

399
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,875
He is selflessly loving me.

400
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:46,462
In this context, he's selflessly
given me the freedom...

401
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:48,927
to explore my life. And...

402
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:50,896
if I'm doing that, I'm selfish.

403
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:54,732
So, yes. I am selfish, because
I have to be selfish to...

404
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:57,036
him being selfless towards me.

405
00:26:57,178 --> 00:26:58,058
It is a gift.

406
00:26:58,297 --> 00:26:59,437
That, be selfish.

407
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,274
Explore your own self. Uh...

408
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:03,028
why do I have a
problem with Natasha?

409
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:05,459
I don't have a
problem with Natasha.

410
00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:06,518
She's just young.

411
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:09,098
But, uh, she's insignificant...

412
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:10,280
to me.

413
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:13,716
But Tejas lied to
me when I asked him

414
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:15,868
if you are having an
affair with her or not.

415
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:18,299
He lied to me.
That is my problem.

416
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,713
See, I am selfish.
I have expectations.

417
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,081
Do not lie to me.

418
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,684
I had a problem
because he lied to me.

419
00:27:26,142 --> 00:27:27,267
He shouldn't have lied.

420
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:29,641
Because, I want honesty...

421
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:32,335
right now... and that
is my expectation.

422
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:35,263
Tejas!

423
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:22,681
Tejas?

424
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:23,978
He's inside.

425
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:30,451
Tejas!

426
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:35,272
Tejas!

427
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,198
Open the door!

428
00:28:50,381 --> 00:28:51,840
Open the door!

429
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:55,517
Oh great lady!

430
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,588
Tejas.

431
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,329
Please open the door!

432
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:13,447
Are you listening?

433
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:24,700
-Grandma?
-Tejas.

434
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:26,738
Open the door!

435
00:29:33,683 --> 00:29:35,225
You're here? Who is in there?

436
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,679
That crazy girl!

437
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:39,433
She just ran inside.

438
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:43,600
Open the door!

439
00:30:08,304 --> 00:30:09,600
What's going on
between these two?

440
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,573
-Whose is this?
-I don't know.

441
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:12,975
Whose is this?

442
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:14,850
-I don't know!
-Is it Natasha's?

443
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:15,649
No.

444
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,310
I'm asking for the last time!
Is it hers?

445
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:19,410
Why should it be hers?

446
00:30:19,683 --> 00:30:22,518
Why not? She may have
forgotten it here.

447
00:30:22,602 --> 00:30:23,706
I don't know whose it is.

448
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,517
-Oh, you don't know!
-I don't know.

449
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,433
-You don't know?
-I said I don't know!

450
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:30,866
I will hit you!

451
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:32,643
-Don't you know?
-No.

452
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,642
Don't you? Wait.

453
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:37,914
-Don't break that!
-Why not?

454
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:39,573
-It's expensive.
-How much is it?

455
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,375
Fifty five thousand rupees.

456
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:45,456
If it breaks, how can I
watch Raj Kapoor's movies?

457
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:44,794
I know you are
sleeping with her.

458
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:48,476
When I catch you red-handed,
one day, you'll know.

459
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,395
Move!

460
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:10,244
You like Boomerang very much?

461
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,480
Why do you kiss like a child?

462
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:16,039
You should have eaten her.

463
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:19,674
You lied to me and
dated her under my nose?

464
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,542
You flirt with her on
Whatsapp in my class.

465
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:26,103
You were dating and glued to
each other at the Comedy Club!

466
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:28,018
Do you think I don't know?

467
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:30,702
Did you play Raj Kapoor's
songs for her as well?

468
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:38,861
You played Raj Kapoor's
songs for her, didn't you?

469
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:46,914
I'm sorry.

470
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,504
Don't make fun of me.

471
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:51,395
I didn't realize

472
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:53,933
you would be so hurt.

473
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:58,519
You don't know
girls like Natasha.

474
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,884
She is just using you!

475
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:04,267
Girls like Natasha do things
to show off to the world.

476
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,884
On Instagram, Twitter...

477
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:08,490
She wants to show-off that
I too have a boy friend.

478
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:11,521
She is using you like
an Instagram filter.

479
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:13,669
You are the filter today.

480
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,615
Tomorrow, it will be Rahul.

481
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:18,089
Don't laugh.

482
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:21,078
You should break up with her.

483
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:32,058
Do what you want.

484
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:35,945
Kalindi ma'am?

485
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:42,642
-I didn't realize you would be hurt.
-Why are you repeating yourself?

486
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,796
Really...

487
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,538
I didn't realize you
loved me so much.

488
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,430
I want to be with you.

489
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:54,017
-I will leave her for you.
-Have you lost it?

490
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,142
I'm married!

491
00:36:19,923 --> 00:36:21,077
Please hand me a towel.

492
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:30,252
Not going to shower?

493
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,440
Dirty bitch!

494
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:38,791
Naked dog!

495
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:14,762
How are you, Sudha?

496
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,172
-All good?
-Yes.

497
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:21,686
Bless you. Bless you.

498
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,792
You look very pretty.

499
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,517
Amit said you are taking
good care of the house.

500
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:28,767
-There are fragile things in that.
-Okay.

501
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,711
Okay?

502
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:33,609
The house is very clean.

503
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:41,431
-Do you need anything?
-First, I will take a shower.

504
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:43,660
Take it.

505
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,519
It's so humid here!

506
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,702
-Sudha! Put the water heater on.
-Okay.

507
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:52,854
Listen, should I give her these?

508
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:55,747
-Give her one.
-Okay.

509
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,535
Keep this bag inside.

510
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:03,267
And, take this home.

511
00:40:04,315 --> 00:40:05,030
Okay?

512
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:19,197
Come.

513
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:26,892
Close the left nostril and
inhale using the right nostril.

514
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:31,178
Now close the right nostril and
exhale using the left nostril.

515
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:36,290
Again, close the right nostril and
inhale through the left nostril.

516
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:39,671
Now close the left nostril...

517
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:42,642
Four terrorists killed in Bandipore
district of Jammu & Kashmir

518
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:44,850
while attempting to
attack a pilgrimage...

519
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:46,499
-And?
-Three.

520
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:49,825
I have entered the number.

521
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:51,745
Wait for the OTP.

522
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:46,103
I'll get it.

523
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,517
-Come in.
-Greetings.

524
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,916
-Greetings!
-Welcome.

525
00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:53,761
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

526
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:58,475
-Hi, dear. Come.
-Hello, auntyji.

527
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,605
-Hello.
-Hello...

528
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:03,004
-Did you find parking?
-No, no no...

529
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,858
Please sit.

530
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,796
-Please.
-Sit.

531
00:42:09,142 --> 00:42:10,894
You guys are early.

532
00:42:10,955 --> 00:42:12,918
People are always
late in Mumbai.

533
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:16,850
We left after the peak hours
and the roads were empty today.

534
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:19,767
We've been to this
neighbourhood before.

535
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:20,400
I see.

536
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:22,056
When you told me the
name of this building,

537
00:42:22,117 --> 00:42:22,962
I didn't remember it..

538
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:24,961
But when we entered the gate...

539
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:28,234
I remembered that her
cousin used to live here.

540
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:30,485
Actually, my cousin's
wife's family.

541
00:42:30,546 --> 00:42:31,997
-Sorry.
-I see.

542
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:34,533
-This is a good society.
-Absolutely.

543
00:42:34,743 --> 00:42:37,988
Finding a flat in such a locality
in Mumbai, is a big thing.

544
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:41,328
He has this one-bedroom flat
because he's a bachelor.

545
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,919
Here 2 - 3BHK
flats are nice too.

546
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:44,901
I'm sure.

547
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:46,210
Yes.

548
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:48,334
Thing is, he comes
home just to sleep.

549
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:50,308
Look at the mess here.

550
00:42:50,659 --> 00:42:53,064
I have asked him to hang
a painting at least.

551
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,007
I keep busy.

552
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,232
I am happy that he
got the house painted.

553
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:01,253
Nowadays, boys don't
bother about these things.

554
00:43:01,693 --> 00:43:04,035
That they order food for
themselves, is an achievement.

555
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,600
I'm sorry. Will you
have tea or cold drinks?

556
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:10,585
Lemonade?

557
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:12,126
Ma'am...

558
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:14,486
-Some tea for us.
-Yes.

559
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:21,866
Has Ajit taken you on
a tour of Mumbai yet?

560
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,647
Sudha.

561
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,591
Make six cups of tea

562
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:27,298
and serve some snacks
in the new bowls.

563
00:43:28,353 --> 00:43:29,766
I was posted here.

564
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:31,434
Oh! Where were you posted?

565
00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:34,191
Dungarsi Road.

566
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:36,517
He has started with his stories!

567
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,556
We used to live
in the same area.

568
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:40,800
Just behind the Opera House.

569
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:43,221
We moved to Andheri
after we got married.

570
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:46,183
But Mumbai has changed a lot.

571
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,747
Everything has.

572
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:49,287
Even Meerut has changed so much.

573
00:43:50,183 --> 00:43:51,703
It's so green now.

574
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:54,265
Mr. Manoj, your
area is nice too.

575
00:43:55,434 --> 00:43:57,671
It's an old building but
there is greenery around.

576
00:43:57,732 --> 00:43:59,333
Greenery is a luxury in Mumbai.

577
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,712
Like, they say... sea view...
tree view...

578
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:03,786
Similarly, we have tree views.

579
00:44:06,225 --> 00:44:07,911
It's a good one!

580
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:10,005
You are a 'Jokey' man.

581
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:11,173
The word is 'Jovial'.

582
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:12,187
They are the same.

583
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,962
My sister-in-law's family
speaks highly of you.

584
00:44:16,558 --> 00:44:18,892
Your brother-in-law is married
into that family, right?

585
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:21,303
They are the reason we are here.

586
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,896
-Do you come to Mumbai often?
-Not really.

587
00:44:25,054 --> 00:44:26,971
Once a year.

588
00:44:27,475 --> 00:44:31,308
But Ajit comes to
Meerut on festivals.

589
00:44:32,058 --> 00:44:33,662
Whenever he gets a break.

590
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:36,330
Diwali must be
spectacular in Meerut!

591
00:44:37,225 --> 00:44:41,142
-Absolutely! We get new outfits made.
-I see.

592
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:44,387
-We hold Lakshmi puja...
-We do that too.

593
00:44:45,618 --> 00:44:49,576
And they play cards. It's a
cosmopolitan kind of Diwali!

594
00:44:49,673 --> 00:44:51,706
We have a Ram Leela
performance there.

595
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:53,548
Ajit had played Ravana once!

596
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:54,817
He was Ravana!

597
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:56,946
-He forgot some lines!
-Oh!

598
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:58,673
He was so nervous.

599
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,183
We will be right back.

600
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:06,642
Let me show her the house.

601
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:08,558
-My small flat.
-Sure.

602
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:10,302
Go ahead.

603
00:45:17,808 --> 00:45:18,972
Do you know?

604
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:21,225
People talk about it.

605
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,722
Aparna told me that
they have met twice.

606
00:45:24,377 --> 00:45:27,939
Nowadays, things are
finalized at coffee shops.

607
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,896
-Marriages, business deals.
-Right.

608
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,276
Even divorces...
in coffee shops!

609
00:45:33,558 --> 00:45:35,308
-Why are you talking
about divorce?

610
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,827
-Why not? It's a fact of life

611
00:45:37,058 --> 00:45:39,024
We will not get divorced.

612
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:41,642
Oh, come on!

613
00:45:41,725 --> 00:45:43,433
Never!

614
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:45,517
They are a good match.

615
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,683
Similar lifestyles and values.

616
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,595
The same profession. It's great.

617
00:45:52,698 --> 00:45:55,214
-But mutual understanding is vital.
-Correct.

618
00:45:55,275 --> 00:45:57,817
-If they want to be together...
-That is very important.

619
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,100
True.

620
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:04,664
We saw Aparna for the first
time at Mr. Pramod's funeral.

621
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,546
-Were you there?
-Yes.

622
00:46:07,683 --> 00:46:09,336
He was close to us.

623
00:46:10,013 --> 00:46:11,763
He loved Ajit dearly.

624
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:13,885
He was a good man.

625
00:46:14,225 --> 00:46:17,433
He introduced us to the astrologer.
We really believe in him.

626
00:46:17,546 --> 00:46:18,865
You have faith in him.

627
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:21,433
We showed him our horoscopes.

628
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:24,621
-He told us so many things!
-Wow! Here comes the tea!

629
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:25,488
Please come.

630
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:30,995
Did you add sugar? One more.

631
00:46:33,808 --> 00:46:36,375
-Let him.
-He has diabetes.

632
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:40,648
They are a great match.

633
00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:43,485
Their horoscopes are compatible.

634
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,445
Very good. Very good.

635
00:46:45,892 --> 00:46:46,916
Serve them inside.

636
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:53,198
She makes very good tea.

637
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:55,127
It is very nice.

638
00:46:55,475 --> 00:46:57,642
People prefer tea
bags these days.

639
00:46:57,919 --> 00:46:59,366
Does she cook?

640
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:04,571
She does, but not too well.

641
00:47:04,975 --> 00:47:06,405
And do you cook?

642
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,790
-Yes, but not non-veg dishes.
-Are you a vegetarian?

643
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,807
Yes, but Ajit is a carnivore.

644
00:47:19,442 --> 00:47:21,862
So difficult to put
things across to him.

645
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:24,721
The guy has a small brain!

646
00:47:25,707 --> 00:47:26,734
No, I mean...

647
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:28,658
#

648
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:31,623
#

649
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,721
I mean...

650
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:34,702
#

651
00:47:35,344 --> 00:47:35,984
#

652
00:47:36,504 --> 00:47:37,910
#

653
00:47:38,585 --> 00:47:39,125
I know.

654
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:40,937
#

655
00:47:41,915 --> 00:47:43,341
#

656
00:47:45,438 --> 00:47:46,538
Um.. stop.

657
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:48,242
Stop?

658
00:47:50,274 --> 00:47:50,881
Okay.

659
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:09,948
Thank you.

660
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:16,615
You... wanna share half?

661
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:19,488
Actually... I don't want this.

662
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:23,620
Put it there.

663
00:48:39,594 --> 00:48:42,196
So, there's this high protein
diet you were talking about?

664
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:44,448
Ajit?

665
00:48:45,114 --> 00:48:45,627
Yes.

666
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:48,396
You were talking about
some high protein diet.

667
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,085
Yeah.

668
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,699
-Mom, should we go?
-Did you show her the house?

669
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:12,462
What do you think?

670
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,405
Are you ready to
give up chicken?

671
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:18,584
Congratulations!

672
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:24,289
-Congratulations to you too!
-Congratulations.

673
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:28,356
I knew things would work out
today, so I got some sweets.

674
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:30,279
God bless you!

675
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:33,333
I will talk to my astrologer
and call you tomorrow.

676
00:49:33,496 --> 00:49:34,746
-Yes, please.
-Definitely.

677
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:35,803
Ajit!

678
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:38,230
There is no need!

679
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:41,269
-We'll meet again.
-Sure.

680
00:49:41,683 --> 00:49:43,531
-Congratulations once again.
-To you too.

681
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,856
-Keep in touch.
-Sure.

682
00:49:46,267 --> 00:49:49,523
Call us, sometime. Okay.

683
00:49:56,308 --> 00:49:58,892
Sudha, Ajit is going
to get married!

684
00:49:58,975 --> 00:50:00,678
We will finalize the date soon.

685
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,576
Congratulations to you too!

686
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,558
Good people. Good family.

687
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:07,390
Please take some sweets home.

688
00:51:26,392 --> 00:51:27,776
Only one elevator
is working, right?

689
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:29,776
It's a ten-minute
wait if we miss it.

690
00:51:30,475 --> 00:51:33,596
I was just about to leave and
Ms. Neha gave me some work.

691
00:51:34,046 --> 00:51:35,453
'Dust the painting...'

692
00:51:35,514 --> 00:51:37,799
I did that yesterday. She
wanted me to do it again!

693
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,524
What should I do if someone
is renovating their home?

694
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:42,760
'Sweep the balcony, water
the plants...' Annoying.

695
00:51:42,963 --> 00:51:43,955
Should I show you something?

696
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:51,764
Ms. Neha gave it to me.

697
00:51:56,577 --> 00:51:57,444
Beautiful, isn't it?

698
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:02,472
Pure silk and fully embroidered.

699
00:52:07,517 --> 00:52:10,183
I will fix it or
drape a scarf over it.

700
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,805
It will look perfect.

701
00:52:13,118 --> 00:52:14,785
-Absolutely!
-Isn't it?

702
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,253
I will wear it on my
sister's wedding day.

703
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:19,125
With this, matching...

704
00:52:21,782 --> 00:52:23,615
Don't know when she
will get married.

705
00:52:29,642 --> 00:52:30,326
Wow!

706
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:36,175
You're not having one?

707
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:48,912
Your day also went well.

708
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,276
Help!

709
00:54:25,254 --> 00:54:27,028
Why can't you swim?

710
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:29,774
My dad wasn't a Gymkhana member.

711
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,873
-How do I look now?
-Like a mother of two.

712
00:54:36,808 --> 00:54:37,667
Tea!

713
00:54:38,304 --> 00:54:38,871
Yes.

714
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,281
I don't look so fat, yaar.

715
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:00,375
As compared to?

716
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:41,669
A woman's heart is lighter?

717
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:43,213
But it beats faster.

718
00:55:43,686 --> 00:55:45,098
There are eleven more differences.
Shall I tell you?

719
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,924
No, no.

720
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,431
The girls didn't even call
me once in the afternoon.

721
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:53,984
You must have put on
back to back movies?

722
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:56,876
Not bad, mister.

723
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:00,946
You are not going to
accept, matashreeji?

724
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:02,447
We'll live, okay?

725
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:22,307
Yes. Speak...

726
00:56:22,517 --> 00:56:23,550
Am I disturbing you?

727
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,780
Speak...

728
00:56:26,892 --> 00:56:27,627
Where are you?

729
00:56:30,058 --> 00:56:30,802
I...

730
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:32,667
Where are you?

731
00:56:34,377 --> 00:56:35,995
Hey Sudhir, where
the hell are you?

732
00:56:36,056 --> 00:56:37,098
I... at the beach house.

733
00:56:37,952 --> 00:56:39,243
I'm coming over.

734
00:56:40,138 --> 00:56:42,826
Salman, where are
you speaking from?

735
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:44,359
I'm coming.

736
00:56:45,116 --> 00:56:45,773
Now?

737
00:56:46,089 --> 00:56:48,579
We decided that you will
come after the house-warming!

738
00:56:50,558 --> 00:56:51,595
Did you send me an email?

739
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,523
What about?

740
00:56:54,926 --> 00:56:57,545
Salman, bank details,
my black money

741
00:56:57,612 --> 00:57:00,997
my Swiss account numbers,
you know it, yaar.

742
00:57:01,058 --> 00:57:02,144
Where all I stole money from,

743
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:03,683
I'm sending all
details in an email.

744
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:06,267
-I will introduce you to Hardik.
-Who is Hardik?

745
00:57:06,477 --> 00:57:07,642
Hardik, my lawyer, yaar.

746
00:57:07,852 --> 00:57:10,365
Salman, what will I
speak with your lawyer?

747
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:11,770
I'm not getting you.

748
00:57:13,148 --> 00:57:15,582
-Why are you laughing?
-That is the problem, yaar.

749
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:17,245
Nobody gets me bro.

750
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:19,710
What I'm saying is...

751
00:57:21,517 --> 00:57:24,017
you will take care of Ankita
and Tapishree after I am gone.

752
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,951
What do you mean,
after you're gone?

753
00:57:30,225 --> 00:57:31,600
Forget it, Sudhir!

754
00:57:33,392 --> 00:57:34,206
Salman!

755
00:57:35,808 --> 00:57:39,100
After I'm gone, you will take
care of Ankita and Tapishree.

756
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:41,558
Where are you going?
Where are you now?

757
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:43,121
#

758
00:57:43,475 --> 00:57:45,308
On my balcony, drinking.

759
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:46,724
I had asked for single malt,

760
00:57:46,785 --> 00:57:48,867
but there is no one in
the house to give me ice.

761
00:57:49,308 --> 00:57:52,933
Where are the girls?
Where are Tapishree and Ankita.

762
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:55,613
Watching a movie with Rosemary,
I guess. I don't know.

763
00:57:56,193 --> 00:57:57,035
Did they have dinner?

764
00:57:57,096 --> 00:57:58,303
How the hell do I know?

765
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,643
Why don't you ask their mother?

766
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:03,338
The girls could be starving!

767
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:05,459
Where is the mother?
Who is she with?

768
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,872
And why is her location
service disabled?

769
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:10,731
-What are you talking about?
-Sudhir...

770
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,475
Sudhir, Reena is bored of me.

771
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:15,915
She's looking for excitement.

772
00:58:15,976 --> 00:58:17,279
She's with somebody exciting.

773
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:18,767
-Got it?
-Salman...

774
00:58:19,337 --> 00:58:20,484
Salman, are you serious?

775
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:22,004
Am I laughing, Sudhir?

776
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:24,475
What are you saying. Are
you listening to yourself!

777
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:28,415
You know what she said to me?

778
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,234
In 13 years of our marriage,

779
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:32,535
she was happy for
only 11 months.

780
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:33,624
You want proof?

781
00:58:33,685 --> 00:58:34,791
What? What are you doing?

782
00:58:35,002 --> 00:58:37,169
Sudhir, I want you to be
witness to this moment.

783
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:38,465
Salman? What are you doing?

784
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:41,216
I'm calling her. I bet, she
will not answer my call.

785
00:58:43,892 --> 00:58:46,778
-Salman, stop the drama.
-Sudhir, listen... listen to this.

786
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:47,638
Listen...

787
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:55,797
See, she's not
picking the phone.

788
00:58:57,308 --> 00:58:58,745
-Salman.
-She will not take the call!

789
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:00,783
You can bet anything.

790
00:59:03,049 --> 00:59:05,287
Now imagine, what if
I was in an accident?

791
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:07,206
And I'm dying.

792
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:08,504
Salman, you've gone mad!

793
00:59:08,565 --> 00:59:10,425
I'm dying Sudhir, listen to me.

794
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:15,565
I'm calling ICE. 'In case
of Emergency'... my wife.

795
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,204
Let the boring husband die!

796
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,335
Are you listening?

797
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:33,716
Husband is dying.
There's blood everywhere.

798
00:59:39,673 --> 00:59:41,869
Anyway, enjoy your beach life.

799
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,573
Love you darling. See you. Bye.

800
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:54,590
You think... he...

801
00:59:59,112 --> 00:59:59,532
Call.

802
01:00:01,593 --> 01:00:02,939
Call him. Find out what's wrong.

803
01:00:03,879 --> 01:00:04,631
Nothing is wrong.

804
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:06,210
He is pretending.

805
01:00:06,563 --> 01:00:08,690
Reena, he's in the balcony.
He's drinking.

806
01:00:09,537 --> 01:00:10,257
Call him.

807
01:00:10,892 --> 01:00:12,377
Don't tell him I asked you to.

808
01:00:36,142 --> 01:00:37,426
What is it, Salman?

809
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,356
Now what?

810
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:41,812
Where are you?

811
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:46,015
You can call Sudhir
up but not me.

812
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,493
He is my buddy.
I have every right!

813
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:49,900
Where are you?

814
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:51,767
I'm at Geeta's.

815
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:53,485
Have you gone nuts?

816
01:00:54,058 --> 01:00:56,058
Assume I have... for a moment.

817
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:57,675
Tell me this.

818
01:00:58,683 --> 01:01:00,486
When I call Geeta,

819
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,089
why does she tell me...

820
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:05,283
'I don't know what's going
on between Reena and you?

821
01:01:07,058 --> 01:01:08,008
but Reena is not here.'

822
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:12,746
Why did she say that?

823
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:15,352
Reena.

824
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:18,919
-What?
-Shh.

825
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:24,850
He knows.

826
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:25,961
He's spying.

827
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:27,374
#

828
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:28,848
He's spying on me.

829
01:01:29,725 --> 01:01:30,646
How?

830
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,042
Geeta told him that
I'm not with her.

831
01:01:34,517 --> 01:01:36,495
-What else has she told him?
-Bitch.

832
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:38,820
How would I know
what she said to him?

833
01:01:41,232 --> 01:01:42,626
#

834
01:01:43,404 --> 01:01:44,424
I have no idea.

835
01:01:45,058 --> 01:01:47,975
We don't send each other
messages or emails!

836
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:50,481
We meet once in a while.

837
01:01:50,558 --> 01:01:51,644
Is he following us?

838
01:01:51,705 --> 01:01:53,452
No. He is not.

839
01:01:53,558 --> 01:01:54,889
Otherwise, why
would he call Geeta.

840
01:01:55,518 --> 01:01:56,218
Geeta knows?

841
01:01:56,677 --> 01:01:58,183
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

842
01:01:59,147 --> 01:02:00,594
She would have confronted me.

843
01:02:01,808 --> 01:02:03,118
What did you tell Geeta?

844
01:02:03,683 --> 01:02:07,236
I texted her that I was going on
a tour with my HSBC colleague.

845
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:08,748
#

846
01:02:12,558 --> 01:02:14,433
Because I feel ashamed.

847
01:02:15,683 --> 01:02:16,932
What have I become?

848
01:02:17,892 --> 01:02:20,106
My children are hungry and
my husband is spying on me.

849
01:02:20,489 --> 01:02:21,469
God! The bitch.

850
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,725
Not Geeta, I'm the bitch.

851
01:02:29,683 --> 01:02:30,826
Tell him you are here.

852
01:02:32,933 --> 01:02:35,892
Call him and tell him you
are here to talk to me.

853
01:02:36,767 --> 01:02:37,850
What about?

854
01:02:37,975 --> 01:02:40,322
About your fights.

855
01:02:41,122 --> 01:02:41,660
Okay?

856
01:02:42,188 --> 01:02:46,021
End this Geeta chapter now

857
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:47,799
or you'll be caught in a lie.

858
01:02:48,568 --> 01:02:50,921
Call him and tell him that you
came to me for advice.

859
01:02:57,308 --> 01:02:58,180
You hung up on me?

860
01:02:58,962 --> 01:03:00,422
Salman, are you spying on me?

861
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:01,063
Where are you?

862
01:03:03,808 --> 01:03:05,683
-At Sudhir's.
-At Sudhir's?

863
01:03:07,475 --> 01:03:09,475
-At his beach house.
-Beach house?

864
01:03:10,476 --> 01:03:11,871
He's not yet done
the house-warming.

865
01:03:11,932 --> 01:03:12,911
What are you doing there?

866
01:03:14,808 --> 01:03:16,627
-I needed to talk.
-About what?

867
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:20,950
About us...

868
01:03:21,558 --> 01:03:23,750
Our daily fights.

869
01:03:24,627 --> 01:03:26,180
You're talking to
Sudhir about us?

870
01:03:26,422 --> 01:03:27,582
What's wrong with you?

871
01:03:27,752 --> 01:03:28,945
Salman, I didn't mean to.

872
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:29,836
I didn't mean to.

873
01:03:30,024 --> 01:03:32,240
Do I go to him and rat on you?

874
01:03:32,624 --> 01:03:33,816
In 12 years of our marriage,

875
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:35,322
I didn't bore you for 10 months.

876
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,716
Do you know why?

877
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:38,673
#

878
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:40,795
He just saw me crying, okay?

879
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,543
-Alright.
-Crying? Where?

880
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:44,485
In a party.

881
01:03:45,017 --> 01:03:45,728
Which party?

882
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:49,327
At the Kishore Thadani
one, last week?

883
01:03:50,606 --> 01:03:51,260
Yes.

884
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:55,490
Reena, Kishore came to our house

885
01:03:56,058 --> 01:03:57,640
and you were doing
drama in front of him?

886
01:03:57,701 --> 01:03:58,270
Drama?

887
01:03:58,541 --> 01:03:59,433
What else?

888
01:03:59,517 --> 01:04:01,405
Kishore Thadani of
Sunrise Capital!

889
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:03,932
You know him.

890
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:06,183
He's going to invest 200 crore
rupees in my company!

891
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,455
12 years as a banker and
you have learned nothing!

892
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:09,812
You know what Kishore
Thaddani means to me?

893
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:11,999
Of course, I know what
he means to you.

894
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,393
To me? To all of us.

895
01:04:14,089 --> 01:04:14,882
#

896
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:16,803
Ankita and Tapishree's
education.

897
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:19,548
Dad's 10 crore rupees
loan and the debt!

898
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:21,191
Salman, who's doing drama?

899
01:04:21,304 --> 01:04:21,940
What drama?

900
01:04:22,017 --> 01:04:22,977
You or I?

901
01:04:23,183 --> 01:04:25,267
Dad's loan is 2 crores.
Not 10 crores.

902
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:27,343
Listen, listen. You are
not doing this for us.

903
01:04:27,562 --> 01:04:28,425
You are doing this for yourself.

904
01:04:28,971 --> 01:04:29,491
Sudhir...

905
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:30,644
#

906
01:04:30,705 --> 01:04:34,892
Me... Kishore... beach house...
you are collecting trophies!

907
01:04:35,623 --> 01:04:36,543
It's all about you, Salman.

908
01:04:41,325 --> 01:04:42,725
Anyways. I'm coming home.

909
01:04:43,642 --> 01:04:44,933
What if I don't?

910
01:04:46,558 --> 01:04:47,204
What?

911
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:51,225
You said I like to
collect trophies.

912
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:52,783
What will you do if I
stop collecting them?

913
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,642
I will live my life.

914
01:04:57,049 --> 01:04:57,556
Oh, life?

915
01:04:58,435 --> 01:04:59,560
What is your life about?

916
01:05:00,933 --> 01:05:02,281
Branch Manager, MG Road!

917
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:08,353
Tell me. What is your life?

918
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:11,203
Your life is that, Reena...

919
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:14,100
what I permit it to be.
Is there any other life?

920
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:14,658
Permit?

921
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:15,918
Yes.

922
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,514
Tell me. What kind of life
will you have without me?

923
01:05:20,685 --> 01:05:22,005
I'm allowing you... your life?

924
01:05:22,345 --> 01:05:22,951
So there.

925
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:24,810
please don't lecture.

926
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,472
The girls are hungry. Come home.

927
01:05:32,442 --> 01:05:33,208
Please come home.

928
01:05:35,459 --> 01:05:35,966
Hello.

929
01:05:40,642 --> 01:05:41,933
That's enough.

930
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:42,993
Come back home.

931
01:05:49,452 --> 01:05:50,026
Reena?

932
01:06:00,184 --> 01:06:01,064
You're dropping me?

933
01:06:10,808 --> 01:06:11,568
Sudhir,

934
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,198
should we tell Salman?

935
01:06:16,581 --> 01:06:17,222
About what?

936
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,520
About us.

937
01:06:18,893 --> 01:06:19,746
You... me.

938
01:06:29,933 --> 01:06:31,928
Reena, start working again.

939
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:34,292
Half of your problems
will be solved.

940
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,620
What about the remaining 50 percent?

941
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:43,855
Salman also said the same thing.

942
01:06:44,175 --> 01:06:47,618
I'm giving you 60 percent freedom.
So, what is your problem?

943
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:55,910
Let's tell him about
it and make it simple.

944
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:00,964
What's so complex here?

945
01:07:03,842 --> 01:07:06,008
-It's not?
-This is life.

946
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:09,668
This is an allowance.

947
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:13,100
You know Salman.

948
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,357
-He talks and forgets about it.
-I don't.

949
01:07:17,543 --> 01:07:18,210
I don't forget.

950
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:25,439
Anyway...

951
01:07:26,683 --> 01:07:27,653
He will be here soon.

952
01:07:34,453 --> 01:07:36,859
-What?
-I told him to come over.

953
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:39,600
Who did you call?

954
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,868
You should have told me.

955
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:45,538
How could you do this?

956
01:07:45,655 --> 01:07:46,861
You've no right, okay?

957
01:07:48,782 --> 01:07:50,097
Is this not about me as well?

958
01:07:51,392 --> 01:07:52,975
-Get dressed!
-I am dressed!

959
01:07:53,558 --> 01:07:56,538
He wasn't supposed to come
here before the house-warming!

960
01:07:58,142 --> 01:07:59,392
Why are you laughing?

961
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,308
Get dressed!

962
01:08:11,249 --> 01:08:11,909
Wear these shoes.

963
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:13,092
Why should I?

964
01:08:14,308 --> 01:08:15,642
You always wear them at home.

965
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:18,540
-But here I take them off.
-I don't want him to notice.

966
01:08:21,183 --> 01:08:21,933
Reena...

967
01:08:22,657 --> 01:08:25,548
What has Salman got to
do with our relationship?

968
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,094
Stop being childish!

969
01:08:29,725 --> 01:08:31,950
I knew that you had a
crush on me in college.

970
01:08:32,982 --> 01:08:34,069
Did you ever talk to me?

971
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:39,015
If Salman didn't make a
scene at Jamshed's party,

972
01:08:39,341 --> 01:08:40,284
would you have dropped me off?

973
01:08:46,267 --> 01:08:47,636
If I wasn't Salman's wife...

974
01:08:48,775 --> 01:08:49,609
would you have kissed me

975
01:08:53,454 --> 01:08:54,831
Do you believe that
if we tell Salman,

976
01:08:54,892 --> 01:08:56,064
we can meet again?

977
01:09:01,027 --> 01:09:01,869
Sudhir,

978
01:09:02,933 --> 01:09:04,382
if he learns the truth...

979
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,290
would he want to be
in this marriage?

980
01:09:08,017 --> 01:09:09,483
Our marriage will end.

981
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:18,279
Ankita and Tapishree...
have you thought about them?

982
01:09:18,433 --> 01:09:19,977
Whenever I talk to you,

983
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:21,450
why do the kids always come in?

984
01:09:21,511 --> 01:09:23,474
-Do you feel it is wrong?
-Yes. It is wrong.

985
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:26,327
They will be raised as children
of divorced parents are.

986
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:28,355
What?

987
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:33,679
Sudhir, I'm tired.

988
01:09:36,225 --> 01:09:40,208
I cannot take this anymore.

989
01:09:42,017 --> 01:09:43,176
If you want a divorce,

990
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:45,225
what is the point
in telling Salman?

991
01:09:45,308 --> 01:09:48,308
If Salman sees us together
after our divorce...

992
01:09:48,909 --> 01:09:50,155
how would he feel?

993
01:09:51,486 --> 01:09:51,976
Us...

994
01:09:53,024 --> 01:09:54,142
us together?

995
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,448
Yes.

996
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:09,875
Yeah.

997
01:10:11,197 --> 01:10:11,844
Yeah. Yeah.

998
01:10:13,028 --> 01:10:14,088
Forward the email.

999
01:10:15,225 --> 01:10:15,885
Yeah. Cool.

1000
01:10:17,466 --> 01:10:18,110
Yes.

1001
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:21,264
It's 12 in the afternoon in New York.
So just call them up.

1002
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:23,621
Okay.

1003
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:26,517
Forward the email to me.

1004
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:28,692
Alright?

1005
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:31,058
Okay then. Bye.

1006
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:33,474
Nice room.

1007
01:10:34,156 --> 01:10:34,869
Nice house.

1008
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:36,308
#

1009
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:37,817
Very nice.

1010
01:10:37,878 --> 01:10:39,420
Actually, there were
many colours earlier.

1011
01:10:39,556 --> 01:10:40,735
I repainted the walls to off-white.

1012
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,683
The contractor's dog died.
So the work stalled.

1013
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:45,011
It looks empty, doesn't it?

1014
01:10:45,234 --> 01:10:46,443
Empty is good!

1015
01:10:46,933 --> 01:10:47,746
We all need space.

1016
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:50,175
Get me a house like this.

1017
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,841
Yours is better, pal!

1018
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,596
But it should be only mine...

1019
01:10:54,176 --> 01:10:55,497
I have no voice there.

1020
01:10:55,558 --> 01:10:57,112
Even this house
belonged to a couple.

1021
01:11:08,933 --> 01:11:11,353
My wife looks pretty
in your house.

1022
01:11:15,118 --> 01:11:16,635
How much did it cost you?

1023
01:11:17,808 --> 01:11:18,481
Not much.

1024
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,410
It belonged to a couple.

1025
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:23,407
I got it in a distress
sale at the separation.

1026
01:11:25,642 --> 01:11:27,031
What does Kishore
Thadani have to say?

1027
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:30,396
He's your friend.
You tell me if he is serious or not.

1028
01:11:30,695 --> 01:11:32,195
He is. Keep at it.

1029
01:11:34,142 --> 01:11:35,780
She is up to something.
I know it.

1030
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,513
Salman, you provoke her.
-I provoke her?

1031
01:11:39,933 --> 01:11:41,850
You just know her version.

1032
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:44,718
-You have not heard my version.
-Did you tell Reena?

1033
01:11:45,008 --> 01:11:46,200
I had no chance.

1034
01:11:46,975 --> 01:11:47,893
She'll give back a bouncer.

1035
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:51,021
'I gave up my career
for you and the kids!

1036
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,288
I could have been
anything I wanted!'

1037
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:56,642
Could've been queen, could've
been Chanda Kochchar'.

1038
01:11:56,725 --> 01:11:58,894
Could've been Kareena Kapoor,
could've been Mary Kom!'

1039
01:11:59,475 --> 01:12:00,558
No matter what, you...

1040
01:12:01,281 --> 01:12:03,406
You must not use the word
'allowance' with her.

1041
01:12:03,467 --> 01:12:05,812
But why did she lie to me that
she is going to Geeta's house...

1042
01:12:05,873 --> 01:12:07,165
So what? She is Reena!

1043
01:12:08,433 --> 01:12:09,457
Don't you understand?

1044
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:11,767
'Ice Doll', they used
to call her in college.

1045
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:13,792
No one had the balls
to stand before her.

1046
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,584
You were the only one
who talked to her.

1047
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:20,929
Handling marriage issues
is not my cup of tea.

1048
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:22,895
So, I'm telling you...

1049
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:25,331
talk to her lovingly
and take her home.

1050
01:12:25,392 --> 01:12:26,621
You also got married,
knowing this.

1051
01:12:30,195 --> 01:12:30,867
Don't you know?

1052
01:12:32,392 --> 01:12:33,299
You never told me.

1053
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,578
After my marriage,

1054
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:38,660
your mom sent me
the invitation card.

1055
01:12:38,725 --> 01:12:40,517
I ate veg biryani
at your wedding.

1056
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,877
You went away for a year

1057
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,387
and then you called
me and said that you

1058
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:44,683
signed papers in the court.

1059
01:12:44,767 --> 01:12:46,558
It has been ten years now!
Forget it.

1060
01:12:47,183 --> 01:12:48,036
Think about yourself.

1061
01:12:50,436 --> 01:12:52,092
Sometimes I feel like...

1062
01:12:53,892 --> 01:12:54,911
What did she say to you?

1063
01:12:56,421 --> 01:12:57,574
'She doesn't want
to live with me.'

1064
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:02,941
Should I divorce her?

1065
01:13:04,308 --> 01:13:05,736
Salman, have you lost it?

1066
01:13:06,024 --> 01:13:06,731
I know.

1067
01:13:08,372 --> 01:13:09,606
I know, man. I know.

1068
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,010
I don't know. I don't know.

1069
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:18,373
Listen.

1070
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:20,943
You will never find a
better package than Reena.

1071
01:13:21,004 --> 01:13:21,663
I know.

1072
01:13:22,144 --> 01:13:23,871
As a wife, mother, hostess...

1073
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:24,587
I know that.

1074
01:13:24,873 --> 01:13:26,672
I know Sudhir. Two kids,
one after the other...

1075
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:29,652
Right?

1076
01:13:31,797 --> 01:13:32,297
Yes.

1077
01:13:32,937 --> 01:13:33,664
Yes, you do.

1078
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:35,597
-You'll be finished without her.
-But...

1079
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,517
Kishore Thadani had come home.

1080
01:13:39,142 --> 01:13:40,764
She was crying in front of him?

1081
01:13:41,058 --> 01:13:42,759
When did Reena cry in
front of Kishore Thaddani?

1082
01:13:42,975 --> 01:13:44,145
You were there!

1083
01:13:45,431 --> 01:13:47,511
He's going to invest 200
crores in my company...

1084
01:13:47,854 --> 01:13:48,955
And you're crying
in front of him?

1085
01:13:49,016 --> 01:13:50,516
How could she?

1086
01:13:51,985 --> 01:13:52,905
I'm coming.

1087
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:57,639
Shall we watch a movie tonight... action.
What do you think, Reena?

1088
01:13:58,615 --> 01:13:59,764
Sure. We can go to a night show.

1089
01:14:03,033 --> 01:14:04,325
It's only a suggestion.

1090
01:14:04,445 --> 01:14:06,452
You only suggest the
things you want to do.

1091
01:14:17,048 --> 01:14:19,532
The other day you took me to
a movie that you had seen.

1092
01:14:20,058 --> 01:14:21,003
I was bored.

1093
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:22,873
But I tolerated two
hours if that movie.

1094
01:14:22,934 --> 01:14:26,684
You had decided beforehand
that you will not like it.

1095
01:14:27,428 --> 01:14:28,678
Who decided this?

1096
01:14:28,902 --> 01:14:30,756
A movie should entertain.

1097
01:14:30,817 --> 01:14:32,904
Or it should have a message
of patriotism or love.

1098
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:36,529
You like to leave things
open-ended, and I, black and white.

1099
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:37,378
What's wrong in that?

1100
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,082
Salman. Finish your food.
I'm tired!

1101
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,433
Actually, both of you are tired.

1102
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:43,850
Eat well. Go home and rest.

1103
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:45,472
Am I an idiot?

1104
01:14:46,552 --> 01:14:48,213
I drove all the way here.

1105
01:14:48,286 --> 01:14:50,397
You have all the wisdom
and I'm an idiot.

1106
01:14:50,644 --> 01:14:51,992
Pure idiot. I am the idiot.

1107
01:14:52,053 --> 01:14:53,553
-Why do you keep repeating it?.
-I will say it ten times

1108
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:54,774
Why? Are you Girish...

1109
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:57,117
Remember that guy? He would
repeat everything three times?

1110
01:14:57,178 --> 01:14:58,124
-Yes.

1111
01:14:59,278 --> 01:15:00,695
He was such an item.

1112
01:15:01,547 --> 01:15:02,653
Half fry! Half fry! Half fry!

1113
01:15:02,726 --> 01:15:05,070
The waiter got three half fries.

1114
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:09,084
What would he say?

1115
01:15:09,145 --> 01:15:10,991
Thapar is going to...

1116
01:15:13,954 --> 01:15:15,294
#

1117
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:16,979
-Where is he now?
-He's in Dallas.

1118
01:15:17,143 --> 01:15:18,656
He sold his start-up and
is living it up there.

1119
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:19,741
Lucky guy.

1120
01:15:19,953 --> 01:15:22,907
Let's plan a reunion.
Start a group.

1121
01:15:23,066 --> 01:15:23,966
Good old days.

1122
01:15:24,183 --> 01:15:25,101
Those were the days!

1123
01:15:25,214 --> 01:15:26,914
Drink coffee and the movies!

1124
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:28,061
Memories, memories, man.

1125
01:15:28,142 --> 01:15:31,142
Reena, this guy introduced
me to black coffee.

1126
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,030
-I was broke. He took care of me.
-Sudhir...

1127
01:15:38,517 --> 01:15:39,736
Can Salman and I talk?

1128
01:15:43,183 --> 01:15:44,611
-Here or...
-Yes.

1129
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:49,917
-Is it comfortable here?
-It is comfortable, Sudhir.

1130
01:15:52,655 --> 01:15:54,015
Babe, can you just
pass me the water?

1131
01:16:08,975 --> 01:16:10,058
Actually, he is right.

1132
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:12,036
Enough of this. Wash your hands.
Let's go home.

1133
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:46,062
Heart Matters. Your
YouTube channel.

1134
01:16:46,123 --> 01:16:48,648
Super successful...

1135
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:49,693
But how...

1136
01:16:52,225 --> 01:16:54,235
I always wanted to
be an IAS officer.

1137
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:56,642
My father taught in
a Government school.

1138
01:16:56,725 --> 01:16:59,494
My initial studies were
in a Government school.

1139
01:17:00,975 --> 01:17:03,966
Maybe, that is why my
English accent is...

1140
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:06,122
You hate me?

1141
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:08,025
No.

1142
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:09,545
So you love me?

1143
01:17:19,906 --> 01:17:20,999
It's not that simple.

1144
01:17:24,526 --> 01:17:28,443
I get irritated with you.

1145
01:17:29,517 --> 01:17:30,224
What about?

1146
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:31,352
What did I say?

1147
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,691
I feel a strange tightness
in my head, day and night.

1148
01:17:37,017 --> 01:17:38,286
You feel a tightness
in your head?

1149
01:17:41,392 --> 01:17:42,580
Tell me in one line.

1150
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:43,827
What's the problem?

1151
01:17:44,267 --> 01:17:46,064
You need a mother, not a wife.

1152
01:17:49,142 --> 01:17:50,163
I can't do it.

1153
01:17:57,517 --> 01:17:59,939
Sudhir saw me crying, not
at Kishore Thaddani's party...

1154
01:18:01,975 --> 01:18:03,667
but at Jamshed's party.

1155
01:18:07,253 --> 01:18:08,631
Sudhir and I

1156
01:18:11,535 --> 01:18:12,662
have been together
for three years.

1157
01:18:20,484 --> 01:18:22,698
Sudhir Batra? Indiabulls?

1158
01:18:27,778 --> 01:18:30,244
My father suffered a
heart attack, and...

1159
01:18:30,548 --> 01:18:34,160
We could not afford the treatment.
He passed away.

1160
01:18:35,413 --> 01:18:38,407
I think, that was when I
decided to be a heart surgeon.

1161
01:18:39,398 --> 01:18:39,964
And...

1162
01:18:41,267 --> 01:18:44,077
So, greatness started
with a tragedy.

1163
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,392
Let me tell our viewers...

1164
01:18:48,493 --> 01:18:50,660
Dr. Sinha is the only cardiologist...

1165
01:18:59,725 --> 01:19:00,432
Sudhir?

1166
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:26,220
It is a reversible process.

1167
01:19:26,374 --> 01:19:28,476
Take care of it and
you will be fine.

1168
01:19:29,906 --> 01:19:32,531
If there are any technical
flaws, we are there to mend them.

1169
01:19:32,975 --> 01:19:36,567
But my focus has
has been more on...

1170
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:39,967
Salman wants to talk.

1171
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:10,259
Kishore sent a text.

1172
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:12,917
'Hi Salman.'

1173
01:20:15,302 --> 01:20:17,575
'Just finished with the team.
We are going ahead.'

1174
01:20:17,993 --> 01:20:20,573
'Option 1. 130 crores, 1st stage...'

1175
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:23,460
'Congrats buddy. Take
good care of my money.'

1176
01:20:23,521 --> 01:20:25,807
'Smiley. Let's catch up tomorrow.' Kishore

1177
01:20:36,356 --> 01:20:37,276
Congrats, friend.

1178
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:41,778
Reena...

1179
01:20:42,353 --> 01:20:43,199
It's good news.

1180
01:20:43,725 --> 01:20:44,353
Yes.

1181
01:20:44,902 --> 01:20:46,602
#

1182
01:20:46,902 --> 01:20:47,476
Great.

1183
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:48,583
But boss...

1184
01:20:48,903 --> 01:20:50,111
I'm exhausted.

1185
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,024
Don't go. Sleep here.

1186
01:20:53,275 --> 01:20:54,149
#

1187
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,616
I'll show you the bedroom.

1188
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:57,290
Yeah. I think that's the best option.

1189
01:23:53,975 --> 01:23:54,930
What are the plans for Saturday?

1190
01:23:56,308 --> 01:23:56,974
You tell me.

1191
01:23:58,308 --> 01:23:58,819
Golf?

1192
01:23:59,725 --> 01:24:00,663
Okay. Ranjeet was saying,

1193
01:24:00,724 --> 01:24:02,327
let's have lunch in
the club after that.

1194
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:03,786
Is he back?

1195
01:24:04,054 --> 01:24:04,539
Yes.

1196
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,234
How is he doing?

1197
01:24:06,382 --> 01:24:06,855
Happy.

1198
01:24:07,561 --> 01:24:08,288
Single now.

1199
01:24:09,183 --> 01:24:10,480
His profile on Tinder says...

1200
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:12,866
I love adventure sports.

1201
01:24:13,158 --> 01:24:15,133
It is another matter, that he
can't even catch a Frisbee.

1202
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:16,706
Shit! I am getting late.

1203
01:24:17,107 --> 01:24:18,477
-Salman.
-Thadani's team is visiting today.

1204
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:20,564
I left my sunglasses inside.

1205
01:24:21,374 --> 01:24:21,954
Sudhir.

1206
01:24:40,499 --> 01:24:41,912
-Sudhir...
-Not now.

1207
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,007
We will talk later.

1208
01:24:46,393 --> 01:24:47,282
Will I see you again?

1209
01:24:55,353 --> 01:24:56,360
Salman knows.

1210
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:06,890
He told me two things.

1211
01:25:10,255 --> 01:25:11,202
This must stop.

1212
01:25:13,603 --> 01:25:14,396
And he said...

1213
01:25:19,892 --> 01:25:21,558
you should not know...

1214
01:25:22,716 --> 01:25:23,734
that he knows.

1215
01:25:59,084 --> 01:26:00,703
-Did you say anything to him?
-No.

1216
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,782
What did I say that
day, at Jamshed's party?

1217
01:26:09,255 --> 01:26:09,875
Nothing.

1218
01:26:11,753 --> 01:26:14,145
-So you guys were...
-He called me two days later.

1219
01:26:14,652 --> 01:26:15,489
I didn't answer it.

1220
01:26:17,653 --> 01:26:19,502
Then I called him
back after a week.

1221
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:21,476
Had we fought again?

1222
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,181
No.

1223
01:26:30,548 --> 01:26:31,534
It was a peaceful day.

1224
01:26:42,598 --> 01:26:44,607
Libertina! The fish fry
was outstanding!

1225
01:27:23,683 --> 01:27:24,481
Ms. Rekha...

1226
01:27:25,433 --> 01:27:26,331
Principal sir...

1227
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:28,928
Is all okay at the library?

1228
01:27:29,987 --> 01:27:31,848
It was dusty. I got it cleaned.

1229
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:34,140
-On the books?
-On the fans, sir...

1230
01:27:34,475 --> 01:27:35,840
Who reads books these days?

1231
01:27:36,142 --> 01:27:37,766
The library is always empty.

1232
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:40,546
If you get bored, come to
my office for a cup of tea.

1233
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:42,119
I have invited
you several times.

1234
01:27:43,105 --> 01:27:45,852
I have also told you several times sir.
I don't drink tea.

1235
01:27:47,059 --> 01:27:47,722
Is that all?

1236
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:49,315
That's it.

1237
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:50,424
Thank you, sir.

1238
01:27:56,975 --> 01:27:58,808
The principal ogles
at me so hard,

1239
01:27:59,339 --> 01:28:01,232
his eyes will pop out one day.

1240
01:28:03,017 --> 01:28:03,951
So, Meghaji...

1241
01:28:04,933 --> 01:28:06,044
Are you happy...

1242
01:28:06,517 --> 01:28:07,493
or suffering?

1243
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,611
-Ma'am, I can't do it.
-I know.

1244
01:28:11,225 --> 01:28:12,437
Come here. Let me do it.

1245
01:28:15,183 --> 01:28:18,026
Not every soldier is
capable of firing a bullet.

1246
01:28:19,433 --> 01:28:20,537
Ask me.

1247
01:28:21,058 --> 01:28:22,439
I am experienced
in such battles.

1248
01:28:23,892 --> 01:28:25,309
And now, my dear...

1249
01:28:25,482 --> 01:28:27,275
are ready for battle.

1250
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:29,621
Is it too revealing?

1251
01:28:29,682 --> 01:28:30,807
I wish it was.

1252
01:28:32,752 --> 01:28:34,960
Rekha ma'am. You are too much!

1253
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,558
Go! You'll be late!

1254
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:38,089
Good luck, soldier!

1255
01:28:39,235 --> 01:28:40,009
Megha Verma?

1256
01:28:40,369 --> 01:28:40,995
Yes?

1257
01:28:41,403 --> 01:28:42,390
This is my daughter, Sanditi.

1258
01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:44,898
Sorry, I'm late for the meeting.

1259
01:28:44,975 --> 01:28:45,914
She never told me about it.

1260
01:28:45,975 --> 01:28:48,432
No worries. She is an excellent student!
I have no complaints.

1261
01:28:48,493 --> 01:28:49,303
But I have some.

1262
01:28:50,017 --> 01:28:52,392
Thank God I checked her phone!
Or I would not have known.

1263
01:28:52,832 --> 01:28:54,319
Look what she is up to! Look!

1264
01:28:54,606 --> 01:28:56,130
-She's eating ice cream.
-I am eating ice cream.

1265
01:28:56,308 --> 01:28:56,929
What happened?

1266
01:28:57,216 --> 01:28:58,517
Did you not like the flavour?

1267
01:28:58,745 --> 01:29:00,978
What is the advantage of sending
her to an all-girls school...

1268
01:29:01,142 --> 01:29:03,494
If she is dancing
around with mad boys?

1269
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:05,817
And... she is sending
it by telegram.

1270
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,448
It's Instagram, Mom!

1271
01:29:07,725 --> 01:29:08,675
Ma'am,

1272
01:29:08,935 --> 01:29:11,665
when both school children
participate in debates together,

1273
01:29:11,758 --> 01:29:12,900
friendship happens.

1274
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:14,868
Please, Ms. Rekha!

1275
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:17,534
If we let you mind our children,

1276
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:19,972
our culture will be washed out.

1277
01:29:20,799 --> 01:29:22,527
You have made
detergents of teachers.

1278
01:29:22,626 --> 01:29:23,540
One minute! One minute!

1279
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:25,998
Can you do something
about her school dress?

1280
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:27,389
When she leaves the
house in the morning,

1281
01:29:27,532 --> 01:29:28,705
her skirt is in Lucknow.

1282
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:30,295
Slowly it shortens
to reach Kanpur.

1283
01:29:31,017 --> 01:29:32,933
Why do you not ask them to
wear salwar-kameez instead?

1284
01:29:33,502 --> 01:29:34,603
It will keep their legs covered.

1285
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:56,652
-Sorry for being late, Paras.
-Don't worry. No problem!

1286
01:29:59,142 --> 01:30:00,697
I was hanging out
with my friend.

1287
01:30:03,032 --> 01:30:03,692
Google.

1288
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,183
So... how's you?

1289
01:30:13,717 --> 01:30:14,237
Fine.

1290
01:30:19,428 --> 01:30:21,430
Should we make small
talk or get to the point?

1291
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:23,718
I've just come.

1292
01:30:23,825 --> 01:30:25,614
Let's make some small
talk to start with.

1293
01:30:25,675 --> 01:30:26,161
Correct.

1294
01:30:27,642 --> 01:30:29,594
It is not cold enough
to use a shawl now.

1295
01:30:30,023 --> 01:30:31,273
I feel the cold
more that others.

1296
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:34,404
You are sweating. You can take
off the shawl. No problem.

1297
01:30:40,433 --> 01:30:42,231
You can keep it on, if you like.

1298
01:30:43,677 --> 01:30:44,569
I'm good.

1299
01:30:49,924 --> 01:30:50,504
See...

1300
01:30:51,133 --> 01:30:52,595
this is our third meeting...

1301
01:30:53,538 --> 01:30:54,824
that too, without our families.

1302
01:30:55,296 --> 01:30:57,837
So I want to speak openly.

1303
01:30:58,151 --> 01:30:59,590
Yes. Sure.

1304
01:31:00,212 --> 01:31:01,372
I'm a shy boy.

1305
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:04,927
I have never asked a
girl for her number.

1306
01:31:07,267 --> 01:31:10,314
-No, I did when I took her sari.
-What!

1307
01:31:11,183 --> 01:31:13,020
I spilled my Cola on
here in the train.

1308
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:14,241
So, I kept her sari with me.

1309
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:15,956
-You took her sari off on the train?
-Yes!

1310
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:18,013
No, I mean...

1311
01:31:19,165 --> 01:31:21,364
The next day, I took
it to get it washed.

1312
01:31:21,637 --> 01:31:22,157
I see.

1313
01:31:22,808 --> 01:31:24,263
But the Cola stains
are stubborn.

1314
01:31:27,392 --> 01:31:28,629
Can I ask you something?

1315
01:31:28,836 --> 01:31:29,556
Of course!

1316
01:31:29,933 --> 01:31:31,310
Did the Cola spill accidentally,

1317
01:31:31,704 --> 01:31:32,577
or did you spill
it intentionally?

1318
01:31:34,767 --> 01:31:36,258
Please, Meghaji...

1319
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:42,723
I studied in an all-boys school.
I don't have such courage.

1320
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:46,295
Why? I have heard that
all-boys school students

1321
01:31:46,356 --> 01:31:49,410
often treat all-girls school
students to ice creams.

1322
01:31:49,883 --> 01:31:50,457
What!

1323
01:31:55,227 --> 01:31:57,100
You are smart, Megha.
I know now.

1324
01:31:57,683 --> 01:31:59,769
You are trying to
distract me again,

1325
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:01,018
but it won't work this time.

1326
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:08,117
Shall we get to the point?

1327
01:32:08,683 --> 01:32:10,600
-No.
-Why not, Megha?

1328
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:12,481
He's a such a good boy!

1329
01:32:12,933 --> 01:32:15,308
He has a good job!
He has good values.

1330
01:32:15,892 --> 01:32:18,188
He is respectable
and respectful.

1331
01:32:19,441 --> 01:32:21,151
Ma, he is a little dark skinned,

1332
01:32:22,044 --> 01:32:23,469
but you'll balance that out.

1333
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:27,594
So when everything is
good, what is your problem?

1334
01:32:28,729 --> 01:32:31,080
I cannot tell the difference
between good and bad guys.

1335
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,223
What do you mean?

1336
01:32:33,579 --> 01:32:35,182
You made me study,
not in a coed school,

1337
01:32:35,243 --> 01:32:36,271
but an all girls school.

1338
01:32:37,017 --> 01:32:39,308
You gave me, neither
freedom, nor an allowance.

1339
01:32:39,892 --> 01:32:41,348
Also, I wasn't brave enough,

1340
01:32:42,167 --> 01:32:45,170
to hang around with
boys from other schools

1341
01:32:45,317 --> 01:32:46,457
and speak with them

1342
01:32:47,558 --> 01:32:50,142
or make them buy me ice creams.

1343
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:54,897
That is why I am saying...

1344
01:32:56,142 --> 01:32:57,136
get married.

1345
01:32:58,100 --> 01:32:59,901
You can have as much
ice cream as you want.

1346
01:33:31,775 --> 01:33:33,525
Paras. You made it!

1347
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:52,632
-Who are you searching for?

1348
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:56,302
Normally, friends
show up to play prank.

1349
01:33:58,433 --> 01:33:59,320
No one came.

1350
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:02,313
Please come in.

1351
01:34:09,142 --> 01:34:10,854
They must have got
drunk and gone home.

1352
01:34:12,894 --> 01:34:14,168
-Come on.
-What!

1353
01:34:15,677 --> 01:34:16,350
Have a seat.

1354
01:34:20,142 --> 01:34:20,809
Sit.

1355
01:34:37,206 --> 01:34:38,124
If you could be an animal,

1356
01:34:38,185 --> 01:34:39,419
which one would
you prefer to be?

1357
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,298
What kind of a question is that?

1358
01:34:41,554 --> 01:34:44,115
At work also, we ask
such silly questions.

1359
01:34:44,176 --> 01:34:45,329
People enjoy it.

1360
01:34:47,892 --> 01:34:48,673
So tell me.

1361
01:34:49,349 --> 01:34:50,457
Animal?

1362
01:34:52,933 --> 01:34:53,604
A cat.

1363
01:34:54,308 --> 01:34:55,045
A cat!

1364
01:34:57,445 --> 01:34:58,666
They have nine lives.

1365
01:35:00,058 --> 01:35:02,205
Seven lives with me...
and two extra!

1366
01:35:03,272 --> 01:35:03,857
Meow!

1367
01:35:06,808 --> 01:35:08,850
Okay, you tell me, what
would you prefer to be?

1368
01:35:11,725 --> 01:35:12,679
A crocodile.

1369
01:35:14,225 --> 01:35:15,748
The sleeping devil.

1370
01:35:17,043 --> 01:35:18,334
If he wakes up, he will bite!

1371
01:35:20,975 --> 01:35:22,814
Do you know anything
about crocodiles?

1372
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:23,478
No.

1373
01:35:24,003 --> 01:35:25,612
I have watched Nat Geo a lot.

1374
01:35:26,308 --> 01:35:30,044
The male crocodile blows bubbles
in the water with his breath.

1375
01:35:31,743 --> 01:35:32,673
Really!

1376
01:35:33,487 --> 01:35:34,091
Why?

1377
01:35:34,531 --> 01:35:36,117
To attract the female!

1378
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,475
To excite them.

1379
01:35:40,308 --> 01:35:42,144
-Do you want some water?
-I'm fine!

1380
01:35:44,892 --> 01:35:46,126
Okay, I'll have some.

1381
01:36:41,683 --> 01:36:42,850
Congratulations.

1382
01:37:01,767 --> 01:37:02,801
Are you drying your hair?

1383
01:37:11,975 --> 01:37:12,977
Are you drying clothes?

1384
01:37:53,725 --> 01:37:55,070
Are you chopping tomatoes?

1385
01:37:55,933 --> 01:37:56,739
No.

1386
01:38:15,138 --> 01:38:16,683
If aunties in the colony are
happy, Mom is also happy.

1387
01:38:17,233 --> 01:38:17,877
Look, child...

1388
01:38:18,465 --> 01:38:19,616
I will be happy

1389
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:22,839
when you deliver two children
quickly, one after one.

1390
01:38:23,378 --> 01:38:25,957
Oh, Ma! You do not lose any
opportunity to mention this.

1391
01:38:26,357 --> 01:38:27,180
Keep quiet.

1392
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,672
This is a discussion
between women.

1393
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,392
-What do you say?
-Right.

1394
01:38:31,618 --> 01:38:35,743
Okay. You ladies talk, we are
going to go get some air.

1395
01:38:36,344 --> 01:38:36,917
Excuse me.

1396
01:38:42,642 --> 01:38:43,495
Megha...

1397
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:45,581
listen to us.

1398
01:38:46,892 --> 01:38:48,549
Look at my elder
daughter-in-law, Sandhya.

1399
01:38:49,326 --> 01:38:50,374
She looks so happy.

1400
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,191
She delivered two kids,
one after the other.

1401
01:38:56,729 --> 01:38:58,904
She spends all her time
looking after them.

1402
01:38:59,389 --> 01:39:01,331
She does not need to
work hard anymore.

1403
01:39:01,392 --> 01:39:02,029
Hard work?

1404
01:39:02,289 --> 01:39:04,202
Yes, my dear, this is hard work.

1405
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:06,066
Look,

1406
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:09,811
your mother-in-law
squawks all day

1407
01:39:10,327 --> 01:39:12,410
and the bed squeaks all night.

1408
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:14,524
Once you have two kids,

1409
01:39:14,886 --> 01:39:17,144
all your time will be spent
with their squaks and squeaks.

1410
01:39:19,058 --> 01:39:20,449
When desires are fulfilled,

1411
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,469
toil will end.

1412
01:39:23,942 --> 01:39:26,683
What if desires
are not fulfilled?

1413
01:39:27,267 --> 01:39:28,157
How is that possible?

1414
01:39:30,036 --> 01:39:31,017
Tell me something,

1415
01:39:31,573 --> 01:39:34,703
can a woman desire
anything more than a child?

1416
01:39:35,894 --> 01:39:36,683
No.

1417
01:39:37,808 --> 01:39:38,762
See.

1418
01:39:43,683 --> 01:39:44,971
So...

1419
01:39:46,451 --> 01:39:50,170
this is why teacher madam is
upset since morning. I noticed...

1420
01:39:51,558 --> 01:39:52,944
you were upset
with what ma said.

1421
01:39:54,558 --> 01:39:57,531
Don't listen to ma. We will
have a kids when we have them.

1422
01:39:58,433 --> 01:39:59,817
We must make love now.

1423
01:40:01,415 --> 01:40:02,942
Lots of love.

1424
01:40:03,934 --> 01:40:05,280
You are enjoying
married life a lot.

1425
01:40:06,347 --> 01:40:07,828
You are always excited!

1426
01:40:07,889 --> 01:40:08,455
Hey!

1427
01:40:09,058 --> 01:40:11,517
You are also enjoying very much.
I noticed, understand?

1428
01:40:12,058 --> 01:40:13,605
You are happy, too.

1429
01:40:18,683 --> 01:40:20,055
Have you ever watched
an adult film?

1430
01:40:21,728 --> 01:40:22,369
What?

1431
01:40:22,829 --> 01:40:23,769
Adult film?

1432
01:40:25,151 --> 01:40:25,855
Have you seen?

1433
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:27,876
Yes.

1434
01:40:28,475 --> 01:40:30,225
Back in school... college.

1435
01:40:30,308 --> 01:40:31,790
Even till last month... Why?

1436
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,306
When the guy says...

1437
01:40:36,994 --> 01:40:37,948
Oh baby!

1438
01:40:38,571 --> 01:40:39,438
Oh baby!

1439
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,434
Oh baby!

1440
01:40:43,183 --> 01:40:44,550
And the girl says...

1441
01:40:44,969 --> 01:40:45,649
Oh yeah!

1442
01:40:46,336 --> 01:40:47,090
Oh yeah!

1443
01:40:48,836 --> 01:40:49,583
Oh yeah!

1444
01:40:51,683 --> 01:40:53,101
They have a good time together.

1445
01:40:54,604 --> 01:40:55,390
Together.

1446
01:40:58,433 --> 01:40:59,020
Yes!

1447
01:40:59,808 --> 01:41:01,767
I have never understood that!

1448
01:41:02,477 --> 01:41:04,314
You either have sex or talk!

1449
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:06,350
Or sit down, relax
and talk or have sex.

1450
01:41:06,411 --> 01:41:07,567
What this 'doing
both together' is,

1451
01:41:07,628 --> 01:41:08,736
I have never been
able to understand

1452
01:41:09,142 --> 01:41:10,975
See, also at work in the office,

1453
01:41:11,183 --> 01:41:13,880
I either check the accounts
or type on the computer.

1454
01:41:13,941 --> 01:41:15,850
I do not have this funda
of doing both together.

1455
01:41:16,023 --> 01:41:17,129
It feels stupid.

1456
01:41:17,642 --> 01:41:18,847
Look! Birds!

1457
01:41:24,425 --> 01:41:25,669
Take these birds for example.

1458
01:41:26,475 --> 01:41:28,642
They either lay eggs or fly.

1459
01:41:28,725 --> 01:41:30,683
Have you seen a
flying bird lay eggs?

1460
01:41:39,833 --> 01:41:40,522
What's wrong?

1461
01:41:42,017 --> 01:41:43,096
Nothing...

1462
01:41:43,298 --> 01:41:45,560
Megha, the Principal
has called you.

1463
01:41:48,108 --> 01:41:48,830
Go.

1464
01:41:49,143 --> 01:41:50,283
All the best.

1465
01:41:53,344 --> 01:41:55,990
Principal sir, please
tell me what I should do.

1466
01:41:56,308 --> 01:41:57,700
Such books are issued
in this school?

1467
01:41:58,680 --> 01:41:59,920
What were you thinking
when you issued such books?

1468
01:42:00,053 --> 01:42:01,433
-Ma'am, I did not issue the book...
-Hold on.

1469
01:42:01,876 --> 01:42:02,883
She did not issue the book.

1470
01:42:03,022 --> 01:42:05,118
It was issued by our
librarian, Rekha ma'am.

1471
01:42:05,735 --> 01:42:08,779
Oh! I understand now!

1472
01:42:09,392 --> 01:42:12,211
She is a divorcee. What
can teach our children?

1473
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:16,789
What is there in this book.
Let me take a look at it.

1474
01:42:19,158 --> 01:42:19,708
I see.

1475
01:42:21,373 --> 01:42:22,356
What is the story?

1476
01:42:22,832 --> 01:42:24,806
-I have not read it, sir.
-Lolita!

1477
01:42:25,433 --> 01:42:26,677
Read it and you will understand.

1478
01:42:27,549 --> 01:42:29,589
It is about a relationship
between a father and daughter.

1479
01:42:30,617 --> 01:42:31,892
So you have read it.

1480
01:42:32,128 --> 01:42:32,934
No!

1481
01:42:33,517 --> 01:42:34,244
Why should I read

1482
01:42:34,305 --> 01:42:35,725
such strange stories of father
and daughter relationships?

1483
01:42:35,828 --> 01:42:37,104
She and her father
have read it.

1484
01:42:41,918 --> 01:42:44,888
-Call Rekha ma'am, please.
-Okay.

1485
01:42:45,835 --> 01:42:46,600
Jaswant!

1486
01:42:47,046 --> 01:42:47,407
Yes sir?

1487
01:42:47,468 --> 01:42:49,008
Ask Rekha m'am to
come here immediately.

1488
01:42:49,259 --> 01:42:49,758
Okay.

1489
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,070
Lolita!

1490
01:43:44,453 --> 01:43:47,547
Light of my life!
Fire of my loins!

1491
01:43:47,993 --> 01:43:48,713
Spelling mistake.

1492
01:43:48,864 --> 01:43:50,621
Ma'am, this book
is about animals.

1493
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:52,058
Who knows what is written?

1494
01:43:52,119 --> 01:43:53,013
I will correct it.

1495
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:54,850
Where is Rekha ma'am?

1496
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:56,961
Let me find out.

1497
01:43:58,569 --> 01:43:59,876
Lion. L-I-O-N.

1498
01:44:58,058 --> 01:44:59,900
Nobody has died. All is well.

1499
01:45:02,426 --> 01:45:05,343
Why in the library?

1500
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:07,869
I had two fantasies.

1501
01:45:09,892 --> 01:45:10,722
Let me tell you.

1502
01:45:12,361 --> 01:45:14,593
In a locked airplane toilet...

1503
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:17,177
and the other, in the midst
of books in a library.

1504
01:45:18,092 --> 01:45:19,293
That is why I thought,

1505
01:45:19,515 --> 01:45:21,100
let me fulfil one fantasy.

1506
01:45:24,034 --> 01:45:26,131
Men are selfish.

1507
01:45:26,725 --> 01:45:28,252
They cannot make a woman happy.

1508
01:45:29,183 --> 01:45:30,579
We have to do it ourselves.

1509
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,099
And this useless principal...

1510
01:45:33,892 --> 01:45:36,683
took away my happiness
and my husband as well.

1511
01:45:37,028 --> 01:45:37,599
Husband?

1512
01:45:38,368 --> 01:45:39,269
Yes. It can be
called my husband.

1513
01:45:39,808 --> 01:45:41,593
It's always with
me, day and night.

1514
01:45:42,458 --> 01:45:43,490
It does not talk.

1515
01:45:44,017 --> 01:45:45,331
and keeps me happy.

1516
01:45:46,392 --> 01:45:47,725
Can I get a better husband?

1517
01:45:50,433 --> 01:45:51,479
Anyway, enough for today.

1518
01:45:51,999 --> 01:45:52,512
Shall I go?

1519
01:46:05,042 --> 01:46:05,886
What happened?

1520
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:07,874
It's Sunday.

1521
01:47:14,558 --> 01:47:15,253
Hello, Grandma.

1522
01:47:15,933 --> 01:47:19,642
-Have you seen the TV remote?
-No.

1523
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:23,471
Where is it?

1524
01:48:24,702 --> 01:48:25,722
Megha!

1525
01:48:25,807 --> 01:48:26,393
Oh shit!

1526
01:48:26,991 --> 01:48:29,358
Megha! Come soon. What
has happened to Paras.

1527
01:48:31,008 --> 01:48:33,670
Sandhya! Get the First Aid kit!

1528
01:48:33,732 --> 01:48:35,187
-Hurry up!
-Does it hurt?

1529
01:48:35,642 --> 01:48:36,288
Paras!

1530
01:48:36,505 --> 01:48:38,399
-Come Megha. Sit beside me.
-What happened, Paras.

1531
01:48:41,745 --> 01:48:42,600
Are you all right?

1532
01:48:42,661 --> 01:48:44,860
Forget about her! Tell
me how did you get hurt?

1533
01:48:44,921 --> 01:48:48,591
It was my fault, Mom!

1534
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:52,073
I do not know why I felt
that Megha needed me.

1535
01:48:52,589 --> 01:48:54,004
I immediately left the office,

1536
01:48:54,099 --> 01:48:56,100
took a rickshaw and told
the driver to hurry.

1537
01:48:56,183 --> 01:48:57,765
And the driver
drove at full speed

1538
01:48:57,826 --> 01:48:59,509
and we collided with a bull.

1539
01:49:01,749 --> 01:49:03,209
And the saying came true.

1540
01:49:03,763 --> 01:49:05,364
Come bull. Hit me.

1541
01:49:06,161 --> 01:49:07,594
I do not know about the bull,

1542
01:49:07,655 --> 01:49:09,606
but the rickshaw
toppled, and I fell.

1543
01:49:09,933 --> 01:49:11,694
I lost consciousness
for a minute.

1544
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:16,654
As they say 'All people
seek light in the dark'

1545
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:19,576
but I was searching for Megha.

1546
01:49:20,308 --> 01:49:21,046
Megha.

1547
01:49:22,058 --> 01:49:23,433
Megha.

1548
01:49:24,084 --> 01:49:25,511
Why are you sitting
and looking at him!

1549
01:49:25,598 --> 01:49:26,673
Go get him a glass of water!

1550
01:49:27,051 --> 01:49:28,433
Go! Look over here.

1551
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:35,558
Why did I not see this before?

1552
01:49:45,143 --> 01:49:47,683
-Nothing will happen.
-Just blow on it gently!

1553
01:49:58,572 --> 01:49:59,949
Why is this not working?

1554
01:51:39,142 --> 01:51:42,392
-Sister, please listen to me...
-Not at all!

1555
01:51:43,228 --> 01:51:44,030
Please tell us.

1556
01:51:44,643 --> 01:51:46,205
Why should we accept her.

1557
01:51:47,485 --> 01:51:49,093
To save your respect...

1558
01:51:49,561 --> 01:51:51,243
we'll tell our relatives...

1559
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:52,657
that your daughter...

1560
01:51:53,737 --> 01:51:54,790
is epileptic.

1561
01:51:58,892 --> 01:51:59,620
Sister,

1562
01:52:00,329 --> 01:52:02,027
how can this
marriage break apart?

1563
01:52:02,433 --> 01:52:05,933
-I beg you...
-Ma. There is no need to do all this.

1564
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:11,164
Look Sister...

1565
01:52:12,335 --> 01:52:13,568
In this family,

1566
01:52:13,982 --> 01:52:15,535
we do not want a child from
her womb, in this family.

1567
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,787
Ma... enough now.

1568
01:52:18,694 --> 01:52:19,860
This is between us.

1569
01:52:21,202 --> 01:52:24,106
If it happened in the bedroom,
it was between you both.

1570
01:52:24,733 --> 01:52:27,093
But, because it
happened in the open,

1571
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:29,077
it's a family matter!

1572
01:52:29,868 --> 01:52:31,003
I have heard enough!

1573
01:52:31,843 --> 01:52:33,595
And if you care so much for her,

1574
01:52:33,892 --> 01:52:35,653
you also stay here. Understand?

1575
01:52:37,413 --> 01:52:38,127
Goodbye.

1576
01:52:39,556 --> 01:52:41,179
-Sister, please listen.
-I don't want to listen to anything.

1577
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:42,840
Please listen to me. Sister!

1578
01:53:27,482 --> 01:53:29,120
-Sorry, I am late.
-No, no! Sit down.

1579
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:32,015
I always arrive early.

1580
01:53:33,231 --> 01:53:34,466
It was the Annual Day at school.

1581
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:35,775
How was it?

1582
01:53:36,767 --> 01:53:37,932
Shall we get to the point?

1583
01:53:41,805 --> 01:53:42,479
Megha.

1584
01:53:43,545 --> 01:53:45,063
Let's forget what happened.

1585
01:53:46,225 --> 01:53:47,436
Let's make a new start.

1586
01:53:49,417 --> 01:53:51,354
I apologize for what my mom did.

1587
01:53:52,475 --> 01:53:55,870
But I cannot divorce you.

1588
01:53:58,517 --> 01:54:00,157
-Whatever wrong happened...
-Paras!

1589
01:54:02,975 --> 01:54:04,484
I didn't do wrong.

1590
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:08,398
What happened was not wrong.

1591
01:54:10,903 --> 01:54:11,846
Where it happened..

1592
01:54:14,913 --> 01:54:16,338
I apologize.

1593
01:54:19,892 --> 01:54:22,308
Women desire more
than just children.

1594
01:54:35,488 --> 01:54:36,082
So,

1595
01:54:38,475 --> 01:54:40,236
what have you decided?

1596
01:54:42,888 --> 01:54:44,030
What do you want to do?

1597
01:54:46,267 --> 01:54:47,893
I don't know what I want to do.

1598
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:55,836
But for now,

1599
01:54:59,017 --> 01:55:00,384
I want some ice cream.
