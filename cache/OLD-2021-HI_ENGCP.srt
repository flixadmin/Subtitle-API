00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,890
You work in a goddamn museum!

165
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,772
[Maddox] I think they stopped.

166
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,484
Why don't you play?

167
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,608

[slow suspenseful music playing]

170
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,192
[waiter] Good morning.
What would you like for breakfast?

171
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,796
[Chrystal] I'll have
the Calcium Bomb juice drink.

172
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,530
I have a calcium deficiency.

173
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,533
So, is it really calcium-rich
or just a catchy name?

174
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,619
[chuckles] It has all
calcium-rich vegetables, ma'am.

175
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,122
Sit up, Kara, honey.

176
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,623
- Okay.
- All right?

177
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,351
You don't want to be hunched
when you grow up.

178
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,710
It's very unattractive.

179
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,837
Boys will get turned off.

180
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,215
Give me the Calcium Bomb juice.

181
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,886
And maybe you could
recommend one of these.

182
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,642
This one.

183
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,353
[waiter] I recommend the granola parfait.

184
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,023
Um, it's a good choice.

185
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,274
Okay.

186
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,610
So, how is the Capa family?
Any plans today?

187
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,489
Well, one of our kids wants to do Jet Ski,

188
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,825
- and the other one…
- Mm-hmm.

189
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,452
…wants to do anything but that.

190
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,535
[chuckles]

191
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,373
Well, there's, um, there's a private beach

192
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,542
on the nature preserve side of the island.

193
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,793
It's impossible to find.

194
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,004
It's surrounded by stunning rocks,

195
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,922
- very unusual minerals.
- Oh.

196
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,467
Oh, it's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, so…

197
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,218
A natural anomaly.

198
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,306
I only recommend it to certain guests.

199
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,143
But I liked you guys immediately.
All right? You're a nice family.

200
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,687
So I-I could arrange
a van to take you, if…

201
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,564
Hmm. Yeah.

202
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,650
Sounds like a great memory for us.

203
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,862
It's our little secret.
I'll make all the arrangements.

204
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,367
- [Guy] Thank you.
- [Maddox] Thanks.

205
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,497
Okay, so I think we should get
the Calloway Kale-away for Trent.

206
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,084
Idlib, what did I tell you
about being in here when you shouldn't?

207
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,754
You can't… You know,
I told you so many times.

208
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,255
You know, we have certain…

I'm a doctor.

My wife has epilepsy.
I'm a nurse. My name is Jarin.

212
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,567
Right, she's having a grand mal seizure.
Keep things away from her, please.

Doll?

216
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,094
All right, Jack,
I think if you just leave her

217
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,929
lying here for a while,
put something under her head,

218
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,788
- I think she'll be fine.
- Thank you, Doctor.

219
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,331
It's Jarin, by the way.

220
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,629
For my next act,
I'll spin my head around 360.

I'm sorry I ruined everyone's breakfast.

- [Trent] Begin an activity.

324
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,030
- Dad, I have to!
- [Prisca] Yes. Okay.

325
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,334
[Trent] You and Mom on one side.

326
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,492
- [Guy] No, leave him.
- [Prisca] Sounds like fun. Come on.

327
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,410
- Because it's a private…
- Stop! I need to say hi.

328
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,354
He's on vacation. He's on vacation.
What's his surname? Sedan?

329
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,148
[whooping, laughing]

330
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,735
Oh! Oh.

331
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,278
Whoa. [grunts]

332
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,365
Whoa. All right. Here's a big one. Aah!

333
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,117
[Kara] Help me with this.

334
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,162
We should have a housewarming party.

335
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,791
Isn't our house so beautiful?

336
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,169
[water trickling]

337
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,338
[waves sloshing]

338
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,265
- Boo!
- Aah! You!

339
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,142
- Come. Come back here!
- No!

340
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,643
[Maddox and Kara laughing]

341
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,353
[Kara] Not gonna get me!

342
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,439
[Maddox] Kara,
I'm gonna get you right now.

343
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,815
Come on.

344
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,067
- Not gonna get me!
- No, I am.

345
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,111
Come on, Kara.

346
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,698
Whoa! Oh, my God.

347
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,074
Caught you.

348
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,329
[Trent] Ha. Never gonna catch me.

349
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,500
[Kara] Honey, I'm home.

350
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,337
[Trent] I told you,
I don't want to live like this.

351
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,422
I'm gonna live in a condominium.

352
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,507
I'm going for a drive to calm down.

353
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,053
I'm really, really hungry.

354
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,680
Me, too. My stomach's growling.

355
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,265
[Maddox] Me, too.

356
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,823
[Maddox] Wow.

357
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,576
Who would leave this?

358
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,412
Hey, Mom!

359
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,456
From the hotel!

360
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,583
They're so rusted.

361
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,251
[Prisca] Put that down!

362
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,796
You can get infected
or you'll cut yourself.

363
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,964
Come away.

364
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,926
- [Trent] Next activity. Hide-and-seek.
- [Guy] What's happening?

365
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,762
[Prisca] I don't know. They found
stuff from the hotel in the sand.

366
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,975
[Maddox] Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

367
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,395
- No fish.
- Ready or not, here we come!

368
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,397
[laughing]

369
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,024
[chuckling]

370
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,487
[eerie music playing]

371
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,080
Mom!

372
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,541
Mom! Mom!

373
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,795
Mom! Mom! Mom!

374
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,299
What is it? What is it?

375
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,176
- [Guy] Trent?
- Someone over there.

376
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,428
[Prisca] Over where?

377
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,566
[Charles] Come on,
give me a hand. Get the legs.

378
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,285
[Prisca] Make your list.

379
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,786
- Make your list.
- Okay.

380
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,580
- Red and orange.
- Red, orange.

381
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,165
Come away from here, babies.

382
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,917
Let the doctor try
and help this lady, yeah?

383
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,586
- [Trent] Green.
- [Prisca] Green.

384
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,881
- Tan.
- Tan.

385
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,382
- Purple.
- Purple.

386
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,884
- What happened?
- It's okay.

387
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,719
- [Trent] Blue.
- [Prisca] Blue is good.

388
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:43,844
- In there.
- [Trent] Green.

389
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,472
- [Prisca] Green, yes.
- [Trent] Yellow.

390
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,837
[Prisca] Yellow. I love yellow.

391
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,091
[Guy] Call the police, right?

392
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,143
[Charles] I'll get my mobile.

393
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,479
Oh, damn.

394
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,440
[suspenseful music playing]

395
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,918
[Maddox] What happened to her, Mom?

396
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,294
I don't know.

397
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,589
- [Maddox] I'm still hungry.
- [Kara] Me, too.

398
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,134
[Guy] Was she with you?

399
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:27,263
[Mid-Sized Sedan] I was waiting for her.
She swam out by herself.

400
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,308
Yo, I don't know what the hell happened.

401
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,435
I ain't saying nothing else.

402
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,763
[Charles] Did you strike him?

403
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,523
I don't need to know the context of…

404
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,191
[Guy] What? No. Of course not.

405
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,818
So why's your nose bleeding?

406
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,530
I told y'all, I ain't got
nothing to say to you.

407
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,452
My chest feels funny.

408
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,539
- Well, you know…
- [sighs]

409
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,500
…we should've gotten a yacht,
like I suggested, Agnes.

410
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,377
You shouldn't have fought me on that.

411
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,506
You see? Now we're mixed up
in some island issue.

412
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,008
I mean, I… [scoffs]

413
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,346
[Agnes wheezes softly]

414
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,974
[Trent] Mom, my swimsuit is hurting.

415
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,392
I have to take it off.

416
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,394
Well, just loosen your…

417
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,526
[Guy] We're from Philadelphia.

418
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,362
I'm on a break here with
my wife and kids. That's them.

419
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,740
That… Well, yeah, over there.

420
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,287
And for the record, I know
most people who die on vacation

421
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:36,207
die from sun exposure, overexertion,

422
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,626
overindulgence of food or alcohol

423
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,838
or-or a mixture of all
of the above 99.4% of the time.

424
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,840
- How you know all this?
- I'm an actuary.

425
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:47,260
I calculate people's insurance rates
based on their risk profile.

426
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,181
I ain't do nothing, man.

427
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,643
She was into me.

428
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,273
Somebody will figure this out.

429
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,568
We'll just have to wait
for them to get here.

430
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,196
[Charles] No reception at all.

431
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,491
I guess our beach day's over.

432
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,910
You got to keep an eye
on him and the body.

433
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,454
[Patricia laughs, whoops]

434
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,415
Oh, my goodness.

435
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,607
[Charles] Did you just get
dropped off by the resort?

436
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:28,134
Yeah. We were supposed to come earlier,
but we rested in the room first.

437
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:31,096
Great. We have to get the resort people
before they leave.

438
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,865
I think we will all
have to leave this beach.

439
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,893
Wait. Why? They left already.
What happened?

440
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,615
We really don't know what happened.

441
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,076
Well, I think this man had
something to do with it.

442
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,371
Man, if I was involved,
why would I be standing around, bro?

443
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:57,706
- Damn.
- His nose is bleeding.

444
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,433
Got that when she
was trying to defend herself.

445
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,459
I don't like this dynamic at all.

446
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,229
Yo, my nose has been bleeding
for hours, man.

447
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,397
I don't know why it's doing that.

448
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,756
Charles, something's wrong
with your mother.

449
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,258
She's asking for you, honey.

450
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,970
Well, we're all in this now.

451
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,514
We are responsible for that woman.

452
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,683
And I've got nothing against this man.

453
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,643
I'm just doing what needs to be done.

454
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,479
[Jarin] No cell phone reception
on this beach.

455
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,189
You stay here.

456
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,918
I'll go to the clearing in the jungle
where they dropped us and try to call.

457
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,111
They obviously have a signal out here.

458
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,530
- How else do people call to go back?
- Right.

459
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,251
[groaning, gasping]

460
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,549
[Patricia] Oh, my God.

461
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,635
You stumbled back out.
You were holding your head.

462
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,637
You looked like you were in pain, babe.

463
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,057
- [Guy] You blacked out.
- [scoffs]

464
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,809
I felt this pressure in my head.

465
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:08,568
I'm fine, Charles.
I-I think it's the shock.

466
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:09,944
[Gustav barking]

467
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,113
Try to help Gustav, or he'll be sick.

468
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:13,437
Yeah, of course it's the shock.

469
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,509
Listen, I'm gonna get a van
to take us back to the resort,

470
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,613
but first, I've got to deal
with all this, all right?

471
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:19,537
[Agnes] Are you okay?

472
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,705
Yeah.

473
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,874
[Agnes] I know you've been stressed.

474
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,460
Don't let this upset you.

475
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,463
Help these people through this, Charles.

476
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,215
[Gustav barking]

477
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,633
So, what did you hear?

478
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,012
Help these people through
this, Charles. [gasps]

479
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,389
[Prisca] Excuse me.

480
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,686
Excuse me. I saw you were
talking to my husband.

481
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,480
I know you're dealing with a
lot with that woman right now,

482
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,482
but something is wrong with my son.

483
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,401
- Some kind of reaction.
- Is… is it severe?

484
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,652
I don't have time for this.

485
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,946
- What kind of doctor are you?
- [Gustav barks]

486
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,407
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon
and chief medical officer.

487
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,117
[Prisca] You don't know me.

488
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,578
- I curate exhibits for museums.
- [whimpers, barks]

489
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,914
I'm telling you this
because I want you to trust me

490
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,916
and not think I'm being
hysterical when I say

491
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,544
there's something very wrong
with my child.

492
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,921
He seems fine to me.
He's playing with my daughter.

493
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,882
[Trent older voice]
You look different, too.

494
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,259
[Maddox older voice] How?

495
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:18,221
[Trent] Uh, I don't know.
You just look different.

496
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,433
[Kara older voice] Hold my hand.

497
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,726
[Trent] Okay.

498
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,980
Willow.

499
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,108
Japanese maple. Evergreen.

500
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,152
[Maddox] If you get scared,
just tell me, okay?

501
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,196
What do you keep looking at?

502
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,741
- [Trent] There.
- [Maddox] Where?

503
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,911
[Trent] Way, way up there
on the side of the hillside.

504
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,455
[Maddox] What do you see?

505
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,415
[Trent] I thought I saw something shiny.

506
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,168
[Maddox] Here comes Mom.

507
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,466
[Chrystal] Charles, she stopped breathing!

508
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,384
She stopped breathing!

509
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,014
I didn't do anything, Charles.

510
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,099
You guys just… you just walked away,

511
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,518
and she just stopped breathing
all of a sudden.

512
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,145
She… I mean, she was peaceful.

513
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,022
Can you step back, please?

514
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,399
[Jarin] We'll take the kids
away from here.

515
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,485
[Chrystal] Is this happening?

516
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,695
[Gustav barking]

517
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,618
[Charles sobs]

518
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,667
- She couldn't take the shock.
- [Chrystal crying]

519
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:32,045
She-she saw a murdered woman,
and her heart couldn't take it.

520
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,131
[Trent] What are your names
and occupations?

521
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,759
I'm Jarin. I'm a nurse.

522
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,220
I'm Patricia. I'm a psychologist.

523
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,848
[Maddox] He remembers everyone's names
and things about them.

524
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,351
Everything's gonna be okay.

525
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,353
What's your name?

526
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,898
I'm Trent. This is my sister Maddox.

527
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,566
How old are you guys?

528
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,236
- I'll guess. I'm good at this.
- [chuckles]

529
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,154
You're 11, right, Trent?

530
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,573
[chuckling] I'm six.

531
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,158
No.

532
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,577
Really, are you ten, 11?

533
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,830
[Maddox] He's not lying. He's six.

534
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,125
[Trent] I'm specifically
six and a quarter.

535
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:11,918
She's 11.

536
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:16,214
They're feeling unsafe.
There is a lot going on here.

537
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,426
They're playing with us. Let's leave it.

538
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,137
Okay, what's your best friend's name?

539
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,014
[Trent] Maddox.

540
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,391
How sweet.

541
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,476
[Prisca] Have you seen my children?

542
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,811
[chuckles]

543
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,564
Is-is everyone trying
to play a joke on us?

544
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,983
- What?
- Aren't these your children?

545
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,526
[Trent] I'm right here, Mom.

546
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,447
[Maddox] Mom?

547
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,408
Mom.

548
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,793
Why are you looking at me like that?

549
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,638
Prisca.

550
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:07,891
I think we should leave.

551
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,810
Get the kids back to the resort.

552
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:11,935
Guy.

553
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,915
- Maddox?
- Yeah. Dad, it's me.

554
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,087
What's going on?

555
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,892
You see? You see?

556
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,773
[panting]

557
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,704
[groaning]

558
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,914
[trembling breaths]

559
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,083
[panting]

560
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,712
[whimpers]

561
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,969
[grunts, groans]

562
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,763
[panting]

563
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,645
[grunts]

564
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:39,899
[grunts]

565
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,237
Damn.

566
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,657
- How'd we get here?
- [Patricia] Take it easy.

567
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:52,328
[Charles] Intense cranial pressure.
It's like being deep underwater.

568
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:57,042
[Patricia] Can you get up?
Whoa, whoa, take it easy.

569
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:02,464
- [Chrystal] Charles? You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm all right.

570
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:03,673
I'm fine. I'm all good.

571
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,884
We're leaving right now,
and we're taking our kids.

572
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,012
For some reason, people are
blacking out going this way.

573
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,597
Three people have blacked out now.

574
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,557
- That's ridiculous. Come, move.
- No, no, no.

575
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,201
I saw it, Prisca. I saw Jarin black out.

576
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:17,812
What I know is that we have to
get these kids to a hospital.

577
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:18,937
Now.

578
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,816
Look, let's stop talking about it.

579
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,401
The kids are scared.

580
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:27,155
I can stay here with them,
but everyone else should try

581
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,866
and find a different pathway
off this beach.

582
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:33,953
[Jarin] Break off into groups of two
in case people black out.

583
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,874
Chrystal, go with me.

584
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,251
[suspenseful music playing]

585
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,555
[Chrystal gasps]

586
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:54,057
[Charles groans]

587
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,226
[Charles] Whoa.

588
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,894
Whatever you do, just stay close.

589
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,230
I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.

590
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,940
[Charles] Don't get up too quickly.

591
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,317
Kids, let Mom and Dad talk for a second.

592
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,528
[Maddox] No. Mom, we're scared.

593
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,656
Please, stay right here.

594
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:11,658
Okay?

595
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,619
If I cry, please don't let them see.

596
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:15,954
I won't.

597
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,122
Your hands are shaking.

598
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,081
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

599
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,291
- Yeah, they are.
- Yeah. You okay?

600
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,295
We're on a beach
with two unrelated dead bodies.

601
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,214
That is just statistically impossible.

602
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:29,759
All three kids are reacting to something.
Only the kids.

603
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,636
I mean, look at the doctor's daughter.

604
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:36,182
The kids are reacting
to something they ate.

605
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,351
Or they caught something.

606
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:41,187
We're on a remote, undeveloped island,

607
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,065
but we have a doctor here, so…

608
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,526
let's get the doc to look at the kids.

609
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:56,828
I still can't get any reception.

610
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,789
Doctor, before we do anything else,

611
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,000
can you take a look
at our children, please?

612
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,919
[Mid-Sized Sedan yells in pain]

613
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,087
He's got a knife!

614
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,630
[groaning]

615
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,674
There's a damn hole in my cheek.

616
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,676
[Patricia] Oh, my God. Are you okay?

617
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,347
- Put that down right now, Doctor.
- Watch out, Jarin.

618
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,310
Listen, I don't know why I did that.
I thought he was gonna hurt me. Sorry.

619
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,687
Sorry.

620
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,332
- What's he talking about, "sorry"?
- Okay.

621
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,858
- Let me see that laceration.
- Man, that's assault, man!

622
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,401
[Jarin] Calm down.

623
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,820
What's your name?

624
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,239
Mid-Sized Sedan.

625
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,912
I must be in shock. I'm numb.
I'm not feeling the pain no more.

626
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:41,373
Please, let me see.

627
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,424
No, this is not making any sense, Prisca.

628
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:53,789
[Mid-Sized Sedan] I need to get
my ass to a hospital now.

629
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,638
What's with all y'all faces?

630
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,558
It's hard to explain.

631
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,399
This is messed-up, man. Where'd it go?

632
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,609
This is some kind of parlor trick.

633
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,778
[Mid-Sized Sedan]
Yo, I know I tried to dip,

634
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,072
but I am freaked, man.

635
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,492
I just want to go back to my hotel room.

636
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,787
This was supposed to be a Zen trip, man.

637
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,165
She and I only started talking
because she was sick and so am I.

638
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,042
She had just been diagnosed with MS,

639
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,879
so we started rapping about that.
I didn't do nothing to that girl, man.

640
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,425
She was like Michael Phelps
swimming out there,

641
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,884
backstroking and whatnot.

642
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,511
She swam way the hell out.

643
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:37,804
What did you say?

644
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:40,390
No, I-I-I don't know, man.
Maybe it was butterfly stroke.

645
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:41,742
I don't watch the Summer Olympics.

646
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,411
You came vacationing here
because you were sick,

647
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:44,477
- and so did she?
- Yes.

648
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:46,122
I thought that was a cool coincidence.

649
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,898
Maybe this is some kind
of group psychosis.

650
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:49,982
I've studied this.

651
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,652
We're all emotionally shaky
from our lives.

652
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:55,780
We don't believe we can leave this beach.

653
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:04,330
[Kara] Mom, is there any more food?
I'm still hungry.

654
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:05,850
[Charles] Well, she's definitely aged.

655
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,643
[Chrystal] Honey, how can you
still be hungry? We just…

656
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,545
[Charles] I'd put her biological age
somewhere between 12 and 13,

657
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:13,006
and she turned six two weeks ago Tuesday.

658
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:14,591
What?

659
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,093
We're older?

660
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,721
Am I okay?

661
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,725
I don't know what's happening
to the three of you, sweetheart.

662
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,311
For now, I have
another swimsuit in my bag,

663
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:28,688
and maybe you should change into that.

664
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,566
[Charles] Uh, it might be a virus, maybe.

665
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,318
Could be mosquitoes where…

666
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,362
The way they behave
on this part of the island.

667
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:38,114
Something's happening to her
that's triggering her hormones.

668
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,119
- [Jarin] The dog has died!
- [Prisca] Oh, my God.

669
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,285
- [Maddox] Oh, my God.
- [Chrystal gasps]

670
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,661
He was only just alive.

671
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:46,831
- [Chrystal] Kara, hold on to me, baby.
- What's happening?

672
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,626
[Jarin] Who thinks they can swim

673
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:53,213
a hundred lengths of a pool
against currents

674
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,383
and then turn and swim an unknown amount

675
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,677
along the coast
till we find another shore?

676
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:03,556
That's what I'm guessing the distance is
to swim out and get around this cove.

677
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,905
It's too far. It's not safe.

678
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:21,491
My name is Brendon.

679
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,577
I went to private school,
my mom is an attorney,

680
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,079
and my dad is a dentist.

681
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,874
- Yo, I just wanted somebody to know that.
- [Maddox] Okay.

682
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,920
[Mid-Sized Sedan]
I have a problem with my blood.

683
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,420
A rare issue with its clotting.

684
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:36,214
I came to this island to see the ocean

685
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:39,551
and remember I'm connected
to something bigger.

686
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,137
That's beautiful, Brendon.

687
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,766
I don't feel the same way
I felt yesterday or this morning,

688
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,352
and I don't think
my parents would understand.

689
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,439
My thoughts have more colors in them now.

690
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,943
Yesterday, I had a few colors
and they were really strong,

691
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,487
and now I have more and they're quieter.

692
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,407
- [Patricia] Okay!
- [clapping]

693
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,617
Everyone, gather!

694
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,411
Come on, come on, come on.

695
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,122
Everyone needs to have a voice here.

696
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,791
[Guy] Are you sure we have time for this?

697
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,961
We will make destructive decisions
if we don't feel safe with each other.

698
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,588
I know we don't have time, but…

699
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:18,214
why don't we start with you two?

700
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,425
Why are you here?

701
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:25,305
We've been having a tough time…

702
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,598
Chrystal.

703
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,516
W-We've been going through something.

704
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,352
He's under a lot of stress as a doctor.

705
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,145
- He needed some time away.
- Everyone does.

706
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,147
- I'm not unusual in that.
- Charles, it's okay.

707
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:35,690
I'm not gonna say anything else.

708
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:36,816
Good!

709
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,985
It's nice to hear from you both.

710
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:40,737
How about you guys?

711
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:44,324
[Prisca sighs]

712
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:46,451
Prisca?

713
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:47,911
It's nothing.

714
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:50,580
We just have to make a decision.

715
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,041
The kids are reacting to something.

716
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,627
It's a virus. It's-it's probably a virus.

717
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,713
I just need to catch my breath.

718
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,174
I just started feeling weird a minute ago.

719
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:02,592
[Maddox] Are you okay, Mom?

720
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:04,177
- [Trent] Mom?
- [Jarin] What's wrong?

721
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:05,942
- [Prisca] Um…
- [Maddox] Are you okay, Mom?

722
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:07,472
[Prisca] I don't think it's the…

723
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:09,391
- [Guy] She has a tumor.
- [Maddox] What?

724
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,243
[Guy] But it's benign.
They said it's benign.

725
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,269
- Oh, my God.
- [Maddox] Mom…

726
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:17,399
- [Patricia] Wow. Um…
- Is it… Where?

727
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:18,566
[Maddox] Mom?

728
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:19,692
It's okay.

729
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,819
[Jarin] Can I…

730
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,196
It's the size of a golf ball.

731
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,865
[Prisca] No, it's supposed
to be three centimeters.

732
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,742
[Charles] All right. Let-let me see.

733
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,285
- Whoa, whoa.
- [Maddox] Mom!

734
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,971
- [Guy] Prisca.
- [Patricia] She's gonna faint.

735
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:32,247
Mom. Mom!

736
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,582
Wake up, Pris. Don't do this.

737
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,420
It's there.

738
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,257
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.

739
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:43,425
Jesus.

740
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,593
- It's grown.
- What?

741
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,264
- What's happening to Mom? Dad.
- Trent, it's okay. It's okay.

742
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,367
- What's happening to Mom?
- Trent, why don't you two guys

743
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,851
go play somewhere else on the beach?

744
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:56,104
Okay? Mom's just a little bit tired.
Would you do that for me, tiger?

745
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,790
[Patricia] The first adult's
being affected.

746
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,232
[Guy] Okay, what if we cut it out?

747
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,835
- [Maddox] Dad!
- [Charles] Not possible.

748
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:02,235
[Jarin] Actually, it is.

749
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,737
- But it's Guy's call.
- No!

750
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:04,988
No, no, no. No.

751
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,949
I don't want to make this decision.
No. No, I…

752
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,493
I don't know what to do.

753
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,792
- Do we have alcohol?
- [Chrystal] Yes.

754
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,461
Some bottles from the minibar.

755
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,689
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand that, right?

756
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,048
Yes.

757
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:25,925
Okay. Well, I mean, does anyone
have a needle and thread?

758
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,427
We're gonna have to sew this up.

759
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,012
[Patricia] Yeah. Uh…

760
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:32,349
Here. Here. Is this the right decision?
Maybe we should all talk about this.

761
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:35,643
I can't think.
This tumor is going to kill her.

762
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:44,527
Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?

763
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:45,612
Oh, no.

764
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:47,906
What is he saying?

765
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:49,216
Wh-What was the name of that film?

766
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,117
- Charles, breathe.
- [Jarin] Are you okay?

767
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,243
Yes.

768
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,496
Will you just let me do my job, please?

769
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:55,622
Is he okay?

770
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:19,020
[Jarin] Cut her again.

771
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:21,207
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.

772
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,024
[Mid-Sized Sedan]
Guy, I can help, brother.

773
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:24,734
No. No, I'll take care of her.

774
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,569
Does anyone know the name of that film?

775
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:30,615
It was with Jack Nicholson…
and Marlon Brando.

776
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:32,492
Both!

777
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:33,868
[Jarin] Try again, Doctor.

778
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,246
Oblique incision on the side of the belly.

779
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,164
Four to six inches. You can do this.

780
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:43,128
Put your fingers inside the incision.

781
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,754
[Guy] Okay.

782
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,840
[Charles] Can you open it
a little wider, please?

783
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,509
It's closing around my fingers.

784
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:51,177
Keep pulling it apart.

785
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,303
That's it.

786
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,556
I'm lifting the tumor out.

787
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,766
[Charles] Wow!

788
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,494
[chuckling] It's the size of a cantaloupe.

789
00:41:58,518 --> 00:41:59,769
W-Wait.

790
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:01,980
It's attached to something.

791
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,065
Muscle tissue.

792
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,400
[Charles] Okay. You, um,

793
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,695
hold the incision open
a little wider, if you would.

794
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,239
[Guy] I'm so sorry, Pris.

795
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:13,575
[Charles] Just cutting
underneath the tumor.

796
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,078
Okay. Got it.

797
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,801
[Maddox] Mom. [whimpers]

798
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,387
Prisca?

799
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:36,806
Mom?

800
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:39,142
[crying]

801
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:54,949
It's okay.

802
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,243
I just fainted.

803
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,789
We took the tumor out.

804
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:02,957
It was going to kill you.

805
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:07,462
[Jarin] Your husband made a fast decision.

806
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:21,518
Guy, I feel better.

807
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:33,029
[eerie music playing]

808
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:43,123
Damn.

809
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,835
Come on, y'all, look at this!

810
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,338
Hurry!

811
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:54,384
Damn.

812
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,095
Come on, y'all.

813
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:07,981
Can we all agree I didn't do that?

814
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:10,108
What happened to her?

815
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:12,444
[Prisca] The body has decomposed.

816
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,779
- How quickly can that happen?
- [Charles] A long time.

817
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,281
Mom knows this stuff.

818
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:18,450
I'm not a forensic pathologist,

819
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:20,827
but from excavations for the museum,

820
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:24,372
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.

821
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,542
My best guess, an exposed body,

822
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:30,795
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.

823
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,757
And this happened in what, three hours?

824
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:35,175
I know.

825
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,470
And bones we found will disintegrate
in 30 years more.

826
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,805
[Mid-Sized Sedan] The hell, man?

827
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:42,891
On this beach, less than
20 hours after you die,

828
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,309
you just return to dust.

829
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:47,145
What exactly are we saying?

830
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,070
Something is going on
with time on this beach.

831
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:50,732
Time?

832
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:58,156
You have wrinkles.

833
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:03,203
[rustling]

834
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:11,961
[chewing, food crunching]

835
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,463
[Kara] I'm scared.

836
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:21,554
[Trent] It's best to focus
on specifics in the present

837
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,390
in unsettling situations.

838
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:24,641
[Kara] Mm-hmm.

839
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:27,102
[Trent] Like breathing. [breathes deeply]

840
00:45:27,185 --> 00:45:28,853
[Kara] What's happening to us?

841
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:31,481
Are we sick, too?

842
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:35,235
[Trent] No, I don't think so.
I think we're just growing.

843
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:39,698
[Prisca] Going by Trent and Maddox's ages
and the time we spent on this beach,

844
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:44,536
half an hour is equivalent
to something like one year of our lives.

845
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:48,707
This must be true for all of us.
We just don't see it on everyone.

846
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:50,375
You know, it's the first time

847
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,002
- they wished they were Black.
- Mm-hmm.

848
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,587
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.

849
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:58,383
They need to grow an enormous
amount of mass quickly.

850
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:02,595
We're staying roughly the same mass.
Our cells are just aging.

851
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:07,517
[Kara] I don't feel the same.
It's like my mind is changing, too.

852
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,895
I'm getting many thoughts
at the same time.

853
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:13,398
It's weird.

854
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:20,613
I'm not as scared about
what's happening to us.

855
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,867
[Prisca] What about our hair and nails?

856
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,327
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?

857
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,747
[Jarin] Maybe it has to do
with the fact that the cells

858
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,707
in hair and nails are dead

859
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:32,834
and they aren't reacting in the same way.

860
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,212
[Mid-Sized Sedan] On this beach,
60 minutes is two years.

861
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:40,050
We'll age almost 50 years in one day here.

862
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,218
Almost a lifetime.

863
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:46,181
[eerie music playing]

864
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:49,100
[Jarin] I think it could be the rock
that surrounds this beach.

865
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:52,812
If our cells are being affected,

866
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,857
speeding up in their processes,

867
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,902
then us trying to leave is like

868
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:03,031
swimming to the surface too fast
after being deep in the ocean.

869
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:05,575
Our bodies can't reacclimate.

870
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,536
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.

871
00:47:10,663 --> 00:47:11,915
Maybe…

872
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:16,378
we could slowly walk through the canyon.

873
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,672
Take a step, stand still.

874
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,467
Do it over eight to ten hours.

875
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,136
Let our bodies acclimate.

876
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:29,766
But according to Prisca's timeline,

877
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:32,331
who would be willing to give up
20 years of their life trying?

878
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,603
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.

879
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,939
Let's not shut down everyone's experience.

880
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,401
[Prisca] Wait. Where are the kids?

881
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:43,947
[Guy] Trent!

882
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:45,824
Kara!

883
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,452
Answer us now! We need you here!

884
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:50,912
There they are.

885
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:07,637
- [Kara] Want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

886
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:25,947
Hey.

887
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:27,824
Mom! Dad!

888
00:48:31,953 --> 00:48:33,997
[suspenseful music playing]

889
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:46,676
[Chrystal] Kara?

890
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,636
What did you do?

891
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:51,097
We were just playing. It's okay.

892
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:52,474
I just got a little fat.

893
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,767
Mom, you're better.

894
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,687
- Maddox?
- [Maddox scoffs]

895
00:48:57,812 --> 00:48:58,897
[Trent] Maddox.

896
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,315
It's okay, Trent.

897
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:03,902
Just let Mom and Dad figure this out.

898
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:08,156
[Prisca] My God, Guy.

899
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,326
It's okay, right, Mom?

900
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:17,123
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando
were in a movie together.

901
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,418
If she walked into the emergency room,

902
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:23,004
I'd say she's about five months pregnant.

903
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:24,798
- What?
- [laughing] What?

904
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:26,549
Just stay calm, Trent.

905
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,094
[Jarin] She'll only be pregnant
for about 20 minutes

906
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,762
from the time of conception.

907
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,367
Why do you keep looking at me
like you want to steal my wallet?

908
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,240
Do you want me to punch you in the face?

909
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:38,144
[Jarin] Calm down.
I have no idea what you're talking about.

910
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:42,440
[Charles] All right. Let's just
concentrate on the issue at hand.

911
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:44,567
Do you know about movies?

912
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,778
Dad, Mom tells you to sit down
when you get like this.

913
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:48,780
Okay, we need to get her help.

914
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:50,865
Okay? This cannot happen here.

915
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,325
- It's gotten bigger.
- [Jarin] Kara.

916
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,411
- It's Kara, right?
- [Chrystal] Yeah.

917
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,654
- Lay down on a blanket.
- [Patricia] It's gonna be okay.

918
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:58,516
There's a lot of people here
that can help you.

919
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,000
We're all like your family now.

920
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,544
[Chrystal] Oh, God. [whimpers]

921
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,838
[Guy] Our cells are aging very fast here.

922
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:07,191
Something to do with the rocks
around the beach, we think.

923
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:08,717
[Jarin] Just lay down on the sand.

924
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,682
[Guy] Whatever would have happened to us
is happening to us really fast.

925
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:12,846
[Trent] Okay.

926
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:14,889
[Guy] What you did is how babies are made.

927
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,784
[Trent] I know, but I thought
you had to do that

928
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,226
ten times or something.

929
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:19,769
Did I get that wrong?

930
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:22,439
[Guy] Look, it can happen after only once.

931
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:24,107
[Kara whimpering]

932
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,918
[Guy] We didn't get a chance
to talk about all this.

933
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:28,611
Are Trent and I having a baby?

934
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:29,988
[Trent] Did I get it wrong?

935
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,282
[Jarin] Only a couple
of minutes left if we're right.

936
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:34,242
- Is that the baby?
- [Jarin] You got it. Okay.

937
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,785
- Mom.
- [Chrystal] Charles!

938
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,705
[Charles] Kara? Hon…
I need to think about what to do.

939
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,832
- Mom, I think I…
- No. I need to help her.

940
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:43,376
- Mom! I'm scared!
- It's okay.

941
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:45,045
- Kara.
- Mom, it's coming.

942
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,756
[Jarin] Stay with me. Come on, baby.

943
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,924
- Can you hold her hand? Kara?
- [Trent] I've decided…

944
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:52,510
I'm gonna marry her, and we are
never gonna yell at each other,

945
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:54,012
and we are never getting divorced!

946
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:56,473
[Prisca] Trent, listen to me.
She's going to feel pain.

947
00:50:56,598 --> 00:51:00,143
Intense pain. Okay?
Like she never felt before.

948
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:01,853
But then it's going to pass.

949
00:51:01,936 --> 00:51:04,522
- Okay? It's going to pass.
- [Trent sobbing]

950
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,483
[Kara wailing]

951
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:08,860
- [Maddox] Chrystal.
- [Kara screams]

952
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,528
[Maddox] Chrystal!

953
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:13,698
Hey, you blacked out.

954
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:15,450
You can't go that way.

955
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:19,454
Come on. You're okay now. Come on.

956
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:21,498
- Get up.
- [baby crying]

957
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:24,542
Come here. Look.

958
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:27,671
[Chrystal whimpers, chuckles]

959
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,467
You're okay. Come on. Come on.

960
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:34,612
- Babies crying helps them breathe.
- [Maddox] It's here.

961
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,429
We looked that up, remember, Mom?

962
00:51:36,554 --> 00:51:37,972
[Trent chuckles]

963
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:41,351
- [crying stops]
- [gasping]

964
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:50,235
[Patricia] We put him
on the towel to clean him up.

965
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:52,987
He looked around and closed his eyes.

966
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:56,533
We had him on the towel for one minute.

967
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,077
[Chrystal] He died from lack of attention.

968
00:51:59,202 --> 00:52:02,622
[Mid-Sized Sedan] Things are moving
too fast here for a baby to survive.

969
00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:05,250
[Trent] No. No, you're lying.

970
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,085
You're lying! You're all lying!

971
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,920
- Shut up, Trent!
- You're lying!

972
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:11,339
- You're lying!
- Hey, hey, hey.

973
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:13,508
[Trent sobbing]

974
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:16,344
Maybe we should all talk
about what just happened.

975
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:21,016
[sobbing] Charles.

976
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:23,101
- Get us out of here!
- [Trent sobs] It's my baby.

977
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:26,855
Get us out of here now!
You were supposed to protect us!

978
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,065
You didn't protect us!

979
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,650
Kara's hurt!

980
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:35,447
I will make these decisions.
Just give me a second.

981
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,618
[Chrystal screams, sobs]

982
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,413
I used to see you in our neighborhood.
Who… who are you?

983
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:45,457
[knife thumping in sand]

984
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:47,083
I'm Jarin!

985
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:51,046
[crying] I-I don't know where you live.

986
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,508
Don't condescend to me.

987
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,722
Put some makeup on your face.

988
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:22,327
I'm sorry about the baby.

989
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:27,332
When I was your age,
I was in love with a man.

990
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:31,211
His name was Giuseppe.

991
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:35,423
He wasn't very handsome, and I left him.

992
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,260
We looked silly together, he and I.

993
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:43,014
[suspenseful music playing]

994
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,897
He had nothing to offer.

995
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,945
For some reason,
I think about him a lot here.

996
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:06,454
[sniffles, shudders]

997
00:54:07,997 --> 00:54:09,416
Leave me alone.

998
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:12,544
[screaming]

999
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,338
[screaming]

1000
00:54:15,463 --> 00:54:16,923
[grunting]

1001
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,304
Charles, stop!

1002
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,516
Stop! Stop!

1003
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:39,070
- He's gone.
- [Chrystal whimpers]

1004
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:40,822
[Chrystal] Oh, God.

1005
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:42,824
[Maddox sobbing]

1006
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:48,329
[Maddox and Chrystal sobbing]

1007
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:54,294
[Prisca] Bring your bag. Okay, come here.

1008
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:56,254
[sobbing continues]

1009
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:07,140
I'm just going to take it…

1010
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,356
- …now.
- It's okay.

1011
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:16,858
[Jarin] Everything will be okay.

1012
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:38,364
[Jarin] I'll find another beach,
and I'll try to find help.

1013
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:39,631
[Prisca crying]

1014
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:41,091
She needs her medicine.

1015
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,718
We're lucky she hasn't had a seizure yet.

1016
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:46,471
It must be the beach,
whatever it's doing to my body.

1017
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,891
Guy, I was on the swim team. I'll make it.

1018
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:53,353
I'll make it.

1019
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,403
Watch him.

1020
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:18,628
[wind howling]

1021
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:20,922
[Guy] Maybe I could climb that rock.

1022
00:56:22,298 --> 00:56:25,927
Maybe the effect, the blacking out,
doesn't happen if you go up.

1023
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,054
[Trent] You can't do it.

1024
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:30,932
- I'll do it.
- [Chrystal] Yeah, he's strong.

1025
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:32,225
- He can do it.
- Yeah.

1026
00:56:32,308 --> 00:56:35,103
[Prisca] No. I won't allow
my son to do that.

1027
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:36,563
[Patricia] It's too dangerous.

1028
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:38,273
[Guy] It's a last resort.

1029
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,316
[Charles] Mom…

1030
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,738
I do feel overwhelmed.

1031
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:49,409
I'm managing, but no one must know.

1032
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:51,411
[crunching]

1033
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:54,289
They'll try to stop me from working.

1034
00:56:55,498 --> 00:56:56,833
What should I do?

1035
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:00,086
Mom, tell me what to do.

1036
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,550
[Guy] Prisca, something's bothering me.

1037
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:09,387
Charles' family knew he had
some kind of mental disorder.

1038
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:11,431
Someone in each group was sick.

1039
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:14,267
How did you first hear about this place?

1040
00:57:14,392 --> 00:57:16,770
[Prisca] I don't know. I-I fell upon it.

1041
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:20,148
A random sweepstakes.
It came with a receipt at the pharmacy.

1042
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:23,401
I just followed it up online,
started getting emails.

1043
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:26,571
[Guy] They know our medical condition.
They chose us.

1044
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:30,700
[Prisca] They have our passports.
We could just disappear.

1045
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:33,328
They sent us a special car to the airport.

1046
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:34,746
A plane.

1047
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:37,916
They can make it look like
we never left our house.

1048
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:55,475
[Maddox] You were thinking
about leaving Dad,

1049
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:58,895
weren't you?

1050
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,528
Yes.

1051
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:10,407
I didn't want you two to suffer.

1052
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:16,121
Was there someone else?

1053
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,175
Did Dad know?

1054
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:41,980
Maddox.

1055
00:58:43,231 --> 00:58:44,607
Please.

1056
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:49,821
I found out about this tumor,
and I got scared.

1057
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,409
I stare at the remains of
nameless people in glass cases,

1058
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:57,537
and I kept thinking I'm going
to be one of those people.

1059
00:58:57,662 --> 00:58:59,372
Does that make any sense?

1060
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:04,336
I feel different than I felt yesterday.

1061
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:10,425
What I did feels like an illusion.
I swear.

1062
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,471
Do you hate me now?

1063
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:19,559
I just need some time, Mom.

1064
00:59:25,398 --> 00:59:27,108
We don't have that, baby.

1065
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,196
Look at you.

1066
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:35,909
You're an adult.

1067
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:41,247
Be strong for everyone.

1068
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:48,004
Connect to something bigger.

1069
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:29,879
[screaming]

1070
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:46,980
[whimpering, gasping]

1071
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,190
Here, here. Dad.

1072
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,484
Lay him down. Lay him down.

1073
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:57,657
[sobbing]

1074
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:14,507
[Patricia sobbing]

1075
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:16,676
He must have gone unconscious swimming.

1076
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:21,639
Brendon didn't do anything to that woman.

1077
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,434
We can't swim out, Prisca.

1078
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:35,904
We're not getting off this beach.

1079
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:40,992
We never had a prom.

1080
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,787
Or a graduation.

1081
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,414
There are so many memories we didn't have.

1082
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,501
It's not fair.

1083
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:55,799
He needs to rest now.

1084
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,557
[quiet rattling]

1085
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:10,105
[somber music playing]

1086
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:29,541
[quiet rattling]

1087
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:33,128
[Trent] Kara.

1088
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:36,965
Kara.

1089
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:40,301
Wait. What if you get dizzy up there?

1090
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,679
- You might black out.
- Trent, we are in charge now.

1091
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:46,641
My dad could hurt more people.
I have to get him off this beach.

1092
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:51,312
Kara! Don't climb that. Come down!
We'll find another way.

1093
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:54,357
- [Prisca] No, don't! Trent.
- [Maddox] Mom.

1094
01:02:54,482 --> 01:02:55,692
[Trent] I have to go with her!

1095
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:58,987
[Prisca] Kara, wait! Don't climb!
Let me get your mother!

1096
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,613
- [Trent] Kara!
- [Guy] It's not the way.

1097
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:03,700
She's panicked and desperate.
Talk to each other.

1098
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:06,911
[Trent] Kara, you and I
should just stay together.

1099
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:08,872
What if we spend this whole time trying

1100
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:10,957
to get out of here
and we still don't make it?

1101
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,709
[wind whistling]

1102
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:14,627
It'll be too short if we don't try.

1103
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:16,129
No, Kara, please!

1104
01:03:16,212 --> 01:03:18,131
Please just stay with me, please.

1105
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:22,218
[wind whistling]

1106
01:03:24,512 --> 01:03:25,972
[whimpers]

1107
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:29,601
[wind whistling]

1108
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:31,102
[grunting]

1109
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:36,274
If she makes it to the ledge,
she might have a chance.

1110
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:39,903
Go to the ledge and rest!

It's a mathematical certainty
there must be a way out.

[panting]

1115

[Trent] No. Why is she stopping?

1116
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:04,094
[Prisca] No.

1117
01:04:06,012 --> 01:04:08,014
No. Kara! Kara, wake up!

[somber music playing]

Let's all stay together.

1128
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:27,927
Nobody in this family goes alone anywhere.

1129
01:05:30,805 --> 01:05:34,851
[Patricia] I think I figured it out.
I'm using these to swim out.

1130
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:40,482
I have a sister.

1131
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:43,943
She's a therapist, too.
I need to get to my sister.

1132
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:46,988
We never talk.
We had a fight a long time ago.

1133
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:50,033
She's older, but now I am.

1134
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,870
The fighting seems ridiculous now.

1135
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:00,752
[Guy] Patricia.

1136
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:02,545

[Prisca] No. Wh-What's happening to her?

1139
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:08,677
[Trent] What's going on?

1140
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,428
She was fine. What-what's happening?

1141
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:12,639
[Maddox] She keeps stopping and starting.

[gasps]

1143
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:18,103
No. Dad, do something.

[Chrystal] Kara?

1149

Kara, where are you?

1150
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:24,044
Somebody's done this to us, Kara.

1151
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,507
I can't protect you anymore.

1152

Kara!

[waves crashing]

1154
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:45,273
[Trent] No, you don't know.
Jarin went in a different way.

1155
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:47,692
He went on, and I'm
a better swimmer than he is.

1156
01:07:47,817 --> 01:07:50,028
He's older than me. I-I can probably swim…

1157
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:52,197
[Guy] Trent, stop it. No. No.

1158
01:07:52,697 --> 01:07:54,866
No, you're not a better swimmer than him.

1159
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:56,451
[Trent] Yeah, but let me try.

1160
01:07:56,534 --> 01:07:58,161
[Guy] Listen. Listen.

- [Maddox] We're not gonna let you.

1164
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:16,888
Stop. It won't work.

1165
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:19,491
[Trent] I don't want to give up.
I really don't want to give up.

1166
01:08:19,557 --> 01:08:20,717
[Maddox] We're not giving up.

1167
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:22,018
[Trent] If you let me try…

1168

[chatter continues indistinctly
in distance]

I need my calcium.

[Prisca] Chrystal?

1171
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,835
Chrystal, stay with us.

1172
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:48,753
Don't look at me.

1173
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,733
Prisca, I have to tell you something.

1174
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,532
I saw your text messages one day.

1175

[suspenseful music playing]

1176

He says romantic things.

1177
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:32,756
I'm sorry.

1178
01:09:37,218 --> 01:09:39,721
I don't know who I would have
been okay with, but…

1179
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:41,556
with that guy?

1180
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:46,311
He's-he's a joke.

1181
01:09:46,394 --> 01:09:48,271
He's a pretend person.

1182
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:51,524
You deserve someone
so much better than that.

1183
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:56,738
I should have said something
when I saw it.

1184
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:59,074
I hide from everything.
I'm a fucking coward.

1185
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:02,160
This was no one's responsibility but me.

1186
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:05,830
Your anger should be aimed at me, just me.

1187
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,801
There's no place
I want to be but with you.

1188
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:21,596
Do you believe me?

1189
01:10:24,432 --> 01:10:25,850
I want to be here…

[Trent] Well, maybe we can use

01:11:01,302 --> 01:11:03,304
for the fire, keep Mom and Dad warm.

[Maddox] Whoever it was wanted
to be a science fiction writer.

It's full of story ideas.

Are there other places like this?

Who found this place?"

1210
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,233
Well, maybe we can make
a metal tube that we can get in

1211
01:11:57,359 --> 01:11:59,152
that stops the effects on our cells.

1212

Like at a dentist's office, you know,

1213
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:03,907
when they put a metal vest
on us before an X-ray.

1214
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:06,618
I mean, then we could just
walk out with it on us and…

1215
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:09,871
I mean, we'll get dizzy at first,
but then, slowly, we'll get used to it

1216
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:11,247
