Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?

485
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:18,435
You can mock our god without my help.

486
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,521
I don't mock the Drowned God.

487
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,732
I am the Drowned God.

488

From Oldtown to Qarth,
when men see my sails, they pray.

Now let another rule.

494
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,633
I heard you lost your mind

495
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,761
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

496
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:57,516
They tied you to the mast
to keep you from jumping overboard.

497
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,935
They did.

498
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:03,272
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

499
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:06,400
I needed silence.

500
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,195
What kind of an ironborn

501
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:13,198
loses his senses during a storm?

502

I am the storm, brother.

The first storm and the last.

not unless the Kingsmoot chooses you.

Your father does not get to choose.

Perhaps you'll win.

Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history
to rule the ironborn.

You interrupt nothing.

I will after you tell me.

528

It's about the Lord Commander.

The former Lord Commander.

Do you know of any magic

that could help him?

534
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,127
Bring him back?

If you want to help him, leave him be.
