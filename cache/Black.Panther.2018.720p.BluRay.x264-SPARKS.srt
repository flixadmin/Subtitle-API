1
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,412
Baba?

2
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:07,700
Yes, my son.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,555
Tell me a story.

4
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:11,727
Which one?

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,690
The story of home.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,498
Millions of years ago,

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,327
a meteorite made of vibranium,

8
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:23,304
the strongest substance
in the universe,

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,543
struck the continent of Africa,

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,781
affecting the plant life around it.

11
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,358
And when the time of man came...

12
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,501
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,123
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other,

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,355
until a warrior shaman...

15
00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:47,419
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast,

16
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:50,627
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb,

17
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:54,207
a plant that granted him
superhuman strength,

18
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:56,669
speed and instincts.

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,594
The warrior became king,

20
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:01,046
and the first Black Panther.

21
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:03,505
The protector of Wakanda.

22
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,022
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule,

23
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,341
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,522
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology,

25
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:18,735
more advanced than any other nation.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,573
But as Wakanda thrived,

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,827
the world around it descended
further into chaos.

28
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,544
To keep vibranium safe,

29
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,754
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight,

30
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,505
keeping the truth of their power,

31
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:37,498
from the outside world.

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,789
And we still hide, Baba?

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,653
Yes.

34
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:44,463
Why?

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,106
Lucky shot!
That ain't lucky!

36
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,615
Whatever!
Get outta here!

37
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,744
Check up.

38
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,767
Pick your man up! He open.

39
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:04,082
Where you at?

40
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:05,426
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

41
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,496
Pass! Pass!

42
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,784
Got you, E.
E, hurry up!

43
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,152
Watch me get this.

44
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,325
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

45
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,353
Come on.

46
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,593
What you got?

47
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,677
You ain't got nothing.

48
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,716
Hey look, if we get in and
out quick won't be no worries.

49
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,007
You in the van,
come in through from the west.

50
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,261
Come around the corner.

51
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,513
Land right here.

52
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,366
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.

53
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:28,518
We're leaving this car behind, ok?
We come this...

54
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,152
Hide the straps.

55
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,099
Yo, is it the Feds?

56
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,051
No.

57
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:03,054
It's these two
Grace Jones looking chicks.

58
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:05,092
They're holding spears.

59
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,602
Open it.

60
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,121
You serious?

61
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,753
They won't knock again.

62
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,673
Who are you?

63
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:32,206
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

64
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:36,063
Prove to me you are one of us.

65
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:45,006
My King.

66
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,134
Leave us.

67
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,202
This is James.

68
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,605
I trust him with my life. He stays...

69
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,908
with your permission King T'Chaka.

70
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,314
As you wish.

71
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,602
At ease.

72
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,589
Come, baby brother.

73
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:12,681
Let me see how you are holding up.

74
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,284
You look strong.

75
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,299
Glory to Bast, I am in good health.

76
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:26,621
How is home?

77
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,496
Not so good.

78
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:31,936
Baby brother.

79
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,183
There has been an attack.

80
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,636
This man,

81
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,204
Ulysses Klaue...

82
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,207
stole a quarter ton
of vibranium from us,

83
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,353
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

84
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,800
Many lives were lost.

85
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:51,757
He knew where we hid the vibranium,

86
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,433
and how to strike.

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,454
He had someone on the inside.

88
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,732
Why are you here?

89
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,690
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes,

90
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,424
and tell me why you betrayed Wakanda.

91
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,526
I did no such thing.

92
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:12,296
Tell him who you are.

93
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,726
Zuri, son of Badu.

94
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,663
What?

95
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,374
James.

96
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:24,068
James, you lied to me?

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,890
Leave him.

98
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,089
You were Wakandan this whole time?

99
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:28,371
You betrayed Wakanda!
How could you lie to me like...

100
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,488
Stand down!

101
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,032
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

102
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,123
Prince N'Jobu,

103
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,458
you will return home at once,

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,386
where you will face the Council,

105
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,121
and inform them of your crimes.

106
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,430
Check up!

107
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,637
Guard your man, guard your man!

108
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:08,907
Yo.

109
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,667
<i>The tiny nation of Wakanda,</i>

110
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,536
<i>is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.</i>

111
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,290
<i>The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead,</i>

112
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,244
<i>after a terrorist attack at the
United Nations a week ago.</i>

113
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,860
<i>The suspect
has since been apprehended.</i>

114
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:15,119
<i>Though it remains one
of the poorest countries in the world,</i>

115
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:19,093
<i>fortified by mountain ranges
and an impenetrable rainforest.</i>

116
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:23,756
<i>Wakanda does not engage
in international trade or accept aid.</i>

117
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:26,504
<i>The succession of the throne
is expected to fall to the oldest</i>

118
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,967
<i>of the king's two children
Prince T'Challa.</i>

119
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:31,767
My Prince,

120
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,025
coming up on them now.

121
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,613
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

122
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,936
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

123
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:15,196
Just don't freeze when you see her.

124
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:17,085
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,697
I never freeze.

126
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,627
Mifaru, what's going on?

127
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,307
It's the car. It lost power.

128
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,093
It won't start.

129
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,175
The car no start.

130
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,146
What happened?

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,385
The engine failed.

132
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,086
Ours, too.

133
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,623
What is it, Captain?

134
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,229
Defense positions.

135
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:06,618
Defense positions.

136
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,281
Are we under attack?

137
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,513
Defense positions.

138
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:11,366
Nokduc!

139
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:12,902
Get around to the side.

140
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,261
Defense positions.

141
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,632
Hey. Defense positions!

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,681
No games.

143
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,204
What do you see?

144
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,943
Come in. Come in.

145
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,257
Over there! Look back!

146
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,099
Watch out!

147
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,324
T'Challa, no!

148
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,362
This one's just a boy.

149
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,456
He got kidnapped as well.

150
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,458
Nakia

151
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,606
I...

152
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,639
I wanted.
Hey!

153
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,900
I have her!

154
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,552
Don't move! I will shoot!

155
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,391
I will shoot her right now.

156
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,234
You froze.

157
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,048
Why are you here?

158
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,798
You've ruined my mission.

159
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:08,400
My father is dead, Nakia.

160
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,020
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

161
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,584
And I wish for you to be there.

162
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,381
Carry yourselves home now.

163
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:25,076
Thank you.

164
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:27,226
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

165
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,689
Thank you.
Thank you.

166
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,395
You will speak nothing of this day.

167
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,562
Yes.

168
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,756
Thank you.

169
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,730
Thank you.

170
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,566
Sister Nakia.

171
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,182
My Prince.

172
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,541
We are home.

173
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,855
This never gets old.

174
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,046
Queen Mother.

175
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,958
Princess.

176
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,048
My comfort for your loss.

177
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,385
Thank you, Nakia.

178
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:07,192
It is so good
to have you back with us.

179
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:09,366
Take her to the River Province

180
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:10,621
to prepare her for the ceremony.

181
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,705
Yes, General.

182
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,225
Did he freeze?

183
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,694
Like an antelope in headlights.

184
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,321
Are you finished?

185
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:34,279
So surprised my little sister came

186
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,539
to see me off before our big day.

187
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,472
You wish!

188
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:40,216
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

189
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,797
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.

190
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,258
How many times do I have to teach you?

191
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,625
Just because something works,

192
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:47,513
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

193
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,992
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

194
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:52,015
More than you.

195
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,803
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make,

196
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:57,716
to your ceremonial outfit.

197
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,529
Shuri!

198
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,182
Sorry, Mother!

199
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:05,104
How are you feeling today, Mama?

200
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,335
Proud.

201
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,636
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

202
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,478
He is with us,

203
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,815
and it is your time,

204
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,078
to be king.

205
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,688
Good morning.

206
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,561
How can I help you?

207
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,392
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

208
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,892
They tell me you're the expert.

209
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,794
You could say that.

210
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,066
They're beautiful.

211
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,345
Where's this one from?

212
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,325
The Bobo Ashanti tribe

213
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,800
present day Ghana.

214
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,994
19th century.

215
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,024
For real?

216
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:00,922
What about this one?

217
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,091
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin.

218
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,717
16th century.

219
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,090
Now, tell me about this one.

220
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,052
Also from Benin, seventh century.

221
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Fula tribe, I believe.

222
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,390
Nah.

223
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:23,658
I beg your pardon?

224
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,492
It was taken
by British soldiers in Benin.

225
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,896
But it's from Wakanda.

226
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:28,629
And it's made out of vibranium.

227
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:33,906
Don't trip. I'mma take
it off your hands for you.

228
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,285
These items aren't for sale.

229
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,034
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

230
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,538
You think they paid a fair price?

231
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,975
Or did they take it,
like they took everything else?

232
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,127
Sir, I'm going to have to...

233
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,412
ask you to leave.

234
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,419
You got all this security in here,

235
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:50,956
watching me ever since I walked in.

236
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:53,522
But you ain't checking for
what you put in your body.

237
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:55,971
Alright, mate.
Let's have it.

238
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,509
Come on, mate. Time.

239
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:59,323
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

240
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,615
Hey! Somebody get some help!
Come here!

241
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:02,818
Call a doctor, please!

242
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,325
Hey please, somebody, come help!

243
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,367
Medical emergency right away

244
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,399
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

245
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:08,287
Look out.

246
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:10,844
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

247
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,988
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

248
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,186
I'm gonna take a break.

249
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,017
Let's give the lady some space, please.

250
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,143
Step back, please, gents.

251
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,453
Step back, please.

252
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:29,711
Hey, come here.

253
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,348
Come here. Come.

254
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:32,859
It's ok.

255
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,950
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, alright?

256
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:44,873
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

257
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,321
Because it's better to leave
the crime scene more spread out.

258
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,547
Makes us look like amateurs.

259
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,370
Now then,

260
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,356
let's see if you know
what you're talking about.

261
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,030
That's just a taste.

262
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,084
You're gonna be a rich boy.

263
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:37,148
You better sell that quick.

264
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:38,823
It's already sold!

265
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:41,842
Whatever you try, the
Wakandans'll probably show up.

266
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,203
That'll make my day.

267
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:45,352
I can kill two birds with one stone.

268
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,206
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

269
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,912
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

270
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,873
Onward!

271
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,330
Onward!

272
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,871
I, Zuri,

273
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,090
son of Badu,

274
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,745
give to you,

275
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,005
Prince T'Challa,

276
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,459
the Black Panther!

277
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,378
The prince,

278
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:14,037
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther,

279
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,770
stripped away.

280
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,844
Praise the ancestors.

281
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:51,835
Praise the ancestors.

282
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,470
Victory...

283
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:55,907
in ritual combat,

284
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,565
comes by yield...

285
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:00,188
or death.

286
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,540
If any tribe...

287
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:03,900
wishes to put forth a warrior...

288
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,422
I now offer,

289
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,839
a path...

290
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:09,286
to the throne.

291
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:15,191
The Merchant Tribe,

292
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,069
will not challenge today.

293
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,241
The Border Tribe,

294
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:24,051
will not challenge today.

295
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,754
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

296
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,725
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

297
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,344
Is there any member of a royal blood,

298
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,222
who wishes to challenge,

299
00:22:40,755 --> 00:22:42,080
for the throne?

300
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,237
This corset is really uncomfortable

301
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,902
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

302
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,272
Mother!

303
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:18,058
Hey.

304
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,476
Are they Jabari?
Yes.

305
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,192
M'Baku, what are you doing here?

306
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,591
It's challenge day.

307
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,965
We have watched,

308
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,293
and listened from the mountains!

309
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,424
We have watched with disgust,

310
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,391
as your technological

311
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,298
advancements have been
overseen by a child!

312
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,212
Who scoffs at tradition!

313
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,264
And now you want to hand the nation,

314
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,006
over to this prince,

315
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,588
who could not keep his own...

316
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:09,754
father...

317
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:11,235
safe.

318
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,741
We will not have it.

319
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:22,025
I said, we will not have it, oh!

320
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:23,516
I,

321
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:25,182
M'Baku,

322
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:28,337
leader of the Jabari...

323
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:29,430
I accept...

324
00:24:29,758 --> 00:24:31,383
your challenge...

325
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:32,590
M'Baku.

326
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,688
Glory to Hanuman.

327
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:54,920
Jabari!

328
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,168
Dora Milaje!

329
00:24:58,562 --> 00:24:59,562
Onward!

330
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:07,810
Let the challenge...

331
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,154
begin!

332
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,648
Stand up!

333
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,615
Come! Come!

334
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:46,544
T'Challa! T'Challa!

335
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,078
Where is your god now?

336
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,400
Yeah!
Yes!

337
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,013
No powers.

338
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,238
No claws.

339
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,365
No special suit, oh!

340
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,407
Just a boy not fit to lead!

341
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:25,401
Show him who you are!

342
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,849
I am Prince T'Challa

343
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,769
son of King T'Chaka!

344
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,387
You can do this, T'Challa!

345
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,203
Yes!

346
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,746
Come on!

347
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,076
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

348
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,832
I would rather die!

349
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,255
T'Challa!

350
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,307
T'Challa!

351
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:16,318
T'Challa!

352
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:18,562
T'Challa!

353
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:20,312
T'Challa!

354
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:21,429
You have fought with honor!

355
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,014
Now yield!
Your people need you.

356
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:24,678
T'Challa!

357
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:26,656
T'Challa!

358
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,848
Yield, man!

359
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:28,876
T'Challa!

360
00:27:30,073 --> 00:27:30,841
T'Challa!

361
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:33,427
Yes!

362
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,040
Yes!

363
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,775
I now present to you,

364
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,676
King T'Challa.

365
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,064
The Black Panther.

366
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,108
Zuri.

367
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,373
My King.

368
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,821
Wakanda forever!

369
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,585
Wakanda forever!

370
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,128
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb,

371
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:07,520
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther,

372
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,920
and take you to...

373
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:11,406
the Ancestral Plane.

374
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,321
T'Chaka we call...

375
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:18,806
on you.

376
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,340
Come here...

377
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,806
to your son.

378
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,934
Praise the ancestors.

379
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:06,773
Father.

380
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:08,383
My son.

381
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,966
I'm sorry.

382
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,427
Stand up.

383
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:23,396
You are a king.

384
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,584
What is wrong my son?

385
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,066
I am not ready.

386
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:46,053
Have you not prepared,

387
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:50,048
to be king your whole life?

388
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:53,992
Have you not trained and studied,

389
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:57,283
been by my side?

390
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,284
That is not
what I am talking about.

391
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,736
I am not ready to be without you.

392
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,587
A man who has not prepared
his children,

393
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:14,928
for his own death

394
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:17,182
has failed as a father.

395
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,724
Have I...

396
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:20,214
ever failed you?

397
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:21,922
Never.

398
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,317
Tell me how to best protect Wakanda.

399
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,044
I want to be a great king, Baba.

400
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,052
Just like you.

401
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:40,366
You're going to struggle.

402
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,917
So you'll need to surround yourself

403
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,361
with people you trust.

404
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:46,411
You're a good man,

405
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,323
with a good heart.

406
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,720
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

407
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,124
Breathe.

408
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,522
T'Challa, breathe.

409
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,086
Breathe.

410
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,484
He was there.

411
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,641
He was there.

412
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:10,515
My father.

413
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:27,496
Just one?

414
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,053
Come home, Nakia.

415
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:37,424
I'm right here.

416
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,331
Stay.

417
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,319
I came to support you,

418
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,649
and to honor your father
but I can't stay.

419
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:46,689
It's just...

420
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,659
I found my calling out there.

421
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,300
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

422
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,421
I can't be happy here,

423
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:57,131
knowing that there is people
out there who have nothing.

424
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,370
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

425
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,257
Share what we have.

426
00:34:04,061 --> 00:34:05,338
We could provide aid,

427
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:08,287
and access to technology
and refuge to those who need it.

428
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,382
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

429
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:15,067
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

430
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:18,217
If the world found out
what we truly are,

431
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:19,373
what we possess,

432
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:21,625
we could lose our way of life.

433
00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:23,884
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others,

434
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:25,825
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

435
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,687
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

436
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,318
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

437
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:36,236
See, you admit it!
If that's what I wanted.

438
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,224
Is that him?

439
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,433
Glory to Bast, man.

440
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:51,417
Is he still growing?

441
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:52,931
Of course.

442
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:55,878
I see Nakia is back.

443
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,411
You guys going to work it out?

444
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:06,530
T'Challa

445
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,336
what's wrong?

446
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,418
Nakia thinks we should be doing more.

447
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,650
More, like what?

448
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,703
Foreign aid,

449
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:14,060
refugee programs.

450
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:15,829
You let the refugees in,

451
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,412
they bring their problems with them.

452
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,742
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

453
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,647
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men,

454
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,625
to go out there
and clean up the world,

455
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,013
then I'll be all for it.

456
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,627
But waging war
on other countries,

457
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:34,211
has never been our way.

458
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:39,893
You too?

459
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,693
Bast! We're in trouble.

460
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,008
My King.

461
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:48,102
My love.

462
00:35:48,284 --> 00:35:51,587
You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.

463
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,226
A misidentified Wakandan artifact,

464
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,984
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

465
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,266
We have learned,

466
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,355
Ulysses Klaue,

467
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:07,709
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer,

468
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,624
in South Korea tomorrow night.

469
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,561
Klaue has escaped
our pursuits for almost...

470
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,088
30 years.

471
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,384
Not capturing him is perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

472
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,681
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

473
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:28,557
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

474
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,167
We need a king.

475
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:32,535
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

476
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:35,633
Not a day goes by when I do not think

477
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:37,410
about what Klaue took from us.

478
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,364
From me.

479
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,228
It's too great an opportunity to pass.

480
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:44,528
Take me with you.

481
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,662
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

482
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,180
I need you here,

483
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:50,035
protecting the border.

484
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,232
Then I ask,

485
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,222
you kill him where he stands,

486
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,611
or you bring him back to us.

487
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,095
You have my word.

488
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,650
I will bring him back.

489
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,526
We will proceed with the mission.

490
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:52,845
My King!

491
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,637
Stop it. Stop it.

492
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,976
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

493
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,311
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?

494
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,820
Okoye.

495
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,398
And Nakia as well.

496
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,029
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

497
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,414
Yes.

498
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,786
We'll be fine.

499
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:17,849
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

500
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,948
Yes!

501
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,415
I have great things to show you, Brother.

502
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,309
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

503
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,631
Unlimited range,

504
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,547
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

505
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:30,866
Check these out.

506
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:35,385
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

507
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,436
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

508
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,191
And what are these?

509
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:45,598
The real question is what are those?

510
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,009
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

511
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,941
What, you don't like my royal sandals?

512
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,868
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

513
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,031
I bet the Elders loved that.

514
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,044
Try them on.

515
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:02,684
Fully automated.

516
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,540
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.

517
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,713
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

518
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,682
Interesting.

519
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,148
Guess what I call them.

520
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:14,960
Sneakers.

521
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,773
Because you...

522
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,304
never mind.

523
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:22,204
If you're going to take on Klaue,

524
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,155
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

525
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:28,114
Exhibit A.

526
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,690
My design.
Old tech.

527
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,243
Old?
Functional, but old.

528
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,906
Hey, people are shooting at me.

529
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,035
Wait, let me put on my helmet.

530
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,180
Enough.

531
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,866
Now, look at these.

532
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:44,595
Do you like that one?

533
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,814
Tempting.

534
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,383
But the idea is to not be noticed.

535
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,510
This one.

536
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,571
Now tell it to go on.

537
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,485
Ooh!

538
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,694
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

539
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,382
Strike it.

540
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,601
Anywhere?

541
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,287
Not that hard, genius!

542
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,668
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

543
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,124
I invite you to my lab,

544
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,839
and you just kick things around?

545
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,420
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.

546
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:30,561
Hey.

547
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,189
Wait a minute.

548
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,180
The nanites absorb the kinetic energy

549
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,594
and hold it in place for redistribution.

550
00:40:38,084 --> 00:40:39,133
Very nice.

551
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,099
Strike it again in the same spot.

552
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,848
You're recording?

553
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:48,672
For research purposes.

554
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,243
Delete that footage.

555
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,845
This way.

556
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,646
Bast willing, this will go quickly

557
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,690
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

558
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,027
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

559
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,858
What? It's a disgrace.

560
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,487
Hello Sophia.

561
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,449
Good to see you.

562
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:41,428
Who are these two?

563
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,078
My friends from Kenya.

564
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,626
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

565
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,999
Good for trouble

566
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:50,894
like you?

567
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,195
Thank you!

568
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,559
Spread out.

569
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,202
The buyer is likely already here.

570
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,805
The woman outside.

571
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,936
What trouble was she referring to?

572
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:55,381
I got into a disagreement
with some ivory traders.

573
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,547
Made a bit of a mess.

574
00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:00,251
And will there be any trouble tonight,

575
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,197
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

576
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,355
Depends...

577
00:43:03,768 --> 00:43:05,975
on how quickly we finish the mission.

578
00:43:06,123 --> 00:43:07,955
<i>Can we please focus?</i>

579
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,956
Thank you.

580
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Over here.

581
00:43:14,214 --> 00:43:16,046
One whiskey, please.

582
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,768
Eyes up.

583
00:43:28,183 --> 00:43:29,550
Americans.

584
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:34,393
I count three.

585
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,527
Five.

586
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,565
How could you miss Greased
Lightning there behind you?

587
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,858
Six.

588
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,868
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

589
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,206
It just got a little more complicated.

590
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,705
Agent Ross.

591
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:53,912
Your Highness.

592
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,295
You are buying from Klaue.

593
00:43:58,144 --> 00:43:59,885
What I'm doing or not doing,

594
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,298
on behalf of the U.S. government

595
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,506
is none of your concern.

596
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,426
Now, whatever the hell you're up to...

597
00:44:04,537 --> 00:44:06,274
do me a favor, stay out of my way.

598
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,219
I gave you Zemo.

599
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:09,590
Didn't I keep it under wraps

600
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,330
that the king of a third world country,

601
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,690
runs around in a bulletproof cat suit?

602
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,906
I'd say we were even.

603
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,919
You really need to leave, now.

604
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,780
Klaue is leaving out that door with me.

605
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,184
You've been warned.

606
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,448
Three, craps.

607
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,189
Hey, you won!

608
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:30,967
You know what?

609
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,163
I think I'll just take these

610
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,913
bring them over here,

611
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,362
and hold on for safekeeping.

612
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,238
Ok, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

613
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,221
He cannot leave with Klaue.

614
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,767
Alright.

615
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,592
Vibranium from the attack on
Sokovia links back to a person

616
00:44:50,594 --> 00:44:51,958
that I'm not actually saying

617
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,307
I'm here to make a deal with
but that deal will not be called off.

618
00:44:55,452 --> 00:44:56,600
When the dust settles,

619
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,355
you and me can work something out.

620
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,230
I'm not here to make a deal.

621
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,303
<i>Klaue, plus eight!</i>

622
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,526
General.

623
00:45:30,706 --> 00:45:32,798
In position to secure our exit.

624
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,946
And the vibranium?

625
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,243
I don't see it yet.

626
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,399
<i>I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.</i>

627
00:45:38,709 --> 00:45:40,100
There's not supposed to be.

628
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,501
Somebody did not get the memo.

629
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,215
Definitely armed.

630
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,205
Well, that is quite the entourage.

631
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,407
You got a mixtape coming out?

632
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,063
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, actually, there is one.

633
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,241
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

634
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,854
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

635
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,628
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

636
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,430
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.

637
00:46:01,036 --> 00:46:02,283
You think they're for you?

638
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,060
Don't worry.

639
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,350
I can do a deal with you all by myself,

640
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,550
thank you very much.

641
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,233
<i>Six more. It's a setup.</i>

642
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,728
You got the diamonds?

643
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,185
Ok. That's enough.

644
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,021
We need to move on Klaue.

645
00:46:26,023 --> 00:46:26,862
<i>Stand down.</i>

646
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,779
We can't afford a shootout.

647
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:29,953
Vibranium?

648
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,149
I was going to buy a fancy suitcase but...

649
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,049
I thought I'd save myself some money.

650
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,126
It's now or never.

651
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,311
Stand down!

652
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:48,551
Hey!

653
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:51,949
Hey!

654
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,415
Wakandans! They're here!

655
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,852
Get outta here!
Kill them all!

656
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,317
Diamonds, quick!

657
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:08,953
Murderer!

658
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:14,572
You know,

659
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:17,732
you look just like your old man.

660
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,624
I made it rain!

661
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,234
Let's get out of here, boss!

662
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,788
That was awesome!

663
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,496
That was awesome!

664
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,463
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

665
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:44,955
Do we just leave him?
He'll catch up.

666
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,546
Shuri!

667
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,394
Yes!

668
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:01,756
Remote driving system activated.

669
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,522
Wait! Which side of the road is it?

670
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,639
<i>For Bast's sake!</i>

671
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:06,445
<i>Just drive!
Ok, calm down!</i>

672
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:07,422
Ok. Calm down.

673
00:49:16,302 --> 00:49:17,201
Let's go!

674
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:19,441
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?

675
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,666
Which one is he in now?

676
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,056
Hey, split Up!

677
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,022
They're trying to lose us.
I'll take the right.

678
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,065
We'll take the other two!

679
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:36,392
I see a shortcut.

680
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,771
We're not going to make it!

681
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,436
Keep going!

682
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,826
Brother!

683
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,504
Hey, what was that?

684
00:50:15,506 --> 00:50:17,706
Don't worry about it.
You're doing great.

685
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,137
Guns.

686
00:50:31,627 --> 00:50:32,931
So primitive!

687
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,777
It's a vibranium car, you idiots!

688
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,262
The bullets won't penetrate!

689
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,362
What are you doing?

690
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,610
Just drive.

691
00:50:57,989 --> 00:50:58,513
Shit!

692
00:51:12,408 --> 00:51:13,619
Hey, look at your suit.

693
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:15,134
You've been taking bullets,

694
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:17,002
charging it up with kinetic energy.

695
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,315
Pull around the truck.

696
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,205
Where'd he go?

697
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,924
You show-off.

698
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,178
There he is!

699
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,599
Hold tight!

700
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,720
Alright.
Let's have some fun!

701
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,924
Hop in.

702
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,356
Put that spear in the trunk.

703
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,177
Faster, Shuri.

704
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,926
I'm going as fast as I can!

705
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,811
Take a right! Take a right!

706
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,608
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

707
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:40,174
Brother!

708
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,590
Klaue!

709
00:53:06,485 --> 00:53:08,067
Did you think we would forget?

710
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,207
Look at me, murderer!

711
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,771
Where did you get this weapon?

712
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,055
You savages didn't deserve it.

713
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,612
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

714
00:53:30,868 --> 00:53:33,045
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

715
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:34,053
King!

716
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,549
The world watches.

717
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,846
Come on. Guys.
Let's go?

718
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:45,916
Yeah.

719
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,386
Hello.

720
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,446
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

721
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:17,236
So this is a big mess?

722
00:54:17,744 --> 00:54:20,019
I figured we could go good cop,
bad cop.

723
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,837
I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in.

724
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,547
We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.

725
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,215
Better to let him talk to Klaue alone
for 5 minutes

726
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,734
than to make a scene here.

727
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,728
After your questioning,

728
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,513
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

729
00:54:38,515 --> 00:54:41,052
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

730
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,238
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

731
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,234
Listen, I'm doing you guys a favor

732
00:54:46,236 --> 00:54:47,657
by letting you even be in here.

733
00:54:50,277 --> 00:54:52,473
If he touches you again,

734
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,381
I'm going to impale him to this desk.

735
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:57,779
Does she speak English?

736
00:54:58,389 --> 00:54:59,638
When she wants to.

737
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:02,832
I'm going in.

738
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,072
And when I'm done,

739
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,265
you guys are up.

740
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,857
Agent Ross.
Yeah?

741
00:55:07,814 --> 00:55:10,575
I do appreciate your help in Busan.

742
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,230
You see that?

743
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,137
It's called diplomacy.

744
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,270
You're welcome.

745
00:55:18,743 --> 00:55:20,203
Okoye.

746
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,773
Play nice.

747
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,071
Americans.

748
00:55:23,376 --> 00:55:26,354

749

753
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:37,165
You know, you really should not
trust the Wakandans.

754
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,453
I'm much more your speed.

755
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,562
I don't trust anybody, not in this job.

756
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:43,472
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

757
00:55:43,534 --> 00:55:44,393
Where'd you get that?

758
00:55:44,395 --> 00:55:46,486
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

759
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,781
But I can get you one, if you like.

760
00:55:48,874 --> 00:55:50,631
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,

761
00:55:50,872 --> 00:55:52,008
and I'll ask them.

762
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:53,418
He's right outside.

763
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,543
Why don't you ask him yourself?

764
00:55:55,592 --> 00:55:56,677
What? T'Challa?

765
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:00,451
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

766
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:01,808
Bingo.

767
00:56:02,796 --> 00:56:05,967
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

768
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,739
Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits.

769
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,389
<i>It's all a front.</i>

770
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,968
<i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i>

771
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:16,725
<i>El Dorado,</i>

772
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:18,040
<i>the Golden City.</i>

773
00:56:18,307 --> 00:56:20,309
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America</i>

774
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,131
but it was in Africa,

775
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,475
the whole time.

776
00:56:23,888 --> 00:56:25,674
A technological marvel.

777
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,216
All because it was built on a mound

778
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,159
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

779
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,512
Isipho, they call it.
The gift.

780
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,214
Vibranium.

781
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,696
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

782
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,934
It's not just a metal.

783
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,058
They sew it into their clothes.

784
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,985
It powers their city, their tech...

785
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,016
their weapons.

786
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,612
Weapons?

787
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,648
Yeah.

788
00:56:48,843 --> 00:56:51,544
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

789
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,903
That's a nice fairy tale,

790
00:56:52,905 --> 00:56:54,921
but Wakanda is a third world country

791
00:56:54,923 --> 00:56:57,193
and you stole all their vibranium.

792
00:56:57,877 --> 00:56:59,023
I stole?

793
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,385
All of it?

794
00:57:04,876 --> 00:57:06,191
I took a tiny...

795
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:07,566
piece of it.

796
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,381
They have a mountain full of it.

797
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,892
<i>They've been mining it
for thousands of years</i>

798
00:57:11,897 --> 00:57:13,972
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

799
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,305
<i>I'm the only outsider who's seen it</i>

800
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,973
<i>and got out of there alive.</i>

801
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,655
<i>If you don't believe me you ask...</i>

802
00:57:20,978 --> 00:57:23,181
<i>your friend what
his suit is made of.</i>

803
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,656
What his claws are made of.

804
00:57:49,004 --> 00:57:50,588
Your father told the UN,

805
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,586
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

806
00:57:53,598 --> 00:57:55,255
But now he's telling me
you have more.

807
00:57:55,811 --> 00:57:57,222
And you believe the word

808
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,716
of an arms dealer strapped to a chair?

809
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,374
Where is that?

810
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,839
Back there.

811
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,508
How much more are you hiding?

812
00:58:37,242 --> 00:58:38,837
Something is happening out back.

813
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:45,604
Get down!

814
00:58:51,312 --> 00:58:52,012
Stand down!

815
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,574
Cover!

816
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,700
Grenade!

817
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,175
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

818
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:24,382
My King!

819
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:28,815
My King.

820
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,138
Nakia.

821
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,856
He just jumped in front of me.

822
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:39,360
I don't think he'll make it here.

823
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,816
It hit his spine.

824
00:59:43,597 --> 00:59:44,977
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

825
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:51,677
This will stabilize him for now.

826
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,602
Give him to us.

827
01:00:01,811 --> 01:00:03,130
We can save him.

828
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,426
Our mission was to bring back Klaue.

829
01:00:15,867 --> 01:00:16,818
We failed.

830
01:00:17,778 --> 01:00:20,655
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

831
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,363
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?

832
01:00:23,365 --> 01:00:24,848
He took a bullet for me.

833
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,557
That was his choice.

834
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,294
So now we are just supposed
to let him die?

835
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:31,128
Let us consider that we heal him.

836
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,908
It is his duty to report back
to his country.

837
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,725
And as king, it is your duty

838
01:00:37,727 --> 01:00:40,139
to protect ours.
I'm well aware of my duties, General.

839
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:42,326
I cannot just...

840
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,983
let him die,

841
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,736
knowing we can save him.

842
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,595
Where exactly are we taking him?

843
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,233
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

844
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:02,143
This is going to be fun.

845
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,501
He will live.

846
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,160
W'Kabi is here.

847
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,747
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

848
01:01:28,439 --> 01:01:29,711
He's not here.

849
01:01:34,018 --> 01:01:36,016
He slipped through our hands.

850
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,632
Slipped?

851
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,299
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

852
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,655
With you, I thought it'd be different.

853
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,415
But it's more of the same.

854
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,745
Let's get going, boss.

855
01:02:13,136 --> 01:02:14,703
You always sell to the CIA?

856
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,602
I sell to the highest bidder.

857
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,183
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg

858
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,647
and I lay low for a bit,

859
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,436
I'll make sure both you guys get paid.

860
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,091
I ain't worried about the money, bro.

861
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,115
I know you good for it.

862
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,866
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

863
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,013
You don't want to go there, boy.

864
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,037
Yeah, I do.

865
01:02:33,402 --> 01:02:34,082
Drop it!

866
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:37,473
Or your little Bonnie and
Clyde routine ends today.

867
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,536
Put your gun down now!

868
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,853
I'm sorry.

869
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:43,417
Sorry, Erik.
It's gonna be ok.

870
01:03:11,773 --> 01:03:12,404
You.

871
01:03:12,514 --> 01:03:14,406
You really want to go to Wakanda?

872
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,896
They're savages.

873
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:21,211
This is what they do to people like us.

874
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,692
I ain't worried about no brand.

875
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:23,691
Check these out.

876
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,067
Each one is for a kill.

877
01:03:27,406 --> 01:03:30,053
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

878
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,906
To them, you'll just be an outsider.

879
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,585
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

880
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,318
To think I saw you
as some crazy American.

881
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,642
Leave us!

882
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,163
So your mission...

883
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:15,202
did not go as planned.

884
01:04:16,555 --> 01:04:18,616
What happened to my uncle...

885
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:19,928
N'Jobu?

886
01:04:20,952 --> 01:04:23,409
My father told me he disappeared.

887
01:04:24,745 --> 01:04:26,029
There was a man today

888
01:04:27,306 --> 01:04:30,640
wearing a ring identical to this one.

889
01:04:32,486 --> 01:04:34,568
That is not possible.

890
01:04:35,236 --> 01:04:38,532
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

891
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,522
My grandfather's ring!

892
01:04:41,132 --> 01:04:42,777
Do not tell me what is possible.

893
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:43,814
Tell me the truth!

894
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:49,812
Some truths...

895
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,667
are too much to bear,

896
01:04:55,287 --> 01:04:56,312
T'Challa.

897
01:04:57,742 --> 01:04:59,969
That is not your choice to make.

898
01:05:00,932 --> 01:05:01,932
What happened to him?

899
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,526
I promised the king to say nothing.

900
01:05:03,528 --> 01:05:05,134
I am your king now!

901
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:21,951
Your uncle...

902
01:05:22,694 --> 01:05:23,649
took...

903
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,782
a War Dog assignment...

904
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:28,525
in America.

905
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,592
Your father,

906
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,116
placed...

907
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:35,164
me there,

908
01:05:36,302 --> 01:05:37,302
to observe...

909
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,211
unbeknownst to him.

910
01:05:40,914 --> 01:05:43,579
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

911
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,493
They had a child.

912
01:05:47,122 --> 01:05:49,454
The hardships he saw there,

913
01:05:50,787 --> 01:05:52,783
radicalized your uncle.

914
01:05:52,785 --> 01:05:55,090
I observed for as long as I could.

915
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,943
Their leaders have been assassinated.

916
01:05:58,272 --> 01:06:00,642
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.

917
01:06:00,644 --> 01:06:03,198
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

918
01:06:03,734 --> 01:06:05,460
All over the planet

919
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,748
our people suffer because

920
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,924
they don't have the tools to fight back.

921
01:06:09,968 --> 01:06:11,254
With vibranium weapons,

922
01:06:11,256 --> 01:06:12,967
they could overthrow every country

923
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,638
and Wakanda could rule them all,

924
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:15,890
the right way.

925
01:06:16,118 --> 01:06:17,401
He knew your father,

926
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:19,882
would not support this.

927
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,267
So, your uncle...

928
01:06:22,681 --> 01:06:23,725
betrayed us.

929
01:06:24,258 --> 01:06:24,851
No!

930
01:06:25,098 --> 01:06:28,400
He helped Klaue steal the vibranium.

931
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:31,407
No, no, no.

932
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,320
You will return home at once

933
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,322
where you will face the Council

934
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,832
and inform them of your crimes.

935
01:06:38,479 --> 01:06:40,506
He drew his weapon on me.

936
01:06:40,762 --> 01:06:41,350
No!

937
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,913
Your father killed his own brother

938
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:02,728
to save...

939
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:05,423
my life.

940
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,152
Speak nothing...

941
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:12,614
of this.

942
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,199
And the Child?

943
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,414
We left him.

944
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,292
We had to...

945
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,586
maintain...

946
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:38,195
the lie.

947
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,241
What is this?

948
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,280
Just a little gift.

949
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:31,020
Who are you?

950
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,189
Alright, where am I?

951
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,984
Don't scare me like that, colonizer!

952
01:09:26,346 --> 01:09:28,062
Colo... What?
My name is Everett.

953
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:29,914
Yes, I know.

954
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,491
Everett Ross

955
01:09:31,559 --> 01:09:34,096
former air force pilot and now CIA.

956
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:35,793
Right.

957
01:09:40,983 --> 01:09:42,254
Ok, is this Wakanda?

958
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,783
No, it's Kansas.

959
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,771
How long ago was Korea?

960
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,011
Yesterday.

961
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,229
I don't think so.

962
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,601
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

963
01:09:54,935 --> 01:09:56,022
They do here.

964
01:09:56,357 --> 01:09:58,791
But not by magic, by technology.

965
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:06,791
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

966
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,020
These train things,

967
01:10:33,078 --> 01:10:35,556
that's, that's magnetic levitation, right?

968
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:36,892
Obviously.

969
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,647
Obviously, but I've never seen it this...

970
01:10:40,372 --> 01:10:41,397
efficient.

971
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,278
The light panels, what are they?

972
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,740
Sonic stabilizers.
Sonic what?

973
01:10:48,322 --> 01:10:49,534
In its raw form

974
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,287
vibranium is too dangerous

975
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,960
to be transported at that speed

976
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:56,160
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

977
01:10:57,526 --> 01:10:59,086
There's vibranium on those trains?

978
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,295
There's vibranium all around us.

979
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,500
That's how I healed you.

980
01:11:12,855 --> 01:11:14,266
Where is T'Challa?

981
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,344
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.

982
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,939
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

983
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,316
A man showed up at the border

984
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,712
who claims to have killed Klaue.

985
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:22,756
What?

986
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,399
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.

987
01:11:25,401 --> 01:11:27,299
We need to find your brother!

988
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:28,705
An outsider?

989
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,359
No, a Wakandan.

990
01:11:30,637 --> 01:11:32,048
He's not a Wakandan.

991
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:35,788
He's one of ours.

992
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,639
He killed his own brother,

993
01:11:51,254 --> 01:11:52,759
and left a child behind,

994
01:11:53,608 --> 01:11:54,516
with nothing.

995
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,993
What kind of king?

996
01:12:00,294 --> 01:12:02,269
What kind of man does that?

997
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,073
No man is perfect.

998
01:12:05,584 --> 01:12:06,915
Not even your father.

999
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:09,625
He didn't even give him a proper burial.

1000
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:14,517
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father,

1001
01:12:16,349 --> 01:12:18,589
he may have created something
even worse.

1002
01:12:18,716 --> 01:12:19,394
Hey.

1003
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,581
Look at me.

1004
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:29,395
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

1005
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,828
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.

1006
01:12:42,243 --> 01:12:44,649
Brother, you need to get here now!

1007
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,169
Erik Stevens.

1008
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,119
Graduated Annapolis age 19

1009
01:12:49,121 --> 01:12:51,032
MIT for grad school.

1010
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,446
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan

1011
01:12:53,448 --> 01:12:55,166
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

1012
01:12:55,168 --> 01:12:56,432
like it was a video game.

1013
01:12:56,757 --> 01:12:58,498
Started calling him Killmonger.

1014
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,397
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

1015
01:13:01,697 --> 01:13:03,002
They will drop off the grid

1016
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,284
so they can commit assassinations

1017
01:13:04,286 --> 01:13:05,619
and take down governments.

1018
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,302
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

1019
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,782
He has a War Dog tattoo

1020
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,433
But we have no record of him.

1021
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:23,451
Is this man Wakandan or not?

1022
01:13:23,504 --> 01:13:25,290
Tell us what is going on.

1023
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,831
Speak.

1024
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,256
Speak.

1025
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,797
I'm standing in your house

1026
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:53,975
serving justice to a man

1027
01:13:53,977 --> 01:13:56,023
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

1028
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,781
Justice your king couldn't deliver.

1029
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,400
I don't care that you brought Klaue.

1030
01:14:06,923 --> 01:14:09,193
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand

1031
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,232
is because I know who you are.

1032
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,192
Now, what do you want?

1033
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:16,868
I want the throne.

1034
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,161
My goodness.

1035
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,286
Y'all sitting up here comfortable.

1036
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:26,822
Must feel good.

1037
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,287
It's about two billion people

1038
01:14:29,289 --> 01:14:30,979
all over the world that looks like us.

1039
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,302
But their lives are a lot harder.

1040
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,006
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate them all.

1041
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,360
And what tools are those?

1042
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,106
Vibranium.

1043
01:14:41,152 --> 01:14:41,809
Your weapons.

1044
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:45,246
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

1045
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,349
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner

1046
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,183
for people who are not our own.

1047
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,172
Not your own?

1048
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,698
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

1049
01:14:56,112 --> 01:14:57,611
So ain't all people your people?

1050
01:14:57,613 --> 01:15:01,231
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

1051
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,155
And it is my responsibility,

1052
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,253
to make sure our people are safe,

1053
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,586
and that vibranium,

1054
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:10,448
does not fall into the hands
of a person like you.

1055
01:15:10,849 --> 01:15:11,595
Son.

1056
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:14,048
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

1057
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,342
Reject his request.

1058
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:18,525
I ain't requesting nothing.

1059
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:21,658
Ask who I am.
You're Erik Stevens.

1060
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:24,727
An American black operative.

1061
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,714
A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger.

1062
01:15:26,716 --> 01:15:27,813
That's who you are.

1063
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,351
That's not my name, Princess.

1064
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:30,979
Ask me, King.

1065
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,268
No.

1066
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:34,590
Ask me.

1067
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,184
Take him away.

1068
01:15:39,753 --> 01:15:40,876
Who are you?

1069
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,673
I am N'Jadaka,

1070
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,713
son of Prince N'Jobu.

1071
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,535
Son of N'Jobu?

1072
01:15:47,537 --> 01:15:49,855
I found my daddy
with Panther claws in his chest!

1073
01:15:49,899 --> 01:15:51,961
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

1074
01:15:51,963 --> 01:15:53,051
You're lying!

1075
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,464
Lies!
I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1076
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:58,964
What?

1077
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,593
The descendent of N'Jobu.

1078
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,206
Hey, Auntie.

1079
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,436
I'm exercising my blood right

1080
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,476
to challenge for the mantles of king

1081
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,232
and Black Panther.

1082
01:16:18,018 --> 01:16:19,383
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1083
01:16:19,385 --> 01:16:21,547
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

1084
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:23,579
he is within his rights.

1085
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,995
He has no rights here!

1086
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,510
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.

1087
01:16:27,512 --> 01:16:30,305
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1088
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,869
The whole country ain't got
to be there. I just need him.

1089
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,209
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

1090
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,128
T'Challa, what do you know of this?

1091
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,890
I accept your challenge.

1092
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,401
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1093
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,661
He should have just come
to the first challenge

1094
01:17:07,663 --> 01:17:09,092
and gotten it over with.

1095
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,873
The king will now have the strength

1096
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,712
of the Black Panther stripped away.

1097
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,089
Where is Agent Ross?

1098
01:17:54,438 --> 01:17:57,128
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1099
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:03,105
This is your last chance.

1100
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,138
Throw down your weapons,

1101
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,553
and we can handle this another way.

1102
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,968
I lived my entire life,

1103
01:18:19,275 --> 01:18:20,608
waiting for this moment.

1104
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,230
I trained, I lied,

1105
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:24,752
I killed

1106
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,600
just to get here.

1107
01:18:27,941 --> 01:18:30,989
I killed in America, Afghanistan

1108
01:18:33,092 --> 01:18:34,127
Iraq.

1109
01:18:35,575 --> 01:18:37,702
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

1110
01:18:37,704 --> 01:18:39,020
right here on this continent.

1111
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,086
And all this death

1112
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,041
just so I could kill you.

1113
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,522
Let the challenge begin.

1114
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:36,830
Yield!

1115
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,382
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1116
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:21,727
Come on, get up.

1117
01:20:23,029 --> 01:20:24,029
Come here.

1118
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,942
This is for my father.

1119
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:31,398
Erik!

1120
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,118
Zuri, no.
Stop!

1121
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,702
Zuri!
Zuri, don't!

1122
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,864
I am the cause of your father's death.

1123
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,248
Not him.

1124
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:40,744
Take me.

1125
01:20:42,452 --> 01:20:44,280
I'll take you both, Uncle James.

1126
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:45,978
No!

1127
01:20:46,146 --> 01:20:47,898
No! No!

1128
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:49,097
No!

1129
01:20:50,955 --> 01:20:51,990
Zuri, no!

1130
01:20:51,992 --> 01:20:52,992
No!

1131
01:20:53,238 --> 01:20:54,074
No!

1132
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,763
No! No!

1133
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,716
Zuri! Zuri!

1134
01:20:58,468 --> 01:21:00,300
No! No!

1135
01:21:03,465 --> 01:21:04,606
Is this your king?

1136
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,082
Is this your king?

1137
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:16,724
The Black Panther,

1138
01:21:16,965 --> 01:21:18,954
who's supposed
to lead you into the future?

1139
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,573
Come on, Brother!

1140
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,132
Is there nothing that can be done?

1141
01:21:24,784 --> 01:21:25,401
Him?

1142
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,039
He's supposed to protect you?

1143
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,685
No.
No!

1144
01:21:49,212 --> 01:21:50,790
No!

1145
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:55,228
Nah.

1146
01:21:55,504 --> 01:21:56,868
I'm your king.

1147
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,703
No! No!
We have to go now!

1148
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,611
Queen Mother, let's go!

1149
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,582
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

1150
01:22:38,584 --> 01:22:39,104
Yes.

1151
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,208
Thank you.

1152
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,879
We should get to them immediately.

1153
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:45,935
I cannot.

1154
01:22:46,205 --> 01:22:46,785
What?

1155
01:22:46,871 --> 01:22:48,134
Though my heart is with you.

1156
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:52,340
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

1157
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,049
who showed up here only hours ago.

1158
01:22:54,222 --> 01:22:55,222
He is of royal blood.

1159
01:22:55,224 --> 01:22:57,612
He killed T'Challa!
In ritual combat.

1160
01:22:57,614 --> 01:22:59,210
Does that really matter?

1161
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,817
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

1162
01:23:05,678 --> 01:23:09,662
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1163
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:10,652
Overthrow?

1164
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,474
Nakia!

1165
01:23:14,285 --> 01:23:17,159
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1166
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:20,681
I am loyal to that throne,

1167
01:23:21,181 --> 01:23:22,934
no matter who sits upon it.

1168
01:23:23,878 --> 01:23:25,441
What are you loyal to?

1169
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,098
I loved him.

1170
01:23:31,871 --> 01:23:33,536
I loved my country, too.

1171
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:36,385
Then you serve your country.

1172
01:23:36,432 --> 01:23:39,220
No. I save my country.

1173
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,642
What's wrong?

1174
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:51,246
The king is dead.

1175
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,689
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1176
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,006
First Baba.

1177
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,093
And now my brother.

1178
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,765
Mama, we didn't even get
to bury him.

1179
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,440
It's me.
Nakia.

1180
01:24:34,273 --> 01:24:35,193
Who is this man?

1181
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,067
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1182
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:39,322
Where's Okoye?

1183
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,405
Okoye is not coming.

1184
01:24:40,724 --> 01:24:43,125
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1185
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,384
Wait here.

1186
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,408
What has happened to our Wakanda?

1187
01:24:59,149 --> 01:25:01,265
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb

1188
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,596
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther

1189
01:25:04,617 --> 01:25:07,562
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

1190
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:45,165
What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1191
01:26:53,902 --> 01:26:55,120
What did you find?

1192
01:26:56,121 --> 01:26:57,108
Your home.

1193
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,790
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1194
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,267
Yes.

1195
01:27:05,581 --> 01:27:08,248
The sunsets there
are the most beautiful in the world.

1196
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,213
But I fear you still may not be welcome.

1197
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:16,716
Why?

1198
01:27:19,137 --> 01:27:20,798
They will say you are lost.

1199
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,633
But I'm right here.

1200
01:27:27,965 --> 01:27:29,324
No tears for me?

1201
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:34,945
Everybody dies.

1202
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,991
It's just life around here.

1203
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,073
Well, look at what I have done.

1204
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,056
I should have taken you back
long ago.

1205
01:27:52,258 --> 01:27:54,532
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1206
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,144
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1207
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,097
That's why they can't find us.

1208
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,284
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.

1209
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,873
Breathe. Breathe.

1210
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,308
The Heart-Shaped Herb did that?

1211
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:41,517
This all of it?

1212
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,557
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

1213
01:28:43,589 --> 01:28:44,704
we will be ready.

1214
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,685
Another king?

1215
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,525
Yeah, go ahead and burn all that.

1216
01:28:50,884 --> 01:28:52,618
My King, we cannot do that.

1217
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,845
It is our tradition...

1218
01:28:57,491 --> 01:29:00,449
When I tell you to do something,
I mean that shit.

1219
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,455
Burn it all!

1220
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,315
You know, where I'm from

1221
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,143
when black folks started revolutions,

1222
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,164
they never had the firepower,

1223
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,603
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1224
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,464
Where was Wakanda?

1225
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,697
Yeah, all that ends today.

1226
01:30:14,028 --> 01:30:16,985
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1227
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,351
Already in place.

1228
01:30:18,937 --> 01:30:20,268
I know how colonizers think.

1229
01:30:20,716 --> 01:30:23,077
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against them.

1230
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,662
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

1231
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,659
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world

1232
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,420
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1233
01:30:32,683 --> 01:30:33,686
And their children.

1234
01:30:33,955 --> 01:30:35,696
And anyone else who takes their side.

1235
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:38,435
It's time they know the truth about us!

1236
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,035
We're warriors!

1237
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:43,848
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1238
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,427
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1239
01:30:49,589 --> 01:30:51,924
Wakanda has survived for so long...

1240
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,753
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1241
01:30:55,911 --> 01:30:58,723
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1242
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,203
But the world is changing, General.

1243
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,780
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1244
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:07,956
The outside world is catching up

1245
01:31:08,143 --> 01:31:10,452
and soon it will be the conquerors

1246
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:12,585
or the conquered.

1247
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,103
I'd rather be the former.

1248
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:21,173
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1249
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,256
So where are we going again?

1250
01:31:24,404 --> 01:31:27,022
We're taking the Heart-Shaped Herb
to Jabariland.

1251
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,806
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

1252
01:31:29,088 --> 01:31:31,396
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1253
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:34,152
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

1254
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:35,733
Nakia.

1255
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,399
I don't like this.

1256
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:43,505
The Herb belongs to us.

1257
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,291
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1258
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:54,407
Nakia,

1259
01:31:55,567 --> 01:31:57,127
you should take it yourself.

1260
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,125
I am a spy,

1261
01:31:59,127 --> 01:32:01,182
with no army.

1262
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,095
I would not stand a chance.

1263
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:06,977
We'll go.

1264
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,555
Oh, boy.

1265
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,075
Oh, shit.

1266
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,070
Look down. Stay calm.

1267
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,248
Shuri.

1268
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,953
Look down.

1269
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,573
My son,

1270
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,244
was murdered in ritual combat.

1271
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:13,044
Were the odds fair?
Yes, but

1272
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,628
So it was less a murder than a defeat.

1273
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,886
Do not rub our noses in it!
Silence!

1274
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,425
I make the pronouncements here, girl.

1275
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,303
Look, Your Highness,

1276
01:33:22,742 --> 01:33:24,558
the new king is a U.S...

1277
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,117
The new king...

1278
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:37,012
You cannot talk!

1279
01:33:37,379 --> 01:33:38,590
One more word,

1280
01:33:38,757 --> 01:33:40,998
and I will feed you to my children.

1281
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,535
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.

1282
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:57,588
Great Gorilla M'Baku.

1283
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:03,756
This is why we are here.

1284
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,801
To offer this to you.

1285
01:34:07,105 --> 01:34:09,472
An outsider sits on our throne.

1286
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,935
Only you can help us stop him.

1287
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,825
Come with me.

1288
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,222
Impossible!

1289
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,141
Is he breathing?

1290
01:34:56,143 --> 01:34:57,288
He's in a coma.

1291
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,886
Barely clinging to life.

1292
01:34:59,631 --> 01:35:01,292
One of our fishermen found him

1293
01:35:01,312 --> 01:35:02,928
at the edge of the river border.

1294
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,275
He brought him to me.

1295
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:05,872
Why do you have him in the snow?

1296
01:35:05,919 --> 01:35:08,699
It is the only thing keeping him
from joining the ancestors.

1297
01:35:08,701 --> 01:35:11,249
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1298
01:35:11,257 --> 01:35:13,109
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

1299
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,408
Nakia, the Herb.

1300
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,365
I call upon the ancestors.

1301
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,413
I call upon Bast.

1302
01:35:38,401 --> 01:35:41,216
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1303
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,468
Heal him.

1304
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:56,844
We must bury him.

1305
01:35:57,437 --> 01:35:58,622
Cover him. Cover him!

1306
01:35:58,663 --> 01:35:59,361
Ok.

1307
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,389
Praise the ancestors.

1308
01:36:13,408 --> 01:36:14,559
Praise the ancestors.

1309
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:17,420
Praise the ancestors.

1310
01:36:18,017 --> 01:36:19,428
Praise the ancestors.

1311
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,107
Wake up, T'Challa.

1312
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,692
<i>Wake up.</i>

1313
01:36:27,135 --> 01:36:28,034
My son.

1314
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,230
The time has come,

1315
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,668
for you to come home,

1316
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,899
and be reunited with me.

1317
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:52,438
Why?

1318
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:57,259
Why didn't you bring the boy home?

1319
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:00,974
Why, Baba?

1320
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:03,724
He...

1321
01:37:05,405 --> 01:37:07,941
He was the truth I chose to omit.

1322
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:12,025
You were wrong to abandon him.

1323
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,444
I chose my people.

1324
01:37:15,307 --> 01:37:17,169
I chose Wakanda.

1325
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,346
Our future,

1326
01:37:19,523 --> 01:37:21,164
depended...
You were wrong!

1327
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,540
All of you were wrong!

1328
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,302
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1329
01:37:29,868 --> 01:37:32,130
We let the fear of our discovery

1330
01:37:32,132 --> 01:37:34,434
stop us from doing what is right!

1331
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:36,815
No more!

1332
01:37:40,952 --> 01:37:42,027
I cannot...

1333
01:37:43,014 --> 01:37:44,802
stay here with you.

1334
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:48,114
I cannot rest...

1335
01:37:48,624 --> 01:37:50,650
while he sits on the throne.

1336
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:54,362
He is a monster of our own making.

1337
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:59,170
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1338
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:03,477
I must right these wrongs.

1339
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,293
Do you have a blanket?

1340
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:22,473
Killmonger has the full support
of our military.

1341
01:38:22,474 --> 01:38:23,217
And...

1342
01:38:24,756 --> 01:38:26,933
he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1343
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:28,897
Of course he did.

1344
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,293
That's what he was trained to do.

1345
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,646
His unit used to work with the CIA

1346
01:38:32,648 --> 01:38:34,611
to destabilize foreign countries.

1347
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,992
They would always strike
at transitions of power

1348
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,156
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1349
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,799
You get control of government,
the military

1350
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:43,559
Our resources.
Right.

1351
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,252
The Great Mound.

1352
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:48,180
Our vibranium, all of my designs.

1353
01:38:48,182 --> 01:38:50,266
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1354
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,296
You must get them out
of Wakanda safely.

1355
01:38:56,298 --> 01:38:57,703
What?
What about you?

1356
01:38:58,606 --> 01:39:00,134
The challenge will have to continue.

1357
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:01,374
T'Challa,

1358
01:39:02,592 --> 01:39:04,015
we will not leave Wakanda.

1359
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,054
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1360
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:08,724
If he gets control of our technology,

1361
01:39:09,013 --> 01:39:10,344
nowhere will be safe.

1362
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,405
The Black Panther lives.

1363
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,758
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda

1364
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,297
I will be right there beside him.

1365
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:40,805
As will I.

1366
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,507
I'm in too.

1367
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,352
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1368
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:50,808
Are you done?

1369
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,128
Are you done?

1370
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,609
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

1371
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,617
Thank you.

1372
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,015
I owed you a great debt.

1373
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,727
A life for a life.

1374
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,574
Consider it paid.

1375
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:18,509
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1376
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:21,746
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1377
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:25,768
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1378
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:27,621
I bet you could.

1379
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:29,973
But no.

1380
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,610
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1381
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,085
It is our cause.

1382
01:40:36,884 --> 01:40:38,650
It is for all of us.
Oh, us?

1383
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:42,591
Us? You are the first king to come
here in centuries and now...

1384
01:40:43,878 --> 01:40:46,065
you speak of us?

1385
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,250
I cannot speak for past kings.

1386
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,919
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

1387
01:40:53,516 --> 01:40:55,850
We both know
the power of vibranium.

1388
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,050
If Killmonger gains control of it,

1389
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:00,838
who do you think
he will come for next?

1390
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:09,342
We will not...

1391
01:41:11,054 --> 01:41:11,941
help you.

1392
01:41:40,821 --> 01:41:42,052
Everything is on schedule.

1393
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:43,316
Have the spies been alerted?

1394
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,755
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1395
01:41:46,124 --> 01:41:47,481
But the War Dogs in London,

1396
01:41:47,483 --> 01:41:49,328
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

1397
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,405
We'll strike there first.

1398
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:54,201
The others'll come around.

1399
01:41:54,813 --> 01:41:55,820
Look at this.

1400
01:41:55,969 --> 01:41:57,316
A handheld sonic cannon,

1401
01:41:57,318 --> 01:41:58,683
powerful enough to stop a tank

1402
01:41:59,016 --> 01:42:00,632
untraceable by metal detectors.

1403
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,777
And we got thousands of them.

1404
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:07,639
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1405
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,818
He lives.

1406
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:46,778
N'Jadaka!

1407
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:48,889
Wassup?

1408
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,154
I never yielded!

1409
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,435
And as you can see,

1410
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:55,343
I am not dead!

1411
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,252
All that challenge shit is over with!

1412
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,454
I'm the king now!

1413
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:01,839
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1414
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:12,029
Shuri, now.
<i>Copy that.</i>

1415
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:16,446
Go, go, go, go, go!

1416
01:43:17,079 --> 01:43:18,020
Come on, Ross!

1417
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:19,209
W'Kabi man,

1418
01:43:19,523 --> 01:43:20,710
kill this clown.

1419
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:22,568
W'Kabi,

1420
01:43:23,077 --> 01:43:24,953
the challenge is not complete.

1421
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,315
What will we do?

1422
01:43:31,626 --> 01:43:32,707
Border Tribe!

1423
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:47,595
You!

1424
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:50,095
Your heart is so full of hatred

1425
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,182
you are not fit to be a king!

1426
01:43:57,031 --> 01:43:57,595
Come on!

1427
01:43:57,679 --> 01:43:58,906
Ayo, the king!

1428
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,408
Shields!

1429
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:51,865
W'Kabi, stop this!

1430
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,437
Stop this now!

1431
01:44:58,793 --> 01:44:59,793
No!

1432
01:45:27,934 --> 01:45:30,713
Nakia and I will get control
of the Royal Talon with this.

1433
01:45:30,903 --> 01:45:32,059
So what do I do?

1434
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:33,560
You'll have to fly it.

1435
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,281
What?
You were a great pilot.

1436
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:38,492
Don't worry, I'll guide you through it.

1437
01:45:38,754 --> 01:45:40,782
It's just like riding a hoverbike.

1438
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:43,163
What? You guys have hoverbikes?

1439
01:45:43,492 --> 01:45:45,123
Hey, Nakia, take this.

1440
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:46,404
I'm not a Dora.

1441
01:45:46,406 --> 01:45:48,040
Just put it on, it's armor!

1442
01:45:49,552 --> 01:45:50,587
Come!

1443
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,325
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1444
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:55,300
Yeah, I don't know what

1445
01:45:55,302 --> 01:45:56,747
I'm doing with this.
We're counting on you.

1446
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,229
Wakanda forever.

1447
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:20,456
Come on!

1448
01:46:31,046 --> 01:46:31,682
Go, go!

1449
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:40,615
Remote piloting system activated.

1450
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:42,896
My God.

1451
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,527
<i>I made it American style for you.
Get in.</i>

1452
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:47,407
Alright.

1453
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:54,991
Yes!

1454
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,935
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1455
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:02,825
Alright, I'm on it.

1456
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:20,908
Lock!

1457
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:23,600
Get him down!

1458
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:25,138
Get the necklace!

1459
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:26,997
Get the necklace!

1460
01:47:34,114 --> 01:47:36,196
Wakanda forever!

1461
01:47:44,093 --> 01:47:45,099
<i>Ok, Shuri.</i>

1462
01:47:45,169 --> 01:47:46,335
I got them. What do I do?

1463
01:47:46,355 --> 01:47:47,952
Shoot them down, genius!

1464
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:48,962
Alright.

1465
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:51,624
Here goes nothing.

1466
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,004
Alright, got them.

1467
01:48:04,353 --> 01:48:05,593
Oh, shit.

1468
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:08,304
Shit, shit, shit.

1469
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:29,785
Nice!

1470
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:05,948
Shuri!

1471
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,617
What's up, Princess?

1472
01:49:11,943 --> 01:49:13,581
You'll never be a true king.

1473
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:17,842
Brother!

1474
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:50,903
Shuri.

1475
01:49:51,994 --> 01:49:52,710
Brother!

1476
01:49:53,759 --> 01:49:55,420
Turn on the train on the bottom track.

1477
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,459
<i>The stabilizers will deactivate your suit!</i>

1478
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:59,088
You won't have protection!

1479
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:00,192
Neither will he.

1480
01:50:00,823 --> 01:50:01,399
Ok!

1481
01:50:26,234 --> 01:50:27,961
I don't need a suit to kill you.

1482
01:50:28,583 --> 01:50:29,789
Your reign is over!

1483
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,455
You sat up here, safe and protected.

1484
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,071
You want to see us become

1485
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,122
just like the people you hate so much.

1486
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:37,129
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

1487
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:38,594
Nah, I learn from my enemies.

1488
01:50:38,735 --> 01:50:39,827
Beat them at they own game.

1489
01:50:39,829 --> 01:50:41,042
You have become them!

1490
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,627
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1491
01:50:43,655 --> 01:50:45,396
The world took everything
away from me!

1492
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,212
Everything I ever loved!

1493
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:48,847
But I'mma make sure we're even.

1494
01:50:49,017 --> 01:50:50,203
I'mma track down anyone who would

1495
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:51,717
even think about being loyal to you!

1496
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:54,394
And I'm gonna put they ass in the dirt
right next to Zuri!

1497
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,517
Nakia!

1498
01:51:01,285 --> 01:51:02,910
Are you alright?
I'm ok. You?

1499
01:51:03,228 --> 01:51:04,639
Yes.
Let's go.

1500
01:51:12,066 --> 01:51:14,353
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1501
01:51:16,794 --> 01:51:18,000
Shit. What the hell was that?

1502
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:19,440
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

1503
01:51:19,464 --> 01:51:20,499
What? Where?

1504
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:22,292
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

1505
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:28,813
<i>Ross, you have
to get out of there, now!</i>

1506
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:31,117
How long have I got?

1507
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,098
<i>Glass integrity is at 50%.</i>

1508
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:36,933
Put me back in.

1509
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:38,814
<i>Ross! Ross!</i>

1510
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,201
Surrender now!

1511
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:02,362
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1512
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:03,518
One!

1513
01:52:04,529 --> 01:52:05,529
Two!

1514
01:52:15,152 --> 01:52:17,966
Witness the might of the Jabari,

1515
01:52:17,968 --> 01:52:19,153
firsthand!

1516
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:03,318
<i>Glass integrity is at 15%.</i>

1517
01:53:11,576 --> 01:53:13,533
<i>Critical weapons failure.
Shit!</i>

1518
01:53:18,584 --> 01:53:20,366
Hey, Shuri!
The last cargo ship

1519
01:53:20,368 --> 01:53:21,608
is almost at the border

1520
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:23,211
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1521
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:24,634
Make an X with your arms!

1522
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:27,506
<i>Sonic Overload initiated.</i>

1523
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,508
Now break it!

1524
01:53:38,632 --> 01:53:40,543
System rebooting in Five.

1525
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:41,565
Four.

1526
01:53:41,819 --> 01:53:42,499
Three.

1527
01:53:43,034 --> 01:53:43,464
Ttwo.

1528
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:44,395
One.

1529
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:46,392
<i>System rebooted.</i>

1530
01:53:58,707 --> 01:54:00,206
Yes! We did it!

1531
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:02,237
<i>Great!
Now get out of there!</i>

1532
01:54:12,929 --> 01:54:13,749
Charge!

1533
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:35,698
Drop your weapon!

1534
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:39,401
Would you kill me, my love?

1535
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:41,257
For Wakanda?

1536
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:46,420
Without question!

1537
01:55:30,777 --> 01:55:32,313
This is it for you, Cousin.

1538
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,335
Hell of a move!

1539
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:22,306
My pop said Wakanda was

1540
01:56:22,321 --> 01:56:23,903
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

1541
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:29,684
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1542
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:32,943
You believe that?

1543
01:56:34,413 --> 01:56:37,054
Kid from Oakland, running around
believing in fairy tales.

1544
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:26,980
It's beautiful.

1545
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:43,993
Maybe we can still heal you.

1546
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:47,614
Why?

1547
01:57:49,789 --> 01:57:51,217
So you can just lock me up?

1548
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:55,910
Nah.

1549
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:00,060
Just bury me in the ocean

1550
01:58:00,617 --> 01:58:02,772
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

1551
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:05,126
Because they knew death

1552
01:58:05,684 --> 01:58:07,208
was better than bondage.

1553
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:32,831
Thank you.

1554
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:35,992
You saved me.

1555
01:59:37,172 --> 01:59:38,888
You saved my family.

1556
01:59:41,557 --> 01:59:42,771
Our nation.

1557
01:59:43,188 --> 01:59:44,917
There's nothing to thank me for.

1558
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:47,028
It is our duty to...

1559
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:53,243
It was my duty to fight for what I love.

1560
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:55,646
I should have...

1561
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:04,827
You can't blame me, I almost died.

1562
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:09,305
Stay.

1563
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:14,933
I think I know a way you can
still fulfill your calling.

1564
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:17,896
Please stay.

1565
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:52,871
Oh, he moves it!
He moves it!

1566
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:54,518
Who man is that?
Bucket!

1567
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:55,770
Easy.

1568
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:00,333
When you said you would take me

1569
02:01:00,335 --> 02:01:02,084
to California for the first time

1570
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:04,088
I thought you meant Coachella

1571
02:01:04,632 --> 02:01:05,720
or Disneyland.

1572
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:07,715
Why here?

1573
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:14,002
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

1574
02:01:19,981 --> 02:01:21,376
They're tearing it down.

1575
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:23,604
Good.

1576
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:25,628
They are not tearing it down.

1577
02:01:27,236 --> 02:01:28,729
I bought this building.

1578
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:32,247
And that building.

1579
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:34,893
And that one over there.

1580
02:01:36,586 --> 02:01:37,872
This will be the first,

1581
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:40,206
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

1582
02:01:41,593 --> 02:01:44,255
Nakia will oversee the social outreach.

1583
02:01:44,974 --> 02:01:46,214
And you will spearhead,

1584
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:48,378
the science and information exchange.

1585
02:01:50,147 --> 02:01:51,239
You're kidding.

1586
02:01:51,429 --> 02:01:51,874
Hey?

1587
02:02:03,107 --> 02:02:04,143
Hey, yo.

1588
02:02:04,934 --> 02:02:06,227
Man, what the hell is that?

1589
02:02:06,287 --> 02:02:07,994
That's like a Bugatti spaceship!

1590
02:02:08,071 --> 02:02:10,414
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did you all see that?

1591
02:02:13,785 --> 02:02:14,946
What?

1592
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:17,788
Check it out, bro.

1593
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:19,380
We can take this back to the house.

1594
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:21,706
Pull up to school in this.

1595
02:02:21,769 --> 02:02:23,726
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

1596
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:24,837
On eBay.

1597
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:27,483
Everybody get, like, a million apiece.
I would not do that if I were you guys.

1598
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:28,897
Where you come from?
From Wakanda.

1599
02:02:28,899 --> 02:02:29,924
What is a Wakanda?

1600
02:02:30,191 --> 02:02:31,022
Hey, yo!

1601
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:32,575
This yours?

1602
02:02:36,641 --> 02:02:37,490
Who?

1603
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:39,512
Who are you?

1605
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:27,229
My name is King T'Challa,

1606
02:05:27,854 --> 02:05:29,593
son of King T'Chaka.

1607
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:33,809
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.

1608
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:36,670
And for the first time in our history,

1609
02:05:37,572 --> 02:05:39,516
we will be sharing our knowledge,

1610
02:05:39,658 --> 02:05:40,922
and resources,

1611
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:42,480
with the outside world.

1612
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:46,176
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

1613
02:05:46,703 --> 02:05:48,036
We cannot.

1614
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:50,216
We must not.

1615
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:53,568
We will work to be an example
of how we,

1616
02:05:53,611 --> 02:05:56,161
as brothers and sisters on this earth,

1617
02:05:56,303 --> 02:05:57,952
should treat each other.

1618
02:05:58,404 --> 02:06:00,236
Now, more than ever,

1619
02:06:01,429 --> 02:06:05,844
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

1620
02:06:06,267 --> 02:06:07,970
We all know the truth.

1621
02:06:08,352 --> 02:06:11,362
More connects us than separates us.

1622
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:13,646
But in times of crisis,

1623
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:16,142
the wise build bridges,

1624
02:06:16,444 --> 02:06:18,649
while the foolish build barriers.

1625
02:06:19,601 --> 02:06:21,442
We must find a way,

1626
02:06:21,616 --> 02:06:23,980
to look after one another,

1627
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:26,461
as if we were one,

1628
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:28,700
single tribe.

1629
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:30,770
With all due respect King T'Challa,

1630
02:06:31,009 --> 02:06:33,709
what can a nation of farmers
have to offer the rest of the world?

Are you playing around
with that man again?

1633

No.
You're teasing him again.

1634
02:13:38,219 --> 02:13:40,335
Don't wake him. He must rest.
No, I'm not.

No, I'm not.

Thabo, you're doing that.

1637

He's doing it.
He's lying.

1638

No, he's resting.

Bucky.

How are you feeling?

1646
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:04,732
Good.

Thank you.
