1
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:03,873
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
we've reached our destination.</i>

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:06,876
<i>Welcome to New York City.</i>

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,313
- Taxi!

4
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,234
- Legends, we made it!

5
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,165
Legends, we made it!

6
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,862
- Thanks, we heard
you the first time.

7
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,125
- And every other time.

8
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:39,735
- I appreciated
all your updates.

9
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:40,997
- Thanks.

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,956
Uh, Nate and Zari
aren't coming?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,480
What are they doing?
Did they say something?

12
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:47,134
- Hoover-Bot's
still stonewalling us,

13
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:48,526
so they're tinkering,

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,093
trying to figure out
who sent him.

15
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:52,052
Why are you so concerned?
- I'm not concerned.

16
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,142
I'm just, you know, emotionally
invested in their love story.

17
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:57,013
- I can't believe we're finally
in New York.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,189
We're so close to getting
a time machine and going home.

19
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,930
- Okay, first, we got to find
Dr. Gwyn Davies.

20
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:02,540
So let's get a city map,
yeah?

21
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,542
- Can we also please find
some pizza or something

22
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,153
that's not John's whiskey?

23
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:08,894
- Ooh! I saw an ice-cream stand
near the park.

24
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,380
- Oh, I miss classic
New York pizza.

25
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:18,382
It's all squash blossoms
and cauliflower crust

26
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:19,862
in 2044.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:21,342
Why couldn't John's
manor dimension

28
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:24,127
have had unlimited Pizza Shack?

29
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:27,783
- Manor dimension? 2044?

30
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:29,480
Pizza Shack?

31
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,482
Where--where are you kids from?

32
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:34,355
- Oh, um, we're just
tourists from--

33
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:36,879
- Uh, Canada, eh?

34
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:39,621
Sorry, how much
do we owe you?

35
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:43,494
- You're not Canadians.
Canadians are good people.

36
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,714
You're outlaws.

37
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:47,672
And I'm gonna stop you.

38
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,991
- Come here, come here.
-

39
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,602
- Careful, careful.
-

40
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:05,690
Okay.

41
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,216
Okay, I'm fine.
I got the map.

42
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,956
Let's just get to the manor.

43
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:22,054
- Whatever you're doing
back there, you can't hurt me.

44
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,883
I'm impervious to pain.
- Oh, I believe it.

45
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,366
- Wow, You mastered
that Hoover tech real quick.

46
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,325
- Yeah, well, the code is
the same as the Waverider's.

47
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,588
In fact, you see
this blue chip?

48
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,764
We have chips like this
all over the Waverider.

49
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,201
- So, we can confirm
that the Waverider

50
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:41,291
who shot our Waverider
is making the Hoover-Bots.

51
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:43,206
But the question
is still who and why.

52
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,860
- Yeah.
Well, if this computer

53
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,036
I stole from John's attic
wasn't so retro,

54
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,646
I would have
the answer to that.

55
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,300
- I was sent by the
United States Government

56
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:52,128
to uphold the law.
- Hmm.

57
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,869
- He still thinks
he's the real Hoover?

58
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,698
- Yeah, I even put up a mirror
to show him his tech.

59
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,091
He accused me of subversion.

60
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:02,399
- You deserve a break.
- Doughnuts?

61
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,184
Where'd you get doughnuts?

62
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,750
- John's attic.
Kidding.

63
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,143
Gary stole them off the train.

64
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,407
- Ah, genius!

65
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,844
Oh, my God, Sara!
- I'm fine.

66
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,759
We got too casual,
forgot the Bullet Blondes

67
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:15,891
are still front-page news.

68
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,109
Not gonna happen again.

69
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,198
- Yes, you might be fine,

70
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,503
but I'm finding it very hard

71
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,852
to erase the image of my wife

72
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,680
being shot
by a trigger-happy local.

73
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,247
- Sounds more like a patriot
to me.

74
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,944
- Can we mute him?

75
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,859
I can't deal with his
negative energy right now.

76
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,079
- Yeah, gladly.

77
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,430
- Sounds like an American hero.
Sounds like some--

78
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,476
- Okay, so...

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,652
Have you and Zari
talked next steps?

80
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,175
- No.
I don't know what to say.

81
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,785
And I don't want
to ruin the vibe.

82
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,309
- You're ruining the vibe
by not saying anything.

83
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,962
This is last time
I sneak you train doughnuts.

84
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,660
- The hell you will.
You're my doughnut dealer.

85
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,401
- Hey.

86
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,229
What are you two
whispering about?

87
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,231
- Oh, uh...
The mission.

88
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,015
The Bullet Blondes
are still front-page news,

89
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,886
and we got to find this
Dr. Davies as fast as we can.

90
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,714
- He's right.

91
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:59,064
And we located Edison Labs,
which is where Davies worked

92
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:01,066
when he came up with
the foundation for time travel.

93
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,416
- Great.
Just get us his research,

94
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,765
and we'll use
our future knowledge

95
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,201
to build
what he's come up with.

96
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,116
Then we can time travel
out of 1925.

97
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,074
- Wonderful.

98
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:11,207
While you regain your strength,
I'll go get Davies' research.

99
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,383
- Actually, I'm going.
You're staying.

100
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,646
- What? No way.
You just got shot.

101
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,300
- Babe, our faces are literally

102
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,650
on the front
of every single newspaper.

103
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:22,174
If someone recognizes us again
and decides to take a shot,

104
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,046
I'm the only one who's gonna
be able to survive that.

105
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,831
- Fine.
But no footprints.

106
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,703
Davies is the father
of time travel.

107
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,835
If you mess up his timeline,
no amount of IOUs

108
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,054
in the world can fix it.

109
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:34,143
- You got it.
-

110
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,885
- Which one's Davies?

111
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,452
- No clue.

112
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,497
Time Bureau Manual didn't have
a picture of him.

113
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,978
- Oh.

114
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,589
- But if I had to guess,
I'd say that guy.

115
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,851
- Looks familiar.

116
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:50,246
Kind of like Mick
but with hair?

117
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,117
- I was thinking
more of a young Stein.

118
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,598
But regardless, he's clutching
his briefcase to his chest

119
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,557
like it has
something important in it.

120
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,341
- Basis of time travel?
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,343
Wait here.

122
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,650
Um, excuse me, Dr. Gwyn Davies?

123
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:05,174
- That's Dr. Gwyn Davis.
What is it you want?

124
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:08,133
- I am a huge fan of your work,
and I would just love

125
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:09,526
to pick your brain
over a cup of--

126
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,527
- Yes, yes, yes,
I'm not here

127
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,137
to socialize, young lady.

128
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,791
I'm here to make
some very important discoveries

129
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,184
for Mr. Edison.

130
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:17,142
Now excuse me. Thank you.
- Of course.

131
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:20,276
Ooh!
Oh, I am so sorry.

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,105
Oh, by the way, was that
an accent that I detected?

133
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,846
- Good day to you.
- Oh, um...

134
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,326
keep up the good work.

135
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,420
- Did you get it?

136
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,465
- Couldn't have been easier.

137
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:45,562
<i>♪</i>

138
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,096
- We've been trying
to hitchhike for days,

139
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,142
and literally nobody
has stopped.

140
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,665
- We must get
to Dr. Gwyn Davies

141
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,407
by 7:00 p.m. tomorrow,
or the Legends will die.

142
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:07,367
At our current pace,
we'll get to him in two weeks.

143
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,673
<i>- Sí.</i>

144
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,461
- Spooner.

145
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,911
- Why can't you just bring us
some good luck, man?

146
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,608
- Who are you conversing with?

147
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,088
Is there someone
up there?

148
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:35,786
Hello! I'm Gideon.

149
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,222
- Fine.
I didn't want to do this.

150
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,441
But you leave me no choice.

151
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:50,410
I just performed
a luck spell.

152
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,150
Now this rock
will bring us good luck.

153
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,456
- No way! You can do that?

154
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,153
- Obviously.
I'm a witch.

155
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,416
- Isn't luck just
an interpretation

156
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,982
of random occurrences?

157
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,375
How can a spell generate that?

158
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,855
- How can a spell generate
anything?

159
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:04,554
All I know is it works.
Spooner.

00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:14,129
- It works!

161
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,174
- These blueprints
are incredible.

162
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:18,350
It's like Da Vinci's
helicopter sketch.

163
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,744
- Okay, how long to build
the time ship?

164
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,833
- Davies' instructions
are really thorough.

165
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,270
I'd say four--no, five.

166
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,534
- Weeks? Months?

167
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,624
- Uh, years.
- Five years?

168
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,017
- You're asking us to build
a time machine

169
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,019
from scratch in 1925.

170
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:36,934
- We're never gonna
get back to 2021.

171
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,328
- Look, it's not impossible.

172
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,330
It's just gonna
take a little while.

173
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,158
- Well, you're right.

174
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,203
And at least we have
an unlimited supply of booze

175
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,988
'cause I need
to get liquored up.

176
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,469
- I totally support that
after you ninja Davies' files

177
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,557
back into his apartment.

178
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,036
- You want me to do this now?

179
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,690
- Yes.
Small footprints, babe.

180
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:55,823
We can't risk
altering time travel history.

181
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,521
It could jeopardize
our entire existence.

182
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,305
- Okay.
Fine.

183
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,220
And then
I'm getting liquored up.

184
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:04,048
- Bye.

185
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:25,592
<i>♪</i>

186
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,948
-
Now go about your life,

187
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,385
and we'll build
your time machine for you.

188
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,745
<i>♪</i>

189
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,834
Or you'll build it
for us.

190
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:00,104
- You guys, his time machine
is literally sitting there

191
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,324
just begging to be used.

192
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,413
- Hold on.
We can't use it yet.

193
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,503
According to Davies' notes,
we're still missing one part.

194
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,157
- Who's game
for a scavenger hunt?

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,985
- Oh, I love scavenger hunts,

196
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,770
because I love giving myself
to all things--

197
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:16,686
games, people.

198
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:20,560
- Did you and Gary hook up?
I won't be mad.

199
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,344
I will be confused.

200
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,043
Just checking.

201
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,958
- Davies' notes also say
he got all his parts

202
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,438
from Edison Labs.

203
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:30,874
I bet that's where we find
the missing one.

204
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,876
- Scavenger hunt just
got way easier.

205
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,575
- Wait, wait.
I am also dying to get to 2021,

206
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,054
but no footprints, remember?

207
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,013
- Babe, I respect
your "no footprints" plan.

208
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,189
And, yes, we could wait
five years

209
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,799
for the Tarazis
to build a time machine

210
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,584
that may or may not work--
no offense.

211
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:45,889
- None taken.
- Slightly offended.

212
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,892
- Or we could leave
a tiny footprint

213
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,677
and get out of here
way earlier.

214
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,374
- It's not gonna be tiny.
Can you slow down?

215
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,767
We're just trying to get
all the information.

216
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,507
For instance,
this is very interesting.

217
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,988
The Manual says that Davies
laid the foundation

218
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,076
for time travel.

219
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,730
If he built a time machine,

220
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:02,645
why doesn't it say
that he invented time travel?

221
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,560
- All right, maybe
he time-traveled somewhere,

222
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,344
couldn't recharge,
and got stuck there.

223
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:07,519
- Oh, that makes sense.

224
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,956
That's why he never got credit,

225
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,871
because no one
ever knew he succeeded.

226
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,786
- But if we time-travel to the
future, we can recharge it.

227
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,266
Plus, we'll pick up some time
couriers, and we'll get back,

228
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,661
and we'll return the machine,
and he'll be none the wiser.

229
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:22,622
Babe, we would have
time travel again.

230
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,841
And I know it's a footprint,
but it's a tiny footprint.

231
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:26,495
It's like a baby footprint.

232
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,497
And everyone loves
baby footprints.

233
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,503
- The clutch is slipping.

234
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,113
- I have no idea
what that means.

235
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:37,854
But I assume it's bad.
Can you fix it?

236
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,508
- No, there's no time,
and we won't be able

237
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:41,336
to get out of first gear.

238
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,381
So, like, the max we can go
is, like, 20 miles per hour.

239
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,209
- How fast do we need to drive
to get to New York?

240
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:46,950
- Well, to prevent the Legends
from blowing up

241
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,909
in Davies' time machine
due to electrical overload,

242
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,562
we should maintain
a conservative pace

243
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,564
of no less than
55 miles per hour.

244
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,958
- Maybe we can, I don't know,
find a mechanic.

245
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,918
- There's no need.

246
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,702
We got our lucky rock.
Remember?

247
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,965
- I'm still not convinced
there's any such thing as luck,

248
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,315
only the ability to cope
with the statistical universe.

249
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:07,275
- Ah, you'll see.
Watch.

250
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,629
Come on, rock,
bring us some more luck.

251
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,472
- Good afternoon, ladies.

252
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,213
Name's Erwin George Baker,

253
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:34,128
but you can call me
Cannon Ball.

254
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,651
- Cannon Ball?

255
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,871
As in the cross-country
race-car driver?

256
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,350
- You've heard of me?

257
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:41,396
- I'm a big NASCAR--
I mean racing fan.

258
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,661
Well, y'all wouldn't happen
to know the fastest route

259
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,576
through Cleveland,
now, would you?

260
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,273
I'm actually in the middle of
trying to break my own record

261
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,623
driving from L.A.
to New York.

262
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,583
And, well,
I think I made a wrong turn.

263
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,237
- New York, did you say?

264
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,066
We're actually
on our way there, too.

265
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,850
- Well, the fastest route
to New York

266
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,722
is south on Highway 15
till it merges with Highway 40,

267
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,768
then cut through Columbus,
not Cleveland, on the 90.

268
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,773
You sure know
your directions, miss.

269
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,775
I'll tell you what--

270
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,038
if y'all help me
get to the highway,

271
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:18,955
I'll let you race with me
all the way to New York.

272
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,740
- Shotgun.
- All right!

273
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,611
- Let's go.

274
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:25,179
- Oh, I love scavenger hunts.

275
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,920
Are we playing teams
or head-to-head?

276
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:29,183
- Neither. You're on your own
finding that part.

277
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:30,750
- Well, what are you gonna do?

278
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,403
- Make sure that the doc
stays here all night.

279
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,796
We can't have him walking in

280
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,232
on us building
his time machine, right?

281
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:37,191
- How you gonna keep him here?

282
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,845
- Uh...

283
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,154
- Hmm.

284
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,638
-
I told you,

285
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,988
I am not here to socialize,
young lady.

286
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,816
Thank you.

287
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,600
I beg your pardon.

288
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:56,601
What do you think
you are doing?

289
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:57,689
You see, this is my desk.

290
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,561
It is not a rubbish tip.

291
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,432
- Oh, you didn't hear?

292
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,043
They want your opinion

293
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:06,829
on which of these projects
is best by tomorrow?

294
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:09,310
- Yes.
Who wants it?

295
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:10,920
Not Edison.

296
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,617
- Oh, this...

297
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,663
came straight
from Edison himself.

298
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,884
Oh, and these.

299
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,668
Tomorrow.

300
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,458
- What do we have here?

301
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:37,338
I truly am the world's
greatest scavenger hunter.

302
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,822
- I should be out there.
- Sara's gonna be fine.

303
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,171
She's a half-alien ninja

304
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:45,607
in a building
full of scientists.

305
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,261
- An illegal alien?

306
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:48,958
You degenerates
are worse than I thought.

307
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,394
- Would you just shut up?

308
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,613
You're not even
the real Hoover.

309
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:52,962
You are a robot.

310
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,790
If you would just tell us
who sent you

311
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,487
and who blew up our Waverider,
we could be rid of you.

312
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:57,880
- You can't get rid of me.

313
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,708
I'll hunt you
until my dying breath.

314
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,666
- Shh!

315
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,060
I still don't know who sent him
or who blew up the Waverider.

316
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,976
But I did find a to-do list

You'll pay for this.

319
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:16,029

supersedes everything else.

Oh.

to replace the old Hoover

323
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,694
and do everything
that the old Hoover did,

324
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,740
does that mean that the person
that wants us dead

325
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,655
is trying to protect
the timeline?

Protecting the timeline
is literally our job.

but any noticeable footprints,

330
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,882

that it's us

Dr. Gary Green.

337
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:08,081
- Well, Dr. Green,
at Edison Labs,

338
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:11,562
we log out parts
from the Parts Department.

339
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:12,737

of course.

345
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,580
- Have security meet me

Right away.</i>

to do,

349
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,810
it will keep me here all night.

350
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:45,553
- I suggest
you get started, then.

351
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,163
- Out of the night
that covers me,

352
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,600

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm fine.
I'm fine.

355

Are you all right?

- Yeah, please.
Just don't touch me.

- Confiscate everything.

358
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,005
- No, no, no.
No, not my work.

No, you--

360
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:10,056
- I've told you,

361
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:13,624
this time travel
is a fool's errand.

362

But you've been drafting
blueprints at work

and stealing company parts.

364
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,631
- Just let me complete it,
Mr. Edison, please.

365
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:23,765
I beg of you.
- You're terminated, Davies.

366

These men will escort you
off the premises.

367

And I am personally
burning this.

369

Time travel
is my divine mission.

on the road.

- We'll be fine.
We got our lucky rock.

386

out of the vehicle.

I'm taking you in

You are making a huge mistake.

Erwin's cross-country races

In fact, he is in the process

Our problem

00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,871
and make sure that history

475
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:49,786
happens exactly
how it's supposed to.

476
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,527
Stay here and uninstall
that last part.

477
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:53,355
- We're not gonna use
the time machine?

478
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,531
- No, we will, but we need
Davies to install it

479
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:58,621
and take his maiden voyage
like history intended.

480
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:00,841
- Wait, you're gonna break him
out of a mental institution?

481
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:02,277
- Yeah, I guess so.

482
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,366
Oh, wait.
Edison took all of his files.

483
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,715
- It's all good.
We made a copy.

484
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,456
- No, no, no.
It's not all good.

485
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,892
It was the originals that were
passed down from history,

486
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:10,416
and it's the originals
that inspired

487
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,808
the invention of time travel.

488
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,375
We have to get those back
from Edison.

489
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,377
- Okay, it's a lot to do,
but it's not impossible.

490
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:16,813
- We have until 7:00 p.m.

491
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:18,641
- That's a little
more impossible.

492
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:22,297
- Then it's time
for all hands on deck...

493
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,300
human and robot.

494
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,130
Hey, you guys muted him.

495
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:31,262
Can you get him to do
or say things?

496
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,742
- I mean, he has a to-do list.

497
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,614
In theory, I could replace
what's on it.

498
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:37,399
- Replace it. We need him to
get Davies' plans from Edison.

499
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,749
And Edison's gonna be
more likely to give the plans

500
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,491
to Hoover than he would to us.
- Okay.

501
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,711
Bye-bye, eliminate legends.

502
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:46,321
Bye-bye, tax Convention.

503
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,193
- Don't you dare.
I will ruin your--

504
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,413
- You know, I don't know
why I keep unmuting you.

505
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,415
- All right, I'm gonna
grab some clothes

506
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,156
so we can accompany Hoover.

507
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,027
It's shocking how much stuff
John has in that attic.

508
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:58,942
- Hey.

509
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,075
You think
he has a lab coat?

510
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,091
- Oh, I'm fine--

511
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,484
No, no, no, no, no, no.

512
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:19,702
What the devil
are you doing in here?

513
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:20,921
- Getting you
out of here.

514
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:22,749
The fangirl stuff
was just an act.

515
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,838
-
- I'm actually a time traveler.

516
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,317
-
"Time traveler"?

517
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,276
Is this some kind
of sick joke?

518
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,930
Edison put you up to it,
didn't he?

519
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:31,845
The blasphemer!
- This isn't a joke, all right?

520
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,281
I'm from 2021.

521
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,196
And I know that
you invented time travel

522
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,764
and your maiden voyage
is tonight at 7:00.

523
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,505
So I'm gonna get you back
to your apartment

524
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,507
so you can use
your time machine--let's go.

525
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,378
- Do you honestly expect me
to believe

526
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,945
a word that's coming out
of your mouth?

527
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:47,338
You lied to me!
This is all just more lies!

528
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,210
- Shh! Come on.
You'll see when you get there.

529
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:50,820
- I'm not going
anywhere with you.

530
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,256
- No.
Listen, you don't understand.

531
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,867
- I don't think you understand.

532
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,783
I built my time machine
for a sacred purpose.

533
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,394
And I'll be damned if I'm
letting a two-bit liar use it.

534
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,961
- We do not have time for this,
all right?

535
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,789
If you don't come with me,
then history is--

536
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:05,444
- What are you not getting?

537
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:09,360
You see, I am not going
anywhere with you.

538
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:11,319
As a matter of fact--
Guard!

539
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,234
Help!
Intruder!

540
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:14,583
Help!
- Hey.

541
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:15,976
Shh!

542
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,414
Be quiet.

543
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,942
- Shh.
- Okay.

544
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:29,511
- Now, I will let you go
if you stop screaming.

545
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:30,991
Do you understand?

546
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:34,342
- I promise.

547
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:38,128
- Okay.
All right, hey, hey.

548
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,956
It's all right.
Hey, look--

549
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,306
Calm down, you're
having a panic attack, okay?

550
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,526
You just need to focus
on your breathing.

551
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,920
- Okay, okay.

552
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,404
- Okay, look.

553
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:56,712
Hey, hey.
I'm sorry, okay?

554
00:24:56,756 --> 00:25:00,368
I've been treating you like
a pawn instead of a person,

555
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,065
and it's not fair.

556
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:05,242
You--you are a really big deal,
all right?

557
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:08,071
Hey, you invented
freakin' time travel,

558
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:11,074
and it's because of you that
so many things become possible,

559
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:13,468
including me meeting my wife.

560
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:17,124
- You married a woman?

561
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,169
- Yeah.

562
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,389
Still getting used
to saying that.

563
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,912
We just got married.

564
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,396
Look, I messed up, and...

565
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,529
and she disappeared
from the timeline.

566
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,661
And so now I have a sacred
purpose, too--

567
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,402
to bring her back.

568
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:36,622
And the only way
that that could happen

569
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,624
is if you come with me,

570
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:42,976
or otherwise
she could be gone forever.

571
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,152
So, please,
believe me when I say

572
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:47,154
that I am done lying to you.

573
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:53,595
- I can understand
doing anything

574
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:56,380
to save the person you love.

575
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:59,862
It's actually why I was trying
to invent time travel.

576
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,260
- So let's do it.
What do you say?

577
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:07,870
Help me save my person?

578
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:14,442
- If I help you save
your person,

579
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,487
you'll help me save mine?

580
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:19,229
- Uh, you're only gonna come
with me if I say yes, right?

581
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,623
- Uh-huh.
We have a deal, then.

582
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:26,759
Let's get the hell out of here.

583
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,544
- Yes, indeed.
- I'm gonna wash my hands.

584
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,288
- I don't know, Zari.

585
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:36,246
He's still giving me
"Terminator" vibes.

586
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,075
- Listen, I hear that,
but he's on our side now.

587
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,642
I reprogrammed him

588
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:42,949
to get Edison's plans,
among other tweaks.

589
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:47,257
- Yikes.

590
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,477
Is there any way
to make that less toothy?

591
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,565
- Watch this.

592
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:58,355
- After you.
- Aw!

593
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,886
- I don't understand why you
would be interested

594
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:10,585
in Dr. Davies' plans,
Mr. Hoover.

595
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,632
Believe me, they're just
the ravings of a madman.

596
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,285
I was just about
to destroy them.

597
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,939
- Thank you very much,
Mr. Edison.

598
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:20,160
I'm sure you're probably right.

599
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:24,512
- Yeah.

600
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:29,082
- I'm just a little confused,
Mr. Hoover.

601
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:32,738
Why would someone of your
stature...

602
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,565
bother to come here?

603
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,829
Unless you have something
more important

604
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,439
on your agenda nearby?

605
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,615
- I came here for a--

606
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:45,228
-
- Sir, sir.

607
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:48,797
- T-t-t-t-tax convention
at 3:00 p.m.

608
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,060
- Mr. Hoover, are you okay?

609
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,845
- Yeah.
Sir, he's--he's fine.

610
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,674
You know, he suffers
from low blood sugar.

611
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,458
-
I'm here for a tax convention.

612
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:58,851
I'm here
to retrieve the plans.

613
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,070
I'm here to r-r-r-retrieve
the plans.

614
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,290
I'm here for a tax convention.
I'm here for a tax convention.

615
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,595
I'm here to retrieve the plans.

616
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:10,906
<i>♪</i>

617
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:19,349
- Uh...

618
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:23,049
I can explain everything,
Mr. Edison.

619
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,747
- Great Scott!

620
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,009
- Oh!
- Oh!

621
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:30,621
- Mr. Edison!
Oh, my God.

622
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,754
He's dead.

623
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,756
Oh, my God.

624
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,584
- It's imperative
that we find him.

625
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:40,719
There.

626
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:46,637
- Come on.

627
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:50,598
- I am a scientist,
not an athlete.

628
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,862
- We need to take as much
Hoover-Bot tech as we can.

629
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:57,387
We can still use it to try to
figure out who sent him here.

630
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,607
- Why do you think
the Hoover-Bot short-circuited?

631
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,435
- I don't know-
he was being pulled

632
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:06,266
in two different directions
that he couldn't reconcile--

633
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,617
Like our relationship.

634
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,880
Nate, I-I know

635
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:15,710
I'm--I'm not super great
at expressing my feelings,

636
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,407
but I...

637
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,801
I have
to tell you something.

638
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,847
- You're getting cold feet
about living together?

639
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,849
- No, what?
No, no, no.

640
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:27,069
No, dude, that's--
that's literally all I want.

641
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,811
But in the totem,

642
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:31,421
not the manor.

643
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:35,425
No one is more surprised
about this than me.

644
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:38,080
I found a real community there.

645
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:41,127
I feel like
I'm part of a family.

646
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,914
Somehow over the last
two years, it feels like home.

647
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,003
- Okay, um...

648
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:51,441
Can I get
a little bit of time to digest

649
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,400
what it would be like
living out of a totem?

650
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:55,054
- Yeah.
Completely.

651
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:58,013
This--this reality
we're navigating, it's insane.

652
00:29:58,057 --> 00:29:59,536
- It's insane.
- Yeah.

653
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,104
Just take--take as much time
as you need.

654
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,240
And while there's no rush
on your decision,

655
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:08,850
we should probably
get out of here.

656
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,243
Yeah.
- Right.

657
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:12,985
- Okay.

658
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,120
- Too late.

659
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:22,472
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're trapped. We're trapped.

660
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,213
- Okay, you're supposed
to be a genius, right?

661
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,780
You can think
of a way out of here.

662
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,870
- A genius, genius?

663
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,219
They think I'm a lunatic.

664
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:33,309

Back, get back.

668

- I swear with all my might.

669
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,189

Get back.

670

Oh, sorry.
I just feel like I know you.

703
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,098
I mean, I've been studying
your life's work

704
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:52,753
and chilling in your apartment
and using your glassware.

705
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:55,974
I borrowed a glass, by the way.
Hope that's cool.

00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:03,155
Also, uh, Edison's dead.

709
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:05,157
- What?

710
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,855
- So there's another Hoover-Bot
and now an Edison-Bot deployed.

711
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:11,032
But headline--there's a rogue
Waverider after us.

712
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:13,556

Thank you so much.

- Oh, maybe I just have
one of those faces.

716
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,436
- Ray.
He looks like Ray.

717
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,090
- My Ray?
- I said a young Stein.

718
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:27,092
But whatever, we got the plans,
we got the doc.

719
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:28,615
B!

720
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,357

the last part

back on track.

The final piece of the puzzle.

724
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:43,195
You ready?

what happened?

728
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,254
Did I disappear?

729
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:01,648
- It worked!
- I am so sorry.

730
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:04,259
I never should have rushed.
I should have listened to you.

731
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,087

It's okay.

we're back together again.

Oh, oh.

No, no.
No.

a group-hug situation?

736
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,443
- Right, well, uh,

737
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,490
it'll be a bit of a squeeze,
but I'm sure we all can fit.

738
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:20,710
- Oh, all right.
What do you say, guys?

739
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,277
Ready to go home?

740
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,587
- Here, do another luck spell.
Maybe we can still make it.

741
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,502
- I can't.

742
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:31,591
The spell was fake.

743
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,027
- Come again.

744
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,898
- There is no luck spell.
I made it up.

745
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:36,813
I pretended to do it
to make you feel better

746
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,119
and give you back some hope.

747
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,555
You were
at a pretty low point.

748
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,209
- Okay, well, then how
do you explain

749
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:44,125
where all the luck came from?
- It came from us.

750
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,735
Hey, no.
Think about it.

751
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:48,260
You felt better
after I did the spell, right?

752
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:50,305
Gideon convinced Erwin
to give us a ride.

753
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,525
I sweet-talked the cop
into letting us go.

754
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:55,528
We made our own luck,
and we can keep making it.

755
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:57,138
But we have to do it fast

756
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:01,142
because we only have
five minutes to stop them.

757
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:03,971

One, two--

764
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:37,091
- By my calculations,
there's still enough time

765
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,573
to save my friends...
with luck.

766
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:47,057
- Right, then, where to?

767
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,755
- We need to go somewhere
we can get back

768
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:50,800
to our time machine
and find the rest of our crew.

- Tahiti, 2021.

770

There's a Time Bureau
safehouse there.

771
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:56,023
We can go pick up
some time couriers.

a great honeymoon. Hmm?

And now because we didn't,
the timeline might be off.

our whole lives together,
and it's just gone.

time travel or the high jinks.

00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,383
It was like I lost
my safe place.

829
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,169
And I lost
the cuddles on the couch

and bourbon sunsets
on our porch.

- So, Gideon, what was gonna
cause the machine to explode?

837
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:15,021
- The machine requires
a class CR-055 superconductor

838
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:16,370
that doesn't need recharging.

839
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,285
It can power
the machine safely,

840
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:20,156
unlike alternating current.

841
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,594
Unfortunately, it won't be
invented for another 300 years.

842
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,857
- 300 years?

843
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,077
Well, guys, looks like
we're stuck in 1925 forever.

00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:32,691

A little blue chip

- Precisely.
How did you know?
