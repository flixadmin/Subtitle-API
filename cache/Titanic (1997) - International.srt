Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

we're going over the bow. Stay with us.

still gets me every time.

we're landing right over

we're dropping down along the hull.

Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down
and go into the first-class gangway door.

Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck.

Watch the door frame.

We're good. Just chill, boss.

-Come around.
-[Bodine] Cable out, Captain.

00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,867
Yeah, Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

64
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,953
[Brock] Okay, copy that.

65
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,879
[Brock] Okay, right there.
Right there. Right there.

66
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,506
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

[Bodine] Oops.
Somebody left the water running.

75
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,743
Wait, hold it. Hold it. Just a second.

00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,162
Go back to the right.

00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,507
I want to see what's under it.

00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,301

All right.

84
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,852
[Brock] Take it easy.

85
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,978
-It might come apart.
-Okay.

86
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,441
Go, go, go. Flip it over.
Flip it over. Go.

87
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,777
Turn her over. Keep going. Go, go, go.

88
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,196
Okay, drop it.

You know, boss,
this same thing happened to Geraldo

108
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,169
and his career never recovered.

109
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,134

But, hey, hey… Don't worry about it.

There's still plenty of places
it could be.

115
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,688
Hell yes.

116

I know we're close.

122
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,159
We've just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

123
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,078
Hang on a second.

124
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,957
Let me see that.

125
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,751
[Buell] Ah, we might
have something here, guys.

126
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,255
Where's the photograph of the necklace?

127

Treasure hunter Brock Lovett

131
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,443
is best known for finding Spanish gold…

132
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,236
It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.

133
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,656
Come on.

134
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,948
Now he has chartered Russian subs

135
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,368
to reach the most famous
shipwreck of all, the Titanic.

136
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,455
He is with us live via satellite
from the research ship Keldysh

137
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,707
in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock.

138
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,959
[Brock] Hello, Tracy.
Of course, everyone knows

139
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,711
the familiar stories of Titanic.

140
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,382
You know, the nobility of the band
playing to the very end and all that.

141
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,884
But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories.

142
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,136
The secrets locked deep inside
the hull of Titanic.

143
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,514
And we're out here using robot technology

144
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,393
to go further into the wreck
than anybody's ever done before.

145
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,771
[Tracy] Your expedition
is at the center of a storm of controversy

146
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,856
over salvage rights and even ethics.

147
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,067
Many are calling you a grave robber.

148
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,027
Well, nobody ever called
the recovery of the artifacts…

149
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,112
What is it?

150
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,406
Turn that up, dear.

151
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,283
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure

152
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,078
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

153
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,914
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

154
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,126
A piece of paper
that's been underwater for 84 years.

155
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,671
And my team are able to
preserve it intact.

156
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,633
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity,

157
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,760
when we can see and enjoy it now?

158
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,679
I'll be goddamned.

159
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,100
Brock!

160
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,519
There's a satellite call for you.

161
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,603
Bobby, we're launching.

162
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,939
You see these submersibles
going in the water?

163
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,608
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

164
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,028
This better be good.

165
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,238
-And you gotta speak up.
-Yeah, standby.

166
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,948
She's kind of old.

167
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,199
Great.

168
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,620
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs…

169
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,706
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

170
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,957
Mrs. Calvert.

171
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:36,046
I was just wondering if you had found
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett?

172
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,134
Told you you wanted to take the call.

173
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,639
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

174
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,142
Can you tell us who
the woman in the picture is?

175
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,729
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

176
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,747
She's a goddamn liar!

177
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,666
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

178
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,084
God only knows what.

179
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,670
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

180
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,172
They're inbound!

181
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,723
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 17, right?

182
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,849
[Brock] That's right.

183
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,352
If she had lived,
she'd be over 100 by now.

184
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,312
101 next month.

185
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,107
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

186
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,527
Look, I've already done
the background on this woman

187
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,487
all the way back to the 20s,

188
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,697
when she was working as an actress.

189
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,782
An actress.

190
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,867
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

191
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,161
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.

192
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,372
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

193
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,706
They move to Cedar Rapids

194
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,042
and she punches out a couple of kids.

195
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,293
Now Calvert's dead

196
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,295
and, from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

197
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,880
And everybody who knows about the diamond

198
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,092
is supposed to be dead
or on this boat, but she knows.

199
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,725
Copy that.

200
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,066
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

201
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,693
Hurry up, give him a hand.

202
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,279
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.

203
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,905
Welcome to the Keldysh.

204
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,993
Okay, let's get her inside there.

205
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,452
Hi, Miss Calvert.

206
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,788
-Hi.
-Welcome to the Keldysh.

207
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,832
Thanks.

208
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,293
[pilot] Hey. Hey!

209
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,341
[knocking]

210
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,426
[old Rose] Yes?

211
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,136
Are your staterooms all right?

212
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,138
Oh, yes. Very nice.

213
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,891
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?

214
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,475
She takes care of me.

215
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,061
We met just a few minutes ago.

216
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,897
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

217
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,064
Oh, yes.

218
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,232
[Bodine tuts]

219
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,734
There. That's nice.

220
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,570
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

221
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,156
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

222
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,825
Yes.

223
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,661
I would like to see my drawing.

224
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,428
[Brock] Louis XVI wore
a fabulous stone that was

225
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,221
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown

226
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,682
which disappeared in 1792,

227
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,103
about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

228
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,191
The theory goes that the crown diamond
was chopped too.

229
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,985
Recut into a heart-like shape
that became known as

230
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,904
the Heart of the Ocean.

231
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,782
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

232
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,201
[scoffs] It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

233
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,536
I only wore it this once.

234
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,289
You actually think this is you, Nana?

235
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,416
It is me, dear.

236
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,251
Wasn't I a dish?

237
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,131
[laughs] I tracked it down
through insurance records.

238
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,969
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

239
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,973
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

240
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,642
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

241
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,978
[Brock] Nathan Hockley, that's right.

242
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,146
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

243
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,942
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son Caledon bought his fiancée.

244
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,402
You.

245
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,405
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

246
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,741
And it was filed right after the sinking.

247
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,662
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

248
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,248
You see the date?

249
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,751
April 14, 1912.

250
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,046
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is,

251
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,008
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

252
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,219
And that makes you my new best friend.

253
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,848
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

254
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,561
This was mine.

255
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,522
[gasps] How extraordinary.

256
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,027
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

257
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,904
[sighs]

258
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,364
Hmm.

259
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,285
The reflection has changed a bit.

260
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,845
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

261
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,350
[Bodine] Okay, here we go.

262
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,062
She hits the 'berg
on the starboard side, right?

263
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,814
She kind of bumps along,
punching holes like Morse code…

264
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,899
[mimicking Morse code beeps]

265
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,276
along the side, below the water line.

266
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,653
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

267
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,697
Now, as the water level rises,

268
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,783
it spills over the watertight bulkheads

269
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,577
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than E deck.

270
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,579
So now as the bow goes down,

271
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,165
the stern rises up, slow at first,

272
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,042
then faster and faster

273
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,045
until finally, she's got her whole ass
sticking up in the air.

274
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,254
And that's a big ass.

275
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,466
We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

276
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,676
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

277
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,095
So, what happens?

278
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,639
[clicking tongue]
She splits, right down to the keel.

279
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,725
And the stern falls back level.

280
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,352
Then as the bow sinks,

281
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,939
it pulls the stern vertical
and then finally detaches.

282
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,817
Now the stern section
just kind of bobs there

283
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,693
like a cork for a couple of minutes,

284
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,114
floods, and finally goes
under about 2:20 a.m.

285
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,533
Two hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

286
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,577
The bow section planes away,

287
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,163
landing about a half a mile away

288
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,666
going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

289
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,292
[imitates explosions]

290
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,421
Pretty cool, huh?

291
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,884
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

292
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:00,055
Of course, the experience of it was…

293
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,558
somewhat different.

294
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,060
Will you share it with us?

295
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,982
[muffled radio chatter]

296

Oh. [sobbing]

300
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,033
I'm taking her to rest.

301
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,117
No.

302
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,452
Come on, Nana.

303
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,870
No!

304
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,626
Give me the tape recorder.

Tell us, Rose.

306
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,176
It's been 84 years…

307
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,679
It's okay. Just try to remember anything,
anything at all.

308
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,642
Do you want to hear this
or not, Mr. Lovett?

309
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,649
It's been 84 years…

310
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,487
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

311
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,116
The china had never been used.

312
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,495
The sheets had never been slept in.

313
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:52,084
Titanic was called the ship of dreams.

314
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,753
And it was.

315
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,714
It really was.

00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,455
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

325
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,082
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

326
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,001
You can be blasé about some things, Rose,

327
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,086
but not about Titanic.

328
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,880
It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania,

329
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,506
and far more luxurious.

330
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,801
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

331
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,055
[laughs] So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

332
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,181
-It is unsinkable.
-[man] Sir, sir.

333
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,682
God Himself could not sink this ship--

334
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,808
-Sir!
-What?

335
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,393
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

336
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,020
It's round that way, sir.

337
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,731
I put my faith in you, good sir.
Now kindly see my man.

338
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,066
Oh, yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.

339
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,192
If I can do anything at all…

340
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,860
Yes, right.

341
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,862
All the trunks from that car there.

342
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,198
Twelve from here.

343
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:50,952
And the safe to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

344
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,662
[whistle blowing]

345
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,374
Ladies, we better hurry.

346
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
Come along.

347
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,173
-My coat?
-[maid] I have it, miss.

348
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:10,597
[porter] All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

349
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,272
Welcome aboard, ma'am. Welcome to Titanic.

350
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:24,027
[old Rose] It was the ship of dreams
to everyone else.

351
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,822
To me, it was a slave ship

352
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,575
taking me back to America in chains.

353
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:36,081
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

354
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,667
Inside, I was screaming.

355
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,627
[ship's horn blowing]

356
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,849
[both speaking Swedish]

357
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,978
[in Italian accent] Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

358
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,648
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

359
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,902
[in Swedish] You moron.
I can't believe you bet our tickets.

360
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,157
[in English] Sven?

361
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,659
Bet.

362
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,327
[watch ticking]

363
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,222
All right, moment of truth.

364
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,725
Someone's life is about to change.

365
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,101
Fabrizio?

366
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,438

Olaf?

369
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,902
[in English] Nothing.

370
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,403
Sven?

371
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,114
[inhales sharply]

372
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,909
Uh-oh. Two pair.

373
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,161
[tuts] I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

374

[shouts in Italian]

375
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,372
[in English] I'm sorry,

376
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,751
you're not gonna see your mom again
for a long time,

377
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,377
'cause we're going to America.

378
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,171
Full house, boys! [whooping]

379
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,714
[Fabrizio laughs]

380
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,174
Yeah.

Oh!

[patrons laughing]

385
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,103
-[in English] Come on.
-[speaking Italian]

386
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,772
[kisses, in English] I'm going home!

[shouting in Swedish]

388
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,193
[in English] I'm going home. [laughs]

389
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,861
I go to America!

390
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,238
No, mate.

391
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,324
Titanic go to America, in five minutes.

392
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,660
Shit. Fabri. Come on.

393
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,786
Come on, here. Here.

394
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,998
We're riding in high style now!

395
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,542
We're a couple of regular swells.

396
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,545
We're practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio.

397
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,631
You see? Is my destino.

398
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,926
Like I told you,
I go to America to be millionaire.

401
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,222
You are pazzo.

402
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,224
Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

403
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,560
Come on, I thought you were fast.

404
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,731
Whoa. Wait! Wait! Hey, wait!

405
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,817
We're passengers! We're passengers!

406
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,779
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

407
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,863
Of course.

408
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,117
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
We're Americans. Both of us.

409
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,827
Right. Come aboard.

410
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,209
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world. You know that?

[Jack] Goodbye!

415
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,516
[Fabrizio] You know somebody?

416
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,268
Of course not. That's not the point.

417
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,936
Goodbye! I'll miss you!

418
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,146
Goodbye!

419
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,315
I will never forget you!

[cheering]

423
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,531
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

424
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,243
G-60.

425
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,330
G-60. G-60.

426
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,498
Excuse me, ma'am.

427
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,750
G-60.

428
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,753
Oh, right here.

429
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,463
Hey, how you doing?

430
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,673
Jack. Nice to meet you.

431
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,258
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

432
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,718
How you doing?

433
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,012
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

434
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,472
[Fabrizio laughs]

435
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,101
[in Swedish] Where's Sven?

436
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,938
[in English] This is your
private promenade deck, sir.

437
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,481
Would you be requiring anything?

438
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,191
-Mm.
-Excuse me.

439
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,693
-[girl] This one?
-[Rose] No.

440
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,654
It had a lot of faces on it.

441
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,948
This is the one.

442
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,493
Would you like all of them out, miss?

443
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,496
Yes. We need a little color in this room.

444
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,001
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

445
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,213
God, not those finger paintings again.

446
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,048
They certainly were a waste of money.

447
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,008
[Rose] The difference between
Cal's taste in art

448
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,635
and mine is that I have some.

449
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,886
They're fascinating.

450
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,390
Like being inside a dream or something.

451
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,975
There's truth but no logic.

452
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,061
-What's the artist's name?
-Something Picasso.

453
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,189
Something Picasso.
He won't amount to a thing.

454
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,524
He won't, trust me.

455
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,817
[Rose] Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.

456
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,068
At least they were cheap.

457
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,404
Put it in the wardrobe.

458
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,868
[man] Passengers to the upper deck,
we're boarding please.

459
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,454
[old Rose] At Cherbourg,
a woman came aboard

460
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,664
named Margaret Brown.

461
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,416
We all called her Molly.

462
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,086
History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.

463
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,464
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

464
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,007
Here, you think you can manage?

465
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,175
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,428
[old Rose] Her husband had struck gold
someplace out west.

467
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,306
And she was what Mother
called "new money."

468
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,975
By the next afternoon,

469
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,770
we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland

470
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:36,149
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

471
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,532
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

472
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,659
Let's stretch her legs.

473
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,119
Yes, sir.

474
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,956
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

475
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,416
Very good, sir.

476
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,418

All ahead full!

00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,968
[Engineer Bell] Come on, lads.
Step lively!

482
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,892
[engineers shouting]

483
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,489
All right! Let's stoke her right up!

484
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,157
We go full ahead!

485
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,909
Come on, put your backs into it!

00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,674
Twenty-one knots, sir.

489
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,059
Hey, look, look, look!

490
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,480
See it?

491
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,819
There's another one! See him?

492
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,123
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

493
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,542
[whooping]

494
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,973
[stokers grunting]

495
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,357
Whoo!

496
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,110
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

497
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,612
Very small, of course.

498
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,118
I'm the king of the world!

499
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,537
[whooping]

500
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,207
[both whooping]

501
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,167
Yee-hah!

502
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,087
[howling]

503
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,251
[Bruce] She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man

504
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,794
in all history.

505
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,797
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here

506
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,924
designed her from the keel plates up.

507
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,010
I may have knocked her together,

508
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,220
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

509
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,308
He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale
and so luxurious in its appointments

510
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,602
that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

511
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,146
And here she is.

512
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,733
-Willed into solid reality.
-[Cal] Hear, hear.

513
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,444
I'll have the salmon.

514
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,949
You know I don't like that, Rose.

515
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,787
She knows.

516
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,875
Hmm. We'll both have the lamb.

517
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,377
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

518
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,047
Hmm. You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

519
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,968
You gonna cut her meat for her
too there, Cal? [chuckles]

520
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,307
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

521
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,100
Was it you, Bruce?

522
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,643
Yes, actually.

523
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,690
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability,

524
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,152
luxury, and above all, strength.

525
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,489
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

526
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,033
His ideas about the male
preoccupation with size

527
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,077
might be of particular interest to you.

528
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,996
[whispers] What's gotten into you?

529
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,414
Excuse me.

530
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,337
I do apologize.

531
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,423
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

532
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,966
Well, I may have to start minding

533
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,260
what she reads from
now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

534
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,971
Freud? Who is he? Is he a passenger?

535
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,767
It's a great big shaft,
goes right through the middle of the boat.

536
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,727
It's known as a propeller.

537
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,270
And it goes right along there
and it makes these waves.

538
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,898
Makes them spin.

539
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,903
[Fabrizio] The ship is nice, huh?

540
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,655
[man in Irish accent]
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

541
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,824
-[Fabrizio] Is English, no?
-No, it was built in Ireland.

542
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,034
Fifteen thousand Irish men
built this ship.

543
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,245
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

544
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,205
That's typical.

545
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,583
First-class dogs come down
here to take a shite.

546
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,294
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

547
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,838
Like we could forget?

548
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,714
[Jack laughs]

549
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,049
I'm Tommy Ryan.

550
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,342
-Jack Dawson.
-Hello.

551
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,219
-Fabrizio.
-Hi.

552
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,139
Do you make any money with your drawings?

553
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,733
Ah, forget it, boyo.

554
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,070
You'd as like have
angels fly out of your arse

555
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,780
as get next to the likes of her.

556
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,376
[Fabrizio laughs]

557
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,339
-Do you mind?
-I hope you're proud of yourself.

558
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:25,224
[old Rose] I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

559
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:29,187
An endless parade
of parties and cotillions,

560
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,272
yachts and polo matches.

561
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:36,319
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

562
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,948
I felt like I was standing
at a great precipice

563
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,661
with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared

564
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,581
or even noticed.

565
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,960
[panting]

566
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,086
Really, miss.

567
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,090
[Rose sobbing]

568
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,736
[running footsteps]

569
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,196
[Rose panting]

570
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,674
[ocean roaring]

571
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,305
[gasps]

572
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,022
[breathing heavily]

573
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,692
Don't do it.

574
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,069
Stay back.

575
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,572
Don't come any closer.

576
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,741
Come on.

577
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,451
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

578
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,286
No! Stay where you are.

579
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,079
I mean it.

580
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,415
I'll let go.

581
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,927
No, you won't.

582
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,473
What do you mean, no, I won't?

583
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,392
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

584
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,643
You don't know me.

585
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,771
Well, you would have done it already.

586
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,857
You're distracting me. Go away.

587
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,233
I can't.

588
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,651
I'm involved now.

589
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,781
You let go, and I'm going to have to
jump in there after you.

590
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,117
Don't be absurd.

591
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,828
-You'll be killed.
-I'm a good swimmer.

592
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,039
The fall alone will kill you.

593
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,292
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't.

594
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,044
Tell you the truth,

595
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,214
I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

596
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,597
How cold?

597
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,142
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.

598
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,733
You ever, uh, ever been to Wisconsin?

599
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,363
What?

600
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,824
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

601
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,827
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

602
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,954
I remember when I was a kid,

603
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:18,999
me and my father, we went ice fishing
out on Lake Wissota.

604
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,168
Ice fishing is, you know, where you--

605
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,753
I know what ice fishing is!

606
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,172
Sorry.

607
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,010
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

608
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,347
Anyway, I…

609
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,350
I fell through some thin ice.

610
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,185
And I'm telling you

611
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,190
water that cold, like right down there,

612
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,445
it hits you like 1,000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

613
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,198
You can't breathe. You can't think.

614
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,661
Least not about anything but the pain.

615
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,959
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

616
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,044
Like I said…

617
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,548
I don't have a choice.

618
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,180
I guess I'm kind of hoping
you'll come back over the rail

619
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,056
and get me off the hook here.

620
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,225
You're crazy.

621
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,729
That's what everybody says, but…

622
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,899
with all due respect, miss,

623
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,735
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

624
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,904
Come on.

625
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,239
Come on, give me your hand.

626
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,408
You don't want to do this.

627
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,381
Phew.

628
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,926
I'm Jack Dawson.

629
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,304
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

630
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,223
I'll have to get you to
write that one down.

631
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,474
[Rose laughs]

632
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,768
Come on.

633
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,979
[Rose screams]

634
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:05,898
[Jack grunting]

635
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,567
-[screaming]
-I got you. Come on.

636
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,277
Come on.

00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,283
Help, please!

[screaming] Help!

640
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,454
Please, help me!

641
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,289
Listen. Listen to me.

642
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,166
I've got you. I won't let go.

643
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,460
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

644
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,629
[both grunting]

645
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,590
Come on. That's right.

646
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,217
You can do it.

647
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,055
[Rose grunts]

648
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,640
I got you.

[both grunting]

650
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,647
What's all this?

651
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,110
[Rose gasping]

652
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,947
You stand back and don't move an inch!

653
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,076
Fetch the Master at Arms.

654
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,327
Care for a brandy?

655
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,080
This is completely unacceptable!

656
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,498
What made you think

657
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,083
that you could put your hands
on my fiancée?

658
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,004
-Look at me, you filth!
-Cal.

659
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,630
What do you think you were doing?

660
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,174
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

661
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,760
An accident?

662
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,178
It was.

663
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,514
Stupid, really.

664
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,684
I was leaning over and I slipped.

665
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,398
I was leaning far over to see the, uh,

666
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,610
uh, uh, the, uh…

667
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,779
-Propellers?
-Propellers, and I slipped.

668
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,950
And I would have gone overboard
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

669
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,036
And almost went over himself.

670
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,204
You wanted to see the…
She wanted to see the propellers.

671
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,666
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

672
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,960
Was that the way of it?

673
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,049
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

674
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,759
Well, the boy's a hero, then.

675
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,886
Good for you, son. Well done.

676
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,972
So, it's all's well
and back to our brandy, eh?

677
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,225
Look at you. You must be freezing.

678
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,435
Let's get you inside.

679
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,064
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

680
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,609
Of course.

681
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,654
Mr. Lovejoy, I think a 20 should do it.

682
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,741
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

683
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,078
Rose is displeased.

684
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,246
What to do?

685
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,706
I know.

686
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,921
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening

687
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,800
to regale our group with your heroic tale.

688
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,596
Sure. Count me in.

689
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,099
Good. It's settled then.

690
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,434
This should be interesting.

691
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,066
[whistles]

692
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,446
Can I, uh, bum a smoke?

693
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,581
You'll want to tie those.

694
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,544
It's interesting…

695
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,421
The young lady slipped so suddenly

696
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:19,133
and you still had time
to remove your jacket and your shoes.

697
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,474
[tune plays on music box]

698
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,642
[knocking]

699
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,692
I know you've been melancholy.

700
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,320
I don't pretend to know why.

701
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,159
I intended to save this

702
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:50,330
until the engagement gala next week

703
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,001
but I thought

704
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,669
tonight.

705
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,547
-Good gracious.
-[chuckles]

706
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,009
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

707
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,136
-Is it a--
-Diamond. Yes. [laughs]

708
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,516
Fifty-six carats to be exact.

709
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,188
It was worn by Louis XVI.

710
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,608
And they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer."

711
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,151
-"The Heart of the Ocean."
-"The Heart of the Ocean."

712
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,235
Yes. [laughs]

713
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,743
It's overwhelming.

714
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,995
Well, it's for royalty.

715
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,373
We are royalty, Rose.

716
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,713
You know, there's nothing
I couldn't give you.

717
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,549
There's nothing I'd deny you

718
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,385
if you would not deny me.

719
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,600
Open your heart to me, Rose.

720
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:11,286
[Jack] Well, I've been on my own
since I was 15, since my folks died.

721
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,207
And I had no brothers
or sisters or close kin

722
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,792
in that part of the country,

723
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,795
so I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

724
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,506
You could just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

725
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,882
[both chuckle]

726
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:29,471
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck

727
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,431
and chewed over
how great the weather's been

728
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,475
and how I grew up,

729
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,436
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

730
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,440
-[sighs] Mr. Dawson, I--
-Jack.

731
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,484
Jack.

732
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,530
I want to thank you for what you did.

733
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:51,535
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

734
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,161
You're welcome.

735
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,454
Look.

736
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,375
I know what you must be thinking.

737
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,085
Poor little rich girl.

738
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,546
What does she know about misery?

739
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,630
No.

740
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,050
No, that's not what I was thinking.

741
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,468
What I was thinking was

742
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,805
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

743
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,559
Well I…

744
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:21,898
It was everything. It was my whole world
and all the people in it.

745
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,694
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead, and me,

746
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,738
powerless to stop it.

747
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,032
God, look at that thing.

748
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,284
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

749
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,747
Five hundred invitations have gone out.

750
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,708
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

751
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:43,795
And all the while, I feel I'm standing
in the middle of a crowded room,

752
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,881
screaming at the top of my lungs,

753
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,424
and no one even looks up.

754
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,010
Do you love him?

755
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,388
-Pardon me?
-Do you love him?

756
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,391
You're being very rude.

757
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,060
You shouldn't be asking me this.

758
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,687
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

759
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,023
[scoffs]

760
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,317
This is not a suitable conversation.

761
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,860
Why can't you just answer the question?

762
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,403
[laughs]

763
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,323
This is absurd.

764
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,158
You don't know me and I don't know you,

765
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,619
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

766
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:18,121
You are rude and uncouth and presumptuous

767
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,165
and I am leaving now,

768
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:23,126
Jack. Mr. Dawson. It's been a pleasure.

769
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,379
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

770
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,422
And you've insulted me.

771
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,132
Well, you deserved it.

772
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,384
-Right.
-Right.

773
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,138
I thought you were leaving.

774
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,556
I am.

775
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,227
You are so annoying.

776
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,395
[laughs]

777
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,939
Wait. I don't have to leave.

778
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,067
This is my part of the ship. You leave.

779
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,404
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

780
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,490
[Rose laughs]

781
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,077
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

782
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,580
So, what are you, an artist or something?

783
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,291
Well…

784
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,586
These are rather good.

785
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,093
They're, uh… They're very good, actually.

786
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,352
Jack, this is exquisite work.

787
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,105
Ah, they didn't think too
much of them in old Paris.

788
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,606
Paris?

789
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,569
You do get around for a p…

790
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,449
Well, uh, a person of limited means.

791
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,993
Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

792
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,290
Well, well, well.

793
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,379
And these were drawn from life?

794
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,968
Well, that's one of
the good things about Paris.

795
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,887
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

796
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,014
[Rose laughs]

797
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,853
You liked this woman.

798
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,647
You used her several times.

799
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,816
Well…

800
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,486
She had beautiful hands, you see?

801
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,199
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

802
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,076
No, no, no. Just with her hands.

803
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,829
She was a one-legged prostitute.

804
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:24,956
See?

805
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,502
Oh.

806
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,670
[both laugh]

807
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,632
She had a good sense of humor, though.

808
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,177
Oh, and this lady…

809
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:43,683
She used to sit at this bar every night
wearing every piece of jewelry she owned,

810
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,269
just waiting for her long, lost love.

811
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,356
We called her Madame Bijoux.

812
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,691
See how her clothes are all moth eaten?

813
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,446
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

814
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,114
You do.

815
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,866
You see people.

816
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,535
I see you.

817
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,288
And?

818
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,375
You wouldn't have jumped.

819
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:16,466
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

820
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,468
Rose has already done that.

821
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,638
Look, here comes that vulgar Brown woman.

822
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,391
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

823
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,019
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

824
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,729
We're awfully sorry, you missed it.

825
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,316
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

826
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,736
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

827
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,241
Countess.

828
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,579
So, you've not yet lit
the last four boilers?

829
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,956
No, I don't see the need.

830
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,666
We are making excellent time.

831
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,086
The press knows the size of Titanic.

832
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,463
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

833
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,757
We must give them something new to print.

834
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:04,014
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

835
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:08,310
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines

836
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,937
until they've been properly run in.

837
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,523
Of course I'm just a passenger.

838
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,026
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

839
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,279
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing

840
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,072
if we were to get
into New York on Tuesday night

841
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,783
and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

842
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,703
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

843
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,625
Good man.

844
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,211
Well, after that,
I worked on a squid boat in Monterey,

845
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,882
then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica

846
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,384
and started doing portraits there
for ten cents apiece.

847
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,763
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

848
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,974
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

849
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,562
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier,

850
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,690
even if we only ever just talk about it.

851
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,400
No, we'll do it.

852
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,777
We'll drink cheap beer.

853
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,112
We'll ride on the roller-coaster
till we throw up.

854
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,197
[laughs]

855
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,950
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

856
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,452
Now, but you'll have to do it
like a real cowboy.

857
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,954
None of that sidesaddle stuff.

858
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,165
You mean one leg on each side?

859
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,333
Yeah.

860
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,335
Can you show me?

861
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,337
Sure, if you like.

862
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,465
Teach me to ride like a man.

863
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,175
[in Western American accent]
And chew tobacco like a man.

864
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,054
[in Western American accent]
And spit like a man.

865
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,889
What, they didn't teach you
that in finishing school?

866
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:28,974
No. [laughs]

867
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,559
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

868
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,687
-What?
-I'll show you how. Come on.

869
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,356
-Jack, no! Jack, no!
-Oh, come on! Come on.

870
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,941
-Wait, Jack!
-Come on.

871
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,317
-No, Jack…
-Come on!

872
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,402
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

873
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,486
Watch closely.

874
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,571
[hawking phlegm]

875
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,699
That's disgusting!

876
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,992
All right, your turn.

877
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,284
[Rose sniffs]

878
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,328
That was pitiful.

879
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,163
Come on, you really gotta hawk
it back, you know.

880
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,957
Get some leverage to it. Use your arms.

881
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,041
[snorts] Arc your neck.

882
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,751
-[hawking]
-[Rose clears throat]

883
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:57,877
Now, you see the range on that thing?

884
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,962
Mm-hmm.

885
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,672
[Jack] Okay, go.

886
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,385
Oh, that was better.

887
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,594
-You gotta work on it.
-Really?

888
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,679
Really try to hawk it up

889
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,305
and get some body to it,
you know? You gotta…

890
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,807
[snorts]

891
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,604
[Jack gulps]

892
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,356
Mother.

893
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,572
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

894
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,616
Charmed, I'm sure.

895
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,416
[old Rose] The others
were gracious and curious

896
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,668
about the man who'd saved my life.

897
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,839
But my mother looked at him
like an insect.

898
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:47,427
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

899
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,889
Well, Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

900
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,517
[fanfare playing]

901
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,728
Why do they always insist
on announcing dinner

902
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,229
like a damn cavalry charge?

903
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,397
[laughs]

904
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,732
Shall we go dress, Mother?

905
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,276
See you at dinner, Jack.

906
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:06,946
Uh, son?

907
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,531
Son!

908
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,534
Do you have the slightest comprehension
what you're doing?

909
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,828
Not really.

910
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,789
Well, you're about to go
into the snake pit.

911
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,376
What are you planning to wear?

912
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,964
[scoffs] I figured. Come on.

913
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,511
I was right.

914
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,680
You and my son
are just about the same size.

915
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,890
Pretty close.

916
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,228
[whistles]

917
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,979
You shine up like a new penny.

918
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,898
[laughs]

919
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,535
Good evening, sir.

920

[orchestra plays "The Blue Danube"]

921
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,178
Hello.

922
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,476
[Cal] Do you know that there
are several thousand tons

923
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,352
of Hockley steel in this very ship?

924
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,437
[Ruth] Which part?

925
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,688
[Cal] All the right ones, of course.

926
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,816
Then we'll know who to hold accountable
if there's a problem. Where's my daughter?

927
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,901
Oh, she'll be along.

928
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,195
There is the Countess.

929
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,405
-Hello, my dear.
-Good evening, Cal.

930
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,698
It's so good to see you.

931
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,186
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

932
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,687
[both laugh]

933
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,783
[Ruth] I'll see you at dinner.

934
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,954
Darling, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

935
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,081
Dawson.

936
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,959
[laughs] Well, that's amazing.

937
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,919
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

938
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,338
Almost.

939
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,548
That's extraordinary.

940
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,436
[Lucile] My dear,
it's delightful to see you.

[Cal] Cosmo.

942
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,856
What a remarkable voyage this is.
It's mad, isn't it?

943
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,066
How lovely.

944
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,194
There's the Countess of Rothes.

945
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,575
And that's John Jacob Astor,

946
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,202
the richest man on the ship.

947
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:44,664
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

948
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,584
See how she's trying to hide it.

949
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,335
-Quite the scandal.
-Hmm.

950
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,506
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

951
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,467
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

952
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:00,805
And over here we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

among her many talents.

Congratulations, Hockley. She's splendid.

Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?

961
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,704
Remember, they love money
so just pretend like you own a gold mine,

962
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:25,913
and you're in the club.

963
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,709
Hey, Astor.

964
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,170
Well, hello, Molly.

965
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:33,963
Nice to see you.

966
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,633
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you
to meet Jack Dawson.

967
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:37,925
-How do you do?
-Pleasure.

968
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,427
Hello, Jack.

969
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,763
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

970
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,266
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

971
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,434
Oh, yes.

972
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,398
[old Rose] He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

973
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,943
They assumed he was one of them.

974
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:59,030
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

975
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,326
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

976
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:08,081
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

977
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,793
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

978
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,503
I hear they're quite good on this ship.

979
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,257
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.

980
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,926
[laughter]

981
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,513
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

982
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,307
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

983
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:29,936
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

984
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,979
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

985
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,441
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

986
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,111
Not to impugn your work, sir.

987
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,488
[Rose clears throat]

988
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,572
[mouths]

989
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,953
[Ismay] She may be mine on paper,
in the eyes of God,

990
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,788
she belongs to Thomas Adlers.

991
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,914
Are these all for me?

992
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,874
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

993
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,335
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

994
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,503
-Indeed.
-Your ship

995
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,213
is a wonder, Mr. Andrews, truly.

996
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,631
Thank you, Rose.

997
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,302
How do you take your caviar, sir?

998
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,889
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

999
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,686
And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

1000
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,981
Well, right now,
my address is the RMS Titanic.

1001
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,066
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

1002
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,485
And how is it you have means to travel?

1003
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,488
I work my way from place to place.

1004
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,907
You know, tramp steamers and such.

1005
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,035
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

1006
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,871
A very lucky hand.

1007
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,207
All life is a game of luck.

1008
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,670
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
Right, Dawson?

1009
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,755
Mm.

1010
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,300
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing, do you?

1011
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,513
Well, yes, ma'am, I do.

1012
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:51,392
I mean, I've got everything
I need right here with me.

1013
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:54,312
Got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

1014
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,064
I mean, I love waking up in the morning,

1015
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,193
not knowing what's gonna happen
or who I'm gonna meet.

1016
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,487
Where I'm gonna wind up.

1017
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,864
Just the other night
I was sleeping under a bridge,

1018
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,617
and now, here I am,
on the grandest ship in the world,

1019
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,827
having champagne with you fine people.

1020
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:10,912
I'll take some of that.

1021
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,707
I figure life's a gift,
and I don't intend on wasting it.

1022
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,586
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

1023
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,880
You learn to take life as it comes at you.

1024
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,131
Oh, here you go, Cal.

1025
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,385
To make each day count.

1026
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,179
Well said, Jack.

1027
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,555
Hear, hear.

1028
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:31,766
To making it count.

1029
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,644
[all] To making it count.

1030
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,813
Bravo.

1031
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,194
[Molly laughing]

1032
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:46,906
[Molly] But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

1033
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,741
[laughter]

1034
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,993
So, he comes home
drunk as a pig celebrating

1035
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,286
and he lights a fire.

1036
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,913
[laughter]

1037
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,457
[Col. Gracie] Bravo.

1038
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,668
Next it'll be brandies
in the smoking room.

1039
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,839
Well, join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

1040
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,924
-[Ismay] What a good idea!
-[Cal] Yes.

1041
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,467
Now they'll retreat into a cloud of smoke

1042
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,220
and congratulate each other
on being masters of the universe.

1043
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,472
Ladies, thank you
for the pleasure of your company.

1044
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,225
Rose, may I escort you back to the cabin?

1045
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,393
No, I'll stay here.

1046
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,144
Here you go, Molly.

1047
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,856
[Col. Archibald] Joining us, Dawson?

1048
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:23,526
Well, you don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you? [chuckles]

1049
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,152
No, thanks. I've gotta be heading back.

1050
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,237
[Col. Archibald] Ah.

1051
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,321
Probably best.

1052
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,407
It'll be all business and politics,
that sort of thing.

1053
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,575
Wouldn't interest you.

1054
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,579
But, Dawson, good of you to come.

1055
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,627
Jack, must you go?

1056
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,088
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

1057
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,423
[laughs]

1058
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,467
Good night, Rose.

So, you wanna go to a real party?

Let's go!

I'm gonna dance with her now, all right?

1078
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,580
Come on.

1079
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,165
-What?
-Come on.

1080

-Come with me.
-What? Jack. Jack, wait.

1081
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,672
I can't do this.

1082
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,132
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer.

1083
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:52,842
Like this.

You're still my best girl, Cora.

01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,560
I don't know the steps.

1087
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,769
Neither do I. Just go with it.

Beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

That's how my lawyers will argue.

1109

That's what Rockefeller said,

Coffee, sir?

to me last night.

01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,406
Your exertions below decks
were no doubt exhausting.

1137
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,537
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

1138
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,165
You will never behave
like that again, Rose.

1139
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,291
Do you understand?

1140
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,381
I'm not a foreman in one of your mills
that you can command.

1141
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:04,093
I'm your fiancée.

1142
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:06,595
[quietly] My fiancée.

1143
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,597
[shouting] My fiancée!

1144
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,140
Yes, you are! And my wife!

1145
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,727
My wife in practice, if not yet by law,

1146
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,562
so you will honor me!

1147
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,607
You will honor me the way a wife
is required to honor a husband.

1148
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,110
Because I will not be made out
a fool, Rose.

1149
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,570
Is this in any way unclear?

1150
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,491
-No.
-Good.

1151
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,201
Excuse me.

1152
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,498
[Rose gasping]

1153
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,708
Oh, Miss Rose.

1154
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,711
[panting] We had a little accident.

1155
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,004
It's all right, Miss Rose. It's all right.

1156
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:42,172
-I'm sorry, Trudy.
-It's all right.

1157
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,382
Let me help you.

1158
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,675
It's all right, miss.

1159
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:49,471
[sobs]

1160
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,225
It's all right, miss.

1161
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,857
Tea, Trudy.

1162
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:01,734
Yes, ma'am.

1163
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:20,169
You're not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

1164
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,465
Rose, I forbid it.

1165
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,800
Oh, stop it, Mother.

1166
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,177
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

1167
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,012
This is not a game.

1168
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:34,683
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

1169
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,185
Of course, I know it's gone.

1170
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,812
You remind me every day.

1171
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,107
Your father left us nothing

1172
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,361
but a legacy of bad debts
hidden by a good name.

1173
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,197
That name is the only card
we have to play.

1174
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,032
I don't understand you.

1175
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,743
It is a fine match with Hockley.

1176
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:54,536
It will ensure our survival.

1177
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,290
How can you put this on my shoulders?

1178
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,292
Why are you being so selfish?

1179
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,585
I'm being selfish?

1180
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,050
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

1181
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:11,720
Is that what you want?

1182
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,267
To see our fine things sold at auction?

1183
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,480
Our memories scattered to the winds?

1184
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:33,659
[sighs] It's so unfair.

1185
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,829
Of course it's unfair.

1186
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:39,790
We're women.

1187
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,211
Our choices are never easy.

1188

Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning.

[Capt. Smith] Thank you, Sparks.

1226

Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

1227
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,063
In fact, we're speeding up.

1228

I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

[grunting]

1230
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:17,406

like I showed you. That's right.

01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:18,490
Okay, now, let it go.

-Quite nice.

That's excellent, son.

1234
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:34,214
[Rose] Mr. Andrews, forgive me…

1235
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,550
I did the sum in my head.

1236
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:40,846
And with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned,

1237
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,598
forgive me, but it seems that

1238
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:44,391
there are not enough for everyone aboard.

1239
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,603
About half, actually.

1240
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,229
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

1241
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,190
In fact, I put in these new type davits

1242
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,110
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

1243
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:57,779
But it was thought, by some,

1244
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,531
that the deck would look too cluttered.

1245
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,117
So, I was overruled.

1246
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,412
Waste of deck space as it is
on an unsinkable ship.

1247
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:09,374
Sleep soundly, young Rose.
I have built you a good ship.

1248
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,792
Strong and true.

1249
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,711
She's all the lifeboat you need.

1250
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:13,920
Just keep heading aft.

1251
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,297
The next stop will be the engine room.

1252
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,299
Come on.

1253
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,179
Jack.

1254
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:23,847
This is impossible.

1255
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:26,850
-I can't see you.
-I need to talk to you.

1256
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:28,310
No, Jack. No.

1257
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:32,230
Jack, I'm engaged.

1258

I love Cal.

1260

Rose, you're no picnic.

1261
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:46,453
All right? You're a spoiled
little brat even.

1262
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:47,996
But under that,

1263
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,291
you're the most amazingly astounding,

woman that I've ever known.

-Jack, I…

No, let me try and get this out. You're…

I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

I've got ten bucks in my pocket,

1269
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:10,018
I have nothing to offer you,
and I know that.

1270
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,646
I understand.

1271
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:14,648
But I'm too involved now.

without knowing you'll be all right.

That's all that I want.

Well, I'm fine.

1276
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:28,745
I'll be fine. Really.

1277
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,123
Really?

1278
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,376
I don't think so.

1279
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,213
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1280
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:39,881
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

1281
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,967
Maybe not right away
because you're strong, but…

1282
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:47,723
sooner or later,
that fire that I love about you, Rose,

1283
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,766
that fire is gonna burn out.

1284
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,773
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1285
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,861
You're right.

1286
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,155
Only you can do that.

1287
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:12,122
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

with the stationers.

1290
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,432
Well, of course, the invitations
had to be sent back twice.

01:34:47,139 --> 01:34:48,432
Cold. It's bloody cold.

1456
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:51,852
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1457
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:54,897
Bollocks!

1458
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:56,482
Well, I can, all right.

1459
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:59,568
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1460
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,070
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1461
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:04,824
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1462
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,553
[Jack breathing heavily]

1463
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:38,107
You're trembling.

1464
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:43,112
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

1465
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:05,926
They ran down there.

1466
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,011
Right.

1467
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:17,771
[Lovejoy] Anything missing?

1468
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:44,381
I've got a better idea.

[both laughing]

1472
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:10,491
Did you see those guys' faces?

1473
01:37:11,742 --> 01:37:13,160
Did you see them?

1474
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,085
When the ship docks…

1475
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:24,797
I'm getting off with you.

1476
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:27,132
This is crazy.

1477
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:29,552
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1478
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,180
That's why I trust it.

1479
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:44,441
Oh, yes. Here, look at this.

1480
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:47,820
Look at that, would ya?

1481
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:49,572
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1482
01:37:50,072 --> 01:37:51,615
Well, if that's what it takes
for us to get warm,

1483
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:54,326
I'd rather not, if it's all
the same to you, all right?

1484
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:55,869

[Fleet] Is there anyone there?

1490
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:20,978
Yes. What do you see?

1491
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:22,688
Iceberg right ahead.

1492
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:23,731
Thank you.

1493
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:27,443

Is it hard over?

It is. Yes, sir. Hard over.

What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

An iceberg, sir.

1552
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:48,912
I put her hard to starboard

1553
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,498
and ran the engines full astern,
but it was too close.

I tried to port around it but she hit and…

[Capt. Smith] Close the watertight doors.

I shouldn't worry, madam.

there's talk of an iceberg.

Can you shore up?

Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1594

Have you seen the damage in the mail hold?

1595

No, she's already under water.

This is bad.

1597

Yes, it has.

1608
01:45:14,933 --> 01:45:18,353
Indeed. Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1609

Now that one is back,

I have a pretty good idea
where to find the other.

We are in the middle of an emergency.
What's going on?

-Is this it?
-That's it.

1617
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:34,828
This is horseshit!

1618
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:37,706
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1619
01:45:37,789 --> 01:45:39,666
-He couldn't have.
-[Cal] Of course, he could.

1620
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,501
-It's easy enough for a professional.
-Come on.

1621
01:45:41,585 --> 01:45:44,463
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1622
01:45:44,546 --> 01:45:47,174
Perhaps he did it while you were
putting your clothes back on, dear.

1623
01:45:48,925 --> 01:45:51,094
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1624
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:52,262
Shut up.

1625
01:45:52,345 --> 01:45:53,555
[Lovejoy] It isn't even
your pocket, is it, son?

1626
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:55,932
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1627
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,521
That was reported stolen today.

1628
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:02,689
No, I just borrowed it.

1629
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:04,608
-I was going to return it.
-[Cal] Oh, an honest thief.

1630
01:46:04,691 --> 01:46:06,443
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1631
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:08,695
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1632
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:10,530
Don't you believe them, Rose.

1633
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:11,615
You know it. You know I didn't do it.

1634
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:12,699
Come on, son, let's go. Come on, let's go.

1635
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:13,867
Rose, you know I didn't do it, Rose!

1636
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:14,951
-Don't make a fuss.
-Rose!

1637
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:16,036
Come on. There's a good lad.

1638
01:46:16,119 --> 01:46:18,497
Come on, son. There's a good lad. Come on.

1639
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:20,957
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1640
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,377
[Ismay] This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1641
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:31,968
Water 14 feet above the keel
in ten minutes,

1642
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:35,597
in the forepeak, in all three holds
and in boiler room six.

1643
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:36,890
That's right, sir.

1644
01:46:36,973 --> 01:46:38,683
When can we get underway, damn it?

1645
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:40,018
That's five compartments.

1646
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:45,357
She can stay afloat with
the first four compartments breached,

1647
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,441
but not five.

1648
01:46:47,275 --> 01:46:48,777
Not five.

1649
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,320
As she goes down by the head,

1650
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:52,906
the water will spill over
the tops of the bulkheads

1651
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:55,325
at E deck from one to the next.

1652
01:46:55,408 --> 01:46:57,619
Back and back. There's no stopping it.

1653
01:46:58,829 --> 01:47:00,038
The pumps, if we opened the doors--

1654
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:03,250
The pumps buy you time. But minutes only.

1655
01:47:04,042 --> 01:47:06,169
From this moment, no matter what we do,

1656
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:08,797
Titanic will founder.

1657
01:47:11,716 --> 01:47:13,051
But this ship can't sink.

1658
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:15,262
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can.

1659
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:17,514
And she will.

1660
01:47:18,473 --> 01:47:19,933
It is a mathematical certainty.

1661
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,064
How much time?

1662
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:36,199
An hour. Two at most.

1663
01:47:42,497 --> 01:47:43,915
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1664
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:47,085
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1665
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:57,387
Well, I believe you may
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1666
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:06,313
[sighs]

1667
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:16,990
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1668
01:48:18,533 --> 01:48:19,743
You look at me when I'm talking to you!

1669
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:20,869
[knocking]

1670
01:48:20,952 --> 01:48:23,246
-[steward Barnes] Mr. Hockley?
-Not now, we're busy.

1671
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:26,082
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts

1672
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:27,959
-and come up to the boat deck.
-I said, not now.

1673
01:48:28,043 --> 01:48:30,003
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley,

1674
01:48:30,086 --> 01:48:31,254
but it's Captain's orders.

1675
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:33,298
Now, please, dress warmly.

1676
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:34,925
It's quite cold out tonight.

1677
01:48:36,259 --> 01:48:39,137
Now may I suggest, top coats and hats.

1678
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:40,388
This is ridiculous.

1679
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,225
Not to worry, miss.

1680
01:48:43,308 --> 01:48:45,477
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1681
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,437
Everybody up, lifebelts on!

1682
01:48:49,522 --> 01:48:50,899
What? What's he on about?

1683
01:48:51,608 --> 01:48:52,651
Everybody up, put your lifebelts on.

1684
01:48:52,734 --> 01:48:53,860
What's the ruckus?

1685
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:55,237
Just put your lifebelts on.

1686
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,990
CQD? Sir?

1687
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:05,038
That's right. CQD. The distress call.
That's our position.

1688
01:49:09,292 --> 01:49:10,377
[sighs]

1689
01:49:10,835 --> 01:49:13,213
Tell whoever responds
that we're going down by the head

1690
01:49:13,296 --> 01:49:14,923
and need immediate assistance.

1691
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:25,767
Blimey.

1692
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:35,819
[man 1] Hold her underway.

1693
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:38,780
[Wilde] Keep lowering. Keep lowering.

1694
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,199
-Aye, aye, sir.
-[Wilde] Pull.

1695
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:42,492
[crewman] Easy now!

1696
01:49:43,785 --> 01:49:47,289
Steady! Make it taut! And winch it out!

1697
01:49:51,501 --> 01:49:55,171
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1698
01:49:56,047 --> 01:49:57,382
[Lightoller] Release those ties!

1699
01:49:57,465 --> 01:49:58,466
Roll back that cover!

1700
01:49:58,550 --> 01:49:59,551
Roll back that cover smartly, now!

1701
01:49:59,634 --> 01:50:00,760
[Andrews] Mr. Wilde.

1702
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:01,845
[Wilde] Release the boat from…

1703
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:03,096
Mr. Wilde. Where are the passengers?

1704
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:04,347
They've all gone back inside.

1705
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:06,474
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1706
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:07,559
You there. [whistle blows]

1707
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:11,021
Get down here and help with these lines!

1708
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:13,356
[lively music playing]

1709
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:19,571
[chatter]

1710
01:50:25,243 --> 01:50:26,619
Care for a drink, sir?

1711
01:50:28,913 --> 01:50:30,373
-Please put your lifebelt on.
-Hey, sonny.

1712
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:31,458
-Miss.
-What's doing?

1713
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:34,044
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1714
01:50:34,669 --> 01:50:36,463
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go and find out.

1715
01:50:36,546 --> 01:50:37,672
Make sure the straps are secure.

1716
01:50:37,756 --> 01:50:40,133
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1717
01:50:40,216 --> 01:50:42,844
It's just the goddamned English
doing everything by the book.

1718
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:45,555
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1719
01:50:46,431 --> 01:50:48,683
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1720
01:50:48,808 --> 01:50:50,727
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1721
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:51,811
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1722
01:50:57,692 --> 01:50:58,818
[steward] Will you put
your lifebelt on, please?

1723
01:50:59,527 --> 01:51:01,821
[woman] I don't understand
why didn't they know?

1724
01:51:01,905 --> 01:51:02,989
Mr. Andrews?

1725
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:07,827
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1726
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:10,413
Please tell me the truth.

1727
01:51:10,872 --> 01:51:12,665
[steward] Yes, madam.
Please, put it on immediately.

1728
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,548
The ship will sink.

1729
01:51:22,467 --> 01:51:24,177
-You're certain?
-Yes.

1730
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:25,553
In an hour or so.

1731
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:28,390
All of this will be at
the bottom of the Atlantic.

1732
01:51:30,642 --> 01:51:31,726
What?

1733
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,895
Please, tell only who you must.

1734
01:51:33,978 --> 01:51:36,356
I don't want to be responsible
for a panic.

1735
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:38,775
And get to a boat, quickly. Don't wait.

1736
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,320
You remember what I told you
about the boats?

1737
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:46,825
Yes.

1738
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:50,161
I understand.

1739
01:51:53,581 --> 01:51:54,666
[woman] Have I put this thing on right?

1740
01:51:54,749 --> 01:51:56,000
[steward] Yes, madam.
Please put it on immediately.

1741
01:51:58,128 --> 01:51:59,129
Over here, son.

1742
01:52:00,713 --> 01:52:02,966
Sir, they need you up in
the Second-Class Purser's office.

1743
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:04,592
-There's a big mob up there.
-Go on.

1744
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:05,844
I'll keep an eye on him.

1745
01:52:06,636 --> 01:52:08,138
Aye. Right.

1746
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:23,111
[Bride] Sir.

1747
01:52:23,236 --> 01:52:25,613
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.

1748
01:52:25,697 --> 01:52:27,073
Full steam for them, sir.

1749
01:52:28,992 --> 01:52:30,743
She's the only one who's responded?

1750
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,287
The only one close, sir.

1751
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:34,330
Says they can be here in four hours.

1752
01:52:35,165 --> 01:52:36,291
Four hours?

1753
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:42,922
Thank you, Bride.

1754
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,304
My God.

1755
01:52:49,929 --> 01:52:51,681
[Lightoller] I really
don't think so, Mr. Wilde.

1756
01:52:51,764 --> 01:52:53,224
Secure the falls aft.

1757
01:52:57,353 --> 01:52:58,354
Sir?

1758
01:52:58,771 --> 01:53:00,899
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1759
01:53:02,317 --> 01:53:05,528
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1760
01:53:07,947 --> 01:53:08,990
[quietly] Yes.

1761
01:53:09,532 --> 01:53:10,700
Sir?

1762
01:53:13,328 --> 01:53:16,206
Women and children first. Yes.

1763
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:19,334
Yes, sir.

1764
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:24,923
[Lightoller] Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

1765
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:28,009
Step this way, please! That's right!

1766
01:53:28,092 --> 01:53:30,553
Come towards me! Thank you!

1767
01:53:32,013 --> 01:53:33,306
Good.

1768
01:53:33,389 --> 01:53:37,435
For the time being,
I shall require only women and children.

1769
01:53:37,602 --> 01:53:38,603
Gentlemen, please stay where you are.

1770
01:53:38,686 --> 01:53:39,729
[Hartley] Right here.

1771
01:53:39,854 --> 01:53:41,439
All right, boys. Like the captain said.

1772
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:43,149
Nice and cheery so there's no panic.

1773
01:53:43,233 --> 01:53:44,400
Gentlemen please stay
exactly where you are.

1774
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:45,485
"Wedding Dance."

1775
01:53:46,736 --> 01:53:48,571
[lively music playing]

1776
01:53:54,577 --> 01:53:57,288
Lifebelts on. Here, put your lifebelts on.

1777
01:53:57,372 --> 01:54:00,250
Put your lifebelts on.
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1778
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:02,502
Here, come on. Put your lifebelt on.

1779
01:54:02,585 --> 01:54:04,170
Turn that around.

1780
01:54:05,463 --> 01:54:08,508
[steward 2] Please, ladies and gentlemen,
there isn't any reason to panic.

1781
01:54:08,591 --> 01:54:11,177
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet.

1782
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:13,221
Please, stay calm.

1783
01:54:13,304 --> 01:54:16,849
Look, please, make sure, everybody,
you've got your lifebelts on.

1784
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,393
And gentlemen,
allow the women and children

1785
01:54:18,476 --> 01:54:19,477
through to the front.

1786
01:54:19,978 --> 01:54:22,438
-What are we doing, Mommy?
-We're just waiting, dear.

1787
01:54:22,522 --> 01:54:24,899
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats,

1788
01:54:24,983 --> 01:54:26,025
they'll be starting with us,

1789
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:27,485
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1790
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:28,903
[steward 1] Everybody, not just quite yet.

1791
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:31,823
[steward 2] Don't push on the gates.
You won't get out any faster.

1792
01:54:31,906 --> 01:54:33,074
Go and get some help.

1793
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:37,370
Lower it away.
Left and right together. Steady.

1794
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:40,582
Both sides together. Steady.

1795
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:42,917
Steady.

1796
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:44,002
Steady.

1797
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:45,211
[crewman] All right, steady as she goes.

1798
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:47,005
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1799
01:54:48,423 --> 01:54:50,049
Hold the left side!

1800
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:52,635
Right side only! Right side only!

1801
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,388
Right side only! Hold the left side!

1802
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:58,266
Right side down! Lower away together!

1803
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:02,061
Steady, lads!

1804
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:07,942
-[flare explodes]
-[all gasp]

1805
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:25,501
[Wilde] I need two men each
to handle the fore and aft port. Now.

1806
01:55:49,484 --> 01:55:52,779
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1807
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:58,952
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1808
01:56:02,163 --> 01:56:04,832
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1809
01:56:07,877 --> 01:56:09,879
[panting]

1810
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,881
[Lightoller] Step aboard, sir.

1811
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:13,341
Come on, sister. You heard
the man. Into the boat.

1812
01:56:13,424 --> 01:56:14,550
[Lightoller] These gentlemen
will take care of you.

1813
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:16,511
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1814
01:56:16,594 --> 01:56:18,096
[Hichens] Only women at this time, sir.

1815
01:56:18,179 --> 01:56:19,222
[Lightoller] Thank you.

1816
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:20,390
This man here will take care of you.

1817
01:56:21,432 --> 01:56:23,977
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1818
01:56:25,645 --> 01:56:27,855
I hope they're not too crowded.

1819
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:32,026
Oh, Mother. Shut up!

1820
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:33,653
Don't you understand?

1821
01:56:33,736 --> 01:56:35,989
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1822
01:56:36,072 --> 01:56:37,281
Not enough by half.

1823
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:39,993
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1824
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:41,953
Not the better half.

1825
01:56:44,455 --> 01:56:45,999
Come on, Ruth. Get in the boat.

1826
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:47,417
First-class seats are right up here.

1827
01:56:49,335 --> 01:56:51,087
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1828
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:53,047
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1829
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:54,549
[Lightoller] Women and children

1830

-towards the front beam.
-[flare exploding]

1831
01:56:56,634 --> 01:56:58,761
You unimaginable bastard.

1832
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:02,557
[Molly] Come on, Rose, darlin'.
There's plenty of room for you.

1833
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:03,683
[Lightoller] Right this way, miss.

1834
01:57:03,766 --> 01:57:04,767
Come on, Rose.

1835
01:57:05,643 --> 01:57:06,728
You're next, darlin'.

1836
01:57:07,645 --> 01:57:08,730
Come into the boat, Rose.

1837
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,025
[Cal] Come.

1838
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:13,109
Rose!

1839
01:57:14,569 --> 01:57:15,653
Get into the boat.

1840
01:57:16,612 --> 01:57:17,613
Rose.

1841
01:57:19,323 --> 01:57:20,533
Goodbye, Mother.

1842
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:23,995
Rose?

1843
01:57:24,078 --> 01:57:25,246
Rose, come back here right now!

1844
01:57:25,329 --> 01:57:27,040
Where are you going?

1845
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:28,249
What, to him?

1846
01:57:28,332 --> 01:57:30,460
What? To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1847
01:57:30,543 --> 01:57:31,544
[Ruth] No, wait!

1848
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:33,921
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1849
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:37,759
-No! No!
-[grunting]

1850
01:57:39,343 --> 01:57:40,344
I said, no!

1851
01:57:42,472 --> 01:57:44,307
[Ruth] Rose! Please, stop!

1852
01:57:45,475 --> 01:57:47,852
-[Lightoller] And lower away!
-No, Rose!

1853
01:57:47,935 --> 01:57:49,437
-[Lightoller] And together.
-No, wait!

1854
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,105
Lower away!

1855
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:53,149
-Rose!
-[Lightoller] Lower together!

1856
01:57:53,566 --> 01:57:54,567
Pull the left side in!

1857
01:57:58,821 --> 01:57:59,822
Help!

1858
01:58:00,656 --> 01:58:02,742
Can anybody hear me?

1859
01:58:02,825 --> 01:58:03,868
[clanging]

1860
01:58:03,993 --> 01:58:05,787
Hello, help me!

1861
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:10,208
[in distance] Help me! Can you hear me?

1862
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:12,627
Can anybody hear me?

1863
01:58:12,794 --> 01:58:14,462
Somebody help me!

1864
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,381
[Rose] Mr. Andrews!

1865
01:58:17,465 --> 01:58:19,050
[panting]

1866
01:58:21,177 --> 01:58:22,261
Steward, check the starboard corridor.

1867
01:58:22,345 --> 01:58:23,429
Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1868
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:26,099
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt,
get to the boat deck immediately.

1869
01:58:26,724 --> 01:58:28,309
Lucy, for God's sake,
put on your lifebelt.

1870
01:58:28,392 --> 01:58:29,685
-Set a good example.
-Yes, sir.

1871
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:32,605
-Anyone in here?
-Mr. Andrews!

1872
01:58:32,688 --> 01:58:34,816
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1873
01:58:34,899 --> 01:58:37,068
Where would the Master-at-Arms
take someone under arrest?

1874
01:58:37,151 --> 01:58:39,278
What? You have to
get to a boat right away.

1875
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:42,698
No! I'm doing this
with or without your help, sir.

1876
01:58:42,782 --> 01:58:44,408
But without will take longer.

1877
01:58:46,202 --> 01:58:48,079
Take the elevator to the very bottom,

1878
01:58:48,162 --> 01:58:50,289
go to the left.
Down the crewman's passage.

1879
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:52,959
Then go right and left again
at the stairs,

1880
01:58:53,042 --> 01:58:54,585
you'll come to a long corridor.

1881
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:56,337
[sighs]

1882
01:58:59,465 --> 01:59:00,591

01:59:13,062 --> 01:59:14,230
Excuse me. Thank you.

-[woman] I do not care what you think.
-The lifts are…

1888
01:59:18,609 --> 01:59:20,945
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.

1889
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:24,907
I'm through being polite, God damn it!

1890
01:59:24,991 --> 01:59:26,284
Now take me down!

1891

E deck.

1892
01:59:32,832 --> 01:59:33,833
Come on!

No, no!

Miss!

Come back! I'm going back up!
I'm going back up!

Jack! Jack! I'm sorry!

1916
02:01:04,298 --> 02:01:06,175
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

1917
02:01:07,718 --> 02:01:08,970
That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.

1918
02:01:09,053 --> 02:01:11,430
I know! I know! I know! I know!

1919
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:12,598
Listen, Rose,

1920
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:14,350
you're gonna have to find
a spare key, all right?

1921
02:01:14,433 --> 02:01:15,434
All right.

1922
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:17,228
Look in that cabinet right there.

1923
02:01:17,311 --> 02:01:19,063
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1924
02:01:20,773 --> 02:01:21,774
Silver one.

1925
02:01:22,316 --> 02:01:23,776
These are all brass ones!

1926
02:01:24,568 --> 02:01:25,736
Check right here, Rose.

02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:31,701
Rose.

1928
02:01:33,035 --> 02:01:34,495
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1929
02:01:35,454 --> 02:01:37,999
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.

1930
02:01:40,793 --> 02:01:41,794
Keep looking!

1931
02:01:51,262 --> 02:01:52,555
No key.

1932
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:54,765
-There's no key!
-All right, Rose, listen.

1933
02:01:54,849 --> 02:01:56,434
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1934
02:01:57,268 --> 02:01:58,269
It'll be all right.

1935
02:02:03,691 --> 02:02:04,775
I'll be right back.

1936

[moans]

1937
02:02:12,825 --> 02:02:14,076
I'll just wait here!

[creaking]

1940
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:29,133
Hello, is there anyone here?

1941
02:02:30,051 --> 02:02:31,093
Hello!

1942
02:02:32,053 --> 02:02:33,512
Is there anybody down here?

1943
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:37,016
We need help! Hello! [whimpers]

1944
02:02:38,142 --> 02:02:39,143
Damn it!

1945
02:02:45,816 --> 02:02:48,694
Can anybody hear me? Please! Hello!

1946
02:02:48,778 --> 02:02:49,820
Hello!

1947
02:02:51,697 --> 02:02:54,325
Oh, thank God! Wait, please!
I need your help!

1948
02:02:54,408 --> 02:02:55,743
There's a man back here and… [splutters]

1949
02:02:56,702 --> 02:02:57,703
Wait!

1950
02:02:58,412 --> 02:02:59,413
[panting]

1951
02:03:01,957 --> 02:03:03,292
Hello?

[breathing calms]

1954
02:03:28,943 --> 02:03:29,944
Hello?

1955
02:03:30,736 --> 02:03:31,779
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1956
02:03:31,862 --> 02:03:32,863
Wait. Please!

1957
02:03:32,947 --> 02:03:34,448
-I need your help.
-Come along.

1958
02:03:34,532 --> 02:03:35,533
This way, quickly.

1959
02:03:35,616 --> 02:03:36,617
There's a man down here and he is trapped.

1960
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:38,160
-This way. Yes, all right.
-Please!

1961
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:40,162
-There's no need to panic.
-No, I'm not panicking!

1962
02:03:40,246 --> 02:03:42,373
You're going the wrong way!

1963
02:03:42,456 --> 02:03:44,208
Let go of me! Listen!

1964
02:03:49,547 --> 02:03:50,923
To hell with you.

1965

Rose!

1975
02:05:22,431 --> 02:05:23,432
Will this work?

1976
02:05:24,975 --> 02:05:26,727
I guess we'll find out. Come on!

1977
02:05:30,814 --> 02:05:32,358
Wait, wait, wait.

1978
02:05:32,441 --> 02:05:34,235
Try a couple of practice
swings over there.

1979
02:05:34,985 --> 02:05:35,986
All right.

1980
02:05:39,490 --> 02:05:40,699
-[grunts]
-Good.

1981
02:05:40,783 --> 02:05:43,202
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1982
02:05:46,413 --> 02:05:47,540
[grunts]

1983
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:51,710
Okay, that's enough practice.

1984
02:05:51,877 --> 02:05:54,505
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1985
02:05:54,588 --> 02:05:57,716
Listen, just hit it really
hard and really fast.

1986
02:05:59,927 --> 02:06:01,262
Come on. Wait!

1987
02:06:01,345 --> 02:06:03,514
Open your hands up a little more. Good.

1988
02:06:03,597 --> 02:06:04,890
-Like that?
-Right.

1989
02:06:05,766 --> 02:06:07,810
Listen, Rose. I trust you.

1990
02:06:12,773 --> 02:06:13,774
Go!

02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:20,781
You did it!

1994
02:06:21,532 --> 02:06:22,658
Come on! Let's go!

1995
02:06:23,492 --> 02:06:24,868
Oh, shit, this is cold!

1996
02:06:25,911 --> 02:06:27,705
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1997
02:06:33,502 --> 02:06:35,421
This is the way out.

1998
02:06:35,504 --> 02:06:37,298
We have to find another way. Come on!

1999
02:06:38,507 --> 02:06:39,508
[crewman] Pull!

2000
02:06:41,051 --> 02:06:42,052
Pull!

2001
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:43,887
Put your backs into it!

2002
02:06:43,971 --> 02:06:44,972
Pull!

2003
02:06:45,472 --> 02:06:47,349
[band playing]

[people shouting]

2005
02:06:50,102 --> 02:06:51,103
Pull!

2006
02:06:52,021 --> 02:06:54,481
Now there's something you
don't see every day.

2007
02:06:54,565 --> 02:06:55,566
Pull!

2008
02:07:07,828 --> 02:07:09,580
[panicked shouting]

[whistle blowing]

2010
02:07:15,586 --> 02:07:16,712
[Lightoller] There's no room
for luggage in this boat!

2011
02:07:16,795 --> 02:07:18,505
What's this luggage
doing here? Get rid of it!

2012
02:07:18,589 --> 02:07:20,174
Get rid of it. We need the room.

2013
02:07:20,257 --> 02:07:21,508
Get rid of that. Out!

2014
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:25,137
This way. Let go, sir! Get back!

2015
02:07:25,929 --> 02:07:27,723
-Keep calm. Sit down.
-[elderly woman sobbing]

2016
02:07:28,307 --> 02:07:31,310
-No!
-Move along now. Make more room.

2017
02:07:31,393 --> 02:07:32,394
That's right. Let's go!

2018
02:07:33,604 --> 02:07:35,606
-This way, please.
-Lovejoy!

2019
02:07:35,689 --> 02:07:37,107
She's not on the starboard side either.

2020
02:07:38,233 --> 02:07:39,568
We're running out of time.

2021
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:42,196
And this strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

2022
02:07:42,863 --> 02:07:44,865
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

2023
02:07:45,491 --> 02:07:46,700
Well, then, that's our play.

2024
02:07:47,576 --> 02:07:49,620
We'll need some insurance, first. Come on!

2025
02:07:50,496 --> 02:07:52,414
Come on this way.
It's all the way down there.

2026

Here!

2029
02:07:57,378 --> 02:07:58,921
What do you think you're doin'?

2030
02:07:59,797 --> 02:08:01,340
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

2031
02:08:02,132 --> 02:08:03,884
That's White Star Line property.

2032
02:08:03,967 --> 02:08:05,010
[both] Shut up!

2033
02:08:06,553 --> 02:08:08,931
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room.

2034
02:08:09,014 --> 02:08:10,265
[Lightoller roars]

2035
02:08:10,349 --> 02:08:11,350
Sit down!

2036
02:08:12,059 --> 02:08:13,352
She's the last.

2037
02:08:13,435 --> 02:08:14,812
-Prepare to lower.
-Mr. Lightoller.

2038
02:08:15,479 --> 02:08:17,272
Why are the boats
being launched half full?

2039
02:08:17,356 --> 02:08:19,274
-Not now, Mr. Andrews.
-There, look.

2040
02:08:19,358 --> 02:08:21,819
Twenty or so in a boat built for 65?

2041
02:08:21,902 --> 02:08:24,488
And I saw one boat with only 12! 12!

2042
02:08:24,571 --> 02:08:27,366
Well, we weren't sure
of the weight, Mr. Andrews.

2043
02:08:27,449 --> 02:08:29,993
-These boats may buckle.
-Rubbish.

2044
02:08:30,077 --> 02:08:32,621
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

2045
02:08:32,705 --> 02:08:35,666
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller,
for God's sake, man!

2046
02:08:43,132 --> 02:08:44,133
Please.

2047
02:08:44,258 --> 02:08:45,968
I need more women and children, please.

2048
02:08:51,098 --> 02:08:52,307
Get back in there.

2049
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:53,892
-This is not an exit.
-Get back. Get back in there.

2050
02:08:53,976 --> 02:08:55,102
It's not an exit!

2051
02:08:57,771 --> 02:08:59,440
You can't keep us locked
in here like animals.

2052
02:08:59,523 --> 02:09:01,608
-The ship's bloody sinking.
-Stand back!

2053
02:09:01,692 --> 02:09:03,652
Bring forward the women!

2054
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:05,446
Unlock the gates. Come on.

2055
02:09:06,572 --> 02:09:07,656
Women only!

2056
02:09:08,866 --> 02:09:10,993
-No men! Get back!
-[passengers shouting]

2057
02:09:11,076 --> 02:09:12,077
No men!

[man screaming]

2059
02:09:17,207 --> 02:09:18,667
Get back!

2060
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:21,336
Get back!

2061
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:22,671
Lock the gates!

2062
02:09:23,213 --> 02:09:25,090
Get away from those gates!

2063
02:09:25,924 --> 02:09:27,426
Don't touch the gate!

2064
02:09:28,385 --> 02:09:29,720
[all shouting]

2065
02:09:31,346 --> 02:09:34,683
For God's sake, man,
there are women and children down here!

2066
02:09:34,767 --> 02:09:36,977
Let us out so we can have a chance!

2067
02:09:37,603 --> 02:09:38,604
[steward] Get back!

2068
02:09:42,399 --> 02:09:43,692
-Jack!
-[Jack] Tommy!

2069
02:09:43,776 --> 02:09:45,486
-Can we get out?
-It's hopeless that way.

2070
02:09:45,569 --> 02:09:47,279
Well, whatever we do,
we've gotta do it fast.

2071
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:48,781
Jack!

Fabrizio!

2073
02:09:51,158 --> 02:09:52,659
The boats are all gone!

2074
02:09:52,743 --> 02:09:54,411
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

2075
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:55,746
There's niente this way.

2076
02:09:55,829 --> 02:09:56,914
All right.

2077
02:09:56,997 --> 02:09:58,332
Let's go this way, all right? Come on!

2078
02:10:04,296 --> 02:10:05,672
I make my own luck.

2079
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:06,799
So do I.

2080
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:08,884
[chuckles]

2081
02:10:15,015 --> 02:10:16,058
Come on!

2082
02:10:16,809 --> 02:10:17,893
No! Come on, let's go this way.

2083

[speaking other language]

02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:28,862
This way!

2086
02:10:28,946 --> 02:10:31,240
Just go back to the main stairwell

2087
02:10:31,323 --> 02:10:33,283
and everything will be sorted out there.

2088
02:10:33,367 --> 02:10:34,701
[man] The hell it will.

2089
02:10:34,785 --> 02:10:36,495
[steward] It will all get
sorted out back there.

2090
02:10:36,578 --> 02:10:38,247
Go back to the main stairwell!

2091
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:39,331
Open the gate.

2092
02:10:39,414 --> 02:10:40,415
Go back down the main stairwell.

2093
02:10:40,499 --> 02:10:41,500
Open the gate right now!

2094
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:44,127
Go back down the main
stairwell like I told you!

2095
02:10:44,962 --> 02:10:46,088
[Jack sighs]

2096
02:10:46,171 --> 02:10:49,132
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

2097
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:50,425
Stop that!

2098
02:10:50,509 --> 02:10:52,052
[Tommy] Open the damn gate! Open it!

2099
02:10:55,138 --> 02:10:56,139
[Jack] Fabri, Tommy, give me a hand!

2100
02:10:56,223 --> 02:10:57,766
Move aside! Move aside!

2101
02:10:57,850 --> 02:10:58,851
Come on, pull!

2102
02:11:00,018 --> 02:11:01,061
Pull!

2103
02:11:01,854 --> 02:11:03,230
Move aside! Quickly! Move aside!

2104
02:11:03,313 --> 02:11:05,315
-[steward] Put that down!
-Move aside!

2105
02:11:05,482 --> 02:11:07,192
-Put that down! Stop it!
-One!

2106
02:11:07,276 --> 02:11:08,735
-Stop that!
-Two! Three!

[all grunting]

2108
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:13,615
Again! [grunting]

2109
02:11:14,533 --> 02:11:15,659
Yeah, let's go!

2110
02:11:18,287 --> 02:11:19,288
Let's go Rose.

2111
02:11:19,413 --> 02:11:21,290
You can't go out there! You can't do this!

2112
02:11:24,293 --> 02:11:26,461
[people shouting]

2113
02:11:26,545 --> 02:11:27,838
[man] Move back as much as you can!

2114
02:11:27,921 --> 02:11:29,715
[Wilde] Keep order! Keep order here!

2115
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:32,217
Back. Get back. Back.

[screams]

2119
02:11:40,058 --> 02:11:41,435
[seaman] Pull her in!

2120
02:11:41,935 --> 02:11:44,146
Get back, I say!

2121
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:46,940
Or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

2122
02:11:47,024 --> 02:11:48,108
Keep order here!

2123
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:51,403
Keep order, I say!

2124
02:11:52,821 --> 02:11:54,990
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

2125
02:11:59,536 --> 02:12:02,205
[Lowe] Right. Is everybody all right?

2126
02:12:02,289 --> 02:12:03,707
-Nobody panic.

[shouting]

2128
02:12:09,713 --> 02:12:10,756
[Murdoch] Stay back!

2129
02:12:11,965 --> 02:12:13,050
We're too late!

2130
02:12:13,133 --> 02:12:14,760
There are more boats down the front.

2131
02:12:15,177 --> 02:12:18,263
Stay with this one, Murdoch.
He seems to be quite practical.

2132
02:12:18,889 --> 02:12:19,890
[women screaming]

2133
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:24,311
[Barrett] Don't lower it!

2134
02:12:24,895 --> 02:12:26,146
[seaman] Cut the falls!

2135
02:12:33,111 --> 02:12:34,863
[Lowe] Sit down! Hey!

2136
02:12:35,572 --> 02:12:38,116
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!

2137
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:40,577
Stay back, the lot of you. Stay back!

2138
02:12:40,661 --> 02:12:42,120
[screaming]

2139
02:12:43,205 --> 02:12:45,332
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

2140
02:12:47,626 --> 02:12:48,835
Mr. Murdoch?

2141
02:12:48,919 --> 02:12:51,880
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

2142
02:12:51,964 --> 02:12:53,507
I'm a businessman, as you know.

2143
02:12:53,590 --> 02:12:55,258
And I have a business proposition for you.

2144
02:12:58,387 --> 02:13:00,347
[band continues to play]

2145
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:04,101
[Jack] Come on, Rose.

2146
02:13:07,729 --> 02:13:08,730
The boats are gone!

2147
02:13:14,486 --> 02:13:16,029
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?

2148
02:13:16,113 --> 02:13:18,532
No, miss, but there are
a couple of boats all the way forward.

2149
02:13:18,615 --> 02:13:19,741
This way, I'll lead you.

2150
02:13:26,665 --> 02:13:27,666
What's the use?

2151
02:13:27,749 --> 02:13:29,334
Nobody's listening to us, anyway.

2152
02:13:30,002 --> 02:13:31,461
Well, they don't listen to us
at dinner either.

2153
02:13:32,337 --> 02:13:33,839
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

2154

[lively music playing]

2156
02:13:41,513 --> 02:13:42,723
Music to drown by.

2157
02:13:42,806 --> 02:13:44,391
Now I know I'm in first class.

2158
02:13:46,601 --> 02:13:48,270
Keep along. Keep going.

2159
02:13:49,813 --> 02:13:51,106
Where is everyone?

2160
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:52,858
They're all still aft, sir.

2161
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:55,152
[Ismay] Come on, madam.
Don't cry. Come on.

2162
02:13:55,235 --> 02:13:57,612
Do we have an understanding,
then, Mr. Murdoch?

2163
02:14:03,952 --> 02:14:04,953
[Lightoller] Stand back!

2164
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:11,084
Will the men please hold back?

2165
02:14:11,168 --> 02:14:12,419
Hold back, I say!

2166
02:14:13,045 --> 02:14:14,087
[gunshot]

2167
02:14:15,338 --> 02:14:18,008
Women and children only!

2168
02:14:18,091 --> 02:14:19,384
Stand back!

2169
02:14:19,468 --> 02:14:21,636
Step back, sir. Come through, madam.

2170
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:23,430
This way. Step back, sir.

2171
02:14:23,513 --> 02:14:24,514
Let the women through!

2172
02:14:24,598 --> 02:14:25,807
You better check the other side.

2173
02:14:25,891 --> 02:14:27,476
-Stand back, sir.
-Go!

2174
02:14:27,559 --> 02:14:28,935
Stand back, sir.

2175
02:14:29,811 --> 02:14:32,314
[Murdoch] Any more women and children?

2176
02:14:33,148 --> 02:14:34,816
Any children?

2177
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,651
I found her on the other side.

2178
02:14:37,319 --> 02:14:38,695
Waiting for a boat…

2179
02:14:39,196 --> 02:14:40,197
with him.

2180
02:14:41,782 --> 02:14:42,908
Any more women and children?

2181
02:14:42,991 --> 02:14:45,744
-They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.
-Anyone else then?

2182
02:14:46,870 --> 02:14:47,996
Hop on, sir. Hop on.

2183
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:49,164
-Anyone else?
-Do hurry. Hurry along.

2184
02:14:53,710 --> 02:14:54,795
Stand by the falls.

-Quickly.
-God damn it all to hell.

2186

[Ismay] That's it!

2187
02:15:00,008 --> 02:15:01,301
-Shit.
-Fire!

2188
02:15:02,969 --> 02:15:03,970
Sir!

2189
02:15:04,054 --> 02:15:05,514
Sir, you can't go through here.

2190
02:15:05,639 --> 02:15:06,765
Sir, you can't go through.

2191
02:15:09,434 --> 02:15:11,311
That's just splendid. Right.

2192
02:15:13,647 --> 02:15:14,648
Right.

2193
02:15:15,857 --> 02:15:17,025
[Murdoch] Prepare to lower!

2194
02:15:19,611 --> 02:15:20,987
Ready on the left.

2195
02:15:27,452 --> 02:15:28,787
Take them down.

2196
02:15:33,875 --> 02:15:34,876
Keep it steady.

2197
02:15:37,712 --> 02:15:39,548
Both sides together. Steady.

2198
02:15:40,173 --> 02:15:41,258
Keep it steady.

2199
02:15:42,968 --> 02:15:44,136
Give her to me.

2200
02:15:44,302 --> 02:15:45,387

-[father] It'll be fine,

-Take her.

2202
02:15:46,638 --> 02:15:47,889
-Don't you worry.
-Pull her up.

2203
02:15:47,973 --> 02:15:49,724
Daddy, get in the boat.

2204
02:15:49,808 --> 02:15:51,601
It's goodbye for a little while.

2205
02:15:51,685 --> 02:15:52,727
Only for a little while.

2206
02:15:53,436 --> 02:15:54,813
There'll be another boat for the daddies,

2207
02:15:54,896 --> 02:15:56,815
this boat's for the mummies
and the children.

2208
02:15:56,898 --> 02:15:59,025
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

2209
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:01,736
I'm not going without you.

2210
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:04,030
-No, you have to go, now.
-No, Jack.

2211
02:16:04,114 --> 02:16:05,115
Women and children only, please!

2212
02:16:05,198 --> 02:16:07,367
-Get in the boat, Rose.
-No, Jack.

2213
02:16:07,450 --> 02:16:09,452
Yes! Get on the boat!

2214
02:16:09,536 --> 02:16:11,246
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

2215
02:16:14,791 --> 02:16:17,043
Oh, my God, look at you.
You look a fright.

2216
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:19,171
Here.

2217
02:16:20,797 --> 02:16:22,799
Put this on. Come on.

2218
02:16:22,883 --> 02:16:24,009
[man] On the boat, please.

2219
02:16:24,551 --> 02:16:25,719
[woman] We'll pray for you.

2220
02:16:25,802 --> 02:16:26,803
[man 2] Get on the boat.

2221
02:16:26,887 --> 02:16:28,346
[woman] Yes, we'll pray for you, darling.

2222
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:29,931
Go on. I'll get the next one.

2223
02:16:30,348 --> 02:16:32,142
No, not without you.

2224
02:16:32,225 --> 02:16:34,394
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.

2225
02:16:34,477 --> 02:16:36,605
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

2226
02:16:36,688 --> 02:16:38,315
Now, go on. Get on.

2227
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:40,692
I have an arrangement with an officer
on the other side of the ship.

2228
02:16:40,775 --> 02:16:42,444
Jack and I can get off safely.

2229
02:16:42,527 --> 02:16:43,528
Both of us.

2230
02:16:44,946 --> 02:16:47,574
See? I got my own boat to catch.

2231
02:16:47,657 --> 02:16:49,034
[Cal] Come on, hurry.

2232
02:16:49,117 --> 02:16:50,118
They're almost full.

2233
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:52,829
-Step aboard, miss.
-Go, go.

2234
02:16:52,913 --> 02:16:53,914
Come on, hurry.

2235
02:16:54,664 --> 02:16:55,707
[Wilde] Step aboard, please.

2236
02:16:55,790 --> 02:16:56,833
[father] Be Daddy's good girl, all right?

2237
02:16:56,917 --> 02:16:58,501
-[Lightoller] Step lively!
-You're my little sailor.

2238
02:16:58,585 --> 02:17:00,545

2239
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:02,214
-[Rose grunts]
-Clear the rail.

2240
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:03,715
Clear the rail, please.

2241
02:17:04,925 --> 02:17:06,676
And lower away!

2242
02:17:07,427 --> 02:17:09,638
-[lifeboat passengers exclaim]
-Lower away together!

2243

Lower slowly!

Keep going! Keep going!

2245
02:17:14,851 --> 02:17:16,895
And lower away evenly, lads.

2246
02:17:17,854 --> 02:17:20,065
Easy! Lower away!

2247
02:17:20,690 --> 02:17:22,651
-You're a good liar.
-And even away!

2248
02:17:22,734 --> 02:17:23,860
Almost as good as you.

2249
02:17:23,944 --> 02:17:27,197
[Wilde] Easy now! And lower away!

2250
02:17:28,031 --> 02:17:29,115
Steady!

2251
02:17:29,199 --> 02:17:31,034
-There's no…
-Easy!

2252
02:17:31,117 --> 02:17:32,410
There's no arrangement, is there?

2253
02:17:32,911 --> 02:17:34,037
[Wilde] Lower away!

2254
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:35,872
-No, there is.
-Even!

2255
02:17:35,956 --> 02:17:37,874
