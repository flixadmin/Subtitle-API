2
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,610
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

3
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,362
Here at the end of round one...

4
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,823
...I'm gonna recommend
cautious optimism.

5
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,159
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded...

6
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,204
...reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

7
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,165
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

8
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,210
Yeah.

9
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,337
Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

10
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,090
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

11
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:56,175
And your hair should start
to come back.

12
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,888
Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

13
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:05,434
- I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
- Right. Aerodynamic.

14
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:10,022
So no more confusion?

15
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,735
- No more...?
- No. No. Absolutely none.

16
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,363
How are you two holding up?

17
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,658
Fine.

18
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,995
I mean, you know, we're busy...

19
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,873
...but we're good. Absolutely.

20
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,876
It's all good.

21
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,842
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

22
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,927
Yes. Direct bill.

23
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,597
Just need to print it out for you.

24
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,625
Thank you.

25
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,803
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

26
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,640
Absolutely. It's included.

27
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,643
Just a reminder.

28
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,605
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

29
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,107
Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,817
Okay.

31
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,821
Congratulations.

32
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,824
Thank you.

33
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,631
Okay, well,
then what about the MRI?

34
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,883
Can you...?
Can you please explain to me...

35
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,304
...the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

36
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,686
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

37
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,524
Okay, you know,
it should be covered.

38
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,527
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

39
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:24,198
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

40
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,409
Yeah. Okay.

41
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,203
Bitch.

42
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,080
Hi.

43
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,710
Been around someone who smokes?

44
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,169
No.

45
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,380
The hospital bill came.

46
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,549
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,845
Three-day stay,
13,000 and counting.

48
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,814
Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

49
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,734
I mean...

50
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,071
...I know it's strictly your domain,
but...

51
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,365
They will. I'm sure they will.

52
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,200
I'll handle it.

53
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,025
Oh, God.

54
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,112
Bring me up to speed on
Tuco Salamanca.

55
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,363
- Dead.
- Still?

56
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,782
- Completely.
- Okay, then.

57
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,535
- Well, thanks for stopping by.
- Okay.

58
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,707
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

59
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,251
- Good.
- Of course, that's not gonna last.

60
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,421
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

61
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,048
No takers so far?

62
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,593
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

63
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,221
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

64
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,723
- Heisenberg?
- Yeah, I know.

65
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,601
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

66
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,939
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

67
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,608
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

68
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,196
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

69
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:38,786
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

70
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,497
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles...

71
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,791
...in pursuit of their prey.

72
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,960
Yeah, I think I heard that.

73
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,130
You, my friend, are a great white.

74
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,259
How does Albuquerque liaison...

75
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,804
...Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

76
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,139
Like one hell of a promotion.

77
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,018
As of the 1 st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

78
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,646
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

79
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,898
What you gonna do without me,
Gomey?

80
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,694
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

81
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,697
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

82
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,324
- I'm the whole package.
- I'm glad I didn't just eat.

83
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,994
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

84
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,871
- You wanna grab lunch?
- Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

85
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,833
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

86
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,002
Try not to get lost on the way.

87
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,212
Schrader.

88
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,547
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

89
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,383
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

90
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,260
Yeah, El Paso.

91
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,805
Here's the man.

92
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,019
- Hey, congratulations, Hank.
- Thanks.

93
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,084
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

94
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,504
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

95
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,339
Hey. Hey.

96
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,166
- Hey.
- Got some nerve coming back here.

97
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,293
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

98
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,629
Yeah, well, maybe both.

99
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,807
Balance for the tow, the repairs...

100
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,812
...and extra for damages and stuff,
the gate...

101
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,815
...the toilet.

102
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,360
Look, like I said...

103
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,447
...my word is my bond.

104
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,964
What would you charge me
to store this here?

105
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,092
- A million-five.
- Come on, yo.

106
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,511
- Your sister.
- Dog, I'm serious, all right?

107
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,349
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

108
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,977
We could, you know, negotiate.

109
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,484
Five hundred.

110
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,985
- A month?
- A week.

111
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,947
For real?

112
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,782
- See you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

113
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,202
Just hold on. Just chill.

114
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,915
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

115
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,209
- Outside.
- Inside.

116
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,044
- Forget it.
- Man, come on.

117
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,297
Your fence is too easy to climb.

118
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,050
Inside, padlocked,
plus gate privileges.

119
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,221
- Come again?
- Gate, in and out, privileges.

120
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,142
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

121
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,895
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

122
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,396
Yeah.

123
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,036
You selling?

124
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,163
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

125
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,048
What about that one?

126
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,512
Serious?

127
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,869
It's Jane, right?

128
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,540
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

129
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,752
- Really? Does it inspire awe?
- No. I mean, you know, it's great.

130
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,380
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

131
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,466
I had an entire house before,
detached and all...

132
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:31,013
...but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

133
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,224
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

134
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,144
Jesus.

135
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,773
Utilities are included.

136
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,775
Stacking. Sweet.

137
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,695
- You got cable?
- Already wired. Just call to activate.

138
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,530
High speed, whatever.

139
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,408
Bathroom, cool tile.

140
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,452
Bedroom.

141
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,786
Nice.

142
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,165
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

143
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,628
- So you're interested?
- Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

144
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,796
And you're good with NP, NS?

145
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,550
Sorry. What?

146
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,928
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

147
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,057
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

148
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,353
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2
or recent pay stub, current employer...

149
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,147
...former address, you know,
the yadda yadda.

150
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,026
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

151
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,863
Yeah. Look...

152
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,531
...the thing is...

153
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,367
...I can...

154
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,035
Unbelievable.

155
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,872
- I'm just currently between situations.
- Then I'm currently not renting.

156
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,709
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

157
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,380
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

158
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,174
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

159
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,551
- Trust me.
- Your dad?

160
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,554
Owns the place. I manage it.

161
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,973
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

162
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,892
Or go run your game
somewhere else.

163
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,311
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

164
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,897
And I got no game, all right?

165
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,733
I just need a chance.

166
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,365
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

167
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,535
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

168
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,621
Didn't meet their expectations again.

169
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,624
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

170
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,962
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

171
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,589
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

172
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,759
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

173
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,936
Rent just went up.

174
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,939
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

175
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,691
Yes.

176
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,943
Okay. Yes.

177
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,863
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

178
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,782
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

179
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,452
DBAA fee, nonrefundable.

180
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,206
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

181
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:09,129
All right. So, what's DBAA?

182
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,673
- Don't be an asshole.
- Gotcha.

183
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,426
- I live next door.
- Really?

184
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,971
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

185
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,723
If you blow this, I want you gone.

186
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,018
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster...

187
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,603
...faster than you can blink.

188
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,149
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

189
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,650
Which is what, by the way?

190
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,153
It's Jesse.

191
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,157
Jesse Jackson.

192
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,326
Seriously?

193
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,204
What?

194
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,839
- What are you doing?
- Beating off. What's it look like?

195
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,509
That is in fact exactly
what it looks like to me.

196
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,804
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

197
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,015
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

198
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,393
So let me get this straight.

199
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:51,189
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited...

200
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,733
...career-boosting promotion...

201
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,238
...so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

202
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,824
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

203
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,993
Babe, relax.

204
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,538
- Please, don't tell me to relax.
- Sorry, I forgot.

205
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,748
- You know I hate that.
- Right.

206
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,709
Dave said I should express that.

207
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,628
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

208
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,172
I can take a day.

209
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,091
No big deal.

210
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:24,306
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

211
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,873
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>

212
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,376
The plan is we cook.

213
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:21,006
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

214
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,601
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

215
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,521
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

216
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,523
- Dude.
- What?

217
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,568
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

218
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,196
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before...

219
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,616
- ...but still, what choice do we have?
- First of all, there's no we.

220
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,912
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

221
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,330
I got profile now.

222
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,751
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

223
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,337
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

224
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,090
- No way.
- Then what do you suggest?

225
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:09,179
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

226
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,603
I got bills, man.

227
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,104
You've got bills?

228
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,148
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

229
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,150
I've already lost more than
I've made...

230
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,028
...and I am tired
of dicking around out here.

231
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,281
You wanna know how much
I've got left?

232
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,575
After completing
my first round of treatment...

233
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,287
...and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

234
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,456
Zero. Zip. Nothing.

235
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,751
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family...

236
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,379
...which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

237
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,887
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option...

238
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,140
...that leaves us with a total
of two choices:

239
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,393
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic...

240
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,646
...or you and I start...

241
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:03,608
You selling whatever you can.

242
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,613
There's a third way.

243
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,991
And what would that be?

244
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,913
We got to be Tuco.

245
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,499
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

246
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:23,545
So you're going to what?

247
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,922
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

248
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,175
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

249
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:33,930
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

250
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:38,017
Look, we control production
and distribution.

251
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,437
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

252
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,691
I mean, the point here is
to make money, right?

253
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,192
Sky-high stacks.

254
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,029
- No.
- No? That's not the point?

255
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,824
No, I am not willing to do that.

256
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,660
Who said anything about you?

257
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,832
I don't vote for this plan.

258
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,211
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

259
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,964
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

260
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,719
I beg your pardon?

261
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:16,723
- This is a partnership, remember?
- I rem... Oh, I remember.

262
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,058
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

263
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,562
That was the division of labor
when we started all this.

264
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,939
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

265
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,984
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk...

266
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,403
...or on my knees
with a gun to my head...

267
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,573
...before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

268
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,917
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

269
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,045
And perhaps
I was overly ambitious.

270
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,298
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

271
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,175
Yeah, damn straight.

272
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,385
Know why?

273
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,388
Because we do things
my way this time...

274
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,432
...or I walk.

275
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:07,273
You need me more than
I need you, Walt.

276
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,964
Yo, enter my casa.
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?

277
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,173
What up with it, yo?

278
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,635
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

279
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:38,596
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

280
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,810
- Yo, Badge, hey.
- Cool crib, man.

281
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,645
Hey, it echoes.

282
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,480
Hello.

283
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,649
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

284
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,567
Let me give you the virtual tour,
okay?

285
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,320
So plasma is gonna go right here.

286
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,572
Probably like 50-inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

287
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,992
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

288
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,868
No. They burn in, yo.

289
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,205
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

290
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,000
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

291
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,876
That's what I'm waiting for.

292
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,296
- Porn, coz. You know?
- Jesus.

293
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,007
Like 3-D tatas,
like right in your face.

294
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,093
Yeah. So I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs...

295
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,138
...for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

296
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,472
Those are buck.

297
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,684
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

298
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,020
- Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
- Yeah.

299
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,439
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles...

300
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,066
...maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

301
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,068
- It's gonna be chill.
- The ladies...

302
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:38,031
...they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

303
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,367
You are going to score, big time.

304
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,039
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

305
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,375
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

306
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:53,212
You got any other refreshments?

307
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,299
- I could kick it. It's been a while.
- Yes, yes.

308
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,926
I could totally go
for a loving spoonful.

309
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,387
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

310
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:05,224
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

311
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,061
Okay? So listen up.

312
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,939
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

313
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:16,069
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

314
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,030
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

315
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,699
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

316
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,409
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

317
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:27,080
- Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
- Seventeen.

318
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,000
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

319
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,629
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second...

320
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,923
...who else is selling right now,
huh?

321
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:40,176
- It's dry out there, that's for sure.
- Church.

322
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,638
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

323
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:47,016
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

324
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,435
Short me, you're out.

325
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,229
Cut it, you're out.

326
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,064
Period.

327
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,193
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

328
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,945
Understand?

329
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,781
Badger, what is this?

330
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,576
A big opportunity.

331
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,247
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

332
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,959
Gentlemen,
how far you go is up to you.

333
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,627
So bring out the product, yo.

334
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,588
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

335
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,759
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

336
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:27,598
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

337
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,600
Now, I got mad volume.

338
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,479
So you move it quick,
you move it right...

339
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,816
...there is always more.

340
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:41,529
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

341
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,948
Apply yourselves.

342
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,241
Hell, yeah.

343
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,452
Hell, yeah.

344
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,902
Hey, there's the big guy.

345
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,362
- Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
- Hey, Hank.

346
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,739
It's an armpit.

347
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,699
It's not an armpit.

348
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,534
Oh, excuse me.

349
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,287
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

350
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,873
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

351
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:37,460
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

352
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,754
Human heads, they leave.

353
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:44,050
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

354
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,636
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

355
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:51,474
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

356
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:54,560
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

357
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,396
You just do your time
like a good boy...

358
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,566
...and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown...

359
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,527
...in a couple of years.

360
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:22,797
I went online to this fantastic...

361
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,925
...real estate website for D.C.

362
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:30,930
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

363
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,182
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

364
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,435
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

365
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,854
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there...

366
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,237
Apologize.

367
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,991
What?

368
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:56,664
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologize.

369
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,461
- For?
- You know perfectly well, Marie.

370
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,673
- Well, obviously I don't...
- Your lies.

371
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,466
To me.

372
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,012
The shoplifting.

373
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,805
All of it.

374
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:17,476
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

375
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,771
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it...

376
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,815
Apologize.

377
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,321
Now or never. I mean it.

378
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,990
Or it'll never be the same.

379
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,787
Why are you punishing me?

380
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:44,086
If you don't respect me enough to
apologize, to tell me the truth, then...

381
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,014
I need my sister back.

382
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,696
I'm sorry.

383
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,035
I'm sorry.

384
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:30,216
- What do you want, the gory details?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

385
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,218
No, you don't.

386
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,303
Keep you up at night.

387
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:40,184
So was it scary?

388
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,937
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
you little punk.

389
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,188
Jesus.

390
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,274
But you were way faster than him.

391
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,860
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

392
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,780
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

393
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,323
Kick ass and take names.

394
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,326
- Son.
- No, it's fine.

395
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,371
You know what it is?

396
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,250
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

397
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,377
I mean, you don't think about it.

398
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,255
You stomp them down.

399
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,425
Where do they come from?

400
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,512
Criminals, like the one you...

401
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,433
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

402
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,104
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

403
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,526
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

404
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,115
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

405
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,040
Cops.

406
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,334
Cops!

407
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,394
Wasn't sure it was you.

408
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,647
New car?

409
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,651
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

410
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,987
I'm guessing
this one doesn't bounce.

411
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,121
Your half.

412
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,791
Fifteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

413
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,046
You're welcome.

414
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,297
Jesus.

415
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,969
Help me understand the math,
okay?

416
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,054
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

417
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,182
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

418
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,184
$1,000 each.

419
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,311
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

420
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:39,358
Sixteen ounces should net
to me $16,000.

421
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,528
Sixteen. Not 15.

422
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,531
Something came up.

423
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,367
Something came up?

424
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,662
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

425
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,458
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

426
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,213
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed...

427
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:06,760
- Or rather you got robbed.
- But it doesn't matter.

428
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,472
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

429
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,391
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

430
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,560
And you're thinking
this is acceptable?

431
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,855
It's the cost of business, yo.

432
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,523
You're sweating me over a grand?

433
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:24,153
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

434
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,613
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage...

435
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,908
...is just you making a fool
of yourself.

436
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,953
I've got another technical
term for you.

437
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,914
Non-sustainable business model.

438
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,375
You're focusing on the negative.

439
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,171
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

440
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,215
What happens when
word gets out...

441
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,844
...and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

442
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,972
Once everyone knows that
Jesse Pinkman...

443
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,268
...drug lord,
can be robbed with impunity.

444
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,770
Man, come on.

445
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,440
You think Tuco had breakage?

446
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,276
I guess it's true, he did.

447
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,611
He broke bones.

448
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:09,782
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

449
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,493
You want another grand?
Is that it?

450
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,953
- That's not my point.
- Take it. Here.

451
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,710
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

452
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,088
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

453
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,924
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

454
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,467
So am I.

455
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,386
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

456
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,473
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

457
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,559
You've made
the division of labor very clear.

458
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,439
Yo, I mean, seriously...

459
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:46,151
...what the hell
do you want me to do, huh?

460
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,388
Hey.

461
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:15,848
Sorry.

462
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,808
Wow, you snuck in.

463
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,102
Didn't even know you were home.

464
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,437
What you eating?

465
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,691
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

466
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,610
I thought we nixed those, huh?

467
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,529
Did we?

468
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:36,201
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

469
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,912
I had a craving.

470
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,290
Once in a while is no big deal.

471
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,006
So where's Jr?

472
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,175
Out.

473
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,720
With whom?

474
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,388
Louis.

475
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,477
Out where?

476
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,899
Somewhere. I don't know.

477
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,902
- He'll be back by 9.
- Okay.

478
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:15,449
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

479
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,242
Why don't you?

480
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:22,748
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

481
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,375
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

482
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,836
Just pick up the phone like I do.

483
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,974
Great.

484
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,940
Perhaps you might know
something...

485
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,316
...about this.

486
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,238
Perhaps.

487
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,282
And then again...

488
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,535
...perhaps I don't, Walt.

489
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,206
Perhaps I smoked them
in a fugue state.

490
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,294
I'd like an explanation, please.

491
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:12,381
- You don't wanna go down that road.
- Why would you do this?

492
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,634
- You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
- Three and a half cigarettes...

493
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,302
...won't do a thing to the baby.

494
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,638
- Nothing.
- I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

495
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,432
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

496
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,605
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

497
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:34,528
Skyler, this...
I mean, this is something that...

498
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,990
- This is so unlike you. Why...?
- Really?

499
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,117
How would you know?

500
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,955
No, thank you.

501
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,144
Hank.

502
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:36,882
Jesus.

503
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,592
Yo.

504
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,604
You asked me what
I want you to do.

505
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,450
I want you to handle it.

506
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,241
