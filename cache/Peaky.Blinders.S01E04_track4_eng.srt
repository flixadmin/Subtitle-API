1
00:00:02,121 --> 00:00:05,201
When I've achieved what
I've set out to achieve,

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:07,081
I will let you know
where to find the guns.

3
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:09,041
So what shall I do?

4
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,841
Get close to him.
Find out where those guns are heading.

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,961
Raise your hand,
all those who want to strike!

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,481
Freddie Thorne is at the
very top of my list.

7
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:23,801
Well, cross him off.
I'll make him part of our deal.

8
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:27,321
To hell with them. The more they try
and stop us, the madder I'll be.

9
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,401
In times like these, a communist
in family is bad for business.

10
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:32,041
You have to leave the city.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,521
<i>You were also at war with
the Lees, Mr Kimber, am I right?</i>

12
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:41,081
Together, we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

13
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,081
God, he's getting big now!

14
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,161
Not at all.

15
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:16,601
<i># Where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom</i>

16
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:19,721
<i># As it shifts and cracks</i>

17
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:24,841
<i># Where secrets lie in the border fires</i>

18
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:27,081
<i># In the humming wires... #</i>

19
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:31,001
- So, how was London?
- It was crackling with revolution.

20
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,481
The Poplar Docks are on strike.

21
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,641
Did our friends give us
what we asked for?

22
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,281
- How much?
-200 pounds.

23
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:45,161
- Who did you meet?
- An attache from the Russian Embassy.

24
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,641
In a Chinese restaurant.

25
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:52,161
Our revolution is international.
It grows by the day.

26
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:10,681
Jeremiah, Jeremiah, what do you see?

27
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:13,521
Your sister and Freddie
got back this morning.

28
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:17,961
I tried following them.
But Freddie's so good at getting away.

29
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,161
- He's like a fish.
- Right.

30
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,641
Well, keep fishing, eh?

31
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,681
Last bets, now.

32
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,641
Now, don't go spending
all your rent money, Charlie.

33
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,361
That's your starters, gentleman.
No more bets.

34
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,201
- I was there on time.
- Finished.

35
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:03,761
- I've had a tip off. I need this bet.
- The race has started...

36
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:05,361
- Please.
- No!

37
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:09,641
- Ugh. Fine.
- Get rid of him. I said no.

38
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:13,241
- Now get out.
- All right, all right, I'm off. I'm off.

39
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,961
- All right, lads. See you tomorrow.
- Cheers.

40
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:54,321
- It's a good day.
- Where's John?

41
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,561
John's in The Garrison.

42
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,721
Says he wants a meeting
about a family matter.

43
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:03,801
After he's said his piece, he'll come
back and take his place with Scudboat.

44
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:07,081
Scudboat, john will be
here in ten minutes.

45
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:09,081
- All right.
- Five.

46
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,201
We're here.

47
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,321
Good boy.

48
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:08,041
John?

49
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:19,881
Put that down!

50
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,241
This is for Cheltenham.

51
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:26,441
We just taking back what's ours.

52
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,561
There's loot in here, search everywhere!

53
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,641
All right, john. There's only one... Not
now. Only one man guarding the house.

54
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,681
What's troubling you?

55
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:48,201
Polly, you know what it's been like
since Martha died.

56
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,241
God takes the best first.

57
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:54,721
The truth is, my kids have been
running bloody rings around me.

58
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:58,641
Running barefoot with the
dogs until all hours.

59
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,601
Pol, give him ten bob for
some new shoes. Is that it, john?

60
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:04,641
Tommy, we'd be better
to do this without you.

61
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:08,601
Now, what's your point?

62
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:13,121
What the kids need is a mother.

63
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:17,881
So that's why I'm getting married.

64
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:22,401
Does this poor girl know you're
gonna marry her or are you just gonna

65
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,721
spring it on her all of the sudden?

66
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,441
I've already proposed.

67
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:27,961
And she said yes.

68
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:31,841
I think there's a shell about
to land and go bang.

69
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:38,121
It's, um, it's Lizzie Stark.

70
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,201
John! Lizzie Stark's a strong woman,

71
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,881
and I'm sure she provides
a fine service for her customers.

72
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:49,921
I won't hear the word.

73
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:53,081
Understand? Do not use that word.

74
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,601
What word is that, john?

75
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:59,521
- You know what word that is.
- Everybody bloody knows.

76
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,161
Everybody can go to hell.

77
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:05,321
Whore? That word.
Or prostitute? How about that one?

78
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:11,281
All right, I want it known,
if anyone calls her a whore again,

79
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,881
I will push the barrel of my
revolver down their throats,

80
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,281
and blow the word back
down into their hearts.

81
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,321
Men and their cocks never
cease to amaze me.

82
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,121
John, Lizzie Stark never did
a day's work vertical.

83
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:27,161
She's changed. All right, people change.

84
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,521
Like with religion.

85
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,801
Oh, Lizzie Stark's got religion, eh?

86
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:34,481
No, no, she doesn't
have religion, but...

87
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,121
Well, she loves me.

88
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:42,041
Now, listen, Tommy. I won't do it
without your blessing.

89
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:49,361
But of all the people in the world,
I want you to see it...

90
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:53,401
- As brave.
- Oh, it's brave, all right.

91
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:56,401
Brave is going where no
man has gone before.

92
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:00,601
And with Lizzie Stark, john, that is
really not what you'll be doing.

93
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,721
Give me some time.

94
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,361
Welcome her to the family

95
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:06,281
as someone who's had a hard life.

96
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:10,001
All right, because I need someone.

97
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,441
All right, the kids need someone.

98
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,841
Tommy, we've been done over.

99
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,161
What?

100
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,201
Jesus Christ!

101
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:27,321
What the bloody hell happened here?

102
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:32,401
The Lees, all of them. Cousins, nephews.

103
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:34,281
Even the bastards.

104
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,041
They've taken anything
they can lay their hands on.

105
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,201
Four cash boxes.

106
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:45,441
- They left these.
- Wire cutters?

107
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,441
- Why would they leave wire cutters?
- Nobody move.

108
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,921
I think our friends
are playing the game.

109
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:57,401
- What game?
- Pol, don't, don't touch anything.

110
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,001
Erasmus Lee was in France.

111
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,201
Shit.

112
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,161
When we gave up ground to the Germans,

113
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:14,921
we'd leave behind booby traps
set up with wires.

114
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,681
Then we'd leave wire cutters.

115
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:19,401
It's part of the joke.

116
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:22,681
Somewhere in here
there's a hand grenade.

117
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:24,161
Holy Jesus.

118
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,961
Attached to a wire.

119
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,521
Don't move any chairs.

120
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:34,361
Or open any doors.

121
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:39,801
Go easy, john boy, easy.

122
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,081
Ah!

123
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:43,641
Boys, no, there's nothing here.

124
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:47,641
If it was in here, it would
have blown by now.

125
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:51,881
It was my name on
that bullet Erasmus sent.

126
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:54,681
He set up a trap all right.

127
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,281
He set it upj ust for me.

128
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,401
Finn?

129
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,801
Finn, stay exactly where you are.

130
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,081
I was pretending I was you.

131
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,961
Which door did you
open to come in, Finn?

132
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,001
I didn't, I climbed in.

133
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:34,481
I want you to climb out exactly the
same way you climbed in, okay?

134
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,681
No, no, Finn!

135
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,561
Grenade!

136
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:06,761
That's why you should
never pretend to be me.

137
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,321
Okay? Okay?

138
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:48,481
I got you ten minutes with her.

139
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,921
You can at least say thank you.
It's easier to see the Pope, these days.

140
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,441
Put your hand on the Bible.

141
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,201
I don't believe.

142
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:32,881
Anyway, I didn't come here to lie.

143
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,241
This war is cutting us all up.

144
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:47,161
- You're all children.
- I say enough.

145
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:50,881
Your boys tried to kill me. Didn't work.

146
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:08,361
No wonder you won't touch a Bible.

147
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:11,121
- I have ambitions.
- You want to play a switch.

148
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,201
- I need your boys.
- For what?

149
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:18,001
Kimber's not the brains,
there's a Gadza who runs the races.

150
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,361
I'm collecting smart people,
but I need strong men, too.

151
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,721
Now, your boys should know this.

152
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:30,281
We now get the winner in one of three
races before the race even starts.

153
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:33,601
No need for chalkers or rafflers,
I'm talking certainties.

154
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:36,401
You come in here, boasting you're
gonna do someone down,

155
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,481
and in the same breath,
ask me to trust you?

156
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,281
On my mother's side, we are kin.

157
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,321
Ada, can you do my back?

158
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:05,641
Ada!

159
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,201
I know what was in the envelope.

160
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,401
I looked. Money.

161
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:16,321
And that bloke that we met in London,
who you said was a Frenchman,

162
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:18,281
he was Russian.
I'm not an idiot, Freddie.

163
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:21,201
How is it, that you take all the risks

164
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,721
and Stanley Chapman gets the money?

165
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:25,961
It's money for the cause.

166
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:27,681
You're blind.

167
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:30,161
I would be, if your brothers
had anything to do with it.

168
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:33,961
This isn't about them,
this is about you. And me.

169
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,441
And this.

170
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:42,001
You're a dreamer, Freddie.

171
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:46,041
You give money away
while we rot in here.

172
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:49,641
You talk about revolution.

173
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:51,841
I need to know.

174
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,161
Who are you loyal to, Freddie?

175
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:03,241
I said, who are you loyal to?

176
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:44,521
Did you have something to do with this?

177
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,241
I asked an acquaintance for an address.

178
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:51,081
She said she'd only give
it to me anonymously.

179
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,361
She's afraid of the consequences.

180
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:56,521
Whose address is it?

181
00:15:57,721 --> 00:15:59,881
Tommy, I'd like to suggest a strategy.

182
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:24,161
Your message said
you have an address for me?

183
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:30,761
Anonymous tip off.

184
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:34,081
The address of Stanley Chapman.

185
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:39,361
- You promised me Freddie Thorne.
- This is instead of Freddie Thorne.

186
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,281
- No deal.
- Inspector,

187
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:45,841
Stanley Chapman is a bigger
fish than Freddie Thorne.

188
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:51,201
He's currently holding £200 in cash

189
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:55,561
given to The Communist Party
by the Russian government.

190
00:16:57,241 --> 00:17:00,721
That's right, Chapman
has snow on his boots.

191
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,161
And all you need is a shovel.

192
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,321
If he talks, you'll have proof.

193
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:09,521
You might even get that medal.

194
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,441
N ow,

195
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,681
before I give you the address,

196
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:18,161
I want your word

197
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:21,441
that you'll let Freddie Thorne

198
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:24,281
and my sister leave the city.

199
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,121
Very well. You have my word.

200
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,201
I'd say our little truce
has proven quite

201
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:39,841
productive for both of us, Inspector.

202
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:45,201
I'll get the information and protection.

203
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:49,361
And you? Well...

204
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:52,441
You get Bolsheviks.

205
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:59,081
But on a more pressing matter,

206
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:05,841
I'm afraid that Mr Churchill
is becoming impatient.

207
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,801
And I fear that,

208
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:13,561
if you don't get back
those stolen weapons soon,

209
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:15,841
I will be replaced.

210
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:18,481
That will be the finish
for me, that's for sure.

211
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,481
When my business with Kimber is done,

212
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,961
the guns will be returned.
That was the deal.

213
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,641
Then I'm in your hands, completely.

214
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:30,201
You hold all the cards.

215
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:35,441
But, I hope to God that
my dismissal doesn't come

216
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:38,761
before your decision to
hand back those guns.

217
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,481
And I say this for your sake because,

218
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,561
if I were to be fired,
and it were your fault,

219
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,321
I would do things that
would shame the devil.

220
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,361
My fury is a thing to behold.

221
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,681
On my last day in power, for example,

222
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,961
I would see to it

223
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,881
that you and your scum brothers have
your heads stoved in with mallets

224
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,321
and spades.

225
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,001
And your sister, too.

226
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:17,401
That baby inside her would
be of no consequence to me.

227
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:20,601
The only one to be spared

228
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:23,601
would be your little brother Finn.

229
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:27,841
He would, however, be lifted,
as a juvenile,

230
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:31,561
and dumped in that part
of the adult prison

231
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:36,561
where men have the most
appetite for boys like him.

232
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:41,641
Oh, that would be
a dark day indeed, Mr Shelby,

233
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:46,161
if my dismissal comes
before your decision.

234
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,521
You understand?

235
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,521
And know this,

236
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,681
the clock is ticking.

237
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:05,521
Look what we found.

238
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:09,921
Seems Stanley Chapman really
does have snow on his boots.

239
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:15,601
Come on. Here we go.

240
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:21,121
Mr Chapman...

241
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,241
You're fucked.

242
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:42,361
He still refuses to say
where it came from.

243
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,441
I'm sure with a little persuasion

244
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,881
he'll tell us everything he knows.

245
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:53,121
Including the whereabouts
of Freddie Thorne.

246
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:56,641
- Sir?
- Your face is a picture.

247
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,881
But I thought you'd done a deal.

248
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:02,481
- Oh, is that what you thought?
- Well, you gave your word.

249
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,961
My word.

250
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:12,201
People still talk about such
things in this idiotic century.

251
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:15,001
My word to who?

252
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:17,721
To a Peaky Blinder?

253
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:23,241
Now, go on and interrogate
Mr Chapman until he tells

254
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:26,121
us where we can find
Freddie Thorne and his wife.

255
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:29,761
The source of the money
is of secondary importance.

256
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:35,841
You think my campaign against
Shelby has become personal?

257
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,161
Correct.

258
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:41,441
Spot on, as they say in London society.

259
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:45,841
Now, go and interrogate Mr Chapman.

260
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:49,681
And do not make the mistake
of being too gentle.

261
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:52,681
Right, sir.

262
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:25,921
Today's her birthday.

263
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,201
I know you never miss it.

264
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:32,961
Then I'm lucky you're not a copper.

265
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:36,161
- What do you want?
- Came to warn you.

266
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:39,721
They've lifted Stanley Chapman.

267
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:43,521
How do you know?
Police don't spill that information.

268
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,641
I know because it was me and Tommy
who tipped him off.

269
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,641
Tommy did a deal.
In return for safe passage

270
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,801
for you and Ada,
he's given them Stanley and the money.

271
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:53,001
Money? What money?

272
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:59,041
- Who told you about the money?
- Who do you think?

273
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:02,881
Yeah, it was Ada's idea.

274
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:06,361
That's how desperate she is to get out
of that rat hole you're keeping her in.

275
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:12,361
She didn't mind if you knew, just didn't
want to be here when you found out.

276
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,961
Sometimes women have to take over.
Like in the war.

277
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,841
Who the hell do you think you are?
You fucking Shelbys!

278
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,561
Don't you swear over
your mother's grave.

279
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:25,081
You play your tune, you expect
the whole world to dance to it.

280
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,721
You don't have time for this, Freddie.

281
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,721
You did a deal for me.

282
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,481
Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.

283
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:34,401
And you think this copper
will keep his word?

284
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,561
If he does, you're safe.
If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up.

285
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,721
You'll still have to leave
town, same result.

286
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,401
- So neat.
- So leave.

287
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:46,481
Except there's one thing that
you've got wrong,

288
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:50,441
Stanley won't be able to give up my
address because he doesn't know it.

289
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:54,841
That's how it works.
None of us know each other's addresses.

290
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,361
So you've wasted your fucking time.

291
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:03,601
And they'll keep beating him and beating
him for information he doesn't have.

292
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:07,361
So all you've done is sign the
death warrant of a good man.

293
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:12,441
- So you won't leave?
- No, I won't fucking leave.

294
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:16,761
And if you want me out of Birmingham,
it'll have to be in a wooden box.

295
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:25,321
You lay a hand on our Ada and I'll
put you in a wooden box myself.

296
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,801
You raised a stubborn one there, Irene.

297
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:08,321
You told me to carry on.

298
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,001
I wanted to stop.

299
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:12,641
He had some kind of seizure.

300
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,001
So you killed him.

301
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:22,641
Did he give you an address?

302
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,721
What's the matter with you?
He fell down some stairs.

303
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:28,921
This is not bloody Belfast.

304
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:32,601
Not yet, but if men like him
get their way, it soon will be.

305
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:37,401
So find some stairs, throw him
down, and call the coroner.

306
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:40,361
Use Grayson.

307
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:43,001
If he has any awkward questions,

308
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:45,961
ask about the welfare of his mistress
in Saltley.

309
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,601
That'll shut him up.

310
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,801
To think I used to live
in a shithole like this.

311
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:58,841
Bloody animals.

312
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:01,721
The Shelbys really are doing
an excellent job for us.

313
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:04,561
We haven't lost a single penny to

314
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:06,881
rafflers or chalkers
in eight race meetings.

315
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:08,681
The bookies are purring.

316
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,961
So we throw the dog a bone.

317
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:13,201
I think so.

318
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:23,081
Mr Kimber, Mr Roberts,
come and have a look around.

319
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:32,001
After you.

320
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:43,161
Well, I thought the Lees
turned you over?

321
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:45,641
You shouldn't listen to gossip,
Mr Kimber. This way.

322
00:27:48,761 --> 00:27:50,041
Business is good.

323
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:52,841
Especially since now you know

324
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,121
which horse is going to win
before you set the odds.

325
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:57,961
Information is very much appreciated.

326
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:02,241
All right, well, where are they?

327
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:05,761
John, Lovelock. Scudboat, in here.

328
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,321
This is my team.

329
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:15,521
They will take up their pitch at your
convenience, Mr Kimber.

330
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:20,041
John is the book, Scudboat is the
bag man, and of course,

331
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,921
we bring our own protection.

332
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:29,121
Warwick, next Saturday,
at least 50 yards from the beer tent.

333
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:59,041
Gentleman, and lady.

334
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:02,481
I have in my hand

335
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:07,041
a legal betting license,
issued by the Board of Control.

336
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:12,961
The Shelby family has its first, legal

337
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:14,721
racetrack pitch.

338
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:25,721
Congratulations.

339
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,161
There you go.

340
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,841
Congratulations.

341
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,161
30, 40, 50...

342
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,721
These cigarettes
have a strange smell, Arthur.

343
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,881
They smell like rotting water.

344
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,201
And look,

345
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:48,721
rats have got into some of them.

346
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:51,441
They're stolen, are they not?

347
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:52,641
Don't ask.

348
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:55,081
They smell because you
keep them in the boat.

349
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,601
What do you care? Now, can you
come check my adding up, please?

350
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,481
You know, you should make a
new start of this place.

351
00:30:06,961 --> 00:30:08,041
Do it properly-

352
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:10,161
These cigarettes are not fit to sell.

353
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:11,921
Smells like Gallipoli.

354
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,321
You should find a new
place to store them.

355
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,681
It has to be far away from coppers.

356
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:18,161
Oh, but not rats.

357
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,481
All the wharves have rats, Grace.

358
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,921
What's wrong with a dry warehouse?

359
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:25,321
Tommy's orders.

360
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:28,561
What orders?

361
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:32,281
Always keep contraband near
petrol boat moorings.

362
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,201
Don't boats get searched?

363
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:35,881
We moor them at junctions.

364
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:38,841
So there's more than one way out.

365
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:42,041
No locks within a mile
so we can move that stuff,

366
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,601
fast.

367
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:45,921
Your brother doesn't obey the law,
but he has rules.

368
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:48,041
Precise man, your brother.

369
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:50,361
Is my adding up right?

370
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,601
It is now.

371
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:55,321
One.

372
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:56,801
Two.

373
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,081
Three.

374
00:30:58,561 --> 00:31:00,081
<i>And four.</i>

375
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:02,801
<i>And we'll search them one-by-one.</i>

376
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:13,441
Please, Lord, let that which
I seek be found here.

377
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,241
Not so much as a bullet, sir.

378
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:33,201
Just more cigarettes and whisky.

379
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:45,561
Arthur tells me you've
been asking questions.

380
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:49,001
About how we run our business

381
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,401
and how we get our booze

382
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:52,721
and where we keep it.

383
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:54,281
I'm just trying to help.

384
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:58,801
Let's you and me go for a walk.

385
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:01,481
Where to?

386
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:02,721
Come on.

387
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:13,321
Why here?

388
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,001
You're a good Catholic girl, aren't you?

389
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:21,281
Yes.

390
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:24,241
Well, then you know it's here
people come to confess.

391
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:27,161
After you.

392
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,161
Well, here it is, Grace.

393
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:43,401
I'll confess.

394
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:46,721
I need someone.

395
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:51,761
Kimber has an adviser by
the name of Roberts.

396
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:53,241
He talks well.

397
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:55,121
Keeps the accounts.

398
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:57,641
Runs the legal side of the business.

399
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:00,081
And you need a Roberts?

400
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:03,161
Arthur tells me you have ideas.

401
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:05,561
I'm not an accountant, nor a lawyer.

402
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:06,721
No.

403
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,481
No, but you have something I need.

404
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:11,961
Class.

405
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,441
I need someone who looks
right at the big meetings.

406
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:18,361
Epsom, Ascot.

407
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,761
Is this a job interview?

408
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:21,321
Arthur says you're good with numbers.

409
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:24,401
Oh, well, that's relative.
He's quite poor.

410
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,241
You keep the books in order.

411
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:28,561
They were chaotic.

412
00:33:29,561 --> 00:33:30,881
But you're a liar.

413
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,561
No Catholic girl would enter a church

414
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,401
and forget to make
the sign of the cross.

415
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:44,001
You're very perceptive.

416
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:46,921
First, you lied to me about that
pub you used to work in.

417
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:49,561
Now I find out you're a Protestant.

418
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:54,401
- Do you care?
- No.

419
00:33:55,321 --> 00:33:56,721
I like to fit in.

420
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,321
You pull a pint

421
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:01,081
like someone who's thinking about it.

422
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:03,081
This is not an interview,
this is an interrogation.

423
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:04,161
Sit down.

424
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:11,921
Look, Grace.

425
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:15,601
You've washed up in a
place you don't belong,

426
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:17,441
for whatever reason.

427
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:20,361
My good fortune.

428
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:21,721
And perhaps mine.

429
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:29,921
You know that most of
what I do is illegal?

430
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:31,841
I'm not blind.

431
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:34,441
And yet you'd still be
willing to work for me?

432
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:38,961
Are you offering me the job?

433
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:44,561
Then I accept.

434
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:47,921
There's something else you should know.

435
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:53,081
A very important detail about
my reasons for employing you.

436
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:15,401
You disappoint me.

437
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:20,361
You resign?

438
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:23,921
No.

439
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,201
My appetite for the work
has only increased.

440
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:35,281
Tomorrow I'll show you around.

441
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:49,761
Lizzie!

442
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,201
Hello, Lizzie?

443
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:55,601
That bag looks heavy. jump in!

444
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:57,081
It is.

445
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,441
You like kids?

446
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,601
- Yeah.
- Good,

447
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,081
because John's got four of them.

448
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:06,481
It's all right, I'm not going
to try to talk you out of it.

449
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,761
I just want to talk.

450
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:26,681
Then you're against us?

451
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:29,161
John is his own man.

452
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:31,521
And you're your own woman.

453
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:36,961
Now, Lizzie,

454
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:41,241
since I came back from France,
I've come to you on many occasions.

455
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:44,601
Tommy, you didn't tell him?

456
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:46,361
No, I didn't tell him.

457
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:49,201
Just like you didn't tell him.

458
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:52,041
Now, why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?

459
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:54,521
Why didn't you tell him

460
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:57,921
that you've been serving
his brother for the past two years?

461
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:01,001
Because the past is the past.

462
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,921
I don't want to lose him.
He's a good man.

463
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:09,681
That was the answer I was hoping
you'd give. The past is the past.

464
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:12,121
You see, our john says you've changed.

465
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:14,641
And I believe him, and that's good.

466
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:16,361
Change is good.

467
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:20,201
These are new times I'm told.

468
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,041
So I wish you both every happiness.

469
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:31,961
And I want you to see that as
my wedding gift to you

470
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:34,801
and our farewell

471
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:36,081
to pleasures gone by.

472
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:50,241
You mean...

473
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:52,641
One last time?

474
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:56,081
One last time.

475
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:57,481
You and me.

476
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:01,681
It's eight bloody pounds.

477
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:23,201
So where should we go?

478
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,361
Tommy, should we go to my lodging?

479
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,121
So the past is not the past.

480
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:39,201
You can keep the money, Lizzie,
just get out of the car.

481
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,041
- Tommy, please!
-just get out of the car.

482
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:43,121
I love him, Tommy, really.

483
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,281
Really.

484
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:55,681
John will make his own decision.

485
00:38:57,521 --> 00:38:58,681
But he will have the facts.

486
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:04,001
Your brother is ten times
the man you are.

487
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,081
Of that I have no doubt.

488
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,281
Well, he's obviously not stupid.

489
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:42,401
All we found was stolen
tobacco and whisky.

490
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:43,961
Which you left it in place?

491
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:45,401
Of course.

492
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:47,321
I would never endanger you.

493
00:39:52,881 --> 00:39:54,041
You're doing well, Grace.

494
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:57,921
I've been working on Arthur.
He's easier.

495
00:39:58,721 --> 00:39:59,721
Than Thomas?

496
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:00,841
Yes.

497
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:02,761
Less intelligent.

498
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:04,881
Yes.

499
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:07,641
That's not a word you'd
use about Thomas.

500
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:08,841
It's your word.

501
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:12,601
He has promoted me.

502
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:16,521
He wants me to be
his bookkeeper and secretary.

503
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:21,121
A cut-throat gangster with a secretary.

504
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:25,321
The pretensions of these
hoodlums are quite breathtaking.

505
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:27,081
Are they not?

506
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:29,321
Yes, quite breathtaking.

507
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,681
He's obviously fallen
quite heavily for you.

508
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:37,521
I thought you'd be pleased.

509
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,041
I just hope you remember who
you're dealing with, here.

510
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:44,161
A man who cuts off ears
and cuts out tongues.

511
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,521
I know what he is, sir.

512
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:54,001
The difficulty with undercover work,
Grace, is to remember what you are.

513
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:57,641
I come here with
good news and I get this?

514
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:02,721
Grace.

515
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:21,681
Tommy.

516
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:23,481
I need a favour.

517
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,001
I want to borrow the car.

518
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:27,841
I want to take Lizzie for a ride
in the country with the kids.

519
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:30,201
I'm going to celebrate
getting the license.

520
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,001
Not a problem,john.

521
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:34,881
I need the keys.

522
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:38,721
Look, john, you're my brother.

523
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:42,641
There's something I have to tell you.

524
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:47,761
Yesterday, in the front
seat of that ca r,

525
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:50,201
I offered Lizzie some money.

526
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:52,921
And, john,

527
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:55,041
she said yes.

528
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:58,481
Now that's a fact.

529
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,241
You do with it what you want.

530
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:02,561
You can take the keys,

531
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:07,001
take Lizzie to the country.
Marry her, if you want.

532
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:09,961
But you have to know...

533
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:12,881
She said yes.

534
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:57,481
Get another glass.

535
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,121
Can you make a toast?

536
00:43:10,441 --> 00:43:12,801
I'm Irish, I can make a million toasts.

537
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:17,281
May you be in Heaven a full half-hour
before the devil knows you're dead.

538
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:25,521
What are we celebrating?

539
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:28,441
Contract of employment.

540
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:32,841
"Bookkeeper, Shelby Brothers Limited."

541
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:35,161
I don't like that word, "Limited".

542
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:37,761
To be respectable,
you have to be limited.

543
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:39,521
That's what worries me.

544
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:42,881
I had the phone put in.

545
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,081
It's in the back.

546
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:50,481
Huh. If I knew someone
else who had a phone,

547
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,281
we could call them.

548
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:55,761
And since we're celebrating,

549
00:43:57,361 --> 00:44:00,201
I had this delivered from
Rackhams department store.

550
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:05,561
Will you open it?

551
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:08,201
No.

552
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:10,641
Save it for a special occasion.

553
00:44:12,721 --> 00:44:14,441
<i>A“ fight, your first 'gob
for the company.</i>

554
00:44:15,201 --> 00:44:16,641
I want you to get that to my sister.

555
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:18,641
You don't see her?

556
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:21,281
No one does. She's hiding from me.

557
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:26,761
I was told she goes to a bathhouse
on Montague Street

558
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:28,641
on women-only days.

559
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:31,481
She goes in disguise so
I need to get someone inside.

560
00:44:32,441 --> 00:44:33,441
What am I delivering?

561
00:44:36,321 --> 00:44:37,681
It's an invitation

562
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:40,281
to a family occasion. I want her there.

563
00:44:41,001 --> 00:44:42,361
Tell her there'll be a truce.

564
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:44,401
Am I delivering bait for a trap?

565
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:47,001
If you take that contract,

566
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:50,001
I think you'll find it doesn't say
anything about asking questions.

567
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:51,801
Just give her the invitation.

568
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:55,881
And put that thing in the
cupboard till I say.

569
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:39,321
Bloody hell, john.

570
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:41,481
I couldn't get it lit.
Couldn't even do that.

571
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,801
What do you want to be smoking that for?

572
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:45,481
Same reason as you.

573
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:47,241
Pain in the head.

574
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:59,841
I spoke to Lizzie.

575
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:02,001
Told her what you told me.

576
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,641
She said, "Your brother Tommy
is a dirty liar."

577
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:10,961
And then I spoke to her
sister and her cousin.

578
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,921
I bought them a couple of drinks.

579
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,201
Just a few regulars, they said.

580
00:46:17,161 --> 00:46:18,361
That's all.

581
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:22,441
To keep the wolf from
the door she still sees

582
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:24,161
a couple of regulars.

583
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:27,761
You must think I'm an idiot!

584
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,321
I think you're the first
Shelby in history

585
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:43,041
to have a legal license for anything.

586
00:46:46,121 --> 00:46:47,921
What would our granddad say, eh?

587
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:50,921
He'd be turning in his grave.

588
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,521
"Honest bloody money!

589
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:57,241
"Hey, in this house? Here?"

590
00:46:57,321 --> 00:46:59,561
You always used to do voices
when we were kids.

591
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:05,681
Well, we're not kids now, john.

592
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:10,481
But we still have to look
out for each other, right?

593
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:14,681
Yeah.

594
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:17,201
Yeah.

595
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:19,601
Come on, go home.

596
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:21,881
Get some sleep.

597
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:24,801
We've got a big day tomorrow.

598
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,801
We have?

599
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:31,401
Tomorrow, we finish the war
with the Lees for once and for all.

600
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:35,721
- Since when?
- Since just now.

601
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:38,081
Ten o'clock, tomorrow.

602
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,321
Be ready for anything.

603
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:51,881
How do you go, boys?

604
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:56,521
Ready, boys?

605
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,001
<i>Eh“, ready?</i>

606
00:47:59,241 --> 00:48:01,321
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Have a drink.

607
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:11,921
What? What are you all
staring at me for?

608
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:15,201
- What?
- Good. Let's go.

609
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:18,121
What?

610
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,001
Tommy, what are you playing at?
We're at shotgun range.

611
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,521
John,

612
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:39,681
before you go into battle,

613
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:42,081
there's something you're going to need.

614
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,321
What are you bloody doing, Tommy?

615
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:50,881
Smile, john. It's a wedding.

616
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:52,201
Whose bloody wedding?

617
00:48:52,281 --> 00:48:54,321
Now, if we told you,
you wouldn't have come.

618
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:57,001
There's a girl in the Lee family

619
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:59,481
who's gone a bit wild
and she needs marrying off.

620
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,481
- Ah, fuck!
- John, boy!

621
00:49:03,121 --> 00:49:05,761
- John!
- You have no bloody right, Tommy!

622
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:08,161
Shh. Shh. Listen to me! Listen to me!

623
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:13,081
A girl who needs a husband,
a man who needs a wife.

624
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:19,281
Tom, I'm not bloody marrying some
fucking mushroom picker..

625
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:21,561
Shh,john boy. Come on, listen.

626
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:24,801
I've already betrothed you.

627
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:29,281
So if you back out now, there's going
to be one fucking mighty war

628
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:31,121
breaking out here that's
going to make the Somme...

629
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:34,281
That's going to make the Somme
look like a fucking tea party.

630
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,161
But if you marry her,

631
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:39,081
our family and the Lee family

632
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:40,881
will be united forever

633
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:42,361
and this war will be over.

634
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:43,881
Now, it's up to you, john.

635
00:49:44,801 --> 00:49:45,801
War

636
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:48,361
or peace?

637
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:52,401
Let go of me!

638
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:07,201
Right.

639
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:09,601
You should see the size of her dowry.

640
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:11,641
Her what?

641
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:13,961
Her dad's giving you a car.

642
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,521
Will he do?

643
00:50:31,081 --> 00:50:32,081
He'll do.

644
00:50:40,441 --> 00:50:41,441
Here she is.

645
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:42,801
She'd better be under 50.

646
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:44,881
Come here.

647
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,001
Go on.

648
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:58,041
We're here today to
join in matrimony,

649
00:50:58,561 --> 00:51:01,001
this man and this woman...

650
00:51:02,681 --> 00:51:03,921
You look well.

651
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:06,961
And harmony and togetherness

652
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:12,321
which is sanctioned and honoured
by the presence and the power

653
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:14,201
of these two families around us.

654
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:19,441
Do you, john Michael Shelby,

655
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:22,281
take Esme Martha Lee to be your
beautiful young wife?

656
00:51:22,361 --> 00:51:23,481
You got my invitation?

657
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:26,001
Grace said there's a truce.

658
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,321
Family day.

659
00:51:30,641 --> 00:51:31,961
Your husband couldn't make it?

660
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:34,041
He's not speaking to me.

661
00:51:34,561 --> 00:51:37,161
And when he does he calls me a
"Fucking Shelby"

662
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:39,001
even though I'm a Thorne now.

663
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:40,721
A thorn in my side, that's for sure.

664
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:45,481
My God, Tommy,

665
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:48,241
you admire him, don't you?

666
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:50,521
There remains
one more part of the ceremony.

667
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:52,241
It's the mingling of the two bloods.

668
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:57,281
So the two families
become the one family.

669
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:01,921
I now pronounce you man and wife!

670
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,081
Well, john, kiss the bride,
will you?

671
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:04,601
And again!

672
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:07,681
You should tell Ada to slow down.

673
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:09,521
You think she'll listen to me?

674
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:12,121
I've tried stopping her but
she's been drinking.

675
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:16,081
She's been stuck in that little basement
for weeks, what do we expect?

676
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:18,801
She's going off like a firecracker.
Oh, Christ, Tommy, please.

677
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:26,401
Ada, come on, have a rest. Sit down.

678
00:53:26,481 --> 00:53:28,001
Come and look, Esme.

679
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:30,081
Come and look at the family
you've joined.

680
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:31,721
Come and look at the man who runs it!

681
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,841
Chooses his brothers' wives for them!

682
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:37,161
He hunts his own sister down like a rat,

683
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:39,561
and he tries to kill his
own brother-in-law!

684
00:53:39,641 --> 00:53:40,641
Ada, that's enough!

685
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,921
And now he won't even let
me have a fucking dance!

686
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:44,921
- Ada!
- Not even at a fucking wedding!

687
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:46,721
- Sit her down.
- Calm down, Ada.

688
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:48,601
Ada, calm down.

689
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:51,641
Holy shit.

690
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:53,481
Water. Right.

691
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:57,041
Not now, Ada!
Bloody hell, you do pick your times!

692
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:06,801
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

693
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:09,321
Let's go! Whoa.

694
00:54:09,401 --> 00:54:11,081
Slow it up, nice and easy.

695
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:13,881
Story of your fucking life.
Right, we're here.

696
00:54:17,361 --> 00:54:18,441
Come on.

697
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:22,881
Nice car,john. How's she run?

698
00:54:22,961 --> 00:54:24,761
Yeah, beautiful, really smooth.

699
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:27,561
Your sister's in there giving birth,
you're talking about the bloody car.

700
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:29,201
Not much us men can do now, Pol.

701
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:31,201
- Except go get drunk.
- Right, c'mon.

702
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:32,281
One man should be here.

703
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:38,681
You're right, Pol.

704
00:54:39,201 --> 00:54:40,521
Freddie should be here.

705
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:43,241
Is that a heartbeat
I hear inside that chest?

706
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:45,241
The truce lasts until sunrise.

707
00:54:46,001 --> 00:54:48,001
On my oath. Tell Freddie it's safe.

708
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:49,721
Ada!

709
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:50,961
All right, boys,

710
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,641
let's wet this baby's head.

711
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:57,441
Keep going. That's right.

712
00:54:57,601 --> 00:54:58,601
Push!

713
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:06,161
I think it might be
the wrong way around.

714
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:09,361
I attended three sisters.

715
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,921
- Yeah, I think you're right.
- We should move her forward.

716
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,041
Come on, Ada.

717
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:15,961
All right, come on.

718
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:19,041
It's not long to go now, darling.

719
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:23,241
Push, two, three!

720
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:25,401
To a beautiful wedding.

721
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:28,001
I should go.

722
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:30,161
- I should go soon.
- No, no, no, no.

723
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:31,241
No, you sit down.

724
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:33,521
You don't want to be among women

725
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:35,401
when there's a baby coming.
Have another.

726
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:37,681
Do you think her husband will take
the same advice and stay away?

727
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:40,561
No, no, Freddie'll be there.

728
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:42,801
Nothing'll keep him away.

729
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,961
Tommy said it's all right
for him to be there.

730
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:46,881
Isn't that right, Tommy?

731
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:49,041
That's right. I'm all heart tonight.

732
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:56,241
You know what, john?

733
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,281
I think it's that lovely barmaid,

734
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:02,481
that pretty barmaid
that just walked out,

735
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:05,281
that's made our brother go all soft.

736
00:56:05,481 --> 00:56:06,721
Drinks to that!

737
00:56:22,761 --> 00:56:23,961
Ada!

738
00:56:28,201 --> 00:56:29,721
Come on, open up!

739
00:56:33,801 --> 00:56:34,801
There you go, love.

740
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:41,761
He's beautiful.

741
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,281
It's a boy, Freddie.

742
00:56:54,361 --> 00:56:56,521
It's a beautiful baby boy.

743
00:57:07,521 --> 00:57:08,761
There you go.

744
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,921
Welcome to the world, Son.

745
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,961
Welcome.

746
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:17,481
Open up, Police!

747
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:20,241
Freddie?

748
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:23,121
You can't come in here!
There's a baby that's just been born.

749
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:24,321
Freddie!
There's a baby!

750
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:26,201
Don't do this here.

751
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:28,001
Don't hurt him! Freddie!

752
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:30,961
You're hurting him! Leave him alone!

753
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,161
You're taking me away from my baby.

754
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:36,361
- Ada!
- Freddie!

755
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:37,881
Ada!

756
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:54,601
You want me to open that champagne now?

757
00:57:56,921 --> 00:57:58,121
It's a boy.

758
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:02,241
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

759
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:04,161
Oi, Polly! Polly!

760
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:07,041
But the police came and
took his father away!

761
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:09,881
Don't you dare look at me like that!

762
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:20,041
You liar!

763
00:58:49,441 --> 00:58:54,441
<i># Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the track #</i>
