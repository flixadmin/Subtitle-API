Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.

00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,045
Our top story tonight,

16
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,464
Just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

17
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,384
and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Real in a dead heat.

18
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,969
Things certainly got hot last night

19
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,514
in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.

20
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,644
Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,

21
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,479
established by the great Thomas Wayne.

22
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,315
Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall

23
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,858
and the safety net
for those who need it.

24
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:34,112
The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.

25
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,990
Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.

26
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,450
Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.

the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.

31
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,379
The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.

32
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,756
But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.

33
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:53,852
It's gotten worse.

a bump in the new Post poll.

Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

not a cheerleader.

Killer may have come
through the skylight.

168
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,013
[Gordon] You said there was a card.

169
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,681
[lead detective] Yeah.

170
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,861
[Gordon] "From your secret friend. Whoo?

171
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,864
Haven't a clue?

172
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,325
Let's play a game, just me and you.

173
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,912
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

174
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,332
There's a cipher too.

175
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,966
Any of this mean anything to you?

176
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,719
What's going on here?

177
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,224
I asked him to come, Pete.

178
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,976
[Pete] This is a crime scene.

179
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,395
It's Mitchell, for christ sakes!

180
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,480
I got the press downstairs.

181
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,316
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

182
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,235
But this is way over the line.

183
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,043
Wait.

184
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,783
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

185
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:52,046
How do you know?

186
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,079
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

187
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,914
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

188
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,624
[Gordon] I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

189
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,251
He lies still.

190
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,952
Excuse me?

191
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,497
The riddle.

192
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,385
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

193
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,021
Oh, Jesus.

194
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,068
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

195
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,905
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

196
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,324
[Martinez] Excuse me, Commissioner.

197
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,076
They're ready for your statement.

198
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,832
I want him outta here.

199
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,658
Now!

200
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,342
Come on.

201
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,796
[camera shutter clicking]

202
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,356
Yeah.

203
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,025
The kid found him.

204
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,033
[detective] Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

205
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,369
[melancholy song playing]

206
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,635
We really gotta go, man.

207
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,936
[Pete] Tonight, a son lost a father.

208
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,230
A wife lost a husband.

209
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,983
And I lost a friend.

210
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,611
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

211
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,781
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

212
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,409
This was a truly senseless crime,

213
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,580
and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have

214
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,750
in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.

215
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,085
I've spoken to the governor...

216
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,005
[Bruce] I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

217
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,673
but I don't know.

218
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,426
[melancholy song continues]

219
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,473
Murder, robberies, assault.

220
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,642
Two years later, they're all up.

221
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,728
And now this.

222
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,481
The city's eating itself.

223
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,444
Maybe it's beyond saving.

224
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,823
But I have to try.

225
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,867
Push myself.

226
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,328
[melancholy song continues]

[bats chittering]

229
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,457
These nights all roll together in a rush

230
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,335
behind the mask.

231
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,133
Sometimes in the morning,

232
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,096
I have to force myself to remember

233
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,058
everything that happened.

234
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,435
[groaning]

235

[newscaster on TV] Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.

236
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,161
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

237
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,081
was found murdered last night
inside his home

238
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,916
in the exclusive Crest Hill district.

239
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,668
[newscaster 2]
Exact details of the crime

240
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,253
still have not been released,

241
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,214
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

242
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,551
as police and FBI search
for the brazen Killer.

243
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,469
And this certainly is not the first time

244
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,097
Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.

245
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,435
In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week

246
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,270
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

247
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,313
Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha

248
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,233
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

249
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,154
It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.

250
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,030
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career

251
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,783
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

252
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,120
when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,

253
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,166
resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni

254
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,420
with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.

255
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,921
I assume you heard about this.

[newscaster 2 continues indistinctly]

Oh, I see.

[Gordon on video]
All this blood is from his head?

Dear God.

I asked him to come, Pete.

Apparently.

00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,303
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

268
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,681
Why is he writing to you?

269
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,183
[Pete]
It's Mitchell, for christ sakes!

270
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:50,362
I don't know yet.

271
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,936
[Pete] I got the press downstairs.

272
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,231
Have a shower.

00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,359

Here? Why?

276
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:02,666
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

277
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,834
I haven't got time for this.

278
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,533
It's getting serious, Bruce.

279
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,702
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

280
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,371
I don't care about that.

281
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,218
Any of that.

282
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,749
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

283
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,255
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

284
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,507
If I can't change things here,

285
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,968
if I can't have an effect,

286
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,679
then I don't care what happens to me.

287
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:27,942
That's what I'm afraid of.

This is actually quite elusive.

[Alfred smacks lips]

301
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,111
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

302
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,614
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

303
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,743
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

See them in, please, Dory.

[Bruce] What if it's not a partial key?

What do you mean?

312
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,305
What if this is the whole key?

313
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,767
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

314
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,894
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

Blank. Yeah, I understand.

316
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,356
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

On Halloween night,

I killed your mayor because he was not

00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,795
[Gil] You wanna take a seat over there?

661
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,964
- Richie, Glen.
- [Richie] Hey.

662
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,925
That's half the DA's office.

663
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,208
[Gil] You know Carla here, huh?

664
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:50,272
Hi.

665
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,346
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

666
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,306
Drowning our sorrows.

667
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,933
You want a drop?

668
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,060
[Selina] Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.

669
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,770
[music continues on speakers]

670
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,689
Hope you don't mind.

671
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,816
I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.

672
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:05,287
He's wasted.

673
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,517
No shit.

674
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,228
[chuckles] I like this girl.

675
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,073
Oh, hey, I like you too!

676
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,955
I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.

677
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:19,176
He knows so much.

678
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,499
[Travis] He doesn't know shit, man.

679
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,835
[Gil] What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...

680
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:23,889
[Richie] Hey, hey, Gil, come on.

681
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,838
- Think maybe you had a little too much.
- Hey. The rat.

682
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,882
- [Richie] Slow down.
- Ask him about the rat.

683
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,719
[Selina] Hey, what's this about a rat?

684
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,599
[inhales deeply]

685
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,272
I mean...

686
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,693
there was a rat. We had an informant.

687
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,696
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

688
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,490
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

689
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,158
He's talking about the Maroni case.

690
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,536
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

691
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,414
And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.

692
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,416
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

693
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,127
This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.

694
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,462
What do you know about that?

695
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,288
Does anybody want a drink?

696
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:10,436
[Gil] I want a drink.

697
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,717
Keep him talking.

698
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:15,941
Wait, where are you going?

699
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,067
She knows Annika.

700
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,516
No, stay on the DA.

701
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,518
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

702
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,772
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

703
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:25,951
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

704
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,526
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.

705
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,860
What, you got a death wish?

706
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,404
[man] Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

707
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,407
[Carla]
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

708
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,992
Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?

709
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,276
[Carla] Sure thing, Oz.

710
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,115
Hey.

711
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,742
Hey.

712
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,964
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

713
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,466
How you been?

714
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,512
Yeah, I've been okay.

715
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,223
I was just...

716
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,102
I was just headed back upstairs.

717
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,052
Well...

718
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,606
don't be a stranger.

719
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,081
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

720
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,749
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

721
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,626
I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?

722
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,545
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- Forget it.

723
00:51:29,575 --> 00:51:30,766
Wait, what are you doing?

724
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,215
- Listen, I can't do this anymore.
- No! No!

725
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,883
[line breaking up]

[static buzzes, stream stops]

727
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,003
[Selina] Taxi!

00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,556
[heavy breathing]

729
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,966
[Gil] Hey!

730
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:46,615
I lost you in there.

731
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,845
Yeah, I gotta go.

732
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,024
Oh, you need a ride?

733
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,026
That's me right there.

734
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,278
[eerie music playing]

735
00:51:58,053 --> 00:51:59,253
Taxi!

736
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,483
I'm good.

737
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,537
I hope, uh...

738
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,543
I'll see you around.

739
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:10,827

[Gil grunting weakly]

- [Gil grunts]
- [Riddler shushes]

751
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:40,008
Just hold still.

752
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,678
- [beeping]
- [Gil whimpers]

[switch clicks]

757
00:54:38,129 --> 00:54:39,329
[Batman] What do you know about

758
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,653
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

759
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,450
Yeah, sure, there was.

760
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,994
That's the rat we're looking for.

761
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,789
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

762
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,375
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

763
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,919
Where are you getting this?

764
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,880
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

765
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,132
Gil's very nervous.

766
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,636
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

767
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,596
I worked that case.

768
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,640
Riddler's not after you.

769
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,923
How do you know?

770
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,434
You're not corrupt.

771
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,020
Colson's dirty?

772
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,402
Maybe I, uh...

773
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,406
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

774
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,785
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

775
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,329
Who knows how many people it touches.

776
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,624
Politicians. Police. The courts.

777
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,627
It could tear the whole city apart.

778
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,088
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

779
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,466
[Batman] And Riddler's the match.

780
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,542
[Batman on video]
You know Carmine Falcone.

781
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,886
[Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.

782
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,388
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

783
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,973
[Selina] I don't have a relationship...

784
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:51,985
[video rewinds]

785
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,600
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

786
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,352
[Selina] I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?

787
00:55:55,382 --> 00:55:56,448
[video rewinds]

788
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,938
[Batman] You know Carmine Falcone.

789
00:55:57,968 --> 00:55:59,117
[Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.

790
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,774
[Batman] You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

791
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,693
[Selina] I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?

792
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,027
- [Alfred] Pretty.
- [tape clicks off]

793
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,406
She a new friend of yours?

794
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,203
I'm not so sure.

795
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,539
Looks like you upset her.

796
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,834
Shall I take this as a good sign?

797
00:56:18,864 --> 00:56:19,972
What?

798
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:20,973
Your attire.

799
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,130
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

800
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,215
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

801
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,968
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

802
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,596
Riddler might not be able to resist.

803
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,139
Oh, that reminds me.

804
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:37,269
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

805
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,313
The one from the rat maze.

806
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,816
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

807
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,027
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

808
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,363
"You are El Rata Alada."

809
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,407
[Bruce] Rata Alada?

810
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,700
"Rat with wings"?

811
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,286
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

812
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,621
Yeah.

813
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,280
A stool pigeon.

814
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,083
Where are your cufflinks?

815
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,367
I couldn't find them.

816
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:04,546
Well, you can't go out like that.

817
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,423
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

818
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,388
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

819
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:14,672
[scoffs]

820
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,309

Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

839

Hey, watch it, fellas.

840
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,715
You got the prince of the city there.

841
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,386
Some event, huh?

842
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,431
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

845
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,771
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

846
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,065
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

847

Wow. Is that right?

His father saved my life.

849
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,448
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

850
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:41,161
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

I remember your face.

854
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,385
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

855
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,888
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

856
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,808
"Hippocratic oath."

857

01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,626
thank you all for
coming to today's memorial

01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,087
for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.

Our program will begin shortly.

the mayor's memory

Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

I'm sorry?

I'm Bella Real. I'm running for mayor.

I wouldn't be bothering you here,

you're unavailable.

you're not doing anything.

01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,454
You hear me?

986
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,738
[softly] Okay.

987
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,707
[Riddler groaning comically]

988
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,753
[Riddler laughing]

989
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,383
[Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.

990
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,303
No one ever gave me a chance.

991
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,547
Now,

992
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:44,185
ever since I was a child,

993
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:47,855
I've always loved little puzzles.

994
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,858
For me, they are a retreat

995
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:54,279
from the horrors of our world.

996
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:59,576
Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.

997
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,911
- You want me to do puzzles?
- [chuckles excitedly]

998
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,747
Three riddles in two minutes.

999
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,918
You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.

1000
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,337
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

1001
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,590
Okay, okay. So I just...

1002
01:08:13,652 --> 01:08:14,852
- You want me to...
- [device beeps]

1003
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,218
- [whimpers]
- Riddle number one...

1004
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,930
- [timer beeping]
- "It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,

1005
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:25,685
but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

1006
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,187
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

1007
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:29,409
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

1008
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,857
- "Justice."
- Huh?

1009
01:08:30,887 --> 01:08:32,036
The answer's "justice."

1010
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,276
- Justice?
- Yes!

1011
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,944
- Oh, God.
- Justice!

1012
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:39,365
[dramatically] And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,

1013
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,826
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

1014
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,287
were you not, Mr. Colson?

1015
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,580
Of course, of course. Of course.

1016
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,041
Riddle number two.

1017
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,253
"If you are justice, please do not lie.

1018
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:56,507
What is the price for your blind eye?"

1019
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,384
- "The price"?
- [Batman] "Bribes."

1020
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,719
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

1021
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,971
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

1022
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,306
[hesitating]

1023
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:04,569
[shouting] Fifty-eight seconds!

1024
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:05,850
- How much?
- Nothing!

1025
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,144
- [raises voice] How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

1026
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,521
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

1027
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:11,492
What cases?

1028
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:12,702
He didn't ask me that!

1029
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:13,932
- Come on! Ten grand.
- [Riddler laughing]

1030
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:17,153
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1031
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,864
Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.

1032
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:23,785
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

1033
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,287
[singsongy] Last riddle.

1034
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:30,708
[dramatically]
"Since your justice is so select,

1035
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:35,088
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

1036
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,256
- "Which vermin"?
- [Batman] The rat.

1037
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,884
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

1038
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,761
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

1039
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,054
Twenty seconds.

1040
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,806
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

1041
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,849
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

1042
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,476
If 1 go out this way, it's just me.

1043
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,688
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

1044
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,231
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

1045
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,649
- People are watching.
- What people?

1046
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,859
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

1047
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,112
- It's the whole system!
- Five!

1048
01:09:59,142 --> 01:10:00,124
- Four!
- [beeping rapidly]

1049
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,531
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- Three!

1050
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,491
- Goodbye!
- [device trills]

1051
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,900
[Batman grunts]

1052
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,830
[people gasp]

1053
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,999
[ears ringing]

1054
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,211
[muffled, indistinct shouting]

01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,558
[ringing intensifies]

1056

[ringing stops]

1057
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,064
[Martinez]
Who do you think he is under there?

1058
01:10:35,094 --> 01:10:36,035
[Gordon] Take it easy.

1059
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,265
[Martinez] I want to see.

1060
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,610
[medic] What is that thing? Leather?

1061
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,824
[medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?

1062
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,367
[Martinez] Who cares?
I want to see his face.

1063
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,660
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

1064
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:48,944
- [Gordon] Hey!
- [officers clamoring]

1065
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,623
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1066
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,375
Relax, God damn it!

1067
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,960
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

1068
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,922
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

1069
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,425
Colson's blood is on his hands.

1070
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,926
Maybe it's on yours.

1071
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:06,482
What'd you say?

1072
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,097
He would rather die than talk.

1073
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,183
What was he afraid of?

1074
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,133
You?

1075
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,519
[menacing music playing]

1076
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,568
You son of a bitch.

1077
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,155
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

1078
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,948
You could be an accessory to murder.

1079
01:11:25,978 --> 01:11:27,128
[officer] Why are we playing games...

1080
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,826
[officers clamoring]

1081
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:30,089
[Officer 2] Get him! Come on!

1082
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,121
Back off! Back off!

1083
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,499
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

1084
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:36,667
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

1085
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:39,545
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

1086
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,672
[breathing heavily]

1087
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,758
You too now?

1088
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,385
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

1089
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:49,055
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

1090
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,390
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

1091
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,686
Okay, give him the room.

1092
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,620
Two minutes.

1093
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:25,967
You listen to me.

1094
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,554
[softly] We gotta get you out of here.

1095
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,182
That would put a lot of heat on you.

1096
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,934
Well, you punched me in the face.

1097
01:12:35,956 --> 01:12:37,156
[Batman scoffs]

1098
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,479
Take this key.

1099
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:43,150
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

1100
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,903
[Kenzie] Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

1101
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,198
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

1102
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,868
[suspenseful music playing]

1103
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:54,954
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

1104
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,085
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

1105
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:04,088
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1106
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,633
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

1107
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,305
Or he moonlights as a cop.

1108
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,394
- [officer] Jesus Christ!
- [Kenzie] Go!

1109
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,979
[officer 2] Somebody stop him!

1110
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,440

[groaning]

1118
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,025
[Gordon] Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

1119
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,777
I did.

1120
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,239
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

1121
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,366
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

1122
01:14:55,429 --> 01:14:56,629
I only trust you.

1123
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,995
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

1124
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,456
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

1125
01:15:03,187 --> 01:15:04,387
You think Penguin's the rat?

1126
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,461
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

1127
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,505
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

1128
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:10,923
DA was a regular too.

1129
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,510
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

1130
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:16,804
The Rata Alada.

1131
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:17,900
The what?

1132
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,390
Riddler's latest.

1133
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,183
The cipher in the maze.

1134
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,769
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

1135
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,981
A penguin's got wings too.

1136
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,943
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

1137
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,695
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

1138
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,990
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

1139
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:39,243
You want to find Riddler,

[Batman] I'm here.

- [man] Yeah, good. How are you?

This is a buy.

1156
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:49,563
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

1157
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:50,847
Or they never shut it down at all.

would do to me

if he heard this kind of talk?

Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

Yeah!

He doesn't make mistakes.

would owe you anything.

Yeah.

I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1447

Used to see him there.

1448
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,544
He scared the shit out of me.

1449
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:08,966
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:13,346
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1451
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:19,060
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

Strangled.

1453

Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:29,070
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1455
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:31,322
and he didn't say a thing.

1456
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,951
Couldn't even look at me.

1457

I'm sorry.

that giving back

But what is their real legacy?

Twenty years ago, one reporter set out

He found shocking family secrets.

How, when Martha was just a child,

her mother brutally murdered her father,

and money to cover it up.

How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years

and they didn't want anyone to know.

Well, I never seen him like that.

It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1624
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:53,318
He was protecting your mother.

1625
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:57,823
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1626
01:48:57,906 --> 01:49:00,034
He cared about her,

1627
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:01,410
and you,

1628
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:04,413
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1629
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:07,958
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1630
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:12,171
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1631
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:15,382
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1632
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:17,301
That's who Falcone is.

1633
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:21,764
And that was your father's mistake.

1634
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:23,891
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1635
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,727
your father was distraught.

1636
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:30,814
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1637
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:33,067
that he would confess everything.

1638
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:36,570
And that night,

1639
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:40,574
your father and your mother were Killed.

1640
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:45,162
[soft music playing]

1641
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,831
It was Falcone?

1642
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:53,796
[smacks lips]

1643
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:56,006
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1644
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,264
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1645
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:07,101
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1646
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:12,397
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1647
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:18,028
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1648
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:20,489
I know you always blamed yourself.

1649
01:50:20,572 --> 01:50:23,117
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1650
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:27,579
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1651
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:31,375
but I didn't know how to help.

1652
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,961
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1653
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:38,006
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1654
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,925
You needed a father.

1655
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,304
And all you had was me.

1656
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:47,891
I'm sorry.

1657
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,562
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1658
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,560
God.

1659
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:06,910
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1660
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:11,748
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1661
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:19,423
I mean,

1662
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:22,759
I'm not afraid to die.

1663
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,889
I realize now there's something.

1664
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:29,892
I haven't got past.

1665
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:32,561
This fear...

1666
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:37,983
of ever going through any of that again.

1667
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:44,448
Of losing somebody I care about.

1668
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:48,076
[soft music continues]

[engine revving]

1671
01:52:34,853 --> 01:52:36,053
Hey.

1672
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:38,835
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1673
01:52:38,919 --> 01:52:40,837
I thought it was you.

1674
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,385
[both grunting]

1675
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:55,310
- I found him!
- I see that.

1676
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:56,895
He had my shit and my phone.

1677
01:52:56,979 --> 01:52:58,188
She left a message
the night they took her.

1678
01:52:58,218 --> 01:52:59,243
She called me...

1679
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:00,983
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1680
01:53:01,066 --> 01:53:02,359
She got my gun!

1681
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,664
[grunts]

1682
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:05,404
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1683
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:09,491
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1684
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:16,164
- [cell phone beeps]
- Here. Listen.

1685
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:19,793
[Kenzie on recording]
Hey! Get back here!

1686
01:53:19,918 --> 01:53:22,087
- [Annika whimpering]
- Where you going? Come back here!

1687
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:24,256
[Falcone] Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1688
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:25,674
You're scaring her.

1689
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,467
[Kenzie] I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1690
01:53:27,497 --> 01:53:28,647
[Annika, tearfully]
Please, please, please.

1691
01:53:28,677 --> 01:53:29,970
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1692
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:32,723
[Falcone]
Hey, don't be scared. Come here.

1693
01:53:34,599 --> 01:53:36,643
Now let me ask you again.

1694
01:53:37,352 --> 01:53:39,896
- What did Mitchell tell you?
- [Annika] No, nothing. He...

1695
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,899
[Falcone] Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1696
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:45,694
Especially to pretty girls like you.

1697
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:48,238
That's why I made him
take your passport...

1698
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:51,825
until we could have
this little conversation.

1699
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:54,619
[Annika] All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1700
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:56,830
You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...

1701
01:53:56,913 --> 01:54:00,042
[Falcone] We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1702
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:03,420
But first, I gotta know...

1703
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:05,839
What did he tell you?

1704
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:10,177
[Annika] He just said
they all made a deal with you.

1705
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:11,887
[Falcone] Oh. Hmm.

1706
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,930
He told you about that, huh?

1707
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:15,307
The deal.

1708
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:20,312
[Annika] He said you gave some
information on some drops thing

1709
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:23,106
and that's how he became mayor.

1710
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:25,567
He said you were a very important man.

1711
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:26,850
[Falcone] Right.

1712
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:28,904
Mm-hmm.

1713
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:32,032
Hmm. Okay.

1714

- [tussling on recording]
- [Annika screams]

1715

- [Annika cries]
- [tussling continues]

1716
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:41,041
- [Falcone] Just take it easy.
- [Annika choking]

Jesus, he's strangling her.

1718
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:45,796
[Falcone] Take it easy.

1719

A falcon has wings too.

1722
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:05,023
Falcone is the rat?

1723
01:55:15,992 --> 01:55:19,162
Falcone works for you guys?

1724
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:22,374
The mayor? The DA?

1725
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:26,577
No.

1726
01:55:26,795 --> 01:55:28,296
[breathing shakily]

1727
01:55:29,548 --> 01:55:30,841
We work for him.

1728
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:33,093
Everybody does.

1729
01:55:33,123 --> 01:55:34,231
How?

1730
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:35,846
Through Renewal.

1731
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:38,014
Renewal is everything.

1732
01:55:38,098 --> 01:55:39,433
- The Renewal Fund?
- [Kenzie] Yeah.

1733
01:55:40,016 --> 01:55:43,728
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1734
01:55:43,812 --> 01:55:47,399
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1735
01:55:47,482 --> 01:55:50,861
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1736
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:53,029
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1737
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:54,823
Everybody got a piece.

1738
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:56,741
But Falcone wanted more.

1739
01:55:58,535 --> 01:56:01,746
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1740
01:56:03,165 --> 01:56:05,500
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1741
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:08,587
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1742
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:11,131
then install them all as his puppets.

1743
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:13,758
You think this goddamn election matters?

1744
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:17,304
Falcone's the mayor.

1745
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:20,765
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1746
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:22,225
Come on, Vengeance.

1747
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:24,769
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1748
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:27,105
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1749
01:56:27,135 --> 01:56:28,118
No!

[gun clatters]

1751
01:56:29,483 --> 01:56:30,692
We'll get him.

1752
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:33,236
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1753
01:56:33,299 --> 01:56:34,499
He owns the city!

1754
01:56:34,529 --> 01:56:35,780
Cross that line...

1755
01:56:36,573 --> 01:56:37,866
you'll become just like him.

1756
01:56:38,575 --> 01:56:40,118
Listen to me.

1757
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:42,078
Don't throw your life away.

1758
01:56:48,627 --> 01:56:50,003
Don't worry, honey.

1759
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:54,549
I got nine of 'em.

- [screams]
- [Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!

1761
01:56:57,928 --> 01:56:59,221
[Kenzie] Oh, God! [whimpering]

1762
01:57:08,522 --> 01:57:09,722
[Gordon]
She won't get out of there alive.

1763
01:57:09,814 --> 01:57:12,400
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1764
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:13,622
I have to stop her.

1765
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:14,852
Don't you mean "we"?

1766
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,489
I gotta do this my way.

1767
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:19,022
And then what?

1768
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,076
We do what Riddler said.

1769
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:23,537
Bring the rat into the light.

Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1773
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:03,076
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

01:58:03,702 --> 01:58:05,036
Tell him it's about Annika.

Hey!

Look who it is, huh?

1777
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:14,379
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1778
01:58:14,462 --> 01:58:16,464
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1779
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:18,091
Absolutely.

1780
01:58:19,843 --> 01:58:21,043
Alone?

And I know
that you're a very important man.

01:58:57,172 --> 01:59:00,592
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

you're gonna want to see this.

02:10:24,608 --> 02:10:28,154
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1945
02:10:28,237 --> 02:10:29,780
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1946
02:10:29,864 --> 02:10:32,158
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1947
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:34,076
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1948
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,579
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1949
02:10:36,662 --> 02:10:38,414
What about chain of evidence?

1950
02:10:39,248 --> 02:10:40,458
You should see this.

1951
02:10:46,422 --> 02:10:47,923
He's wearing gloves.

1952
02:10:49,383 --> 02:10:51,635
"Friday, July 16th.

1953
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:55,431
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1954
02:10:55,765 --> 02:10:58,809
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1955
02:10:58,893 --> 02:11:00,311
But then, today, I saw it.

1956
02:11:00,394 --> 02:11:04,523
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1957
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:07,651
'Renewal.'

1958
02:11:07,735 --> 02:11:12,156
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1959
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:15,368
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1960
02:11:15,451 --> 02:11:18,788
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1961
02:11:18,871 --> 02:11:21,332
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1962
02:11:21,415 --> 02:11:24,418
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1963

- [rats squeaking]
- "If you want people to understand,

1964
02:11:27,463 --> 02:11:29,298
really understand,

1965
02:11:29,382 --> 02:11:31,675
you can't just give them the answers.

1966
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:33,219
You have to confront them,

1967
02:11:33,302 --> 02:11:35,721
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1968
02:11:35,805 --> 02:11:37,973
just like they tortured me.

1969
02:11:38,057 --> 02:11:40,851
I know now what I must become."

1970
02:11:43,813 --> 02:11:45,147
Jesus.

1971

[bat screeching]

1972
02:11:51,237 --> 02:11:53,197
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1973
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:55,241
This one's not a rat.

1974
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:57,660
- [rats continue squeaking]
- [cages rattling]

[screeching violently]

1976
02:12:11,882 --> 02:12:13,082
[Gordon] What is that?

1977
02:12:15,719 --> 02:12:17,221
[bat screeching frantically]

1978
02:12:44,623 --> 02:12:45,833
[officer] Some kind of pry tool?

1979
02:12:45,916 --> 02:12:47,293
Is it a chisel?

1980
02:12:47,376 --> 02:12:48,836
[Batman] It's a murder weapon.

1981
02:12:48,919 --> 02:12:50,296
He killed Mitchell with it.

1982
02:12:50,963 --> 02:12:53,841
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1983
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:04,435
"My confession"?

1984
02:13:04,518 --> 02:13:07,396
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1985
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,856
This isn't over.

1986
02:13:08,939 --> 02:13:11,358
[officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1987
02:13:11,775 --> 02:13:13,986
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1988
02:13:14,361 --> 02:13:15,654
[typing]

1989
02:13:22,077 --> 02:13:24,288
His final post was last night.

1990
02:13:24,371 --> 02:13:27,583
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1991
02:13:27,666 --> 02:13:30,669
- [Gordon] Can you get in?
- [officer 2] Copying his drive now.

1992
02:13:30,794 --> 02:13:34,215
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1993
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:36,300
[ominous music playing]

1994
02:13:45,559 --> 02:13:48,103
- [Gordon] Show me the post.
- [officer 2] It's right here.

1995
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:51,440
[Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."

1996
02:13:52,274 --> 02:13:53,901
I think I'm his last target.

1997
02:13:56,487 --> 02:13:57,687
You?

1998
02:13:57,947 --> 02:13:59,990
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1999
02:14:00,533 --> 02:14:01,909
What is?

2000
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,786
The Batman.

2001
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:05,236
[cell phone ringing]

2002
02:14:09,166 --> 02:14:10,366
Yeah?

2003
02:14:21,637 --> 02:14:22,846
Right.

2004
02:14:25,724 --> 02:14:29,687
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

2005
02:14:37,152 --> 02:14:38,654
You're a good cop.

2006
02:15:03,262 --> 02:15:05,639
[over speaker]
I told you I'd see you in hell.

2007
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:08,225
[Batman] What do you want from me?

2008
02:15:08,309 --> 02:15:09,852
[Riddler] "Want"?

2009
02:15:10,436 --> 02:15:14,064
If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.

2010
02:15:15,274 --> 02:15:16,609
For this moment.

2011
02:15:17,651 --> 02:15:20,654
I've been invisible my whole life.

2012
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:24,366
I guess I won't be anymore, will 1?

2013
02:15:25,909 --> 02:15:28,329
They'll remember me now.

2014
02:15:28,412 --> 02:15:30,247
They'll remember both of us.

2015
02:15:40,633 --> 02:15:42,593
Bruce...

2016
02:15:45,471 --> 02:15:47,306
Wayne.

2017
02:15:49,683 --> 02:15:53,437
[slowly] Bruce...

2018
02:15:54,855 --> 02:15:57,733
Wayne.

2019
02:16:03,489 --> 02:16:04,689
[exhales deeply]

2020
02:16:08,994 --> 02:16:11,413
You know, I was there that day.

2021
02:16:13,999 --> 02:16:17,378
The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,

2022
02:16:17,461 --> 02:16:19,838
made all those promises.

2023
02:16:22,299 --> 02:16:26,553
Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.

2024
02:16:27,096 --> 02:16:30,641
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

2025
02:16:30,724 --> 02:16:34,395
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

2026
02:16:34,978 --> 02:16:36,522
Orphan.

2027
02:16:42,194 --> 02:16:47,324
Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.

2028
02:16:48,617 --> 02:16:53,247
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

2029
02:16:53,914 --> 02:16:55,457
Don't you tell me.

2030
02:16:58,085 --> 02:17:00,754
Do you know what being an orphan is?

2031
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:03,716
It's 30 kids to a room.

2032
02:17:05,008 --> 02:17:09,054
Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.

2033
02:17:10,764 --> 02:17:15,436
You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.

2034
02:17:16,603 --> 02:17:19,773
And every winter one of the babies die

2035
02:17:19,857 --> 02:17:22,151
because it's so cold.

2036
02:17:23,444 --> 02:17:26,029
But, oh, no.

2037
02:17:27,322 --> 02:17:28,574
[smacks lips]

2038
02:17:28,949 --> 02:17:32,119
Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy

2039
02:17:32,202 --> 02:17:35,122
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.

2040
02:17:35,205 --> 02:17:36,405
Doesn't it?

2041
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:39,710
Bruce...

2042
02:17:40,753 --> 02:17:42,671
Wayne.

2043
02:17:46,341 --> 02:17:49,428
He's the only one we didn't get.

2044
02:17:52,848 --> 02:17:55,976
But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?

2045
02:17:57,436 --> 02:18:01,315
All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.

2046
02:18:04,485 --> 02:18:05,685
God.

2047
02:18:06,653 --> 02:18:07,946
Look at you.

2048
02:18:09,615 --> 02:18:12,075
Your mask is amazing.

2049
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:15,078
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

2050
02:18:15,108 --> 02:18:16,300
Ain't it funny?

2051
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:20,751
All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.

2052
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:24,254
You and I both know.

2053
02:18:25,214 --> 02:18:27,716
I'm looking at the real you right now.

2054
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:31,428
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

2055
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:33,055
No shame,

2056
02:18:33,827 --> 02:18:35,027
no limits.

2057
02:18:35,057 --> 02:18:36,725
Why did you write me?

2058
02:18:37,455 --> 02:18:38,655
What do you mean?

2059
02:18:38,685 --> 02:18:40,395
All those cards.

2060
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:41,688
I told you,

2061
02:18:42,397 --> 02:18:44,316
we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.

2062
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:46,610
- We didn't do anything together.
- We did.

2063
02:18:46,693 --> 02:18:48,153
What did we just do?

2064
02:18:48,237 --> 02:18:50,239
I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.

2065
02:18:50,322 --> 02:18:51,522
We're such a good team.

2066
02:18:51,552 --> 02:18:52,628
We're not a team.

2067
02:18:52,658 --> 02:18:55,160
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

2068
02:18:55,244 --> 02:18:57,663
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.

2069
02:18:57,746 --> 02:19:00,916
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

2070
02:19:00,999 --> 02:19:02,626
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

2071
02:19:02,709 --> 02:19:03,919
You gave me that.

2072
02:19:03,982 --> 02:19:05,182
I gave you nothing.

2073
02:19:05,212 --> 02:19:07,798
You showed me what was possible.

2074
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:12,761
You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.

2075
02:19:12,845 --> 02:19:14,388
You inspired me.

2076
02:19:14,471 --> 02:19:15,973
You're out of your goddamn mind.

2077
02:19:17,037 --> 02:19:18,237
What?

2078
02:19:18,267 --> 02:19:20,435
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

2079
02:19:20,519 --> 02:19:21,895
How can you say that?

2080
02:19:21,979 --> 02:19:23,480
You think you'll be remembered?

2081
02:19:23,564 --> 02:19:25,232
You're a pathetic psychopath,

2082
02:19:25,732 --> 02:19:27,484
- begging for attention.
- No.

2083
02:19:27,568 --> 02:19:29,236
- You're gonna die alone in Arkham.
- No.

2084
02:19:29,266 --> 02:19:30,415
No, no!

2085
02:19:30,445 --> 02:19:31,645
A nobody!

2086
02:19:33,156 --> 02:19:34,950
No!

2087
02:19:36,869 --> 02:19:39,246
Ahhh!

2088
02:19:39,496 --> 02:19:42,082
This is not how this was supposed to go!

2089
02:19:43,041 --> 02:19:46,670
Ahhh!

2090
02:19:46,753 --> 02:19:49,381
I had it all planned out!

2091
02:19:50,382 --> 02:19:52,384
We were gonna be safe here.

2092
02:19:52,759 --> 02:19:56,054
We could watch the whole thing together.

2093
02:19:56,084 --> 02:19:57,192
Watch what?

2094
02:19:57,222 --> 02:19:58,974
Everything!

2095
02:20:00,726 --> 02:20:02,144
[tense music playing]

2096
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:08,984
It was all there.

2097
02:20:11,153 --> 02:20:13,488
You mean, you didn't figure it out?

2098
02:20:14,656 --> 02:20:15,866
[Riddler gasps slowly]

2099
02:20:17,784 --> 02:20:21,705
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

2100
02:20:23,749 --> 02:20:25,834
I guess I gave you too much credit.

2101
02:20:26,293 --> 02:20:27,544
What have you done?

2102
02:20:28,253 --> 02:20:33,133
What's black and blue and dead all over?

2103
02:20:35,969 --> 02:20:37,804
You.

2104
02:20:39,473 --> 02:20:41,600
If you think you can stop
what's coming...

2105
02:20:42,935 --> 02:20:44,478
What have you done?

2106
02:20:46,021 --> 02:20:51,860
[sings in falsetto] Ave Maria

2107
02:20:52,277 --> 02:20:54,154
[shouting] What have you done?

2108
02:20:56,615 --> 02:20:57,991
Gratia plena

2109
02:20:58,158 --> 02:20:59,576
What have you done?

[growls]

2111
02:21:03,580 --> 02:21:06,959

[suspenseful music playing]

2114
02:21:44,538 --> 02:21:45,914
[Martinez] Hey!

2115
02:21:46,915 --> 02:21:48,208
What are you doing in here?

2116
02:22:06,143 --> 02:22:08,729
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

2117
02:22:12,232 --> 02:22:13,432
[bottles clink]

2118
02:22:15,318 --> 02:22:17,779
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

2119
02:22:18,655 --> 02:22:21,408
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

2120
02:22:26,079 --> 02:22:29,124
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

2121
02:22:29,207 --> 02:22:31,376
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

2122
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:33,712
It's a tucker.

2123
02:22:34,046 --> 02:22:35,714
[suspenseful music continues]

2124
02:22:51,521 --> 02:22:52,721
Huh.

2125
02:23:07,704 --> 02:23:10,499
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

2126
02:23:10,582 --> 02:23:12,084
What are you doing?

2127
02:23:21,051 --> 02:23:22,636
[suspenseful music builds up]

2128

[dramatic music playing]

2129
02:23:42,614 --> 02:23:44,032
[Riddler] Hey, guys.

2130
02:23:44,366 --> 02:23:46,576
Uh, thanks for all the comments

2131
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:49,621
and a special thanks to everyone
for the tips on detonators.

2132
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:50,759
Detonators?

2133
02:23:50,789 --> 02:23:55,836
I just want to say this will be my last
post for a little while, and, uh...

2134
02:23:58,088 --> 02:24:00,173
what this community has meant to me

2135
02:24:00,257 --> 02:24:03,260
these weeks, these months,

2136
02:24:04,177 --> 02:24:06,596
let's just say none of us...

2137
02:24:08,306 --> 02:24:10,433
is alone anymore. Okay?

2138
02:24:11,143 --> 02:24:12,343
Jesus.

2139
02:24:12,519 --> 02:24:13,719
[Riddler huffing]

2140
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:16,660
[inhales deeply]

2141
02:24:16,690 --> 02:24:19,276
Tomorrow's Election Day.

2142
02:24:19,442 --> 02:24:21,069
[laughing]

2143
02:24:21,862 --> 02:24:24,489
And Bella Real will win.

2144
02:24:24,573 --> 02:24:27,200
She promised real change.

2145
02:24:27,909 --> 02:24:30,287
But we know the truth, don't we?

2146
02:24:30,370 --> 02:24:32,455
You've seen Gotham's true face now.

2147
02:24:32,539 --> 02:24:34,416
Together, we've unmasked it.

2148
02:24:34,499 --> 02:24:37,460
Its corruption, its perversion

2149
02:24:37,544 --> 02:24:41,381
masquerading under the guise of renewal.

2150
02:24:41,464 --> 02:24:45,302
But unmasking is not enough.

2151
02:24:47,512 --> 02:24:51,516
The day of judgment is finally upon us.

2152
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:53,977
[in playful tone] And now it is time

2153
02:24:55,061 --> 02:24:57,439
for retribution.

2154
02:24:57,522 --> 02:25:00,317
I've parked seven vans

2155
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:02,944
all along the city seawall.

2156
02:25:04,154 --> 02:25:06,031
And on the big night,

2157
02:25:06,114 --> 02:25:08,366
[whispers] they will go boom.

2158
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:13,830
[dramatic music playing]

2159
02:25:19,252 --> 02:25:20,670
[explosion]

2160
02:25:22,631 --> 02:25:23,882
- [explosion]
- [inaudible] Boom!

2161
02:25:29,137 --> 02:25:30,597
- [explosion]
- [inaudible] Boom!

2162
02:25:33,266 --> 02:25:35,518
When the vans blow,

2163
02:25:35,602 --> 02:25:41,233
the flooding will happen so fast,
evacuation will not be an option.

2164
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:44,527
Those who are not washed away

2165
02:25:44,611 --> 02:25:47,614
will race through the streets in terror.

2166
02:25:47,644 --> 02:25:48,835
- [panicked screams]
- Call Gordon.

2167
02:25:48,865 --> 02:25:50,992
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2168
02:25:52,577 --> 02:25:54,204
- [crowd cheering]
- [Riddler] As breaking news

2169
02:25:54,287 --> 02:25:56,206
hits higher ground
in Gotham Square Garden...

2170
02:25:56,331 --> 02:25:59,292
...celebrations will turn to panic,

2171
02:25:59,376 --> 02:26:04,214
as the venue becomes
the city's shelter of last resort.

2172
02:26:04,297 --> 02:26:05,497
[sirens wailing]

2173
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:09,594
And that's where all of you come in.

2174
02:26:16,017 --> 02:26:19,312
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

2175
02:26:19,396 --> 02:26:21,564
The pigs will have me in their custody,

2176
02:26:21,648 --> 02:26:23,692
but that's okay.

2177
02:26:23,775 --> 02:26:28,280
Because then it will be your turn.

2178
02:26:28,363 --> 02:26:32,242
You'll be there, waiting.

2179
02:26:32,450 --> 02:26:34,244
[dramatic music playing]

2180
02:26:43,295 --> 02:26:46,214
It's time for the lies to finally end.

2181
02:26:46,298 --> 02:26:50,427
[dramatically]
False promises of renewal?

2182
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:51,710
Change?

2183
02:26:52,012 --> 02:26:55,807
We'll give them real, real change now.

2184
02:26:55,890 --> 02:27:00,895
We've spent our lives in this
wretched place, [shouts] suffering!

2185
02:27:01,354 --> 02:27:03,857
Wondering, "Why us?"

2186
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:07,068
Now they will spend
their last moments wondering,

2187
02:27:07,152 --> 02:27:09,321
[screams] why them?

2188
02:27:09,404 --> 02:27:11,448
I can't get through! The lines are down.

2189
02:27:12,782 --> 02:27:14,075
[sirens wailing]

2190
02:27:17,078 --> 02:27:19,247
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

2191
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:21,458
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

2192
02:27:21,541 --> 02:27:24,419
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

2193
02:27:24,502 --> 02:27:26,463
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

2194
02:27:26,546 --> 02:27:27,746
[distant explosion]

[sirens wailing]

2198
02:27:36,097 --> 02:27:37,766
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

2199
02:27:37,849 --> 02:27:39,351
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

2200
02:27:39,434 --> 02:27:41,269
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

2201
02:27:41,353 --> 02:27:42,604
We got an active situation.

2202
02:27:42,729 --> 02:27:44,022
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

2203
02:27:44,105 --> 02:27:45,315
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

2204
02:27:45,345 --> 02:27:46,369
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

2205
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:47,287
Come!

2206

2209
02:28:24,717 --> 02:28:25,700
...we're gonna have huge problems.

2210
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,107
The water's already started to breach.

2211
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:28,733
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

2212
02:28:28,817 --> 02:28:31,027
[man] Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

2213
02:28:31,111 --> 02:28:32,946
[Bella] am not gonna let
those people die out there.

2214
02:28:33,029 --> 02:28:35,365
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
SO we can get everyone in.

2215
02:28:35,448 --> 02:28:37,700
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Real.

2216
02:28:37,784 --> 02:28:40,036
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

2217
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:41,955
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

2218
02:28:42,038 --> 02:28:45,041
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

2219
02:28:45,125 --> 02:28:46,626
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

2220
02:28:51,798 --> 02:28:55,260
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

2221
02:28:55,343 --> 02:28:57,637
Please! I just need your attention!

[siren wailing in distance]

2310

The city is underwater.

02:38:47,685 --> 02:38:49,437
The National Guard is coming.

2312
02:38:51,731 --> 02:38:53,733
Martial law is in effect...

2313
02:38:54,650 --> 02:38:56,277
but the criminal element never sleeps.

2314
02:38:59,488 --> 02:39:03,200
Looting and lawlessness will be rampant

2315
02:39:03,284 --> 02:39:05,828
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.

2316
02:39:06,996 --> 02:39:10,708
I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.

2317
02:39:13,669 --> 02:39:16,797
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.

02:39:18,174 --> 02:39:19,550
[Bella] We will rebuild.

But not just our city.

2320
02:39:22,344 --> 02:39:26,557
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

2321
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:28,726
in our elected officials,

2322

in each other.

2323
02:39:30,895 --> 02:39:34,231
Together, we will learn

I have had an effect here...

but not the one I intended.

2329
02:39:50,247 --> 02:39:53,292
Vengeance won't change the past,

mine or anyone else's.

2331

I have to become more.

People need hope.

2333

To know someone's out there for them.

02:40:21,654 --> 02:40:23,739
Our scars can destroy us.

Even after
the physical wounds have healed.

2339
02:40:29,453 --> 02:40:31,205
But if we survive them,

2340
02:40:32,706 --> 02:40:34,583
they can transform us.

2341
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:38,379
They can give us the power

2342
02:40:39,338 --> 02:40:40,840
lo endure...

2343
02:40:42,216 --> 02:40:44,343

02:40:58,858 --> 02:41:01,402
a mysterious masked man emerges,

2350
02:41:01,485 --> 02:41:03,821

right through that skylight...

You did so well.

And you know,

2366

Gotham loves a comeback story.

[Riddler] Who are you?

[man] Well, that's the question,

isn't it?

It won't.

I have to try.
