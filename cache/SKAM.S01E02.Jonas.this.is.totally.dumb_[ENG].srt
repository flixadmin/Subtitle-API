- Hi!
- Hi, dear.

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,460
Are you in Oslo now?

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,340
No, my flight from Geneva is canceled,
so I'm stuck here until tomorrow.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,780
- No...
- But I'll be in Oslo tomorrow afternoon.

10
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,570
But, I'm going to the cabin tomorrow.

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,460
Oh, yeah, that's true!

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,370
Where were you going again?

13

To Ingrid's cabin,
with Ingrid and Sara.

14
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,430
Oh, how nice! Who will drive you guys?

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,660
No, we'll take a bus.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,300
A bus? Can't you wait? If you wait a day,
or go on Tuesday, I can drive you.

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,340
But...

18
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,830
I've been looking forward to going to the cabin
for over a month now.

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,540
Yeah, I know.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,120
But, I'm coming home on Saturday.

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,340
Yeah... on Saturday...

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,920
It looks like I'll have to leave again
on Friday night.

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,960
Oh...

24
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,510
But... do you have enough money?

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,810
Yes.

26
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,470
Yeah.

27
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,020
You know what? I'll wire you a little bit extra,
so you can enjoy yourselves at the cabin trip.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,280
Thanks!

29
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,990
Okay, have a good trip,
and say hi to Ingrid and Sara.

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,660
Yeah, thanks, you too! I will.

- Shut the fuck up! Is that a gay song?

44
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,420
Who is it?

45
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,860
- Jonas?
- Elias.

46
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,820
- Your new boyfriend?
- What are you talking about?

47
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,970
You know what I'm talking about.

48
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,620
You ran after him the entire school day,
it's like he's your god.

49
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,900
- Hello?
- "Oh, Elias? I'm so glad to be talking to you!"

50
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,430
"I-I think I love you!
Maybe we can get married in February

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,300
- What's the deal with Jonas and Ingrid?
- Huh?

54
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,340
You heard what I said.

55
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,340
You have to ask Jonas.

56
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,100
Why do you ask?

57
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,860
I saw a notification on his phone.

58
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,060
I know that you know something.

59
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,930
Can't you just say it?
I promise I won't get angry.

60
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,650
And I promise I won't tell Jonas
you said anything.

61
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,580
Are they texting?

62
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,260

George Washington.

81
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Okay, Eva. Who was the first
female Prime Minister of Norway?

82
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,660
I'm not joining.

83
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,820
She doesn't know the answer.

84
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,260
- I do, I just don't want to join.
- Just answer, then we won't nag anymore.

85
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,940
- I didn't hear the question.
- Who was Norway's first female Prime Minister?

86
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,620
Erna Solberg.

87
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,860
Fuck you guys!

88
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,220
Why are you so pissed?

89
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,060
I'm not pissed.
I just think Trivial Pursuit is boring.

90
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,740
Okay? What do you want to play then,
since you think it's so boring?

91
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,300
- Nothing. I want to read.
- Come on! You got to want to do something.

92
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,020
Okay.

93
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,740

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,260
I'll start.

95
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
My ship is loaded with Ingrid.

96
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,500
My ship is loaded with Erna Solberg.

97
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,620
Okay... my ship is loaded with insects.

98
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,820
My ship is loaded with ice cream.

99
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,980
My ship is loaded with--

100
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,900
- What the fuck? What was that?
- Shit. Damn.

101
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,420
- Did you see it?
- No.

102

- How did you find the way?
- Embedded GPS in my brain, man.

110
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,100
No, I asked a guy at the parking space up there.

111
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,060
- Hey.
- Hey.

Really cool.

Good atmosphere, at least. It'll be a party.

115
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,560
- Where am I sleeping?
- In the inner bedroom, with Isak.

116
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,980
- Am I sleeping with the gay guy?
- Why is everyone calling me gay?

117
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,660
You are gay.

118
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,420

158
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,340
- What did she say I did?
- You think I don't know you text her?

159
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,740
- I was texting her about French.
- About French?

160
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,460
- During autumn break?
- We have homework for after the break.

161
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,860
Okay, if it's about French,
can I read the messages?

162
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,740
- Why would you read my messages?
- You can read my messages!

163
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,180
- I don't want to read your messages.
- Why not?

164
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,260
Do we have to read each others messages
to trust each other?

165
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,220
- Yes!
- That's ridiculous!

166
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,900
Jonas! This is ridiculous!

167
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,820
What the fuck?
Why do you think that I'm talking to Ingrid?

168
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,500
- It's true, right?
- Yeah, about school!

169
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,180
- Can I see your messages, then?
- I already told you it's ridiculous!

170
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,860
Why don't you just trust me?

171
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,820
- She's pissed.
- Yeah, she's damn pissed.

172
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,980
Damn pissed!
