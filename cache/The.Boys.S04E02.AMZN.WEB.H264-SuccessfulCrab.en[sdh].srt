I thought you were too sick to practice.

18
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,395
Done with all that, Coach.

19
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,107
When's the last time you had
a decent meal?

00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,359

-Nothing you say is gonna change my mind.
-Damn it, Reggie.

00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,869
You're the most talented

00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,538
Yet you're... you're throwing it all away

26
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,709
You don't know me, Coach.
You don't know nothin'.

27
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,295
I know you've got heart.

28
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,005
I know you want more than this.

29
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,423
You've got a choice, son.

30
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,384
Either outrun this life,

31
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,304
or you can run yourself
into an early grave.

32
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,724
Now, please. It's me, Coach Brink.

33
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,477
Come back with me.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,562
To the suburbs.

35
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,483
Yeah, what I want doesn't matter.

36
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,778
I'll never be free of these streets.

37
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,030
[Bourke] Cut! Holy fuck.

38
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,241
Holy fuck, we're not gonna beat that.

39
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,868
That was fucking perfect.
We're going again.

44
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,962

45
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,214
I'm not giving off too much
of a <i>Blind Side</i> vibe, am I?

46
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,550
[Bourke] As if that's a bad thing?

47
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,717
Are you... Wait, what is that smell?

48
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,511
Will everyone stop?

49
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,179
What is that smell?!

50
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,473
[sniffs] Is it... Is that you?

51
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:20,975
I had falafel for lunch.

-What?

53
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,312

54
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,647
Shut up, man.

55
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,400
-[Bourke] No, I won't.
-[Ferrell] Don't jinx it.

56
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,860
You can't jinx gold. Look at me.

57
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,988
You better make some shelf space,
De Niro. Do you hear me?

58
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,781
All right, let's get you back to one, huh?

59
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,116
-I'm gonna watch playbacks, okay?
-Absolutely.

60
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,910
Yeah, let's get him some cans, please?
Thank you.

61
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,704
One more quick thing.

62
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,038
Let's sidebar here a little bit.

63
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,707
It feels like you're having
a little bit of trouble

64
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,292
getting out of the starters' block.

65
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,003
Maybe it's the scene.

66
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,421
Baby, this scene sings.
All right, look at me.

67
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,133
In the arc of your character,
this is your low point, right?

68
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,343
Everybody's given up on you,
you're all alone,

69
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,469
until the coach...

70
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,097
Swoops in and saves me from the ghetto?

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,348
No, no, no, you actually save each other.

72
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,225
It's a very balanced narrative.

73
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,812
All the sensitivity readers
that we hired, they all agreed.

74
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,939
-My brother was the only coach I ever had.
-Right.

75
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,025
He was a waiter at Buster Beaver,

76
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,610
not a fucking crack dealer.

77
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,738
And he must be so proud of you right now.

78
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,824
Let's get this train back on the tracks.

79
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,161
-Just give me a minute.
-Yeah, sure.

80
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,539
Wait, wait, you know what?
One more tiny little thing.

81
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,293
You said what I want "doesn't matter."

82
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,753
But as scripted, it's actually

83
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,923
what I want "don't matter," okay?

84
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,007
All right, good stuff.

85
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,301
All right, everybody,
let's get back to one!

86
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,261
I want to make this fucking day!

87
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,224
Hey, can we talk?

88
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,602
You don't talk. It's like your one thing.

89
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,312
Look, playing Noir has been
a meaningful challenge,

90
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,563
but yesterday was wack as fuck.

91
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,816
I've never actually
murdered anyone before.

92
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,652
Does Homelander make us
kill people, like, a lot?

93
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,196
And when he does, do we just... do it?

94
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,741
Look, don't get me wrong,
I am stoked to be here

95
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,078
and I am down to ride the wave.
I'm just having trouble

96
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,371
with Noir's motivation, you feel me?

97
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,248
His motivation is being
a braindead maniac.

98
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,042
Just keep your mouth shut

99
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,835
and do as you're fucking told.

About what?

He gave me power of attorney,

146
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,526
And he signed a DNR.

147

H-He didn't update his will?

148

He did.

149

Wait.

160
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,646
[sighs]

161
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,815
[train rattling on tracks]

162
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,452
You leave the money on the dresser?

163
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,124
[grunts]

164
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,126
I didn't want to wake you up.

165
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,669
[groans]

166
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,045
Hey.

167
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,800
Yeah, maybe you should
stay in bed today, no?

168
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,552
Yeah...

169
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,345
[sighs]

170
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,347
Could've been a lot worse.

171
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,392
I mean, it would've been
a lot worse if you weren't there.

172
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,481
Thank you.

173
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,901
[chuckles]

174
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,655
-[phone chimes]
-Oh.

175
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,824
Starlight.

176
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,451
Work.

177
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,880
[door opens]

178
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,548
[Katrin] Your speech therapist Gloria

179
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,216
has filled me in on the work
you've been doing.

180
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,634
How's that been going?

181
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,856
You know, psychological mutism

182
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,318
is often a symptom of trauma
in one's past.

183
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,777
What do you think about that?

184
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,243
I couldn't agree more.

185
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,162
But sometimes you have
to confront your past

186
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,830
in order to be free of it.

187
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:19,875
Okay.

188
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,710
Why don't we start with something simple?

189
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,464
Tell me about your parents. [gasps]

190
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,012
[Muzak plays]

191
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,639
[Hughie] <i>Jesus.</i>

192
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,973
You're just telling us now?

193
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,809
Have you seen any specialists,
have you, um...

194
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,102
So how long you got?

195
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,313
It's none of your fucking business.

196
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,731
{\an8}-I'm not sure why I'm telling you at all.
-What's going on?

197
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,234
Let's just say I got
an angel on my shoulder.

198
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,194
And she's a right bloody nag.

199
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,905
Butcher, I tried to warn you
that that shit was poison.

200
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,406
You ain't one of us.

201
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,408
-Hey!
-All right!

202
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,453
A word.

203
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,591
You're done.

204
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,926
-What?
-Fired.

205
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,636
Grab your shit and get the fuck out.

206
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,680
I level with you lot
and this is the thanks I get.

207
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,181
Fuck me.

208
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,100
-See what being honest gets you?
-Honest?

209
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,602
Motherfucker, you've been lying to us
for the last six months.

210
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,104
Not telling ain't lying.

211
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,564
Look, you need all the help
you can get, mate.

212
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,192
Not from you. You're a liability, Butcher.

213
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,070
I ain't gonna let this stand, then.

214
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,780
The Boys is mine.

215
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,032
Says a dying man with one last bluff.

216
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,579
Now grab your shit and get the fuck out.

217
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,206
Or I'll throw you out.

218
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:43,834
[soft creaking]

219
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,961
-Just...
-I don't want to hear it.

220
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,130
He's out.

221
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,632
You can join him if you don't like it.

222
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,310
Small-town kid grows up on
a Montana ranch with his mom.

223
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:05,564
On the surface, he's an everyday
all-American boy.

224
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,233
But deep in his heart, he knows
he's different, special.

225
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,027
He's always asking himself, "Who am I?"

226
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,695
Then one day that question is answered

227
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,406
when Homelander flies down from the sky

228
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,408
and says with tears in his eyes...

229
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,659
No tears.

230
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,454
...and says, proudly,
"Son, it's time for you

231
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,122
to take your place by my side."

232
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,708
And for Ryan it feels surprising,
yet inevitable.

233
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,378
He always knew he
was destined for greatness.

234
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,547
Because he came from greatness.

235
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,798
[chuckling]

236
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,342
-Oh.
-[Homelander] Wow.

237
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,553
Oh, buddy, can you believe that?

238
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,555
W-What do you think?

239
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,142
It's cool, I guess.

240
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,394
You guess? [chuckles]

241
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,105
[stammers] I think it looks amazing.

242
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,776
-Oh, so amazing. Really marketable.
-So marketable.

243
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,028
The whole pitch blows.

244
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,822
It... does not blow.

245
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,575
It blows, harder than Nancy Reagan
on the MGM backlot.

246
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,786
I'm sorry, why are you here?

247
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,288
Vought got rid of most of the sidekicks
after Gunpowder.

248
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,539
The settlements exceeded profitability.

249
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,707
[Homelander] Yeah, but I don't think Ryan

250
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,044
is gonna file an HR complaint
against me. [laughs]

251
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,505
-[laughter]
-A what?

252
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,590
Ryan is the first natural-born superhero.

253
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,841
And his brand needs to reflect that.

254
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,636
He's not one of Vought's lab rat freaks.

255
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,139
He was chosen... by fate, God, whatever...

256
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,058
to be the one who saves the world.

257
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,309
[Homelander] Yes.

258
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,436
But let's not forget

259
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,146
why he is special.

260
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,398
Shall we?

261
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,857
He's my son.

262
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,444
Chosen by God, sure, but, uh...

263
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,238
made by me.

264
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,616
The chosen one narrative
only works if he stands alone.

265
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,828
Harry Potter. Neo. Luke Skywalker.

266
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,621
Hollywood's trained people to fall in love

267
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,331
with white boy lone saviors.

268
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,751
So, America will want
to fall in love with Ryan.

269
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,755
What is this?

270
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,090
Uh, it's a crime itinerary.

271
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,634
Your first save. Congratulations, son.

272
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,428
[whispering] I'm not on the call sheet.

273
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,556
You wanted a kingdom for your son.

274
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,143
I'm helping you get it.

275
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,150
-Excellent.
-Mm.

276
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,609
Just as we discussed.

277
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,154
Feel free to move forward.

278
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,239
Thanks.

279
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,408
Ah, if you don't mind?

280
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,368
-[camera clicks]
-Hmm.

281
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,455
I'm here because Homelander wants me here.

282
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,081
Because he trusts me.

283
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,759

[sighs]

288
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,237
Listen.

289
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,990
I know you're the smartest
woman on earth...

290
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,742
Smartest person.

291
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,953
Let me give you some advice.

292
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,872
You know, girls supporting girls.

293
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,334
You cannot talk to Homelander like that.

294
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm telling him the truth.

295
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,213
You're so afraid of him,
you've plucked yourself bald.

296
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,423
If I were you, I'd make myself useful.

297
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,175
You know, get some lactation going,

298
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,760
let him suck on those titties.

299
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,637
Before you end up like Madelyn Stillwell.

300
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,057
[chimes, doors open]

301
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,726
Oh, Ashley, hey, what's up?

302
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,770
Just the girl boss I wanted to see.

303
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,939
I've been looking everywhere for you.

304
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,359
Hey, so I heard that Ryan's
doing his first solo save.

305
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,443
I want to talk to you about something.

306
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,861
I have this idea.

307
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,156
[clears throat] Okay, so, what if...

308
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,866
and just hear me out on this,

309
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,994
what if I was there?

310
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,582
That's it. That's the pitch.

311
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,169
Hmm. You want to join
a family-friendly PG save?

312
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:02,717
While PETA still has you
on their bestiality watchlist?

313
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,178
I swear to God.

314
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,390
Stupid people who think they're smart

315
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,393
make me want to eat my own shit.

316
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,229
Why do you let her talk to you like that?

317
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,982
She's just a bitch.

318
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,608
It's probably that time of the month.

319
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,777
It's like a full moon thing, isn't it?

320
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,362
You're a genetically superior being,

321
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,198
and she's the evolutionary

Come on, Dad.

644
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,402
Uncle Reggie was just
telling us about his saves.

-You want to tell them or should I?
-Come on, man,

646
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,324
let's not make a big thing...

647
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,451
That movie theater in Idaho,

648
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:28,994
that was a soundstage in the Bronx.

649
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,081
That terrorist, that was a stuntman.

650
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,084
Those mountains, they added those in post.

651
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,087
I know because I was there.

652
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,091
Is that true?

00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,428
It's complicated, you know?

00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,180
[Nathan] No, it's simple.

655

Your saves were never real.

656
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,561
You never actually saved anyone.

657
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,689
Yet here you are,
lying to your own flesh and blood.

658

I told you.

659
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,988
Your uncle is no hero.

660
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,866
And I don't want you anywhere near him.

661
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,493
Come on.

662
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:19,837
Nathan...

663
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:23,716
Nathan, I'm sorry.

664
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,344
Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait.
Give him a second.

665
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:45,696
[fan] Your videos got me
to see that my entire family

666
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,157
had been brainwashed
by clovergenders like Starlight.

667
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,200
I told them that I couldn't
speak to them again

668

-Of course not.

That you belong to a community of warriors
