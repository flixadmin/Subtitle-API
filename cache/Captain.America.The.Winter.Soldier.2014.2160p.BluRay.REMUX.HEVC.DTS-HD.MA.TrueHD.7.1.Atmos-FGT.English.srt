What are you doing?

176
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,302
Backing up the hard drive.

177
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,804
It's a good habit to get into.

178
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,347
Rumlow needed your help.

What the hell are you doing here?

180
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,561
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

181
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,980
Whatever I can get my hands on.

182
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,523
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

No, that's your mission,

and you've done it beautifully.

185

You just jeopardized
this whole operation.

186
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,782

00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,296
FURY: I didn't lie.

195
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,714
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

196
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,674
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

197
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,426
I'm not obliged to do anything.

198
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,011
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

199
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,806
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

200
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,100
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

201
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,935
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

202
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,314
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

203
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,735
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.

204
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,987
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

205
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,364
I can't lead a mission

206

when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

207
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,118
It's called compartmentalization.

208
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,996
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

209

Except you.

You're wrong about me.

Yeah.

My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

221

Grandad worked in a nice building.

222
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,657
Got good tips.

223
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,328
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

224
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,830
He'd say, "Hi."

225
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,915
People would say, "Hi" back.

226
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,127
Time went on,
the neighborhood got rougher.

227
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,211
He'd say, "Hi."

228
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,755
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

229
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,049
Grandad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

230
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,009
Did he ever get mugged?

(LAUGHS)

232
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,973
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

233
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,850
What would he do?

234
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,184
He'd show them.

235
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,230
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded.22 Magnum.

236
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,069
Yeah, Grandad loved people.

237
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,322
But he didn't trust them very much.

238
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,830
Yeah, I know.

239
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,374
They're a little bit bigger than a.22.

Three next-generation helicarriers

of targeting satellites.

243

Launched from the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

244
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,505
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:50,593
Continuous sub-orbital flight,

Stark?

247
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,387
He had a few suggestions

248
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,806
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

249
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,101
These new long-range precision guns

250
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,729
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

251
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:06,108
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

252
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,403
We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats
before they even happen.

253
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,489
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

254

We can't afford to wait that long.

255

Who's "we"?

256
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,245
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

257
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,705
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

258
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,792
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

259
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,462
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

260
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,132
You know, I read those SSR files.

261
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,009
"Greatest Generation"?

262
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,387
You guys did some nasty stuff.

263
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,138
Yeah, we compromised.

264
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,474
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

265
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,227
But we did it
so that people could be free.

266
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,646
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

267
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:47,191
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.

Mmm.

302
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,311
I have lived a life.

303
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,442
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

304
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,696
What is it?

305
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,910
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

306
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,664
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is anymore.

307
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,921
And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.

308
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,465

309

It's just not the same.

You didn't.

The world has changed,

that's a sub-committee hearing.

376

It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

377

I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

581
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,053
PIERCE: That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

582
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,639
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.

583
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,308
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

584
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,771
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

585
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,442
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

586
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,901
and he comes to me with a plan.

587
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,945
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

588
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,906
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

589
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,494
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

590
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,830
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

591
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,457
They find it empty.

592
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,543
Nick had ignored my direct order,

593
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:29,088
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil,

594
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,883
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,

595
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,301
including my daughter.

596
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,053
So you gave him a promotion.

597
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,804
I've never had any cause to regret it.

598
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,100
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

599
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,272
I don't know.

600
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,858
Did you know it was bugged?

601
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,070
I did, because Nick told me.

602
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,031
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?

603
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:02,997
I want you to see something.

604
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,166
INTERROGATOR:
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

605
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,459
Is that live?

606
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,213
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

607
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,799
ROGERS:
Are you saying he's a suspect?

608
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,509
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

609
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,512
PIERCE: No, no.
It's more complicated than that.

610
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,264
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

611
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:23,976
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

612
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,564
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

613
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,025
The last one going to
a holding company

614
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,402
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

615
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,904
Am I supposed to know who that is?

616
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,115
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

617
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,243
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

618
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,288
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

619
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,252
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

620
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,420
The prevailing theory

621
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,299
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

622
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,885
and sale of classified intelligence.

623
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,515
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

624
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,437
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

625
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,774
Why do you think we're talking?

626
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,947
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

627
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,909
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

628
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:27,707
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

629
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,918
to build a really better world

630
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,797
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

631
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,467
And that makes enemies.

632
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,639
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

633
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,601
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

634
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,688
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

635
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,609
makes me really, really angry.

636
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,865
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

637
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,950
I don't think that's an accident.

638
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,119
And I don't think you do, either.

639
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,165
So, I'm gonna ask again.

640
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,375
Why was he there?

641
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,589
He told me not to trust anyone.

642
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,052
PIERCE: I wonder if that included him.

643
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,141
I'm sorry.

644
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,601
Those were his last words.

645
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,437

But the Winter Soldier was there.

That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.

01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,122
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

979
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,878
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

997
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:18,858
So, the question is,

01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,027
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch

But he's not working alone.

1002
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:30,870
Zola's algorithm
was on the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

1003
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,539
So was Jasper Sitwell.

1004
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,504
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

1005
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,632
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

1006
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,343
The answer is, you don't.

1007

- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?

You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

- Yeah.

in the choppers because of the RPGs.

What did you use? A stealth chute?

1014

No.

1015

These.

1016
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,289
I thought you said you were a pilot.

1017
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,916
I never said pilot.

1018
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,672
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

1019

Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?

1023

The last one is at Fort Meade.

Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

1312

S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1313
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:00,588
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

02:04:36,928 --> 02:04:39,097
We've been data mining HYDRA's files.

1599
02:04:39,305 --> 02:04:41,432
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1600
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:44,352
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1601
02:04:45,311 --> 02:04:46,562
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1602
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,357
There's something I got to do first.

1603
02:04:50,274 --> 02:04:52,819
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

1604
02:04:53,861 --> 02:04:55,571
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1605
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:58,449
All right, then.

1606
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:07,291
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

1607
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:10,670
You should be honored.
That's about as close as he gets

1608
02:05:10,878 --> 02:05:12,505
to saying thank you.

1609
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:14,757
Not going with him?

1610
02:05:15,258 --> 02:05:16,509
No.

1611
02:05:16,718 --> 02:05:18,720
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1612
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:21,597
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

1613
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:22,932
That might take a while.

1614
02:05:23,433 --> 02:05:25,059
I'm counting on it.

1615
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:28,396
That thing you asked for,

1616
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:31,065
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

1617
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:36,779
Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.

1618
02:05:37,196 --> 02:05:38,406
She's not a nurse.

1619
02:05:38,614 --> 02:05:40,450
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1620
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:43,453
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1621
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:45,204
She's nice.

1622
02:05:57,675 --> 02:05:59,427
Be careful, Steve.

1623
02:06:00,261 --> 02:06:02,013
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1624
02:06:13,566 --> 02:06:15,318
You're going after him.

1625
02:06:15,735 --> 02:06:16,986
You don't have to come with me.

1626
02:06:17,153 --> 02:06:18,237
I know.

1627
02:06:20,198 --> 02:06:21,365
When do we start?

1628
02:08:20,776 --> 02:08:24,405
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1629
02:08:25,114 --> 02:08:26,449
Everything he knows about.

1630
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:28,868
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1631
02:08:29,076 --> 02:08:30,870
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1632
02:08:31,078 --> 02:08:32,788
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1633
02:08:33,789 --> 02:08:36,626
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1634
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:41,964
What we have

1635
02:08:44,008 --> 02:08:46,636
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1636
02:08:49,263 --> 02:08:52,975
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1637
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:59,607
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA's good work around the world.

1638
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:04,195
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colorful friends,

1639
02:09:04,403 --> 02:09:06,239
and keep them off our scent.

1640
02:09:06,447 --> 02:09:08,699
What about the volunteers?

1641
02:09:08,908 --> 02:09:10,451
The dead will be buried so deep

1642
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,787
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1643
02:09:14,872 --> 02:09:16,123
And the survivors?

1644
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:19,752
The twins.

1645
02:09:23,339 --> 02:09:26,425
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1646
02:09:28,636 --> 02:09:30,554
It's not a world of spies anymore.

1647
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:32,723
Not even a world of heroes.

1648
02:09:33,724 --> 02:09:36,435
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1649
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:40,606
There's nothing more horrifying

1650
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,566
than a miracle.
