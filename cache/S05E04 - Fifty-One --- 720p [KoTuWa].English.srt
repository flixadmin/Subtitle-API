1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,710
Gotta say, when you first brought

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,710
her in, I had my doubts.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,950
But your little darling's got nine lives.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,590
Rear-wheel assembly took the brunt

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,590
of the impact. So....

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,350
Yeah.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,110
CV shaft, boots, joints, axle....

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,590
Replaced all of it. No way around it.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,470
I went aftermarket

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,470
on most of the parts here.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,950
You want me to swap in factory parts,

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,950
that's fine.

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,270
But using aftermarket's the only way

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,270
we'll keep it under Blue Book...

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,160
...and on the insurance company's

16
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,160
dime, okay?

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,150
Nothing beats free.

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,110
Swapped out your air filter,

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,110
topped off your fluids.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,470
Didn't have to replace

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,470
the windshield this time.

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,430
I know, right?

23
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,480
Oh, and I noticed you had

24
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,480
some sort of gunky buildup...

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,150
...in the front end here.

26
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,000
First, I had no idea

27
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,000
what I was looking at.

28
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,990
Then I remembered

29
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,990
you had me replace...

30
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,590
...that front fender a few months back

31
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,590
when you ran over that deer.

32
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,230
We went at it with the steam hose,

33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,230
cleaned it up for you.

34
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,960
Hardest part was the paint.

35
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,550
Fern green. Interesting tint.

36
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,940
Anything else?

37
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,310
That's it. Zero balance, like I said.

38
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,470
Sign here, you're good to go.

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,270
People like to joke...

40
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,190
...but I really, really like this car.

41
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,070
She's sturdy as all hell.

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,350
I'm betting you get

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,350
another 200,000 miles out of her.

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,510
Hey, Benny.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,790
What would you give me for it?

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,030
- What's the Blue Book, you mean?

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,030
- No.

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,550
I mean, what will

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,550
you pay me for this car?

50
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,270
- Well, I'm not really looking for....

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,270
- A hundred dollars?

52
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,110
Fifty?

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,070
Insurance company just shelled out

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,070
1900 for the parts alone.

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,950
Then it's a bargain.

56
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,550
You give me 50 bucks,

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,550
and she's all yours.

58
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,350
You sure about this?

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,710
Sure as shooting.

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,310
I'll check the register.

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,510
Dad?

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,320
Fifty bucks? Are you crazy?

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,630
- Gotta be kidding me.

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,630
- Lydia?

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,550
Oh, Christ.

66
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,230
I'm at work right now.

67
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,840
Yeah, I know.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,790
This is a heads-up. You got visitors.

69
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,840
Visitors? What...? You mean today?

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,910
I mean 30 seconds.

71
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,110
Come in.

72
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,150
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?

73
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,790
Agent Hank Schrader,

74
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,790
Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.

75
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,030
We met briefly in Albuquerque.

76
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
Yes, we did.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,110
What can I do for you?

78
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,230
There. The foreman.

79
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,670
Navy pants, powder-blue shirt.

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,790
Hey, buddy.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,110
- Yeah?

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,110
- They got Ron.

83
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,710
Ron's done.

84
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,310
Okay.

85
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,470
No. No.

86
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,630
Not okay, Mike.

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,870
Not okay. The....

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,190
The look he just gave me was

89
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,190
the very antithesis of "okay," okay?

90
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,630
Breathe, Lydia.

91
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,350
No one's talking to the police.

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,710
I just had like 14 DEA agents...

93
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,550
...barge into my office,

94
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,550
screaming and yelling at me...

95
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,790
...and they were swarming

96
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,790
all over the warehouse, okay?

97
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,510
The warehouse.

98
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,270
Besides, Ron was my guy. Remember?

99
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,270
I don't have a guy anymore.

100
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,030
Ron fixed security, pulled the barrels,

101
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,030
drove the truck.

102
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,630
You can't expect me to do that stuff.

103
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,630
I mean, let's be realistic.

104
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,360
Mike, this is crazy.

105
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,150
I'll send a new guy.

106
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,030
You're crazy.

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,110
My car almost has 500 horsepower.

108
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,270
- It would totally smoke--

109
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,270
- Horsepower isn't everything.

110
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,590
Don't you know that?

111
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,910
You have to factor in drag

112
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,910
and torque and suspension...

113
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,870
...and weight of the car.

114
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,430
One more factor

115
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,430
that you're not thinking about:

116
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,060
The experience of the driver.

117
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,060
I totally got you there.

118
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,950
- Please. Please. You drive like a geezer.

119
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,950
- I got you.

120
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,830
Really? I drive like a gee--

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,030
Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,030
I don't think so.

123
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,790
- Bullshit you ever did donuts.

124
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,790
- Watch your language.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,550
- And, yes, I did.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,550
- Seriously?

127
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,510
Yes, seriously. And if you show me...

128
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,030
...just a modicum of respect,

129
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,030
maybe I'll teach you.

130
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,870
- Yeah? Yes?

131
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,870
- No. No, I won't. I take that back.

132
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,190
- Yes. Yes. No. You're saying yes.

133
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,190
- Just a joke. I'm just....

134
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,790
No! No, no. That was kidding.

135
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,990
- We didn't shake on it. No.

136
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,990
- Yes. Yes.

137
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,750
- We are now.

138
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,750
- That doesn't count!

139
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,270
I know you don't approve.

140
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,630
But mine...

141
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,990
...we'll call a birthday present

142
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,990
to myself.

143
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,470
And Junior's....

144
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,590
People will just chalk that up

145
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,590
as me being a softy.

146
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,430
And besides...

147
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,390
...I didn't actually buy either one.

148
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,070
They're both leases.

149
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,070
So it all fits our story.

150
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,110
Okay?

151
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,390
We can afford it now.

152
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,470
You're back at it?

153
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,190
Well, yeah.

154
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,110
We have to make up

155
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,110
that 600,000 we lost.

156
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,510
What do you think

157
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,510
about boarding school?

158
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,230
Boarding school?

159
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,830
For who? For Junior?

160
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,030
Yeah. There's this place

161
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,030
in northern Arizona...

162
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,430
...and it's supposed to be

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,430
one of the top 10 in the country.

164
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,750
He's a year away from college.

165
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,590
Why on earth would we do that?

166
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,990
I.... I don't know. I just....

167
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,030
Just thinking about the kids.

168
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,830
Holly too?

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,150
Where are we sending

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,150
our 8-month-old?

171
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,830
Peace Corps?

172
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,070
No. I just....

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,750
A new environment

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,750
might be good for them.

175
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,070
What does that mean?

176
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,350
What's wrong with their environment?

177
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,950
Skyler.

178
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,400
What's wrong with their environment?

179
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,980
Nothing.

180
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,230
Hey.

181
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,580
Listen, I know these last few weeks

182
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,580
have been rough.

183
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,470
The threat to Hank

184
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,470
and this whole thing with Beneke.

185
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,280
But there's absolutely nothing...

186
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,110
...for you to be afraid of anymore,

187
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,110
okay?

188
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,270
I mean, clear sailing from here on out.

189
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,270
I promise.

190
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,830
You know, I want us to try and start

191
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,830
looking forward to things again.

192
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,630
Speaking of which, my birthday.

193
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,990
I don't know--

194
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,990
I don't know what you have planned...

195
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,550
...and with everything

196
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,550
that's been going on lately...

197
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,470
...I'd understand if you haven't

198
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,470
even given it a thought.

199
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,910
But I think...

200
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,670
...a little celebration might be good.

201
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,830
For all of us.

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,590
You know, a birthday party.

203
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,510
What do you think?

204
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,350
Yeah?

205
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,230
Okay.

206
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,190
And maybe, if I may be so bold...

207
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,360
...chocolate cake with chocolate icing?

208
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,310
Life is good, Skyler.

209
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,110
- Thank you.

210
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,110
- Hey, Mom, you forgot something.

211
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,550
Dad's bacon.

212
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,870
That's okay. I can do it.

213
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,600
No. Mom has to.

214
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,160
Well, it is sort of a tradition.

215
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,600
Watch this, Holly.

216
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,070
Watch what she does with bacon.

217
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,590
Watch. Watch this.

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,430
What is she doing?

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,430
What is she doing?

220
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,310
That's a pretty small "1."

221
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,470
Kind of is.

222
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,710
Just a little.

223
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,670
Now you're talking.

224
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,110
- No. No.

225
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,110
- Good move.

226
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,550
- No.

227
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,550
- No, no, no. It's good.

228
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,270
Very good. Family teamwork.

229
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,110
Making sacrifices. Very important.

230
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,990
- Happy birthday, Dad.

231
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,990
- Thank you, buddy.

232
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,380
You want some?

233
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,390
Guy's some piece of work, isn't he?

234
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,110
Six feet under and half a face,

235
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,110
he's still screwing with us.

236
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,310
So, what's next?

237
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,510
I don't know. I don't know.

238
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,990
This Madrigal thing seems hinky,

239
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,990
though, you know?

240
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,350
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger

241
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,350
in Germany...

242
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,670
...and 5000 miles away,

243
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,670
you got this guy.

244
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,190
There's gotta be someone in the middle,

245
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,190
you know? Someone we're missing.

246
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,390
What about that

247
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,390
Lydia what's-her-name?

248
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,110
Lady Banjo Eyes at the warehouse?

249
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,550
In this world? No way.

250
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,120
Too uptight. Too together.

251
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,390
Maybe.

252
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,750
She was wearing mismatched shoes.

253
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,950
How together can she be?

254
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,630
Gentlemen, how goes it with Fring?

255
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,190
You know, just working through

256
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,190
the grief.

257
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
How soon before you submit a final?

258
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,270
Well, we've been kicking around

259
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,270
some ideas.

260
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,230
Had you asked a couple of weeks ago...

261
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,590
...I'd have said

262
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,590
this was a mop-up job, but....

263
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,870
- But?

264
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,870
- None of Fring's crew is talking to us.

265
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,350
I mean, not a peep,

266
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,350
no matter how hard we squeeze.

267
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,020
Makes it likely there's somebody

268
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,020
keeping them in line.

269
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,430
Our money is on this guy,

270
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,430
Michael Ehrmantraut.

271
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,550
He's Fring's head

272
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,550
of "corporate security."

273
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,630
- He's a definite hard case.

274
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,630
- Now, we're gonna stay on him.

275
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,630
We're putting together

276
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,630
a surveillance team as we speak. Okay?

277
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,470
The other thing is....

278
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,350
This may be unrelated...

279
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,750
...but the blue meth is making

280
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,750
a bit of a comeback. Tell him, Gomey.

281
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,230
Yeah. Some small amounts

282
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,230
on the street-side pulls.

283
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,350
Lab's telling us it's the same stuff.

284
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,670
I mean, it could be

285
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,670
old inventory leaking out...

286
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,190
...or it could be somebody's rebooting...

287
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,140
...using Fring's former cooks

288
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,140
to set up a new operation.

289
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,800
I thought we had Fring's cooks.

290
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,030
The unsubs in the lab fire.

291
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,310
Thought maybe one of them

292
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,310
was your Heisenberg.

293
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,910
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

294
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,830
Like I said,

295
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,830
there's still a lot of questions.

296
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,430
Agent Gomez,

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,430
could you give us a moment?

298
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,430
Yeah.

299
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,470
Hank, I gotta say,

300
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,470
your work here has been stellar.

301
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,510
Really first-rate.

302
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,160
Thank you, sir.

303
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,550
So much so that I'm wondering

304
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,550
if it's time you made a change.

305
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,830
You know I have to get back to El Paso.

306
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,310
This office needs an ASAC...

307
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,990
...and I'm thinking we should be

308
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,990
promoting from within.

309
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,190
If you were to put in an application...

310
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,790
...and I recommend that you do,

311
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,790
you will get the job.

312
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,740
I have no doubt this D.O. would be

313
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,740
well served with you at the helm.

314
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,430
That's....

315
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,350
I'm not sure what to say.

316
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,750
It's a big step up.

317
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,750
It's not without its headaches.

318
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,870
The politics may take

319
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,870
some getting used to.

320
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,350
You'd be overseeing every case

321
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,350
in the office...

322
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,750
...so you'd need to reassign

323
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,750
all your day-to-days, Fring included.

324
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,630
Much as I hate losing

325
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,630
a good field man...

326
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,260
...that's the job,

327
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,260
and you need to be okay with it.

328
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,510
What do you say, Hank?

329
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,710
You want it?

330
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,430
Well, considering my wife

331
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,430
would murder me if I said "no"....

332
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,430
Yeah. I want it.

333
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,510
- Congratulations.

334
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,510
- Thank you.

335
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,150
Can you finish up for me?

336
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,470
It's.... It's my birthday.

337
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,310
- Oh, yeah?

338
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,310
- Yeah.

339
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,430
I probably have a birthday party

340
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,430
waiting for me, you know, so....

341
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,350
Yeah. Cool. Yeah, no problem.

342
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,510
Hey, happy birthday.

343
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,190
Thanks. Thanks.

344
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,550
- Hey, Dad.

345
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,550
- Hey.

346
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
Where's your mom?

347
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,790
Kitchen.

348
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,580
Hey.

349
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,670
Oh, hey.

350
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,550
So, what's the plan?

351
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,430
Hank and Marie are on their way.

352
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,070
Roast chicken and potatoes for dinner,

353
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,070
rocky road for dessert...

354
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,910
...and chocolate cake, as requested.

355
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,390
What's up?

356
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,950
Me?

357
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,750
Nothing.

358
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,190
Thought you'd be more jazzed

359
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,190
about the new job.

360
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,790
No. What...? No. I am.

361
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,070
- Baby, I'm so proud of you.

362
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,070
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

363
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,150
- Sorry, sorry.

364
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,150
- I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

365
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,950
Marie, you've been moping around

366
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,950
the last few days.

367
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,190
Marie?

368
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,870
What's up?

369
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,860
- Marie, come on.

370
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,860
- I'm sorry. I--

371
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,590
I made a promise to someone.

372
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,540
To who?

373
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,830
- Who?

374
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,830
- Your brother-in-law.

375
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,390
- Are you gonna give me a hint at least?

376
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,390
- It involves infidelity. That's all I'll say.

377
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,550
Oh, shit. I knew it.

378
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,910
Knew what? What did you...?

379
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,910
What did you know?

380
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,550
Well, I mean, I didn't know it, but I've

381
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,550
been, you know, saying it forever.

382
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,110
Walt's second cell phone, you know?

383
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,030
Sorry, babe, but I was way ahead of you

384
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,030
on this one.

385
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,790
Way ahead of me.

386
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,980
Well, it wasn't Walt.

387
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,390
Skyler?

388
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,790
No way.

389
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,350
Hey.

390
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,110
- Hey! There she is.

391
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,110
- Hey! Hi!

392
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,510
- Hey!

393
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,510
- Hey, buddy.

394
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,310
Hey, pal.

395
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,310
Welcome. Welcome. Come on in.

396
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,940
Happy birthday. Hi.

397
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,270
I'm in the centre lane going about 60.

398
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,110
I had no choice but to just tear butt

399
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,110
out of there.

400
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,430
So sweet.

401
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,590
Highway patrol's

402
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,590
gonna be sweet on it too.

403
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,630
Gonna get their ticket quota

404
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,630
in a month.

405
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,950
You'll help me out, right, Uncle Hank,

406
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,950
now that you run the DEA?

407
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,750
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled-brat,

408
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,750
car-wash-millionaire nephew?

409
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,230
Sure. I'll make sure you get

410
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,230
a cell with a view.

411
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,030
All right.

412
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,990
Well, I'm out of here.

413
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,150
Okay.

414
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,350
- Happy birthday.

415
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,350
- Thank you, buddy.

416
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,630
Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.

417
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,790
Thanks.

418
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,230
- I'll see y'all later.

419
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,230
- All right.

420
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,830
- Bye. Be safe.

421
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,830
- Have fun.

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,550
- Drive safely, okay?

423
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,550
- I do.

424
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,440
- Slow down.

425
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,440
- Never.

426
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,870
A hell of a couple cars there, Walt.

427
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,630
Honey, for my next birthday,

428
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,630
I'm gonna take a page here from Walt...

429
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,190
...and buy myself a jet plane.

430
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,670
Maybe I overdid it a little.

431
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,430
But with these new lease rates....

432
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,710
I mean, they're mighty attractive. Yeah.

433
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,750
Great dinner, Skyler.

434
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,750
Those were some bad-ass

435
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,750
whipped potatoes, I'll tell you.

436
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,230
You have to tell me

437
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,230
how you get all the lumps out.

438
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,590
How do you do that?

439
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,630
A potato ricer.

440
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,190
A ricer? You don't hand-mash?

441
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,950
No.

442
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,710
- Well....

443
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,710
- Boy, it has....

444
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,870
It has been quite a year, huh?

445
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,190
Do you know that...

446
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,190
...it's almost exactly a year ago...

447
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,030
...that I got my diagnosis?

448
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,830
- Jesus. Yeah, right?

449
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,830
- Yeah.

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,310
- It seems like longer, doesn't it?

451
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,310
- Yeah. No. It's....

452
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,760
One year ago tomorrow.

453
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,550
The day after my 50th.

454
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,350
Honestly never thought

455
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,350
I'd make it this far.

456
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,110
With the cancer and surgery...

457
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,950
...and Hank being shot....

458
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,550
It just....

459
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,230
So many dark days.

460
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,310
Well....

461
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,830
There's Marie's talking pillow.

462
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,750
Remember that?

463
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,070
It was effective.

464
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,430
Boy, I did not want

465
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,430
to get any treatment.

466
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,270
I think I was too scared...

467
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,790
...or too angry or....

468
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,870
I don't know. I just wanted to quit.

469
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,550
But you guys....

470
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,550
You got me through it somehow.

471
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,790
Kept me going.

472
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,950
And that happened again

473
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,950
and again and again.

474
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,470
I mean, there were times...

475
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,670
...when I was sure I was done for.

476
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,790
But then someone or something...

477
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,550
...would come through for me.

478
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,670
God. And Skyler, I can't--

479
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,030
Honey, remember

480
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,030
that first week of chemotherapy?

481
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,550
That night on the bathroom floor?

482
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,590
What you said to me?

483
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,870
I was so sick.

484
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,950
It was rough going at first.

485
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,510
But Skyler....

486
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,910
She was right there, of course...

487
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,820
...putting wet washcloths

488
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,820
on my forehead.

489
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,990
And she's singing to me.

490
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,950
And this would go on and on...

491
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,630
...day after day.

492
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,510
And I remember I was lying

493
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,510
on the floor of the bathroom...

494
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,950
...because the tile felt

495
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,950
nice and cool, you know?

496
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,830
And my head

497
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,830
was in Skyler's lap...

498
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,070
...and I was just asking her...

499
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,350
...if this could all be over.

500
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,830
It was too hard. It was....

501
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,550
I just wanted it stopped.

502
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,710
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

503
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,590
Hey-o. Pool party.

504
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,430
What are you doing, Skyler?

505
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,270
What is she doing? Walt?

506
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,080
Hey, Sky,

507
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,080
maybe it's time to get out now.

508
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,430
What do you think?

509
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,830
Skyler, Hank asked you a question.

510
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,070
You need to get out.... Skyler!

511
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,870
She's gonna come up, right?

512
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,870
She has to.

513
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,150
Skyler!

514
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,070
Oh, my God.

515
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,700
Wha...? Okay.

516
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,990
Okay. It's gotta be....

517
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,110
Nope.

518
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,630
Okay.

519
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,670
Come on!

520
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,670
How am I supposed to--?

521
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,390
Hey.

522
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,190
Wait.

523
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,000
Wait, wait. Who are you?

524
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,720
I'm the-- I'm the guy.

525
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,720
So where's the...?

526
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,710
Hold on. Hold on.

527
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,830
Who sent you?

528
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,560
Who sent me? Who do you think?

529
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,590
No. I'm asking you.

530
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,840
Mike.

531
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,750
And this Mike person....

532
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,470
What's his last name?

533
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,710
Lady, I just got off a plane

534
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,710
from New Mexico...

535
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,190
...and I got a 900-mile drive back.

536
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,190
That's 14 hours if I don't stop.

537
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,910
So the sooner we do this,

538
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,910
the sooner it's done.

539
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,950
Ehrmantraut.

540
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,910
Okay? Satisfied?

541
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,840
Sorry, but I'm not gonna apologise

542
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,840
for being careful.

543
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,230
With all that's been happening,

544
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,230
for all I knew...

545
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,350
...you were one

546
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,350
of those undercover people.

547
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,470
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day...

548
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,470
...over getting gang-raped

549
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,470
by prison guards.

550
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,230
No doubt. So where's the--?

551
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,030
Up there. Number 22356.

552
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,240
That's the one I erased from

553
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,240
the inventory, so it has to be that one.

554
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,070
Can you reach it?

555
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,870
Yeah, with, like, a forklift.

556
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,110
You got one?

557
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,790
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

558
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,110
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

559
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,110
- What?

560
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,630
Please tell me

561
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,630
that's not what I think it is.

562
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,080
Has anything like this

563
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,080
ever happened before?

564
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,030
No. No, of course not.

565
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,060
No, no. I just....

566
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,190
She and I have been

567
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,190
having some issues.

568
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,710
Yeah, yeah.

569
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,710
I might've heard a little bit about that.

570
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,190
I mean, hey, look,

571
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,190
Marie didn't go into detail.

572
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,990
She just, you know, said that,

573
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,990
you know, you guys were...

574
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,380
...having some issues.

575
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,870
So, what's the next move?

576
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,540
Might be good to have her talk

577
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,540
to someone.

578
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,280
- I agree.

579
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,280
- Yeah.

580
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,350
- I'm gonna get on that first thing.

581
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,350
- Yeah.

582
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,830
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

583
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,510
She seems really happy with him.

584
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,480
Not that Marie's an advertisement

585
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,480
for advanced mental health or anything.

586
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,550
You know....

587
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,500
I just had no idea

588
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,500
she was taking it this hard.

589
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,350
Some birthday, huh?

590
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,630
She's gonna try and get some sleep.

591
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,320
Okay.

592
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,990
What was that?

593
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,830
I don't know.

594
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,070
- I mean, was she trying...?

595
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,070
- No, not in a swimming pool. No.

596
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,590
With all of us there?

597
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,590
No, I don't think so.

598
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,360
But we both...

599
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,230
...think that

600
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,230
she should talk to someone.

601
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,030
I'm gonna get you Dave's number.

602
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,710
Okay.

603
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,790
Listen, Walt, I....

604
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,190
I can't help but sense

605
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,190
that there may be some issues...

606
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,670
...between you and Skyler.

607
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,830
None of our business, of course.

608
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,630
And, Hank, I don't know if you've...

609
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,590
- ...picked up on any of the--

610
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,590
- He knows. He knows I know.

611
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,150
These things happen in a marriage...

612
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,990
...but it isn't unfixable.

613
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,790
I think what would be great is if...

614
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,720
...you two had some space...

615
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,950
...to work through this stuff.

616
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,670
So....

617
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,150
And keep an open mind here.

618
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,270
What if we took the kids for a while?

619
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,750
- Took the kids?

620
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,750
- Absolutely.

621
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,800
We'll look after them for a day or two,

622
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,800
or however long...

623
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,870
...and leave you and Skyler...

624
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,310
...to look after each other.

625
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,790
That's very generous of you, Marie...

626
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,150
...but I.... I just don't see

627
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,150
how that's a solution.

628
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,830
And, I mean--

629
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,510
Besides, Junior and Holly,

630
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,510
that's a lot of work.

631
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,190
No, it isn't.

632
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,550
Junior's independent...

633
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,230
...and my niece is only the easiest...

634
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,350
...most delicious baby

635
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,350
that was ever born.

636
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,070
- It'll be fun, right?

637
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,070
- Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah. Yeah.

638
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,190
Absolutely. Yeah. It's a good idea.

639
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,920
Well, I think it's a great idea.

640
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,160
Just the thing for both of you.

641
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,230
Marie, this idea....

642
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,350
Was it yours?

643
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,030
Actually, it was Skyler's.

644
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,510
She really needs this, Walt.

645
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,390
Yep.

646
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,830
I gave Marie bottles.

647
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,110
They'll stop and pick up diapers

648
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,110
along the way.

649
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,150
I spoke with Junior on the phone...

650
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,470
...and after much discussion...

651
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,190
...he agreed to swing by tomorrow,

652
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,190
pick up some clothes. And so voilà...

653
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,670
...the kids are out of this environment.

654
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,710
What a coincidence.

655
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,430
I know you're awake.

656
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,430
What was that about?

657
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,550
Can you explain it?

658
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,870
I don't want the children here anymore.

659
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,990
It isn't safe.

660
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,150
Skyler, we have talked

661
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,150
about this repeatedly.

662
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,800
It has never been more safe.

663
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,990
"Never been"?

664
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,880
A couple weeks ago,

665
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,880
a man was coming to this house...

666
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,110
...to kill us,

667
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,110
to murder your entire family.

668
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,110
You were in the crawlspace,

669
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,110
screaming.

670
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,990
And I dealt with him. It's over.

671
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,910
It is not.

672
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,190
You're right back

673
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,190
in the meth business again.

674
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,510
This is different.

675
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,510
Now I'm running things.

676
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,430
So wait. Now that you're in charge...

677
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,670
...it's what? It's gonna be

678
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,670
smooth sailing from here on out?

679
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,280
I don't see why not.

680
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,270
I keep the work at work, Skyler...

681
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,230
...and nothing will ever

682
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,230
impact you or the kids.

683
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,270
You don't know that.

684
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,270
You can't make that promise, Walt.

685
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,070
I can promise you

686
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,070
that Gus Fring is dead.

687
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,510
And he was the threat.

688
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,510
He was the danger.

689
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,110
I thought you were the danger.

690
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,200
Is that what your pool stunt was about?

691
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,550
Trying to protect my children from me?

692
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,430
Not just you.

693
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,870
There's blood on my hands too.

694
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,870
What blood? Beneke?

695
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,430
He's in the hospital because of me.

696
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,230
- No.

697
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,230
- Because of what I did.

698
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,910
Skyler, you can't beat yourself up

699
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,910
over this thing.

700
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,830
Please. You didn't set out

701
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,830
to hurt anybody.

702
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,350
You made a mistake,

703
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,350
and things got out of control...

704
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,550
...but you did what you had to

705
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,550
to protect your family. I'm sorry.

706
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,550
That doesn't make you a bad person,

707
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,550
it makes you a human being.

708
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,390
Stop it, Walt. Just stop.

709
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,350
I don't need to hear any

710
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,350
of your bullshit rationales.

711
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,950
I'm in it now.

712
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,310
I'm compromised. But I won't--

713
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,470
I will not have my children

714
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,470
living in a house...

715
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,350
...where dealing drugs

716
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,350
and hurting people and killing people...

717
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,470
...is shrugged off as "shit happens."

718
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,550
We're back at it? Fine.

719
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,510
But the kids stay away, and that's that.

720
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,390
"That's that"? That's what?

721
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,390
I got them out of this house.

722
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,120
To a sleepover

723
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,120
at their aunt and uncle's?

724
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,710
They spend a day or two...

725
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,790
...Junior stays up late watching movies,

726
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,790
and then what happens?

727
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,680
- We'll see.

728
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,680
- No, I'll tell you what happens.

729
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,230
They come home to this house,

730
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,230
to their parents who love them.

731
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,080
No. I will not let

732
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,080
our business endanger them.

733
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,830
How many times do I have to say...

734
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,790
- ...that they are not in--?

735
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,790
- I said no.

736
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,150
I swear to God,

737
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,150
I won't have them back here.

738
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,470
What are you gonna do to stop it?

739
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,070
Whatever it takes.

740
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,070
Everything in my power.

741
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,310
Like what? I mean, specifically.

742
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,190
What is your next move?

743
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,590
My next move is maybe I hurt myself.

744
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,710
Make it clear we need more time.

745
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,150
Let Hank and Marie see

746
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,150
we're still struggling.

747
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,360
No, more like you're still struggling. So

748
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,360
maybe next time, I have you committed.

749
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,350
Put you in some inpatient facility

750
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,350
while I take care of the kids myself.

751
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,710
Is that what you want?

752
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,230
So then maybe I show up

753
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,230
with bruises on my neck...

754
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,990
...give myself a black eye...

755
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,870
...say that you beat me...

756
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,670
...when you found out about my lover.

757
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,310
I see.

758
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,470
So you want to involve Ted?

759
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,910
Oh, well, that'll be fun...

760
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,540
...bringing the police

761
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,540
up to speed on all of that.

762
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,830
But not as much fun as

763
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,830
telling your 16-year-old son...

764
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,590
...that his father is a wife-beater.

765
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,150
Also not a very good plan.

766
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,150
What else you got?

767
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,710
- I could send Junior away to school.

768
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,710
- Now here's the conversation:

769
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,990
"So, honey, I know you've only got

770
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,990
one year left in high school...

771
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,590
...but I would love it

772
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,590
if you'd drop everything...

773
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,070
...leave all your friends behind,

774
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,070
and go to boarding school in Arizona."

775
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,630
You have any other ideas?

776
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,630
Because I'm not hearing...

777
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,430
...a solution to your problem.

778
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,830
How are you going to save our kids

779
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,830
from this terrible environment?

780
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,630
- I don't....

781
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,630
- What are you gonna do?

782
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,990
Run off to France? You gonna

783
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,990
close the curtains, change the locks?

784
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,990
This is a joke. Come on, Skyler.

785
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,470
You wanna take me on?

786
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,470
You wanna take away my children?

787
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,470
- What's the plan?

788
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,470
- I don't know!

789
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,670
This is the best

790
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,670
I could come up with, okay?

791
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,620
I will count every minute

792
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,620
that the kids are away from here...

793
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,910
...away from you, as a victory.

794
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,590
But you're right.

795
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,270
It's a bad plan.

796
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,430
I don't have any of your magic, Walt.

797
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,080
I don't know what to do.

798
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,310
I'm a coward.

799
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,390
I-- I can't go to the police.

800
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,390
I can't stop laundering your money.

801
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,510
I can't keep you out of this house.

802
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,430
I can't even keep you out of my bed.

803
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,710
All I can do is wait.

804
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,870
That's it. That's the only good option.

805
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,630
Hold on, bide my time...

806
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,350
...and wait.

807
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,310
Wait for what?

808
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,310
What are you waiting for?

809
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,110
For the cancer to come back.

810
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,110
Yeah?

811
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,830
Okay. Okay.

812
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,870
Just relax. I'm coming.

813
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,270
Look at that.

814
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,270
You tell me what that looks like.

815
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,750
If the DEA's tracking her barrels,

816
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,750
there goes our precursor connection.

817
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,270
That's done.

818
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,270
And I'm telling you, these days...

819
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,510
...chances of getting a new

820
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,510
methylamine hookup is rare, man.

821
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,430
It's like Bigfoot. Like unicorn-rare.

822
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,830
Kid, it's just....

823
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,830
You're giving me heartburn here.

824
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,700
GPS on the bottom of the barrel.

825
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,470
Why didn't they put it inside

826
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,470
where nobody would see it?

827
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,350
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

828
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,350
They made these things

829
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,350
to put under cars.

830
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,310
It can get wet.

831
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,430
Even by cop standards, this is sloppy.

832
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,030
And the other barrels...

833
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,190
...they have trackers

834
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,190
on the outside too?

835
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,790
I don't know. Probably.

836
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,110
You didn't check

837
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,110
any of the other barrels?

838
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,350
No. But that's the only one

839
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,350
we could've taken according to her.

840
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,270
Once we spotted it, she freaked out,

841
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,270
I put the barrel back, and we F.O.'d.

842
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,310
Let me ask you something.

843
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,830
The person who spotted this...

844
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,550
...was it you or was it her?

845
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,150
Lydia. She saw it first.

846
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,230
Okay.

847
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,620
She's dead.

848
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,470
Wait, wait, wait. What?

849
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,550
Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.

850
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,150
She's thinking if she makes it look

851
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,150
like her inventory's being watched...

852
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,150
...that we'll leave her alone

853
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,150
and take our business elsewhere.

854
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,640
And she's right.

855
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,110
We will be taking our business

856
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,110
elsewhere...

857
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,590
...right after I leave her alone in a ditch.

858
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,320
But wait, hey, if the DEA's

859
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,320
not tracking her stuff...

860
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,670
...that's a good thing, right?

861
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,670
I mean, all we gotta do is tell her...

862
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,510
...to cut the crap

863
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,510
and keep the methylamine coming.

864
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,390
You don't know this woman like I do.

865
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,710
I had a chance to deal with this before,

866
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,710
and I gave her a pass.

867
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,710
That's what I get for being sexist.

868
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,350
- Now, if you'll excuse me....

869
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,350
- Mike, you can't just--

870
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,830
Look, that's our precursor.

871
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,830
We need her.

872
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,470
Kid, if we have to ramp down

873
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,470
for a while, so be it.

874
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,150
It beats working with a lunatic

875
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,150
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

876
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,750
Look, she didn't seem crazy to me, you

877
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,750
know? She just seemed, like, uptight.

878
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,030
And now you're being sexist.

879
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,150
Trust me, this woman deserves to die

880
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,150
as much as any man I've ever met.

881
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,150
Wait!

882
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,030
Just wait.

883
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,230
What if this really was the cops,

884
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,230
you know?

885
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,160
- And what if you're wrong about her?

886
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,160
- I'm not wrong.

887
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,670
But what if you are?

888
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,550
Jesse, your misgivings

889
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,550
have been duly noted.

890
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,280
Now move away from me.

891
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,470
No. This is a voting thing.

892
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,630
- I don't think so.

893
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,630
- I vote it's a voting thing.

894
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,110
Mr. White, weigh in here, would you?

895
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,950
What do you think?

896
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,630
Mr. White?

897
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,990
The methylamine keeps flowing,

898
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,990
no matter what.

899
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,920
We are not ramping down.

900
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,590
We're just getting started.

901
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,120
Nothing stops this train.

902
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,430
Nothing.

903
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,670
Hey, yo, Mr. White. Hold up.

904
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,910
Hey, I just wanted to say

905
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,910
I liked your idea.

906
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,190
You know, it's pretty....

907
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,350
I think it's the way to go.

908
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,470
Oh, hey.

909
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,270
You said it was your birthday, so....

910
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,620
I left the receipt in the box

911
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,620
in case you wanna exchange it.

912
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,040
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

913
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,790
Hi.

914
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,190
I stopped by Hank and Marie's.

915
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,470
Junior is still asking,

916
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,470
"What is going on?"

917
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,030
Nonstop, very insistently.

918
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,190
But everything's okay.

919
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,230
They're watching Ratatouille.

920
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,910
It's very sweet.

921
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,590
How are you?

922
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,110
There's gonna be some more money

923
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,110
coming in soon.

924
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,870
Is that okay?

925
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,400
Fine.

926
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,960
Good.

927
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,590
So....

928
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,630
You coming to bed?

929
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,910
I wanna show you something.

930
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,070
See that watch?

931
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,670
It was a birthday present.

932
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,790
The person who gave me

933
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,790
this present...

934
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,670
...wanted me dead too.

935
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,790
Not that long ago...

936
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,590
...he pointed a gun

937
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,590
right between my eyes, right here...

938
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,580
...and he threatened to kill me.

939
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,950
He changed his mind

940
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,950
about me, Skyler...

941
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,990
...and so will you.
