3
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,916
You're here, Arjun? Freshen up.
The food is ready.

4
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,500
Who are you?

5
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,583
I am hungry, mother.
I haven't eaten in many days.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,416
Poor guy! Please eat.

7
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,291
What is your name, son?

8
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,500
Krishna.

9
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,041
Go on, have it.

10
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,500
Come and have your food.

11
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,416
I've finished all the
work and come, mom.

12
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,125
Sit down first.

13
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,416
Here.

14
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,208
Hey...

15
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,041
Who is this brother, mom?

16
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,000
You have already called him brother.
Consider him as one.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,791
Brother.

18
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:21,750
Mom, take this.

19
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,208
Have you made this for me?
- Hmm.

20
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,500
You are such a good kid!

21
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:27,625
What about me, mom?

22
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,833
You mean the world to me.

23
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,791
Sir...

24
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,250
Yes?
- You know the festival is near.

25
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,791
Yes.
- I need a loan.

26
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,708
Yes, I am aware.

27
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,333
Do you want a loan?

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,958
When else will you ask it,
if not on a festival?

29
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,125
Here! Where are you going?
Put your thumbprint here.

30
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,416
How else will I take
it back from you?

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,333
Press hard.

32
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,041
Harder. Hey!

33
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,833
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,500
Oh, you broke the table! Huh!

35
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,958
Ah, Goddess Lakshmi!

36
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,708
Uncle, bring Satto's son quickly.

37
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Brother, focus on the job.

38
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,500
Sir!
- Yes?

39
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,333
We have fixed the table. Okay.
- Okay, keep it here. Come on, fast!

40
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,416
Hey, careful!

41
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,583
Sir...

42
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,833
What?
- Please pay the wages.

43
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,416
I will pass it for interest
on your mom's loan. Get going.

44
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,083
He is asking me for money!

45
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:48,875
Arjun...

46
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,458
Brother, this is Rukmini.
She's a great girl.

47
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,250
Who is he?
- Krishna. My elder brother.

48
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,625
Hey, Arjun! Your mom suddenly...
Run for home quickly!

49
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,541
What happened to mom?

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,416
Mom…

51
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,333
Mom! Open your eyes, mom!

52
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,083
Mom...

53
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,083
Mom...

54
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,416
Mom! Get up, mom!

55
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,666
Mom!

56
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,666
Your mom had mortgaged
this hut and taken a loan, dear.

57
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,375
Now I will have to sell it
to recover my dues.

58
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,208
No one can stop a dying person

59
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,916
or a lender who is out
to recover his dues.

60
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,333
We will repay all your dues,

61
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,750
but please don't take
our house away from us, sir.

62
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,666
And how will you repay me, my dear?

63
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,708
Stop this drama. Lift the bier.

64
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:30,916
Hey!

65
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,750
I will kill anybody who touches her.

66
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,958
Who was she to you?

67
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,875
She is my mother,
and he is my younger brother.

68
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,083
Greetings.

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,625
What is the problem?

70
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,625
What can I tell you?
Times have changed.

71
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,666
The person who lent them money
and helped their mother…

72
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,916
Now he wants to kill him!

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,291
Tell me, what should I do now?

74
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,500
Spare the children.
I will pay their dues.

75
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,666
Didn't you hear?

76
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,625
This house was yours
and will always be yours.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,791
Mom!

78
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,916
What is your name?
- Krishna.

79
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,000
Greetings, sir. - Take care.
- Sure, sir.

80
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,458
Enough.

81
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,666
Hey, come, kids!

82
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:56,916
Yeah.

83
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,041
Sit here.

84
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,500
Hey, what are you doing? Get up!

85
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,583
Don't sit on the floor.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Come here. Sit here.

87
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,416
Sit with us.

88
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,333
Listen...
- Yes?

89
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,125
Serve them food.
- Sure.

90
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,166
Do you eat 'dosa'?
- Hmm.

91
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,041
Huh?

92
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,250
Krishna...

93
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:32,958
Krishna...

94
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,625
Krishna, Rukmini is coming.

95
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,625
Bare your heart to her today.

96
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:42,000
Or just say the dialogue
that heroes say in the movies.

97
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,125
Otherwise, I will lose my face.

98
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,708
Hey, Arjun!

99
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,416
What are you guys doing here?

100
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,416
My brother wants
to tell you something.

101
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,916
Would you like to hear it?

102
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,333
Why are you quiet?

103
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,750
Go on. Tell me.

104
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,791
Uh... actually I...

105
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,375
A lot...

106
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,458
Huh?

107
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,500
Master… Master!

108
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,208
Hey! Come on, man!

109
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,166
Come on! Hey!

110
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,583
Hey, listen.

111
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,958
Where is Gopalrao's house?

112
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,916
It's the last house
on the right-hand side.

113
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,333
Hmm.

114
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,416
Uh, greetings, sir.

115
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,375
Is Bhaskar home?

116
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,166
Bhaskar!

117
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,541
Yeah, Dad!

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,708
How presumptuous you are!

119
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,666
The boys in my village are scared
to even look at my sister.

120
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,750
And you dared to give her a rose.

121
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,416
Now, I will give you a rose,
and you'll follow me.

122
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,458
Or else…

123
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,375
Why would a father die for his son?
Take him along.

124
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Come, come on!

125
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,166
Hey! Who the heck are you guys?

126
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,416
Dump him in!
- Hey, what are you doing?

127
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,250
Where are you taking
my brother-in-law?

128
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,750
Hey, enough of your hooliganism!

129
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,500
Father, they are
taking your son away.

130
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,083
You didn't say anything to them
and playing the clarinet here!

131
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,125
Can't you see anything?

132
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,541
Let's lodge a complaint
with the police.

133
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,291
Son-in-law.
He will come home himself.

134
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,875
The snacks are ready. Please, come.

135
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,458
Are your snacks more important
than the son of this house?

136
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,541
Forget him now.
I've made snacks for you.

137
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,666
Oh, God. Keep quiet.

138
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,875
Are you guys crazy, or what?

139
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,041
Serve them. No, wait!

140
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,333
Who made these? You or my wife?

141
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,458
I made it. Shall I now?
- Thank God!

142
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,833
How can I eat it when it's so hot?

143
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,458
Your son has been kidnapped,
and you are busy eating fritters.

144
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,208
Who will save him?
- The one who saves everyone.

145
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,500
We are Bhaskar's parents.

146
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,875
But he is the master for all of us.

147
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,083
He's our God. Our master.

148
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,083
Will that old man save him?

149
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,250
Will he fight them?
Did you see the size of the goons?

150
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,916
Just like God protects his devotees,

151
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,333
our protector
protects the villagers.

152
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,375
Who is he?

153
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,083
Arjun, I forgot the matchbox.

154
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,500
Go on. Where did they take him?

155
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,625
They went this way.

156
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,583
Could you give me the matchbox?
- I don't have it, sir.

157
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,333
Okay, we'll handle them first.

158
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,375
And then I'll have a puff.
- Okay.

159
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,583
You can go, Arjun.

160
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,541
That's more like it.

161
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,583
Take him to task.

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,458
'This is Akashvani. This is a
warning for an incoming storm.'

163
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,208
Hey, Krishna!

164
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,583
Er… this is my personal issue.

165
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,458
Don't interfere.

166
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,666
Sir, what do you think?
Arjun would have reached?

167
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,375
Where exactly?

168
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,583
To inform your families
about your death.

169
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,458
Huh? This is not your area!

170
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,041
You can't enter just anywhere!

171
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:55,041
If my master orders me,
I'll cross the country and border.

172
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,625
I'll go to the world down under

173
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,500
and fight Yamraj, too.

174
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,750
Hey…

175
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,916
Aunty!
- What is it?

176
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,666
Go to the field with 4-5 sardines
and half a kilo of turmeric.

177
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,166
Why?
- To treat your son.

178
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,583
How did he get hurt?

179
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,333
One... two... three!

180
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,875
Like this.

181
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,833
Krishna…

182
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,208
Stop.

183
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,750
“Goodness gracious”

184
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,125
“My goodness gracious”

185
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,125
Hey, ma'am!

186
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,541
What is it?

187
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,708
Where is your husband?

188
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,291
He must be somewhere. He's still the
same even after becoming a father.

189
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,000
He won't be able
to become a father again.

190
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,625
Why? What for?

191
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,708
Hey!

192
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,458
Sister... what are you up to?

193
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,958
I am making butter for my husband.

194
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,958
Butter is necessary
to mend a broken back.

195
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:46,875
Eh?

196
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,791
Poor thing!

197
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,291
Come on, beat him up, Krishna!

198
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,708
Hey, uncle! Why are you sitting
with a long face?

199
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,791
What do I do? No business, kid.

200
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,791
Be prepared. The patients
must be on the way.

201
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,625
Hmm?

202
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,541
Yeah!

203
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,291
Hey!

204
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,958
I'm sparing you
because Master asked me to.

205
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,458
If you trouble my people again,

206
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,125
then I'll skin you alive
like a sugarcane.

207
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,375
Don't mess with me!

208
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,583
Hey, Krishna, come forward.

209
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,500
Master, you carry on.
- Come on, don't be shy.

210
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,666
Krishna is Master's favourite.

211
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,291
Master dotes on Krishna.

212
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,125
Dad prioritises that servant
over his own sons.

213
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,791
Krishna...
- Yes...

214
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:18,875
They are evil.

215
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,833
Take care of Bhaskar
until the festival is over.

216
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,625
Okay, master!
- Fine!

217
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,708
Arjun!
- I'll take care of him.

218
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,708
Sir, the rooster is ready
for the fight.

219
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,125
Sir?

220
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,041
The edge is sharp.
Fix it on our rooster.

221
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,083
Okay, sir.

222
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,708
'If you trouble my people again,'

223
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,750
'then I'll skin you alive
like a sugarcane.'

224
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,333
'Don't mess with me!'

225
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,125
How did Bhaskar meet my daughter?

226
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I heard they met
on the bus for the first time.

227
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,833
After that, they continued meeting.

228
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,208
Both of them are in the same class,
Mr Veerabhadra.

229
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,791
Tell me something.
Why did you give her a flower?

230
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,958
It's an old custom, brother.

231
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,458
If you give flowers at a festival,
the relationship lasts forever.

232
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,708
You, Romeo. If not for master, you
wouldn't be alive to fall in love.

233
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,041
I know. But my heart has
stopped listening to my mind.

234
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,541
It does as it wants.

235
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,208
And my body moves as per its wishes.

236
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,333
If I don't meet her,
I can't stay happy.

237
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,208
And as soon as I meet her,
my heart starts racing.

238
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,708
I have no control when
my heart takes over.

239
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,166
For her, let alone the village,

240
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,041
I am ready to cross the seven seas.

241
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:22,708
Hey...

242
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,250
What did you do now?

243
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,875
He's telling me his love story.

244
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,958
He is a true lover.
- Hey!

245
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,125
Don't create any new problems now.

246
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,458
Give a break to your love story
for a while. Understood?

247
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,958
Your father-in-law is looking
for a chance to kill you.

248
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,958
What does Krishna know
about how powerful love can be?

249
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,916
He doesn't have a heart,
but a stone.

250
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,208
You have only seen his action,
not his love.

251
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,416
He is a real lover.

252
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,000
Lover? No way.

253
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,041
He can only woo a girl
by threatening her, not by love.

254
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,083
There are always
two sides to a coin.

255
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,583
He has three to four sides. Come on.

256
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,333
I'll tell you
his childhood love story.

257
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,125
The girl whom Krishna
used to love in childhood,

258
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,416
was sent to the city for studies
by her strict father.

259
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,166
Rukmini, you will not study with
these dull-heads in the village,

260
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,500
but you'll study
with the educated kids in the city.

261
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,500
Grandma will always be with you.
Study with interest.

262
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,125
And don't become friends with
any poor, uneducated child. Okay?

263
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,416
That girl came back
to the village after 20 years.

264
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,416
And Krishna got the news.

265
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,833
But Krishna could never
find her in the house.

266
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,333
Finally, they met on my wedding day.

267
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,041
Greetings.
- Greetings. Greetings.

268
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,916
Master! Please come. How are you?

269
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,041
Master has arrived.

270
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,500
Madam, please come. Be seated.

271
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,250
Greetings! Please sit.
- Greetings.

272
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,708
Master, there is Arjun.

273
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,541
Hey!

274
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,375
How did the lights go off?

275
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,833
This is Rukmini…

276
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,125
This isn't needed.
- Hey! Why not?

277
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,000
Hey, Rukmini!
When did you come back from town?

278
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,791
Please sit.
- How is everyone?

279
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,375
Rukmini, you have no idea.

280
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,125
Our village has changed a lot.

281
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,875
Is that so?
- Yes.

282
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,500
You might not even know we have
a permanent school building now.

283
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,666
And that too a big one.

284
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,791
New bridges have also
been built over all the canals.

285
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,833
You don't know about that too?
- Mmm-mmm!

286
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,458
Be blessed!

287
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,958
Take his blessings, too.

288
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:12,916
Mangla, come here.

289
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,250
Bless us, Krishna.
- God bless you.

290
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,416
Don't overdo it.

291
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,000
Only one of you should
call me brother.

292
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,541
This is such a torture!

293
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,291
Such an idiot!

294
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,333
Hey, stop it. Stop it!
I said stop it!

295
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,583
Don't dance! Stop it!

296
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,208
Are you making this noise
to make me deaf?

297
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,416
It's been a long time since we've
been happy, so we're dancing.

298
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,333
Is that so?

299
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,541
So celebrate within your limits!

300
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,125
You were already an orphan,

301
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,083
and you have chosen
an orphan bride too.

302
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,833
A poor, cheap guy like you

303
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,791
is celebrating as if you are
from a reputed family.

304
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,416
You sing on the mic,
you useless fellow!

305
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,916
There were two orphans here earlier.
Now you're three.

306
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,291
What is so big a change?

307
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,083
This is not a home, man!

308
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,458
This is an orphanage. Hey...

309
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,333
Hey!

310
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:29,916
If high-profile people are like you,

311
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,375
it's good that we are orphans.

312
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,416
Huh!

313
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,916
You're useless! You have no value!

314
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:40,500
The villagers hate you so much that
no one will come to your funeral.

315
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,750
You will rot like an orphan.

316
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,583
Don't point fingers
at my family again.

317
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,625
Don't mess with me!

318
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,791
What have you done, Krishna?

319
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,125
After all,
he is your future father-in-law.

320
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,541
So? But why did he call us orphans?

321
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,208
You are like my son,
and I'm like your father.

322
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:02,875
And she's the light of our house.

323
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,291
Don't be sad now.
Otherwise, I will also cry.

324
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:11,375
There will be only happiness
in the house today.

325
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,375
When will you stop feeling shy?
- Once you leave.

326
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,458
Give it quickly.

327
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,666
We'll play alone now.

328
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,041
All of you leave now.
Go back to your home.

329
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,958
Don't be too scared.
- Come on, let's go.

330
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,291
Take care. I'll meet you tomorrow.

331
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,333
What about you?
Are you the mother-in-law? Go now.

332
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,500
I'm leaving.

333
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,375
I won't open the door
till tomorrow afternoon.

334
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,333
Krishna.
- Hmm?

335
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,000
Do you really love the
accountant's daughter, Rukmini?

336
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,250
Yes. What is it now?

337
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:52,583
Nothing much. The love you have for
her is clearly visible in your eyes.

338
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:55,416
But she didn't even look
at you in the wedding.

339
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,250
Moreover, you threatened her father.

340
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,041
I don't know how you will
proceed with this relationship.

341
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,416
Hey... Go and sleep now.

342
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,333
Keep the radio here.
- Okay, Krishna.

343
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:11,083
The truth is always bitter.
- Idiot...

344
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,000
I better run before he hears me.

345
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,333
'But she didn't even look
at you at the wedding.'

346
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,208
"Here he comes"

347
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,666
"Your king"

348
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,666
"He'll shoo your sleep away.
He'll keep you awake all night"

349
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,083
Who the heck is this?

350
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,791
I will be right back.
Don't go to sleep.

351
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,500
Yes, coming...

352
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,625
What is it, Krishna?
- Hey...

353
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,916
Rukmini didn't recognise me, man.
Has she forgotten about me?

354
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,666
How would I know, Krishna?
Let's go and ask her tomorrow.

355
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:09,125
"Your king is back"

356
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:13,625
"Your king is back"

357
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:17,791
"He'll shoo your sleep away.
He'll keep you awake all night"

358
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,625
Krishna, what is it now?

359
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,791
Hey, ever since I saw Rukmini,
I have lost control of my heart.

360
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,208
I want to get married to her
as soon as possible.

361
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,041
I'm also not able to control myself.

362
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,666
I'm also in a great hurry
just like you.

363
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,250
My heart is fluttering
like a butterfly.

364
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,833
My heart too.

365
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,250
What can I tell you now, Krishna?

366
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,125
Krishna, let us
discuss this tomorrow.

367
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,208
Hmm.

368
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,875
"I am back"

369
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:56,500
Krishna...

370
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,958
Arjun, ever since I saw Rukmini,
I just don't know what to do.

371
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:04,000
I know what to do,
but you're not letting me.

372
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,416
You don't have to do anything…
- Krishna.

373
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,583
I'm a little busy.
Stop disturbing me now.

374
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,291
We will sort this out
in the morning, okay?

375
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,583
You got it, right?

376
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:18,416
"Your king is back"

377
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:23,541
"Your king is back"

378
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:27,458
"He'll shoo your sleep away.
He'll keep you awake all night"

379
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,958
The whole program ended
before it even started.

380
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,041
Krishna!

381
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,625
Tell me something, sir.

382
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,958
Why do you sprinkle salt
and basil water on the money?

383
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,708
That's a good question.

384
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,791
The borrower won't be able
to return the money

385
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,416
when you sprinkle salt water.

386
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:46,750
And when we sprinkle basil water,
this sinful money gets purified.

387
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,208
This is called balancing it.
Got it?

388
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,208
Let's go, driver. You can also go.

389
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:55,750
Let's go, Krishna.

390
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,875
Wait and watch, Krishna. She'll
hug you as soon as she sees you.

391
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,500
Arjun, give me your glasses.
- Here you go.

392
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,250
The newly married groom
is here early in the morning!

393
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,791
It must be something important.

394
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,791
Do I need a reason to come
and meet my friend?

395
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,416
Look who has come with me?
Krishna, my elder brother.

396
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:21,541
Krishna?

397
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,375
Didn't I tell you?
She's so happy to see you.

398
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:27,791
Oh… Krishna?
- Hmm.

399
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,291
How dare you grab my dad's collar!

400
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,583
How dare you touch him!

401
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,291
What kind of shameless guy are you?
You insulted my father first.

402
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,000
And now you've come to his house.
- I...

403
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,833
Don't show your face to me.
Get out of here!

404
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,041
Should we go, brother?

405
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,833
A man who single-handedly
fights 100 men,

406
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,458
was trembling in front of that girl.

407
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,000
Love has ruined him.

408
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,125
Hey, don't be shy.

409
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,125
We've also been
through these challenges.

410
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:00,333
Look at him.
We got Arjun married too.

411
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,416
Now, only Das and you are left.

412
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,041
I am looking
for a nice match for Das too.

413
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,750
He is about to return from Dubai.

414
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,500
Now, let's come to you.

415
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,541
Tell me who the girl is.

416
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,250
I will go talk to them.

417
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:18,666
Master, reference works everywhere,
but not in love.

418
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:22,416
When she believes in me
and insists me to meet you,

419
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,750
then I'll take you
to talk to her family.

420
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:28,166
If she doesn't want to look at you,
how will she fall in love with you?

421
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,916
She's not a fish
that you can catch easily.

422
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,500
Shut up, you idiot!

423
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,666
Will she get a diamond
like my brother?

424
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:37,416
And she won't fall for someone
who can't buy her a real diamond.

425
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,125
Arjun, fighting silly goons

426
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,958
and getting a city-bred deer
are different things.

427
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,333
She's from the city.
He won't be able to do it.

428
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:44,916
Hey…
- Hmm.

429
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,916
If I don't take her on my bicycle
by tomorrow evening,

430
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,416
I won't call myself Krishna anymore.

431
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:05,166
Some goons are dragging your father
and hitting him near the river.

432
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,250
Huh? What!

433
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:09,708
Let's go!

434
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:14,708
Hey, boy!

435
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,166
Huh? What is it, girl?

436
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,291
I need to go
to the river right away.

437
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,333
Can you please take me?

438
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,166
You told me not to show you my face.

439
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,208
Go and find someone else.

440
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,333
Darn it! I should have gone walking.

441
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,208
Hey, girl!

442
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,916
By the time you wander to the river,

443
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,916
the accountant's
bones will be broken.

444
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:37,375
If someone drops you there
on a bicycle, you'll reach on time.

445
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,333
Which way are you going?

446
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,333
I have to go far away, but I'll
take a shortcut near the river.

447
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,250
Why don't you take me along then?

448
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,166
Huh?

449
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,958
My bicycle has no carrier.

450
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:53,750
Will you sit in the front?

451
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,375
Hmm...

452
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,083
Hmm.

453
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:08,583
Huh?

454
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,833
Did she really not find anyone else?

455
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,625
Hey, Babulal! You were saying
something about diamonds, right?

456
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,708
Not everyone is as lucky
as you, brother.

457
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,250
You sit here waiting
for your fate to turn.

458
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,750
I believe in hard work.

459
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,000
Bring our sister-in-law
home sometime.

460
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,250
Whom is he calling sister-in-law?

461
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,666
Think about your dad. Let's go.

462
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,958
How did you manage to woo her?

463
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,333
Hey, stop! Stop!

464
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,625
Stop!
- Oh!

465
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:35,041
Be careful, all right?
- Okay!

466
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,416
Hey!
- Huh?

467
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,958
You said I won't be able
to do it, right?

468
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:47,958
What is he talking about?

469
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,333
He said I can't handle the deer
that has come into our village.

470
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,875
I accept defeat, brother.

471
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:56,166
What no one can do,
only you can do it.

472
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,708
You have found out just now.

473
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,625
But others have known
about it for a long time.

474
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,250
Tell me, will I get the deer or not?

475
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,708
Yes! Of course, you will.

476
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,000
Ah! See?

477
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,583
She said yes. Now its confirmed.
- What do you mean?

478
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,625
Will you only ask questions?
Don't you want to save your Dad?

479
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:14,833
Shall we go?
- Yes!

480
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,958
Bring another one.
- He looks fine.

481
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,500
Why did the boy lie to me?

482
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,750
Oh! So, did you send him to me?

483
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:36,125
I set this up to show you how
much the village has progressed.

484
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,500
'Hey... Stop!'

485
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:46,541
The cycle ride
on the canal bridge... was it good?

486
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,500
Hey, girl, listen!

487
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,208
What are these?
- Toe rings!

488
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,541
So give them to your wife, not me.

489
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,041
Look here.
- Hmm?

490
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:06,416
I'll store them safe in my heart
and give them after the wedding.

491
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,583
Why did you bring me here
at midnight?

492
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:26,166
Rukmini wants to meet you, Krishna.
Please go. I'll wait here.

493
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,958
Why did you ask me to meet
in private?

494
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:58,916
Um…

495
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,750
I want to tell you something.

496
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,000
Keep it to yourself.

497
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,791
Try me.

498
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,333
I want to know you
before marrying you.

499
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,500
How can I marry you
without knowing you?

500
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,250
That's why… I asked my maid
for advice…

501
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:16,875
'Do one thing, madam.'

502
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:19,625
'You heard about Rangeela Talkies?
There is a show at 5:00 p.m.'

503
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:22,291
'Go there with him.
You will know everything.'

504
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,750
Will you take me?

505
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,125
Do you know what kind
of movies they show there?

506
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,416
Hmm.

507
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't be shameless like your father.

508
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,500
Why are you involving
my Dad into this?

509
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,041
Tell me
whether you'll take me or not.

510
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,916
I am highly respected
in the village.

511
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,083
If someone sees us,
my reputation will be ruined.

512
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,500
Disgusting! I won't take you.

513
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,041
What's the matter, Krishna?
Why do you look flustered?

514
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,208
What did she ask for?

515
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:55,458
If you hear her demands,
your whole buzz will disappear.

516
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,125
Let it be! She demanded something
for the first time.

517
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,000
We'll give it. We'll
fulfil her wish.

518
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:03,625
Fine.

519
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,208
I'll take you for a movie
tomorrow evening.

520
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,083
Hmm.

521
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,541
Amazing!

522
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,375
Where are you going all dressed up

523
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,666
Did you forget we're going
to the movies? Let's go.

524
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,333
We are not going for
a devotional gathering.

525
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,125
It's a vibrant movie.

526
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:48,250
If you enter the theater like this,
they'll make a movie about you.

527
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,083
Hmm! Then what shall I wear?

528
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,041
Wear this.

529
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,208
Hey, Krishna.

530
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,083
Who is that sitting with you?

531
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,833
If I reveal it,
all **** will break loose.

532
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,000
Hurry up!

533
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,666
We may miss the main scenes.
- Hold on.

534
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,083
There's a right time
to enter the theatre. - What time?

535
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,250
When all the lights are turned off.

536
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,833
I will count to three.
- Hmm.

537
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,583
Swifty barge in, find a seat
and quickly sit down.

538
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:30,458
Hurry up.

539
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:32,708
One.

540
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,500
Two… Hey, hey...

541
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:36,458
Did you run away? Hey, wait!

542
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,333
Stop, stop, stop!

543
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,041
Hey, what's wrong?

544
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,458
How will we enter without a ticket?

545
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,916
Huh?
- Two tickets please.

546
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:42,625
Hurry up! Hurry up!

547
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,666
Let's go! Let's go!

548
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,458
When will they play the main scene?

549
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,000
What brings so many men here?

550
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,333
They don't get food at home.

551
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,750
Do they get food here?
- Hmm.

552
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,375
'What I said is final!
- I will marry her only.'

553
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:15,416
'No matter what!'

554
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,416
Has the main scene come yet?

555
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:21,250
Has the main scene come yet?
- Not yet!

556
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,583
They will first sell the popcorn and
'samosa' and then show the scene.

557
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,416
Even the interval feels delayed.

558
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,041
These theatre guys are looting us.

559
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,416
You were getting
scared for no reason.

560
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,541
This is just like a normal film.

561
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,208
Because
this is not the original film.

562
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,958
It will be fun when they play
the new reel, after the interval.

563
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,458
Bend down. Bend down. Bend down.

564
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,208
All the youth seem to be here...

565
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,458
Hey! Aren't you Chamanrao's son?

566
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:54,708
Are you not ashamed
to watch such films?

567
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,583
Hey! Learn from my son.

568
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:57,750
He is a gem.

569
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,625
He doesn't go anywhere
apart from the college.

570
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:01,500
Huh?

571
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,250
Sir, isn't this your gem?

572
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,208
Shameless fellow! You're here!
Sit down!

573
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,875
Get your money's worth
out of the ticket.

574
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,041
When the scene plays,
closing your eyes.

575
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,125
He defamed me!

576
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:10,916
Disgusting!
- Huh?

577
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,333
The nation's youth
has wandered off the path.

578
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,916
We should blame their teachers
for making them go astray.

579
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,791
You're right.

580
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,208
Hmm?

581
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,750
Master! You are here too,
leaving the school...

582
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,833
I was tired
from checking the homework.

583
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:25,375
So I thought I'd take a break
and get some fresh air.

584
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,416
This is not like getting fresh air,
this is...

585
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,125
This is called fulfiling one's lust.

586
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,625
Enough. Let's go.

587
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:00,500
Wait.

588
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,208
The real scene just started.

589
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,666
I said enough.

590
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,500
Is that so?

591
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,041
Bah, let's go!

592
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:10,416
Hey! Why are you leaving

593
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,250
without watching the main scene?

594
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,250
Close your eyes! Quickly close them.

595
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,333
Come on. Look ahead!

596
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:49,833
I...

597
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,500
...want to watch rest of the movie?

598
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,833
That was over.

599
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,916
What do I do with this?
- Get such clothes for me.

600
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,041
What kind of girl are you?

601
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,041
You look simple.

602
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:18,708
But you don't act simple.
Your actions are quite devious.

603
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,333
Why do you say that?

604
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:21,833
What's wrong with these clothes?

605
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:25,166
There are hardly any clothes.
That's the biggest problem.

606
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,833
I thought you will surely understand
my feelings.

607
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,458
But no.
You're just like everyone else.

608
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:34,166
You want to crush my aspirations.

609
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:37,541
You wanted watch a film earlier.
Now you want to wear filmy clothes.

610
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,250
Your intentions don't seem right.

611
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,125
What happened, brother?
Today, you're flustered again!

612
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,458
What did she ask for this time?

613
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,666
She doesn't think before speaking.

614
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,416
You have no idea
what she is asking for.

615
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,041
Both of them don't listen to me.

616
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:51,375
Whatever it is.

617
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:52,458
She has asked for it,
considering you to be close to her.

618
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,333
Go ahead and do it.
We'll fulfil her wish.

619
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,666
"This..."

620
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,708
Did you prepare it?
I don't believe it.

621
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:17,625
Tell me the truth.

622
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:20,125
Why would I feed you something
that was made by someone else?

623
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:21,875
I made it specially for you.

624
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,250
After my mom's cooking,

625
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,041
it's your food that I am
enjoying most, Rukmini.

626
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:30,416
The size is perfect.
Shall I show it to you?

627
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,625
Would you listen if I say no.
Come on, show it!

628
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,500
How do I look?

629
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,125
Super.

630
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,541
It's very good.

631
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:02,500
That's true.
What do you feel like looking at me?

632
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:06,250
It's the same feeling as
when you look at delicious food.

633
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,416
What does it feel like? Tell me.

634
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,791
Let it be. The one who had
to understand has understood

635
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,000
What do you mean?

636
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:15,666
Hmm. Anyway…

637
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:20,333
For sure, my husband would
feel the same as you do.

638
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:05,458
'Despite all the bickering,
brother was sure'

639
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,041
'that Rukmini
had feelings for him.'

640
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,833
One night, Rukmini
finally accepted that.

641
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,083
I had called you today.
Why didn't you come?

642
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:29,333
Why should I?

643
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,000
Because I chose my groom.

644
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:40,750
What do you desire?

645
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:43,458
You come up with strange demands
every other day.

646
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:46,583
If I refuse, you say 'Who else could
fulfil them, if not you?'

647
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,125
After I fulfil them,

648
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,541
you say,
'It was for my would-be husband.'

649
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,625
If you don't value me... Go away!

650
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,125
Do people speak the truth
after drinking this?

651
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,916
No, it brings out all cuss words.

652
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:13,083
Hey!

653
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:20,166
You feel what I did,

654
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:22,750
was for my would be husband?

655
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:24,833
You said it.

656
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,833
You look smart, but you aren't.

657
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:34,541
I have liked you
since I was this small.

658
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,333
I didn't leave the big city

659
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:50,666
to see the new bridge or
the new school over here.

660
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:54,833
I came here for you.

661
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:20,708
Will you marry me, Krishna?

662
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,166
Everything was fine. Then
why couldn't they unite?

663
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,750
Yes, tell us.

664
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:55,291
Sister-in-law's dad fixed her
wedding with someone else.

665
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:56,541
Oh!

666
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:00,833
There is a star in the fourth
house. There are no flaws.

667
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:04,875
Sir! All the values of the
bride and the groom match.

668
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,000
God has made this pair himself.
- Yes.

669
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:07,875
Yes.

670
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:13,125
Das, the boss' third son who had
returned from Dubai got in the way.

671
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,791
Das will like her.
- A lot!

672
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:18,416
Hmm.

673
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:20,958
She is lovely, right?
- She is beautiful.

674
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:22,458
Come.

675
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:24,000
Master.

676
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:27,625
I told you that when she
would believe in my love

677
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,500
I would make her meet you, right?

678
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,625
Hey, Rukmini. What is this?

679
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:57,833
This man saved your house and
trusted you more than his children.

680
00:49:57,916 --> 00:49:59,583
You are so ungrateful.

681
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,333
You are selfishly playing
with the honour of his family.

682
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,791
You are so shameless.

683
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:12,458
He helped orphans like you, but
you want to rob their happiness?

684
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,833
Hey. Let go of his hand.

685
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:22,291
Sir? Why are you quiet?

686
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,958
Tell him that she is going
to be your daughter-in-law.

687
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,625
Look. Nothing has changed.

688
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,541
If she is in love with Krishna,

689
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,708
then he is just like my son.

690
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,291
Just think that she will become
the daughter-in-law of this family.

691
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,708
Listen to me, Munshi.

692
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,250
Master, you have a big heart.

693
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,625
You can treat any beggar
on the street as your own.

694
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,166
But I make him my
son-in-law and pamper him.

695
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,125
Never!

696
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:59,625
Come home with me.
You'll get what you deserve.

697
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:00,625
Dad.
- Come fast.

698
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,166
Come on now.
- Dad. - Quiet!

699
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:03,583
Hey.

700
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:30,458
Hey.

701
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,750
After your mother died, I gave
you the love of both parents.

702
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:37,875
Everyone in the village
told me to get married again.

703
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:40,291
But I didn't do it because I
didn't want to share my love.

704
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,916
Forget about having empathy, my
daughter doesn't even care about me.

705
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:48,000
I thought you wouldn't express
your feelings because I am a man.

706
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,458
So, I sent you to your grandmother.

707
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,291
With a heavy heart,

708
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,750
do you know why I am collecting
so much money with my hardwork?

709
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:57,125
It's because if I become rich,

710
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:58,833
you'll be able to
marry into a rich family.

711
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,416
And if I become super rich,
I can get you a billionaire.

712
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:06,041
But you choose to rot in his hut.

713
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,291
We don't even know
where he has come from.

714
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,166
Do you think you would leave
the house and would just watch?

715
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:16,208
You…

716
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:18,708
No.

717
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,000
Rukmini.

718
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:36,208
Wait, Rukmini.

719
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,708
If you step out of the
house, you will see me dead.

720
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:44,458
Even if you get some happiness with
Krishna by making your father sad,

721
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,458
you will remain sad forever.

722
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,833
This is a father's curse.
Stop, Rukmini.

723
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,125
Rukmini...

724
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:55,291
Dad.

725
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,750
Dad.

726
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,000
Dad.

727
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:02,541
Dad.

728
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:20,541
Dad.

729
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,958
Whatever happened,
it was bad, Rukmini.

730
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,958
But we can't stop living, right?

731
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:50,916
Krishna will bring you such joy
that you'll forget all your sorrows.

732
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:58,916
Everyone wants to live.

733
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:03,166
But my dad took his
own life because of me.

734
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,083
He said,

735
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:13,375
Even if I get some
happiness with Krishna,

736
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:17,250
I will remain sad
because I hurt my father.

737
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,000
Don't blame yourself, Rukmini.

738
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:22,916
Listen to me.

739
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,208
What do we do now?

740
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:29,875
It has been eight years,
but he is still waiting for her.

741
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:31,916
You were right.

742
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,833
This is called true love.

743
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:36,333
This is the bad
thing about true love.

744
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,333
It takes a gruesome test.

745
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:43,541
Whether it be hard work or cheating,
we will make them pass this test.

746
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,000
Come on.

747
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:49,791
Krishna is acting so smart
with all the master's power.

748
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,958
Krishna does not
have master's power.

749
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,166
Rather, the master is acting
smart with all the Krishna's power.

750
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:02,541
When I will clip off their wings,
both of them will die at my feet.

751
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,541
We don't even
have to lift a finger.

752
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:09,583
Master and Krishna are
going to welcome their deaths.

753
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:14,416
Do you know what happened
during the last year's festival?

754
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,250
Master's son Das is
returning from Dubai today.

755
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:22,000
Hey, smile!

756
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:30,916
It's a great smell.

757
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,208
Do you want it?

758
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:34,791
Give me one.

759
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,000
Okay, keep it.

760
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,583
Thank you.

761
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,750
Do you know Ramesh?

762
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:44,125
Yes, he is the coconut dealer.
I know him.

763
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:46,583
He is my friend.
- Right.

764
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:50,458
I have got these sunglasses
for him from Dubai.

765
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:52,041
Nice, aren't they?

766
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:53,125
They are awesome.

767
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,000
How are you, Das?

768
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:08,000
Come on. You look good.

769
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:11,125
You came to meet your childhood
friend directly from Dubai.

770
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:12,333
Sit down.

771
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:13,666
Hey…
- Yes, sir.

772
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:15,000
You guys leave.
- Okay, sir!

773
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:15,875
Leave!

774
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,708
I got a gift for you.

775
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,208
Did you get it for me?

776
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:24,500
They are amazing.

777
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:25,625
Thanks, man.

778
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:31,125
You didn't call or
write for all these years.

779
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:33,875
Did you meet someone in Dubai?

780
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,916
Your beard is turning grey.

781
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:38,916
Will you get married
when you get old?

782
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:42,625
Look at me.
I am a father of four kids.

783
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,708
I married Geeta from our school.

784
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,833
The same Geeta that you were after.

785
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:57,041
You have such a bad luck.

786
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,916
You fell for Geeta,
but I married her.

787
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,291
Your wedding was fixed with Rukmini,
but Krishna got in the middle.

788
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:12,375
You choose the girl, but your
friends get married to them.

789
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:16,875
You do the hard work
but we get the benefits.

790
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,708
I think there's a
fault in your destiny.

791
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:26,250
You should do something about it.

792
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,833
I ruined his destiny.

793
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,416
What? Did you stop laughing?

794
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,625
Do it. Smile!

795
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,541
I killed someone in Dubai
the same way.

796
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:16,208
They jailed me for nine years.

797
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:20,833
That's why I couldn't write or call.

798
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:23,791
Do you want to smoke?

799
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,000
It doesn't suit you.

800
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,833
Geeta is mine now.

801
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,916
Spray this on your wife. Your
wife won't be able to resist you.

802
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:11,583
Well, do you know Krishna?

803
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:13,333
Yes, I do.

804
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,208
Hmm!

805
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,333
He is also my old friend.

806
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:20,375
What is it?

807
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:21,583
We have reached home.

808
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,333
I'm seeing you after years.

809
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:30,041
Come!

810
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,875
Bless me, dad!
- Bless you.

811
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:38,291
Bless you.

812
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,083
Did you have a comfortable journey?

813
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,541
Come.

814
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:59,250
I heard they didn't get married?

815
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,750
I mean Krishna

816
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:07,708
and Rukmini.

817
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,708
If it didn't happen in nine years,

818
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:14,416
will it happen now?

819
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:18,458
Why don't you ask her to marry me?

820
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:21,458
She's somebody else's,
she'll never be yours.

821
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:23,583
How?

822
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:25,125
Is his name written on her?

823
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:29,708
Name is a small thing.
They're breathing for each other.

824
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:32,750
Despite not being married,
she belongs to Krishna.

825
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:49,000
Mom!
- Say.

826
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,041
Have it. It's hot.
- Thank you.

827
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,750
Pass me the kitchen knife.
- Huh?

828
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,750
What will you do with it?
- Give it here, mom.

829
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:00,083
Oh!

830
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,250
Here!

831
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:19,000
Hey! What are you doing? Come here!

832
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:21,000
Come!

833
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:25,416
Move!

834
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:28,041
Are you crazy?
- Come to your senses.

835
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:30,625
Why did you come out with it?
Do you want to kill your dad?

836
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:33,708
Yes, I will. Is his son Krishna?
Am I not nobody?

837
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,833
Hey, he is our dad.

838
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:37,625
You call him dad?

839
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,750
Did he ever think about us?

840
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,375
Listen to me.

841
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:42,833
Listen.

842
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:44,916
Dad won't give up his principles.

843
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,083
But you can marry her, right?

844
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,833
She is not married yet.

845
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:50,791
Marry her.

846
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,083
With love or force her.

847
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:54,750
Hmm!

848
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:31,416
Huh?

849
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:33,541
Who the heck are you?

850
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:38,625
Recognise? I'm Das.

851
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:43,291
I want to be your slave from today.

852
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:46,208
If you don't leave right now,
I will kill you.

853
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,750
It's because of this.

854
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,916
It's because of this
that you spotted me.

855
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,958
Let's come to the point.

856
01:02:57,708 --> 01:03:00,666
Let me do the work
for which I am here.

857
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:05,000
I wanted to see the show from here.

858
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:09,041
I love you.

859
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,125
Leave!

860
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:09,583
Hey!

861
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:25,500
Move!

862
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:50,625
You!

863
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:05,583
Don't mess with him.

864
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:06,625
He's master's youngest son, Das.

865
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:08,750
Whoever he is, I won't spare him.

866
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,041
Stop!

867
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,166
Hey!

868
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,083
Hey!

869
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:14,083
Hey!

870
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:15,333
Where are you going?

871
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:26,875
Hey!

872
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,291
Hey, what happened?

873
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,333
Das, why are you running?

874
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:00,416
Hey!

875
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,333
Move!

876
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:32,500
No!

877
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:57,250
Arjun!

878
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:00,625
Move!

879
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,250
Hey!

880
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:10,916
Uncle Krishna!

881
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:24,833
Kill him.

882
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:56,916
"My goodness gracious"

883
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:59,250
Hey!
- Hey!

884
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:13,625
"My goodness gracious"

885
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,333
Hey!
- No.

886
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,708
Arjun! Stop it.
- I won't spare him.

887
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:40,625
I won't spare him.
- Move!

888
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:43,833
He is our master's son. Leave him.
Do you know what he did?

889
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:44,958
What did he do?

890
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:56,833
Nothing. Let's go.

891
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:59,250
Change, or I won't spare you.
- Let's go.

892
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,250
Hey!

893
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,041
Hey! Das.
- Stop!

894
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,000
Hey!

895
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:10,750
No, Krishna, stop it.
- What are you doing?

896
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:13,500
Stop it.
- Das, stay away from him.

897
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:15,250
I'm telling you to calm down.

898
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:17,416
Huh!

899
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:20,083
Whether my dad or
my brother stops me,

900
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,125
but I will kill you
by the next festival.

901
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,625
Or else I am not my dad's son.

902
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:56,250
Hey!

903
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:58,833
Despite attacking my brother,

904
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:03,250
you are standing here alive,
it's because you are Master's son.

905
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:06,041
Or else,
forget about next year's festival,

906
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:08,458
I would kill you right now.

907
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:24,541
The ruckus Das created last year,
he's starting it again.

908
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:28,291
Holi's bonfire gets extinguished
in a couple of hours,

909
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:31,458
but the fire of revenge
is still there in Das.

910
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:34,250
Had he not been Master's son,
Krishna would have killed him.

911
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,875
That's what.
- They are rich people.

912
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:38,208
Money has a lot of power.
They can do anything. - Yes.

913
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:45,625
What's wrong with him?
- Yes.

914
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:48,541
Mother-in-law, talk to him.

915
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,833
How is your Krishna doing?

916
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,833
I told you not to
come to the village.

917
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:57,333
Why did you come?

918
01:10:58,083 --> 01:11:02,083
I have come to give him the most
dangerous gift in the world.

919
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,041
Huh!

920
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,500
Why is the little
one's face fallen?

921
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:30,458
Look at him, brother.

922
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:33,083
I have been asking him to buy
her clothes for the festival.

923
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:34,541
But he wouldn't respond.

924
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:37,166
I think I'll celebrate the festival
in old clothes.

925
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,208
What, man?

926
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:43,375
Simmi!

927
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,208
Let's go shopping. Come.

928
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:46,625
Don't go.

929
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:50,416
You'll make Simmi happy but this
cunning girl will scold me later.

930
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,583
Once it's done, I'll take her.

931
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:54,833
Hey!

932
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:57,666
Show this simple face to somebody
else, not to your brother.

933
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:02,333
Kid, after shopping,
we'll have ice cream.

934
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,041
Brother, I...

935
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:52,208
Hey! What are you doing?
- Arjun.

936
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,208
Come here.

937
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:54,125
No, Arjun.

938
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,083
Das has sent a gift
for you and Krishna.

939
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,083
An inauspicious
gift on a festival day?

940
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,625
Wipe off your tears.

941
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:03,916
Is he saying he will kill us?

942
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,166
Hey!

943
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,250
Why did you send
biers to Krishna's house?

944
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,083
Have you lost your mind?

945
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:15,833
You didn't say anything
when he beat up Das.

946
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:17,958
Did you forget what he did?

947
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:20,416
His actions deserved to get beaten.

948
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:21,750
You again took his sides.

949
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,750
You take the side of outsiders.

950
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,125
If someone touches

951
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:28,291
a sheep's kid, the sheep
will attack with her horns.

952
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:30,458
Krishna saves sheep
like you from Wolves.

953
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:35,833
That's why not wolves,

954
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:39,291
rather prisoners released
from jail will him.

955
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,541
They don't kill their prey easily,

956
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,333
they give a torturing death.

957
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:53,041
Even the god of
death is scared of them.

958
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,083
I have called these people

959
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:04,250
to kill those two.

960
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,041
Greetings, sir.
- Yes.

961
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:21,708
Arjun and Krishna.

962
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,291
Hold on, I will be back.

963
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:27,208
Hmm.

964
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:51,375
Krishna is protecting Arjun.

965
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:53,541
We can't touch him.

966
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:57,333
Touching Krishna
means inviting death.

967
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:03,625
Krishna is a living weapon.

968
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:07,625
It's impossible to kill him.

969
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:13,041
If you want to live, then forget it.

970
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:14,916
We are going.

971
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,458
There's only one huge predator.

972
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:24,833
My Krishna!

973
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,333
Damn!

974
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,750
Listen, Subbu.
- Yes, Krishna.

975
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,458
A festival is all
about eating a lot.

976
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:41,166
Drink a lot and have lots of fun.

977
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,000
Hey! Man!
- Won't you have fun?

978
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:45,416
Krishna! Das sent biers home.
- What?

979
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,833
If you say, I can...

980
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:50,583
Das has sent two biers.

981
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:52,875
Why are you worrying for no reason?

982
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,041
Let's open the bottle.

983
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:56,500
Drink it and feel intoxicated.

984
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,000
Cheers!

985
01:15:58,166 --> 01:15:59,625
Arjun.
- Yes.

986
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:02,541
Can I ask a question?
- You can ask two.

987
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:07,583
How would Krishna and Rukmini know
about everything about each other?

988
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:12,500
There's a postman who passes
messages from here to there.

989
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:14,875
Who is it?
- It's me! Hey! Get up.

990
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:16,625
Are you crazy? Get down.

991
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:19,291
Why are you beating?
- Please remove it. It's no kidding.

992
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:21,458
Hey! Should I tell you separately?
- I am having fun.

993
01:16:21,541 --> 01:16:23,916
Go and burn this. Come on. Now go.

994
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:31,750
Arjun, I have another question.
- Yes, ask.

995
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:33,833
How is Rukmini able
to live alone for eight years?

996
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,125
She keeps herself busy.

997
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,958
Otherwise, an empty house haunts
her. She worships every morning.

998
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,708
She cooks something
new in the afternoon.

999
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:43,541
And every night...

1000
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:50,666
She comes and sits with me.

1001
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,125
Mangala sent this for you.

1002
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,416
Tell me the new
story of your brother.

1003
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:04,916
Only yesterday, he beat 20 guys
to pulp.

1004
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:07,708
When will he start
doing something decent?

1005
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:10,041
He always keeps on fighting.
- Why should he do something decent?

1006
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,541
He will do what he's good at.

1007
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:16,416
How can you praise him
after drinking my drink?

1008
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,541
If you want to praise him,
keep the glass down.

1009
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,125
Were the injuries too bad?

1010
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:33,625
Why are you nodding?
Answer what I am asking.

1011
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,333
He can't speak without drinking.

1012
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,125
No injuries to my brother.

1013
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,791
The one who got
beaten got hospitalised.

1014
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,166
I was asking about them.

1015
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:46,541
Who is this boy?

1016
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,250
He's Bhaskar.
One of my new friends.

1017
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:50,708
He is in love with
the village leader's daughter.

1018
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,083
Yesterday's fight
was about this guy.

1019
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:53,833
Master has left him
with us for safety.

1020
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,083
It means, if someone
comes to hit him,

1021
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:57,625
your brother is going
to save him like a hero?

1022
01:17:57,708 --> 01:17:58,750
What do you mean by hero?

1023
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:00,958
My brother is a born hero.

1024
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:03,583
I saw your hero

1025
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:04,833
the other day.

1026
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:08,458
Has his hair gone a bit grey?
Did you notice it?

1027
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,666
I told him to colour them.
But he doesn't listen.

1028
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,708
Hey! He looks better this way.

1029
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:16,208
Keep it.

1030
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:22,916
When you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

1031
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,708
Grumpy old man.

1032
01:18:43,458 --> 01:18:47,125
Let's go. Every evening, there's a
gathering to learn about my brother.

1033
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:49,750
If I praise him, she scolds me.
If I say nothing, she sulks.

1034
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,416
What about Krishna?

1035
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:55,208
Come, I'll show you.

1036
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,166
Look there.

1037
01:18:58,916 --> 01:19:00,541
Our hero is standing in tension.

1038
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:08,333
After hearing his steps,
the heroine will come out.

1039
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:14,291
He will send a whiff of smoke
in her direction.

1040
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:21,666
Watch the heroine's
hair wave in the open.

1041
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:31,541
So much drama for just a glimpse?

1042
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,416
A glimpse is not enough.

1043
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,500
That's why she grooms pigeons.
- Grooms, pigeons?

1044
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,083
She comes out to feed the pigeons.

1045
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:38,875
They keep on seeing each other.

1046
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,750
Krishna watches her
to his heart's content.

1047
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:45,416
The grains will finish soon.
What will she do then?

1048
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:50,291
After this, just like she gives me
two pegs, she will water the plants.

1049
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:00,666
Now, she will unlock the gate
and re-lock.

1050
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,833
That's all.

1051
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,916
As I do my thing, drink and leave,

1052
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:23,625
they continue their flirting.

1053
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:28,000
They are so close
yet so far from each other.

1054
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:30,666
They pretend to be happy.

1055
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:33,625
But they go through hell within.

1056
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,250
Come. Let's go.

1057
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:15,041
Why did you come in?
- I felt like just looking at you.

1058
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,250
I was out for so long.

1059
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:20,333
Not enough?

1060
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:22,041
How can it be enough?

1061
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:25,041
My heart is here, and I am
on the other side of the wall.

1062
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,000
Hmm!

1063
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,041
Enough with your sweet talk.

1064
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:29,500
Hey, listen!

1065
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,916
Oh, wow! Is that the same curry?

1066
01:21:58,541 --> 01:21:59,666
Hey, Rukmini!

1067
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:02,416
Wear some clothes just like
in the movies, just once.

1068
01:22:05,541 --> 01:22:06,750
Enough of you now!

1069
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:11,541
Wait right there!

1070
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,541
You!

1071
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:32,500
Are you not going to change ever?

1072
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:35,333
The tree
before your house has changed.

1073
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,583
This village has changed.

1074
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,750
Even my brother Arjun has changed
after becoming a father.

1075
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:41,916
Give it a thought.

1076
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,000
Maybe your dad would be born
as our kid.

1077
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,791
If I smell like cigarettes, should
I have a cardamom and come?

1078
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:02,750
Hmm?

1079
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:04,583
You…

1080
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:06,250
I am going to kill you!
Stop right there!

1081
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:45,833
Sunita...

1082
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:48,208
Sunita, look at me, please!

1083
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Oh, my! If this happens just
by looking at you,

1084
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:54,833
what will happen if I touch you?

1085
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:56,666
Should we get married today only?

1086
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:01,458
Looking at brother, it doesn't seem
that he has a daughter.

1087
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:05,000
He is so lucky
to have such a beautiful daughter.

1088
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,541
Tell us, brother!

1089
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:09,458
When are you sending your daughter
to our house as my daughter-in-law?

1090
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:12,541
Since she was born, I never
thought of her as a daughter.

1091
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:15,000
I always thought of her
as your daughter-in-law.

1092
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,833
Dad...

1093
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,333
Bhaskar and I...

1094
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:31,958
If you even take his name, it won't
matter that you're my daughter.

1095
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:36,541
I can't let you play with my dignity
for your happiness.

1096
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:38,875
I will kill you
before it comes to that.

1097
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:41,125
What's the point
in strangling her now?

1098
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:42,666
Try this on Bhaskar, with whom

1099
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:45,041
your daughter roams around
in the village.

1100
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:48,458
Remember Krishna?
Master's illegitimate son,

1101
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,625
he's the one supporting Bhaskar.

1102
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:54,416
Hey! Krishna is more important
than your father!

1103
01:24:55,041 --> 01:24:57,041
Tomorrow is the chariot festival.

1104
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,041
The chariot will start
from our village as per tradition.

1105
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:05,958
Until those villagers give up their
insistence on supporting Bhaskar,

1106
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:10,833
I will not let any
of their chariots pass from here.

1107
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:13,750
They will have to face my wrath now.

1108
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:17,625
Greetings, sir!

1109
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,041
For the last 400 years,
the chariot has passed

1110
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:25,791
from Mr Veerabhadra's village.

1111
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:28,416
Twenty-five years ago
when it stopped,

1112
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,125
entire village was
swept away by floods.

1113
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,625
I request
that we do not repeat that mistake.

1114
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:33,875
Yes, sir!

1115
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:37,708
This is like two bulls fighting
and crushing a calf by the side.

1116
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:40,250
As this Bhaskar is in love,

1117
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:42,708
should the whole village
pay the price?

1118
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,500
It's not his fault.

1119
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:46,125
It's the person protecting him.

1120
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,250
This village is like a family to me.

1121
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:55,958
If injustice is done to them
or Master is humiliated,

1122
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:58,125
then Krishna will
never tolerate this.

1123
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:02,416
Krishna makes you all a promise.

1124
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:05,916
If they try to block our chariots
from going through...

1125
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:07,333
I swear by Master!

1126
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:09,708
No one will be spared.

1127
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:11,125
There will be a river of blood!

1128
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:14,750
Why should we get into a fight?

1129
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:17,458
Collector sir is here only.
Let's talk to him.

1130
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:20,083
Let us settle this peacefully.

1131
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,416
Hmm.

1132
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,750
Hey!
- Hey!

1133
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:34,541
Hey! Quiet!

1134
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:42,125
Tell me, Mr Parshuram,
what is your opinion?

1135
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:44,291
Collector sir,
who is he to give an opinion?

1136
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:47,708
He is the one protecting that guy!
- Hey!

1137
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:51,583
If you blabber about Master,
I will cut off your tongue.

1138
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:55,125
It's in everyone's best interest
that the chariots are not stopped.

1139
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:57,750
What if we don't allow them? Huh?

1140
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:59,041
Hey! You…
- Krishna!

1141
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:02,458
The villagers still
remember the devastation

1142
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,083
when the procession
was stopped 25 years ago.

1143
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:09,416
But the whole world will remember
the devastation I will cause now.

1144
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
Don't mess with Krishna!

1145
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:15,458
Collector sir, Bhaskar is
well-educated and a good boy.

1146
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:17,333
He will give all the happiness
to their daughter.

1147
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:20,416
Hey! If you find him so good,
make him your son-in-law!

1148
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:24,333
Hey, I'll hack you down
if you say anything against Master.

1149
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,333
Hey! I dare you to try and do that.

1150
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:29,208
As if we won't do anything!
Come on!

1151
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:30,208
Hey!

1152
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:31,416
Hey, stop it!

1153
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,500
Hey, Inspector!

1154
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:34,625
This is our personal matter.

1155
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,708
You have nothing to do here.
Get going.

1156
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:38,083
What is this!
What the heck is this!

1157
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:41,041
If you wanted to fight only,
why did you come to me?

1158
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:43,083
Mr Veerabhadra, you tell me.

1159
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:45,041
What are your conditions
for allowing the procession through?

1160
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:48,541
Collector sir, there's a
tradition in both villages.

1161
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:53,541
Whoever supports a culprit
is a bigger culprit than him.

1162
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:00,125
He'll be forgiven only when he falls
at the feet of the president

1163
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,125
in front of the whole village.

1164
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:05,458
Touch my feet,
and no one will stop the chariot.

1165
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:11,250
Collector sir,

1166
01:28:12,041 --> 01:28:13,750
I understand their intention.

1167
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:18,750
I'm ready to even bow
for the village.

1168
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,041
Master, I can never let this happen.

1169
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:27,958
Every village knows
that you're Master's shadow.

1170
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:29,708
You can come instead and do it.

1171
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:31,125
Hey!

1172
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:37,958
Come on! Come forward.

1173
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,708
Come on!

1174
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:43,875
Yay!

1175
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:06,750
Brother!

1176
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:13,041
Brother, the job is done.

1177
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:14,666
He won't be able
to tolerate it at all.

1178
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:21,625
So? Uncle, your daughter
has run away with that, Bhaskar.

1179
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:26,250
If your daughter herself has left,
we can't blame them now.

1180
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:42,458
What's wrong?
Did you get a shock, huh?

1181
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:45,541
Now, even if you fall at our feet,
she won't come back.

1182
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:47,750
What sort of president are you?

1183
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:51,625
This could have been resolved
between us, but you involved God!

1184
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:53,083
Mr Collector!

1185
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,250
The chariot procession will
start tomorrow morning,

1186
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,125
and that too through his village.

1187
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,750
If anyone tries to stop it,
I'll crush him under the chariot.

1188
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:04,458
Don't mess with me!

1189
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:08,541
I almost forgot...

1190
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:11,250
Happy Sankranti to you all.

1191
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:17,125
Hey, shut up!

1192
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,125
Let's have some fun now.

1193
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:22,041
Rukmini!

1194
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:40,375
Beautiful girls like you
should not roam alone like this

1195
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:43,041
in dark streets at night.

1196
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:19,458
I know how to teach a lesson
to guys like you.

1197
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:20,666
Blow the horn now!

1198
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:24,250
Should we stop going out
because of people like you?

1199
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:27,458
Come on now!

1200
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:32,541
Let me deal with Krishna first,
and then I will take care of you.

1201
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:35,166
I don't want any hassles for now.

1202
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,333
Come on!

1203
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:50,958
She is so cute!

1204
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:25,583
Huh?

1205
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:28,041
Hey, Bhaskar, this shirt would
look better on me, right?

1206
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:29,375
This is my wedding.

1207
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:30,458
Yeah, right.

1208
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:34,416
It looks very plain on you.

1209
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:36,333
And you are also quite
plain looking.

1210
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:41,791
Dad! I want a white frock.

1211
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:43,541
Excuse me!
Please, take out that white frock.

1212
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:45,000
This one, sir?
- No, not that. The next!

1213
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:46,666
This one?
- Yeah, that one.

1214
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:49,916
Pack this, too. He will pay.

1215
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:55,833
There's only one show for today.

1216
01:33:55,916 --> 01:33:58,625
Come and watch Superstar
Chiranjeevi's super hit film.

1217
01:33:58,708 --> 01:33:59,791
Hey, Bhaskar!
Let's watch the movie.

1218
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:01,625
No! I have to buy
clothes for Sunita.

1219
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:03,541
We can shop later.
Let's go for the movie.

1220
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:04,833
Here, sir!

1221
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:21,875
Come on, move!

1222
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:24,250
Arjun!

1223
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:27,666
Arjun!

1224
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,166
It's fun, isn't it?

1225
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,625
Here comes our hero!

1226
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:35,250
Hey, move!

1227
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:38,125
Sister, can you get me two tickets?

1228
01:34:38,416 --> 01:34:40,500
Make your wife stand in a queue
and get them.

1229
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:42,291
My wife is pregnant.

1230
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,875
She is the one
who always stands in the queue.

1231
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:45,416
Idiot! That's my daughter-in-law.

1232
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,708
Oh, boy!

1233
01:34:46,791 --> 01:34:48,125
You're going to get a beating.
Get going.

1234
01:34:48,208 --> 01:34:50,666
Aunt, I will buy you samosas.
Can you get me two tickets?

1235
01:34:50,916 --> 01:34:51,791
Okay, dear.

1236
01:34:56,833 --> 01:34:58,458
Here are your tickets, dear.

1237
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,166
Hey, Bhaskar, come on!

1238
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,708
Great trick!

1239
01:35:08,666 --> 01:35:09,916
Come here. These are our seats.

1240
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,625
He who puts his feet
on the seat is a donkey.

1241
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:20,708
There's the movie.

1242
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:24,208
Oh, yeah!

1243
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:26,916
It's the last one. Let me smoke it,
and then I'll watch the movie.

1244
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:41,750
'Whoever messes
with me gets messed up!'

1245
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:44,583
'Remember the name! Ranjit Kumar.'

1246
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,375
Come on.

1247
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:07,000
Hey! Who is it?

1248
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:08,875
Show yourself if you have the guts.

1249
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:18,125
Hey!

1250
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,000
Bhaskar, run!

1251
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:29,125
I said run!

1252
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:46,500
Call Krishna!

1253
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:05,541
Hey!

1254
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:07,625
Hey, stop! Stop!

1255
01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:10,541
Hey, stop!

1256
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:12,750
Hey!

1257
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:43,166
How was that?

1258
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:40,291
Wow!

1259
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,833
What did you say?

1260
01:38:46,041 --> 01:38:46,833
Huh?

1261
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:51,125
No one can kill Arjun
while Krishna is alive?

1262
01:38:53,916 --> 01:38:56,333
But we are hacking Arjun here.

1263
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:58,458
Where is your brother Krishna?

1264
01:38:58,916 --> 01:38:59,750
Krishna!

1265
01:38:59,916 --> 01:39:01,500
Hey, Krishna!

1266
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:12,000
Do you remember that day
of your childhood, huh?

1267
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,041
'Hey, Arjun, save him!'

1268
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:32,125
'Das, get up!'

1269
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:33,541
'Get up, Das!'

1270
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:48,416
I cannot sin killing
the person who saved my life.

1271
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:50,791
You are spared. Go!

1272
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:52,833
You can go now.

1273
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:00,041
I was kidding!

1274
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:01,625
What happened?

1275
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:05,166
Did you think
that I would spare your life?

1276
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:08,458
You must have thought
I would spare your life.

1277
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:15,375
When you kill someone after
giving him hope… the high it gives…

1278
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:28,875
Huh?

1279
01:40:29,416 --> 01:40:30,250
Mangla?

1280
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,375
Hey! No, no!

1281
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:35,125
She is your wife!

1282
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:37,916
Hmm… Okay.

1283
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,500
I'll look after her if you want.

1284
01:40:42,625 --> 01:40:43,583
Mangla!

1285
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,625
Hey, my queen!

1286
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:48,416
Hey, Das!

1287
01:40:50,083 --> 01:40:51,125
Hey, Das!

1288
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:54,125
Das, stop! Stop...

1289
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,291
Arjun…

1290
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:29,500
Hey, move! Move!

1291
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:30,791
Arjun!

1292
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:32,791
Arjun! - Krishna...
- Who did this?

1293
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:35,250
Arjun! My brother...

1294
01:41:37,375 --> 01:41:39,208
Arjun, talk to me.

1295
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:41,416
Hey, Arjun!

1296
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:43,416
Hey, bring the car!

1297
01:41:43,708 --> 01:41:44,500
Arjun...

1298
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:47,333
Hey, get the car, man!

1299
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,958
Arjun! Arjun!

1300
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,708
Arjun, you'll be all right.

1301
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,166
Hey, be careful!

1302
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:57,375
Careful!

1303
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:07,125
Brother, go fast.

1304
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,541
Krishna, my brother!

1305
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,083
Simmi was insisting.

1306
01:42:14,166 --> 01:42:15,625
She wanted a frock.

1307
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:19,833
Now, she will see her father
in a white shroud.

1308
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:26,708
Rukmini has no one
except you, Krishna.

1309
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:32,541
She did not marry you
to fulfil her father's last wish.

1310
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:37,625
Tell her that my dying wish was
that she should marry you.

1311
01:42:38,166 --> 01:42:40,041
That might melt her heart.

1312
01:43:11,166 --> 01:43:11,958
Arjun...

1313
01:43:16,916 --> 01:43:17,750
Arjun!

1314
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:20,041
Arjun!

1315
01:43:23,125 --> 01:43:23,958
Arjun!

1316
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,833
What is that?

1317
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:44,208
Has Arjun sent this through you?

1318
01:43:52,166 --> 01:43:53,375
Wow, a frock!

1319
01:43:53,458 --> 01:43:55,125
Hey! Wear this
before your dad comes.

1320
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:56,041
Okay!

1321
01:43:59,041 --> 01:44:00,041
What is this, brother?

1322
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:02,416
He still isn't home
even on the festival day.

1323
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:08,041
Dad! I will open my eyes
when you come.

1324
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:10,958
Hey, Beera! Surya!

1325
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:13,416
They have killed our Arjun, man!

1326
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:15,458
They have killed our Arjun!

1327
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:17,875
See how brutally
Arjun has been killed.

1328
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:19,041
Arjun!

1329
01:44:21,833 --> 01:44:24,375
What happened?
What happened to my Arjun?

1330
01:44:24,583 --> 01:44:26,125
Bhaskar, what happened to him?

1331
01:44:26,208 --> 01:44:28,458
Arjun, get up!

1332
01:44:28,666 --> 01:44:31,708
Open your eyes!
You can't leave me like this.

1333
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:33,125
No... Get up, Arjun!

1334
01:44:33,333 --> 01:44:35,041
Tell him to open his eyes.

1335
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:37,833
Bhaskar! Talk to him...

1336
01:44:45,125 --> 01:44:46,708
What happened, brother?

1337
01:44:48,083 --> 01:44:49,750
I want Arjun back!

1338
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:51,958
I want my Arjun back!

1339
01:44:54,833 --> 01:44:57,208
Why couldn't you save Arjun?
Tell me!

1340
01:45:04,916 --> 01:45:09,916
How could someone kill him
when you were with him, brother?

1341
01:45:20,875 --> 01:45:22,041
Stop kidding.

1342
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:25,625
Get up, Arjun! Get up now!

1343
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:34,083
Uncle, what happened to dad?

1344
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,166
Why isn't he getting up?

1345
01:45:37,333 --> 01:45:38,458
Dad!

1346
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:41,416
Look at Simmi. Get up for Simmi.

1347
01:45:58,458 --> 01:46:00,833
Dad… what happened to you, dad?

1348
01:46:09,208 --> 01:46:10,541
Dad!

1349
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:23,166
Dad, please get up.

1350
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:25,416
Hey... our Arjun…

1351
01:46:51,958 --> 01:46:53,791
It was Arjun's dying wish, dad.

1352
01:46:58,666 --> 01:47:00,125
Before he died,

1353
01:47:01,416 --> 01:47:05,541
more than about his wife and kid,
he thought about me, dad.

1354
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,708
How can someone be so selfless?

1355
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:25,500
Krishna must be dying inside, dad.

1356
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,041
If I don't take care of him,
then who will?

1357
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:37,375
I am going, dad.

1358
01:47:39,833 --> 01:47:40,833
Please forgive me.

1359
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:19,333
Not one man who was involved
in Arjun's killing should live.

1360
01:48:22,708 --> 01:48:25,000
But you... don't die.

1361
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:33,791
Come back to me alive!

1362
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:58,333
Why should we run away fearing him?
- Hey!

1363
01:48:58,625 --> 01:49:02,708
Despite knowing Krishna's wrath,
you all killed his brother.

1364
01:49:03,166 --> 01:49:06,500
The only reason you're still
alive is because you're my son.

1365
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:09,208
But even I can't save you now.

1366
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:12,958
You have killed the brother of the
man who has been protecting me

1367
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:16,458
for so many years
despite having no relation with me.

1368
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,958
Run away from here

1369
01:49:19,041 --> 01:49:21,916
before you all get consumed
in the fire of his revenge.

1370
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,375
How can he kill us just like that?
- No one can defeat him!

1371
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:26,166
He is Krishna!

1372
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:32,708
He will kill you all!

1373
01:49:39,625 --> 01:49:40,750
Run away from here.

1374
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,625
Run away!

1375
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:57,333
Krishna, they're not allowing
our chariots through their village.

1376
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:34,833
I was wondering why no one came

1377
01:50:35,041 --> 01:50:37,458
to file a case against
Arjun's murder.

1378
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:40,625
Why register a case
when the killer is not alive?

1379
01:50:41,791 --> 01:50:43,541
Das died? When?

1380
01:50:45,125 --> 01:50:46,833
So, Krishna killed Das?

1381
01:50:54,375 --> 01:50:57,708
I want that no case should
be filed against Krishna.

1382
01:50:58,375 --> 01:51:01,916
You will have to pay a heavy price
to hush up the murder case.

1383
01:51:19,958 --> 01:51:21,333
Hey, enough... That's it!

1384
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:25,416
So much money is not necessary
for a single murder.

1385
01:51:25,916 --> 01:51:27,333
Who said it would be just one?

1386
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:46,125
If you were a real man,
you would've come alone to fight me.

1387
01:51:46,291 --> 01:51:48,666
But you have come
with the entire village.

1388
01:51:57,083 --> 01:52:01,041
Every year,
our villagers sacrifice goats.

1389
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,458
You will be
that goat this year, Krishna.

1390
01:52:08,833 --> 01:52:09,666
Attack!

1391
01:52:51,416 --> 01:52:53,875
You may not have seen
that many firecrackers at festivals

1392
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:56,166
as you will find
chopped heads there.

1393
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,500
"Goodness gracious"

1394
01:53:21,208 --> 01:53:22,791
"My goodness gracious"

1395
01:53:39,708 --> 01:53:41,041
Krishna!

1396
01:53:44,958 --> 01:53:46,125
Hey... Hey!

1397
01:53:55,208 --> 01:53:56,875
Hey, stop!

1398
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,750
Krishna!

1399
01:54:07,083 --> 01:54:09,333
Hey, Krishna!

1400
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,833
Hey!

1401
01:56:20,958 --> 01:56:21,916
Krishna!

1402
01:56:34,041 --> 01:56:35,000
No!

1403
01:57:01,875 --> 01:57:02,958
Finished!

1404
01:57:04,916 --> 01:57:07,333
What sort of a lion are you
that you couldn't stop

1405
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,750
your brother from being hunted?

1406
01:57:10,625 --> 01:57:12,666
And you couldn't escape
being hunted yourself.

1407
01:57:25,333 --> 01:57:28,833
'Not one man who was involved
in Arjun's killing should live.'

1408
01:57:31,083 --> 01:57:33,416
'I will wait for you.'

1409
01:57:34,041 --> 01:57:35,458
Come back to me alive!

1410
01:57:35,541 --> 01:57:39,125
"Abode of the destroyer"

1411
01:57:40,166 --> 01:57:42,916
"Abode of the destroyer"

1412
01:57:44,875 --> 01:57:48,208
"Abode of the destroyer"

1413
01:57:50,041 --> 01:57:53,833
"Abode of the destroyer"

1414
01:57:54,916 --> 01:57:59,041
"Abode of the destroyer"

1415
01:57:59,833 --> 01:58:03,458
"Abode of the destroyer"

1416
01:58:04,541 --> 01:58:08,583
"Abode of the destroyer"

1417
01:58:13,541 --> 01:58:18,291
"Lord Shiva comes for protection"

1418
01:58:20,625 --> 01:58:23,875
"This is his ferocious war"

1419
01:58:28,166 --> 01:58:32,416
"This is his protection from evil"

1420
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:38,958
"Annihilating the monsters"

1421
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:45,916
The Krishna
whom you raised like a son

1422
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,541
is the one
who is killing your son now.

1423
01:58:50,208 --> 01:58:52,416
Master, you raised a snake
offering it milk.

1424
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:53,916
He will kill everyone!

1425
01:58:57,375 --> 01:59:00,458
"He is in ferocious form"

1426
01:59:02,208 --> 01:59:05,958
"Against all the evil"

1427
01:59:07,541 --> 01:59:10,916
"This is the end of all demons"

1428
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:15,583
"Protection for the humankind"

1429
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:24,416
Arjun saved your life in childhood.

1430
01:59:24,958 --> 01:59:26,250
So how can I kill you?

1431
01:59:27,708 --> 01:59:29,416
You are spared. Go.

1432
02:00:06,875 --> 02:00:07,708
So?

1433
02:00:08,416 --> 02:00:10,916
You thought I would spare your life.

1434
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:16,416
When you kill someone after
giving him hope… the high it gives…

1435
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:18,083
Hey!

1436
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:20,958
Don't mess with me!

1437
02:01:04,958 --> 02:01:05,791
I killed them.

1438
02:01:14,333 --> 02:01:16,250
You killed all my sons.

1439
02:01:17,208 --> 02:01:19,333
He killed my brother, master.

1440
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,916
My sons were no scapegoats!

1441
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:57,208
Hey! Master has killed Krishna.

1442
02:01:57,291 --> 02:01:59,416
Master has killed Krishna.
- Krishna!

1443
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:01,666
Krishna!
- Hey! No...

1444
02:02:02,916 --> 02:02:04,875
If you come even one step closer,
I will kill you.

1445
02:02:05,291 --> 02:02:06,625
Come on, get back!

1446
02:02:06,958 --> 02:02:07,750
Get back!

1447
02:02:24,083 --> 02:02:26,041
Master, nothing...

1448
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:27,583
Nothing will happen to you.

1449
02:02:27,916 --> 02:02:29,416
Get inside! Please.

1450
02:02:29,583 --> 02:02:30,583
Please go inside!

1451
02:02:30,833 --> 02:02:31,666
Don't you dare...

1452
02:03:16,833 --> 02:03:17,625
Krishna!

1453
02:03:19,083 --> 02:03:20,500
Krishna!

1454
02:03:24,875 --> 02:03:25,666
Krishna!

1455
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:34,500
Hey, don't cry.
Nothing happened to me.

1456
02:03:36,541 --> 02:03:37,875
After ten years,

1457
02:03:38,708 --> 02:03:40,375
you have asked me for something.

1458
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,333
Not to die.

1459
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:46,125
Now I won't die even after being
stabbed 100 times like this.

1460
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:53,750
Rukmini...

1461
02:03:55,625 --> 02:03:56,916
Will you marry me?

1462
02:04:31,208 --> 02:04:32,250
Hey, Arjun!

1463
02:04:33,583 --> 02:04:35,375
Dad!
