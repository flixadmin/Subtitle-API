1
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,962
Your grace, if you'd
like to sit, I'm sure that...

2
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,256
We've been here since midday.

3
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,477
Davos:
Easterners have a different sense of time.

4
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,564
Once I was waiting for salladhor saan
here in braavos.

5
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,193
Together, we were going to run
three shiploads of the finest...

6
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,433
Welcome to the iron bank.

7
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,561
Please, sit.

8
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,626
What can we do for you, lord Stannis?

9
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,212
This is Stannis of the house Baratheon,

10
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,423
king of the andals and the first men,

11
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,176
lord of the seven kingdoms
and protector of the realm.

12
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,350
The iron throne is currently occupied
by tommen of the house Baratheon,

13
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,227
king of the andals and the first men,

14
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,980
lord of the seven kingdoms
and protector of the realm.

15
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,691
He shares no blood with me.

16
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,361
He is a bastard born of incest.

17
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,281
- As was his brother before him.
- Yes.

18
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,783
We have heard this story.

19
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,535
It's not a story. It's the truth.

20
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,539
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

21
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,291
A story about a jealous uncle

22
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,960
whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

23
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,837
cost the seven kingdoms dearly

24
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,548
in blood and gold.

25
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,342
Gold you loaned him.

26
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,471
And you feel your blood gives you
a claim on our gold?

27
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,182
More than any man living.

28
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:12,479
Across the narrow sea, your books are
filled with words like "usurper"

29
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,899
and "madman" and "blood right."

30
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,110
Here, our books are filled with numbers.

31
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,696
We prefer the stories they tell.

32
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,657
More plain.

33
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,993
Less open to interpretation.

34
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,207
How many fighting men remain loyal to you?

35
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,500
4,000.

36
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,418
And how many ships do you have?

37
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,504
- Davos: Uh...
- The ones still afloat, ser davos,

38
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,923
not at the bottom of Blackwater bay.

39
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,678
- Thirty-two.
- And how much wheat and barley

40
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,639
and beef and pork
do you produce on dragonstone

41
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,477
to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?

42
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,689
None.

43
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,902
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending

44
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,279
from our perspective.

45
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,618
I'm afraid
we must respectfully decline your request.

46
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,289
But we thank you for
paying us the honour of your visit.

47
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,760
- Davos: My lord.
- I'm not a lord, ser davos seaworth.

48
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,512
You would not be either here.

49
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,931
In braavos,

50
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,642
thieves are not rewarded with titles.

51
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,352
I didn't do the thieving.

52
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,062
That would be the pirates.

53
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,316
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

54
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,195
This is the payment that was demanded
by king Stannis for my crimes.

55
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,656
I consider it an honest accounting.

56
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,200
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

57
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,164
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

58
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,372
Which is a lot. Wars are expensive.

59
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,084
- The war is over.
- As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.

60
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,921
Who's the real power in king's landing?

61
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,672
- Ser davos...
- Humour me.

62
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,176
- Tywin Lannister.
- How old is tywin Lannister?

63
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,343
Sixty-seven.

64
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,347
And when he dies, who's in command?

65
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,765
A half-grown boy,

66
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,600
the product of incest?

67
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,728
Cersei Lannister,
a queen whose people despise her?

68
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,812
Jaime Lannister,

69
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,816
a man best known for killing the king
he was sworn to protect?

70
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,487
When tywin's gone, who do you back?

71
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,114
That is a problem for another time.

72
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,618
I think it's a problem for now.

73
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,454
There's only one reliable leader left
in Westeros.

74
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,539
Stannis.

75
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,166
He's got the birthright.

76
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,168
He's in his prime.

77
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,295
He's a tried and tested battle commander.

78
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,590
And he doesn't just talk about
paying people back, he does it.

79
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,931
Salladhor: The lookout sees a pirate ship
sailing their way.

80
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,016
The captain shouts to his first mate,

81
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,935
"bring me my red shirt."

82
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,813
The first mate brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

83
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,564
And when the pirates try to board,

84
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,650
the brave captain leads his men to victory.

85
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,570
A few days later, the lookout screams,

86
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,489
"two pirate ships!"

87
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,493
The crew is shivering like scared mice.

88
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,370
But the courageous captain hollers,

89
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,205
"bring me my red shirt!"

90
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,374
After the battle, the first mate asks,

91
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:23,169
"captain, why do you call for
your red shirt before battle?"

92
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,879
The captain replies,

93
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,633
"so that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

94
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,428
The next morning the lookout screams,

95
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,265
"ten pirate ships! We are surrounded!"

96
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,143
The crew goes silent.

97
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,687
They all look to their brave captain,

98
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,772
waiting for his usual command.

99
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,774
Calm as ever, the captain bellows...

100
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,193
Whores: "Bring me my brown pants!"

101
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,533
Davos: You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them thatjoke?

102
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,661
Davos.

103
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,289
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon
in dragonstone.

104
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,666
Only half rotted.

105
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,337
Join us, my friend.

106
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,340
This is lhara.

107
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,925
- And this is...
- I am lhara.

108
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,723
She's an artist, this one, truly.

109
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,018
No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.

110
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,688
You, me. We.

111
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,110
Once I thought this man loved me.

112
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,406
Now I know he despises me.

113
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,744
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold...

114
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,590
You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.

115
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,142
There's a chest of the good stuff
left back at your house.

116
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,061
I gave it to your wife.

117
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,733
You're not my friend, my friend.

118
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,195
I'll see you at sunrise.

119
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:21,121
Yara: "I give you until the full moon
to order all ironborn scum out of the north

120
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,707
"and back to those shit-stained rocks
you call home.

121
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,960
"On the first night of the full moon,

122
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,796
"I will hunt down
every islander still on our lands

123
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,673
"and flay them living,

124
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,885
"the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum
I found at winterfell.

125
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,098
"In the box you'll find a special gift.

126
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,143
"Theon's favourite toy.

127
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,229
"He cried when I took it away from him.

128
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:52,652
"Leave the north now
or more boxes will follow with more theon."

129
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,321
Signed, "ramsay snow,

130
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,575
"natural born son of roose Bolton,

131
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,118
"lord of the dreadfort

132
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,954
"and warden of the north."

133
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,081
Myran da: Yes!

134
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,625
Yara: They skinned our countrymen

135
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,086
and they mutilated my brother,

136
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,422
yourpnnce.

137
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,674
Your prince!

138
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,387
Everything they've done to him,
they've also done to you.

139
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,014
Myran da: Yes!

140
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,893
Yara: As long as they can hurt our prince
with impunity,

141
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,897
the word "ironborn" means nothing.

142
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,714
Go left.

143
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,725
- Theon greyjoy.
- I don't know...

144
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,645
I'm here for theon greyjoy.
Take me to the dungeons.

145
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,647
He's not in the dungeons.

146
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,756
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

147
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,803
Man: This way!

148
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,151
We're going home.

149
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,029
Theon: No!

150
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,078
It's all right. It's me, yara.

151
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,289
You can't trick me.

152
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,374
Tell him you couldn't trick me.

153
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,418
I'm not tricking you,
theon. I'm saving you.

154
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,919
Not theon! Reek!

155
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,587
- My name is reek!
- Man: They're here.

156
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,111
- If they catch us in here, we're trapped.
- Help me with him.

157
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,093
No, you can't!

158
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,553
You're theon greyjoy.

159
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,724
No, I don't believe her! I know who I am!

160
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,810
I'm reek! Loyal reek!

161
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,730
Good reek! I've always been reek!

162
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,243
This is turning into a lovely evening.

163
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,429
Theon: I'm reek! Loyal reek!

164
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,357
Theon!

165
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,830
Give me my brother
and no more of your men will die.

166
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,416
You've got bigger balls than he ever did.

167
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,756
But with those big balls of yours,

168
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,222
How fast can you run?

169
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,319
Yara: Make for the ship, now.
Man: But your brother?

170
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,863
My brother is dead.

171
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,416
Ramsay: I have a treat for you.

172
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,167
A reward.

173
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,795
Reward?

174
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,172
Yes, reek.

175
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,134
Those creatures who came in the night,

176
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,719
they wanted to take you away.

177
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,680
And you didn't let them.

178
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,141
You remained loyal.

179
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,271
I didn't want them to take me.

180
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,457
I was so scared.
I didn't want them...

181
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,567
Yes, reek.

182
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,535
It's a bath.

183
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,996
Foryou.

184
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,334
Remove those rags.

185
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,672
Now.

186
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,567
The britches, too, reek. Take them off.

187
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,489
Do you love me, reek?

188
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,039
Yes, of course, my lord.

189
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,501
Good.

190
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,922
Because I need you to do something for me.
Something very important.

191
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,259
There's a castle.

192
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,178
Some bad men hold this castle.

193
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,308
I need your help to take this castle back.

194
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,605
But how can...

195
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,192
I need you to play a role.

196
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,238
To pretend to be someone you're not.

197
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,202
Pretend to be who?

198
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,581
Theon greyjoy.

199
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,278
You stand before Daenerys stormborn
of the house Targaryen,

200
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,780
the first of her name,

201
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,988
the unburnt,

202
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,616
queen of meereen,

203
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,077
queen of the andals and the first men,

204
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,454
khaleesi of the great grass sea,

205
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,999
breaker of chains and mother of dragons.

206
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,961
Don't be afraid, my friend.

207
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,298
The queen says you may approach and speak.

208
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,147
He is a goatherd.

209
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,525
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

210
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,069
I thank him for his prayers.

211
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,795
It was your dragons, he says.

212
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,090
They came this morning for his flock.

213
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,806
He hopes he has not offended your grace,
but now he has nothing.

214
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,435
Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.

215
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,105
I cannot bring back his goats...

216
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,860
But I will see he is paid their value
three times over.

217
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,337
Send the next one in.

218
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:49,475
The noble hizdahr zo loraq begs
an audience with the queen.

219
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:57,608
The noble hizdahr zo loraq can
speak to me himself.

220
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,997
Queen Daenerys.

221
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,042
Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.

222
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,293
I thank you.

223
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,505
Mine is one of the oldest
and proudest families in meereen.

224
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,132
Then it is my honour to receive you.

225
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,216
My father,

226
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,804
one of meereen's most respected
and beloved citizens,

227
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,391
oversaw the restoration and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

228
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,017
This pyramid included.

229
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,855
For that, he has my gratitude.
I should be honoured to meet him.

230
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,565
You have, your grace.

231
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,024
You crucified him.

232
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,531
I pray you'll never live to see
a member of your family treated so cruelly.

233
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,951
Your father crucified innocent children.

234
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,705
My father spoke out
against crucifying those children.

235
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,624
He decried it as a criminal act,
but was overruled.

236
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,961
Is itjustice to answer
one crime with another?

237
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,547
I am sorry you no longer have a father,

238
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,217
but my treatment of the
masters was no crime.

239
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,803
You'd be wise to remember that.

240
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,181
What's done is done.

241
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:14,059
You are the queen
and I am a servant of meereen.

242
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,646
A servant who does not wish to see
its traditions eradicated.

243
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:22,443
- And what traditions do you speak of?
- Of funeral rite.

244
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,945
Proper burial in the temple of the graces.

245
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:31,744
My father and 162 noble meereenese
are still nailed to those posts,

246
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,247
carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.

247
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,134
Your grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

248
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,428
so that they might receive proper burials.

249
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,599
And what of the slave children
these noble meereenese crucified?

250
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,268
They were rotting in the sun as well.

251
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,605
Would you have begged me
for their right to a proper burial?

252
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,608
Your grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

253
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,320
I can only speak to you
as a son who loved his father.

254
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,864
Let me take his body down.

255
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,450
Let me have him brought to the temple

256
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,371
and buried with dignity so that he
might find peace in the next world.

257
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,586
Bury your father, hizdahr zo loraq.

258
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,551
Thank you, my queen.

259
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,481
How many more?

260
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,734
There are 212 supplicants waiting,
your grace.

261
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,737
212?

262
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,622
Send the next one in.

263
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,210
These meetings aren't
always going to be this early, are they?

264
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,255
I was up late last night.

265
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,259
So, does this mean
I am a master of something now?

266
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,177
Coins, ships?

267
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,680
Lord tywin and I already determined that

268
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,933
I shall be the master of ships
long before you...

269
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:27,192
Lord tywin, it's a great honour to have
been granted a seat on this council. I...

270
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,278
Tywin: The trial begins this afternoon.

271
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,530
We only have the
morning for affairs of state.

272
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,240
So, shall we begin?

273
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,786
Varys: Sandor clegane has been spotted
in the riverlands, my lord.

274
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,288
A coward and a traitor.

275
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,292
My birds tell me
the hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.

276
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,295
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

277
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,921
Disgraceful.

278
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,049
Tywin: What would it take to
make the common soldier

279
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,092
stupid enough to try
his luck with the hound?

280
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,803
Varys: Ten silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

281
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,723
Make it 100. What else?

282
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,225
More whispers from the east, my lord.

283
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,351
The Targaryen girl?

284
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,938
Daenerys has taken up residence in meereen.

285
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,400
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

286
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,735
Conquered with what?

287
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,904
Varys: She commands an army of unsullied,
my queen.

288
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,114
Some 8,000 strong.

289
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,076
She has a company of sellswords,
the second sons.

290
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,245
She has two knights advising her,

291
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,540
jorah mormont and barristan selmy.

292
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,501
And she has three dragons.

293
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,919
Baby dragons.

294
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,338
Larger every year, your grace.

295
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,591
Mormont is spying on her for us.

296
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,803
No longer.
He appears to be fully devoted to her.

297
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,387
As for ser barristan,

298
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:43,185
it would seem he took his dismissal from the
kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.

299
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,937
He's an old man.

300
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,939
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

301
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,691
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

302
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,611
Dismissing him was
as insulting as it was stupid.

303
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,073
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

304
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,451
A child with
two seasoned warriors counselling her

305
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,121
and a powerful army
at her back, your grace.

306
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,289
Lord varys is right.

307
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,626
I have been to essos
and seen the unsullied firsthand.

308
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,546
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

309
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,381
Less so in the bedroom.

310
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,134
Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.

311
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,761
Armies win them all the time.

312
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,055
She must be dealt with.

313
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,517
How, my lord? By force?

314
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,519
Eventually, if it comes to that.

315
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,732
Can your little birds
find their way into meereen?

316
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,734
Most certainly, my lord hand.

317
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,531
Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
Fetch my quill and paper.

318
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,512
Prince oberyn.

319
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,931
Lord varys.

320
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,185
Only varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.

321
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,729
No one is under obligation to call me lord.

322
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,439
And yet everyone does.

323
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,569
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the unsullied.

324
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,529
Did you spend much time in essos?

325
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,489
Five years.

326
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,950
May I ask why?

327
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,495
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

328
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:29,249
Most of us live and die in the same corner
where we were born

329
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,127
and never get to see any of it.

330
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,796
I don't want to be most of us.

331
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,632
Most of us aren't princes.

332
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,511
You are from essos.

333
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,431
Where? Lys?

334
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,392
I have an ear for accents.

335
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,269
I've lost my accent entirely.

336
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,687
I have an ear for that as well.

337
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,064
Hmm.

338
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,942
How did you get here?

339
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,485
It's a long story.

340
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,529
One you don't like telling people.

341
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,282
People I trust.

342
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,327
My paramour ellaria,
she would find you very interesting.

343
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,663
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

344
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,958
We brought our own wine,
not the swill they serve here.

345
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,002
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

346
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,966
You did like boys before?

347
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,095
Really?

348
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,513
Girls? Hmm.

349
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,742
I hope you won't be offended when I say
I never would have guessed.

350
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,268
Not at all.

351
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,187
But I was never
interested in girls, either.

352
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,815
- What then?
- Nothing.

353
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,359
Everybody is interested in something.

354
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,986
Not me.

355
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:43,323
When I see what desire does to people,
what it's done to this country,

356
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,076
I am very glad to have no part in it.

357
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,706
Besides, the absence of desire

358
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,792
leaves one free to pursue other things.

359
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,419
Such as?

360
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,582
Let me guess, I've been pardoned.

361
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,892
Really?

362
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,853
Father's orders.

363
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,523
Well, we mustn't disappoint father.

364
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,911
Man: Kingslayer!

365
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,460
I, tommen of the house Baratheon,

366
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,920
first of my name,

367
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,589
king of the andals and the first men,

368
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,758
and lord of the seven kingdoms,

369
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:10,679
do hereby recuse myself from this trial.

370
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:15,308
Tywin of the house Lannister,
hand of the king, protector of the realm,

371
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,019
will sit as judge in my stead.

372
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,107
And with him prince oberyn
of the house martell

373
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,985
and lord mace of the house Tyrell.

374
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,195
And if found guilty,

375
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,116
may the gods punish the accused.

376
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,738
Tyrion of the house Lannister,

377
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,742
you stand accused by
the queen regent of regicide.

378
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,870
Did you kill king Joffrey?

379
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,000
Did your wife, the lady sansa?

380
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,586
Not that I know of.

381
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,839
How would you say he died, then?

382
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,883
Choked on his pigeon pie.

383
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,428
So you would blame the bakers?

384
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,014
Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.

385
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,020
The crown may call its first witness.

386
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,731
Meryn: Once we'd got king Joffrey
safely away from the mob,

387
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,358
the imp rounded on him.

388
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,527
He slapped the king across the face

389
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,363
and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.

390
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,741
It wasn't the first time
the imp threatened Joffrey.

391
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,785
Right here in this throne room,

392
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,746
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

393
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,625
Compared his grace to the mad king
and suggested he'd meet the same fate.

394
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,961
And when I spoke in the king's defence,

395
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,629
he threatened to have me killed.

396
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,257
Oh, why don't you tell them
what Joffrey was doing?

397
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,818
- Tywin: Silence.
- Pointing a loaded crossbow at sansa stark

398
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,562
while you tore at her clothes and beat her.

399
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,638
Silence!

400
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,976
You will not speak unless called upon.

401
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,646
You're dismissed, ser meryn.

402
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,197
"Basilisk venom,

403
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,658
"widow's blood,

404
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,618
"wolfsbane,

405
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,413
"essence of nightshade,

406
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,707
"sweetsleep,

407
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,084
"tears of lys,

408
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,003
"demon's dance..."

409
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,090
"Blindeye..."

410
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,259
I think you have made your point,
grand maester.

411
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,094
You have a lot of poison in your store.

412
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,930
Had, prince oberyn.

413
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,932
My stores were plundered.

414
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,642
By whom?

415
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:07,731
By the accused, Tyrion Lannister,
after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.

416
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,108
Tywin: Grand maester,

417
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:14,070
you examined king Joffrey's corpse.

418
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,574
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

419
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,201
Without question.

420
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:27,751
This was found on the body
of dontos hollard, the king's fool.

421
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:33,590
He was last seen spiriting sansa stark,
the wife of the accused,

422
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,550
away from the feast.

423
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:41,181
She wore this necklace
the day of the wedding.

424
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,603
Residue of the most
rare and terrible poison

425
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,563
was found inside.

426
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,567
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

427
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,737
It was. The strangler.

428
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,491
A poison few in the seven kingdoms possess.

429
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,953
And used to strike
down the most noble child

430
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,915
the gods ever put on this good earth.

431
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,966
Cersei: "I will hurt you for this.

432
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,928
"A day will come when
you think you are safe and happy

433
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,597
"and yourjoy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

434
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,683
"and you will know the debt is paid."

435
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,103
Your own brother said this to you?

436
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,691
Shortly before the
battle of Blackwater bay.

437
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:36,820
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

438
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:43,368
As it turned out, when the attack came, joff
insisted on remaining at the battlements.

439
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:47,122
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

440
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,875
Tyrion said,

441
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,086
"and you will know the debt is paid."

442
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,255
What debt?

443
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,968
I discovered he'd been keeping whores
in the tower of the hand.

444
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,762
I asked him to confine his salacious acts

445
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,306
to the brothel where
such behaviour belongs.

446
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,142
He wasn't pleased.

447
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,232
Thank you, your grace,
for the courage of your testimony.

448
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,418
Mace: Do you remember
the precise nature of this threat?

449
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,462
Varys: I'm afraid I do, my lord.

450
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:39,007
He said, "perhaps you should speak
more softly to me, then.

451
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,925
"Monsters are dangerous

452
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,595
"and just now kings are dying like flies."

453
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,765
And he said this to you
at a meeting of the small council?

454
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,057
Varys: Yes.

455
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,269
After we received word
of robb stark's death.

456
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,855
He didn't seem gladdened by the news.

457
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,024
Perhaps his marriage to sansa stark

458
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,401
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

459
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,991
You're excused, lord varys.

460
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,829
Father, may I ask the witness one question?

461
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,545
One.

462
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,926
You once said

463
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,554
that without me,
this city would have faced certain defeat.

464
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,266
You said the histories
would never mention me,

465
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,019
but you would not forget.

466
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,689
Have you forgotten, lord varys?

467
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,153
Sadly, my lord,

468
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,239
I never forget a thing.

469
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,584
We will adjourn for now.

470
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,463
Toll the bells in an hour's time.

471
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,549
Guard: Clear the court!

472
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,113
Jaime: You'd condemn
your own son to death?

473
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,323
I've condemned no
one. The trial is not over.

474
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,867
This isn't a trial. It's a farce.

475
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,202
Cersei has manipulated everything
and you know it.

476
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,662
I know nothing of the sort.

477
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,123
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

478
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,208
As did I.

479
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,627
Do you know the last order
the mad king gave me?

480
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,589
To bring him your head.

481
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,133
I saved your life
so you could murder my brother?

482
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,677
- It won't be murder. It'll bejustice.
- Justice?

483
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,139
I'm performing my sworn duty
as hand of the king.

484
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,766
If Tyrion is found guilty,
he will be punished accordingly.

485
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,686
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished accordingly.

486
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,442
Once you said, "family is what lives on.

487
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,818
"All that lives on."

488
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,864
You told me about
a dynasty that would last 1,000 years.

489
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,700
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

490
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,705
I'm a kingsguard, forbidden by
oath to carry on the family line.

491
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,123
I'm well aware.

492
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,208
What happens to your name?

493
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,879
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

494
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,797
Your nephews?

495
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,591
Lancel Lannister?

496
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,718
Others whose names I don't even remember?

497
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:32,764
What happens to my dynasty if I
spare the life of my grandson's killer?

498
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,224
It survives through me.

499
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,104
I'll leave the kingsguard.

500
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,191
I'll take my place as your son and heir

501
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,443
if you let Tyrion live.

502
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,819
Done.

503
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,908
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

504
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,826
Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.

505
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,664
He'll plead for mercy.
I'll allow him to join the night's watch.

506
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,293
In three days' time,
he'll depart for castle black

507
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,087
and live out his days at the wall.

508
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,881
You'll remove your white cloak immediately.

509
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,591
You will leave king's landing

510
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,052
to assume your rightful place
at casterly rock.

511
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,888
You will marry a suitable woman

512
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,808
and father children named Lannister.

513
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,561
And you'll never turn your back
on your family again.

514
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,110
You have my word.

515
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,861
And you have mine.

516
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,263
Not going well, is it?

517
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,573
You're going to be found guilty.

518
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,558
- Oh, you think so?
- And when you are,

519
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,936
you need to enter a formal plea for mercy
and ask to be sent to the wall.

520
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,814
Father's agreed to it.

521
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,608
He'll spare your life
and allow you to join the night's watch.

522
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:12,030
Ned stark was promised the same thing
and we both know how that turned out.

523
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,157
Jaime: Father is not Joffrey.
He'll keep his word.

524
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,867
How do you know?

525
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,497
Do you trust me?

526
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,670
Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.

527
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,213
This will all be over soon.

528
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,107
The crown may call its next witness.

529
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,727
State your name.

530
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,438
Shae.

531
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,526
Do you swear by all the gods that
your testimony will be true and honest?

532
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,320
I swear it.

533
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,030
Do you know this man?

534
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,083
Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

535
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,835
How do you know him?

536
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,130
I was handmaiden to his wife lady sansa.

537
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,425
This man stands accused
of murdering king Joffrey.

538
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,553
What do you know of this?

539
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,765
I know that he's guilty.

540
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,311
He and sansa planned it together.

541
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,980
Tywin: Silence!

542
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,608
Continue.

543
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:16,362
Shae: She wanted revenge for her father,
her mother, her brother.

544
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,574
She blamed their deaths on the king.

545
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,118
Tyrion was happy to help.

546
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:26,080
He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.

547
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,665
He hated you, my lord.

548
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,003
He stole poison from
the grand maester's chamber

549
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,379
to put in Joffrey's wine.

550
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,299
Oberyn:
How could you possibly know all this?

551
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,094
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

552
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,223
I wasn't just her maid.

553
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,936
I was his whore.

554
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,522
Mace: I beg your pardon?

555
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,524
You said you were his...

556
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,193
His whore.

557
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,531
How did you come to be in his service?

558
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,033
He stole me.

559
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,203
I was with another man,
a knight in your lordship's army.

560
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:10,082
But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he
sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.

561
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,545
He broke the knight's arm
and brought me to lord Tyrion.

562
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:17,381
"You belong to me now," he said.

563
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:21,344
"I want you to fuck me like
it's my last night in this world."

564
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,515
Silence!

565
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,435
And did you?

566
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,896
Did I what?

567
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,690
Fuck him like
it was his last night in this world?

568
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,237
I did everything he wanted.

569
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,405
Whatever he told me to do to him.

570
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,324
Whatever he felt like doing to me.

571
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,911
I kissed him where he wanted.
I licked him where he wanted.

572
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,206
I let him put himself where he wanted.

573
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,999
I was his property.

574
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:56,379
I would wait in his chambers for hours
so he could use me when he was bored.

575
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,341
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

576
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,553
I took his face in my hands and said,

577
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,556
"I am yours and you are mine."

578
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,144
Shae.

579
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,775
Please don't.

580
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,196
I am a whore.

581
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,490
Remember?

582
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,036
That was before he married sansa.

583
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,039
After that, all he wanted was her.

584
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,500
But she wouldn't let him into her bed.

585
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:38,212
So he promised to
kill king Joffrey for her.

586
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,473
Father,

587
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,018
I wish to confess.

588
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,689
I wish to confess.

589
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,027
You wish to confess?

590
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,572
I saved you.

591
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,743
I saved this city

592
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,455
and all your worthless lives.

593
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,958
I should have let Stannis kill you all.

594
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,586
Tywin: Tyrion.

595
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,133
Do you wish to confess?

596
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,431
Yes, father.

597
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,516
I'm guilty.

598
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,603
Is that what you want to hear?

599
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,521
You admit you poisoned the king?

600
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,649
No, of that I'm innocent.

601
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:44,612
I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.

602
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,698
I am guilty of being a dwarf.

603
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,535
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.

604
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,871
Tyrion: Oh, yes, I am.

605
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,792
I've been on trial for that my entire life.

606
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,380
- Have you nothing to say in your defence?
- Tyrion: Nothing but this...

607
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,424
I did not do it.

608
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,135
I did not kill Joffrey,

609
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,721
but I wish that I had.

610
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,391
Watching your vicious bastard die

611
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:17,645
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

612
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:25,069
I wish I was the monster you think I am.

613
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,032
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

614
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:34,495
I would gladly give my life
to watch you all swallow it.

615
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,622
Ser meryn.

616
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,333
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

617
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:45,297
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

618
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,426
And I know I'll get nojustice here.

619
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,679
So I will let the gods decide my fate.

620
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:56,642
I demand a trial by combat.
