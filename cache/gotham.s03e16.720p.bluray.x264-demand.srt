Maybe you wanna tell me where the

FRANK: The Court is a secret society.

If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

Your father and I were both members.

This city is on the brink of chaos.

22
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,548
Seems like judgment came
to Gotham earlier than expected.

Members of the Ruling Council,
Gotham has fallen ill.

Violence and crime continue to spread
like an unstoppable disease.

Drastic action must be taken.

- To that end, a weapon is being built.

A weapon intended
to be unleashed on Gotham

so that the city may be cleansed
and rebuilt by us.

29
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:15,497
The Head of our Court asked that we reach
a unanimous vote to proceed.

30
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,701
Judgment has been passed.

31
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,239

I want to speak with whoever's in charge.

00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,542
That would be me.

36
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,629
Is The Court of Owls behind my abduction?

37
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,211
The Court is a tool. Nothing more.

He's in Gotham pretending
to be me, isn't he?

- You and your uncle?

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,580
(SIGHS) The drunk driver who hit
and killed my father when I was nine.

00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,545
- What have you got?
- Not much.

69
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,219
He was convicted
of vehicular manslaughter,

70
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,598
got six years, then got his ticket punched
in a prison stabbing a few months in.

- Silver lining.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,812
But I pulled his medical file
from Blackgate

73
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,393
and found something
that wasn't in the original case file.

74
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,934
He had chronic persistent hepatitis.

I was going to ask Lee what it was
when she got in.

Chronic persistent hepatitis

77
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,239
is a non-progressive form
of liver inflammation.

- How do you know that?
- You kidding?

It's known as "the Irish Curse".

80
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,409
With chronic inflammation,
you cannot drink.

81
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,370
Nothing, not a drop. Not even beer.

82
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,692
This guy didn't get the memo.

83
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,873
His blood alcohol was off the charts
the night of the accident.

84
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,677
You're not hearing me. If this guy
had chronic liver inflammation,

85
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,800
if he blew a .1 on a blood-alcohol test,

86
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,381
he'd be dead
before he got behind the wheel.

87
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,340
If that's true,
then someone dummied the report.

Can you do some digging,
find out who this guy was?

So'? Build an army. No one's stopping you.

115
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,804
And I can even help
if you weren't being such a jerk.

116
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,423
Jerk.

117
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,976

00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,436
He's a moron.

121
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,772
But he's a loyal moron.

122
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,285

with one single loyal soldier.

00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,336
Okay. Fine.

Thank you for meeting me.

127
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,281
Why here?

128
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,360
It's public, open,

00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,995
easy to spot if anyone's watching us.

130
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,075
The driver who hit my father's car
that night wasn't drunk.

131
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,208
I think he did it on purpose,
and someone made it look like an accident.

132
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,127
Easy enough for The Court.

133
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,091
So let's say I believe you.

134
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,045
What do you want from me?

135
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,389
I've just learned something
I'm still having trouble believing.

136
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,392
A weapon is en route, headed for Gotham.

137
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,229
A weapon The Court intends
to use to destroy the city.

138
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,564
What are you talking about?

139
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,730
You said The Court controls Gotham.
Why would they want to destroy it?

140
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,940
This isn't The Court as a whole.

141
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,909
It's limited to a number
of high-ranking members,

142
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,662
fanatics who believe
the city needs to be cleansed.

143
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,074
And you really think
they're capable of this?

144
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,617
They've done it before.

145
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,787
Twice in the city's history
they've laid waste to Gotham.

146
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,622
It's no bluff.

147
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,253
So how do we stop it?

148
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,668
I have no idea.

149
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,886
I don't even know what the weapon is.

150
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,097
But that's exactly
what I'm going to find out.

151
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,599
- I can help.
- No.

152
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,930
The Court knows I reached out to you,
but that's all.

153
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,472
We need to keep it that way
in case I'm discovered.

154
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,438
Be careful, Uncle Frank.

155
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,891
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.
- I saw you earlier.

156
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,802
Who's that man you were with?

157
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,639
My uncle Frank.

158
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,733
I thought you two were estranged.

159
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,769
We recently reconnected.

160
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,313

I've been coming here a lot.

162
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,072
The other day, I saw this little old man.

163
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,741
Must have been in his 90s, all dressed up,

164
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,704
standing in front
of his wife's grave, smiling.

165
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,500
I couldn't understand
what there was to smile about.

166
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,680
And then it occurred to me.

167
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,843
They shared a whole life together.

168
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,348
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,936
How do you do that?

170
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,491
How do you just move on, leaving
so much destruction in your wake?

171
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,408
I wish I could do that.

172

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

173
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,839
Yeah.

174
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,596
Hey. That driver that hit and killed your
father that night was a career scumbag.

175
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,881
What did you find out?

176
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,848
He did a stretch for grand theft auto
among other things, and get this.

177
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,636
The high-priced lawyer
who got him his plea

178
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,398
was paid for by none other
than Carmine Falcone.

- Oh, boss, I can't believe it.

182
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,535
You know that everyone thinks you're dead?

183
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,954
- Yes.
- And that Barbara is running things?

184
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,293
Gabe, this might go faster
if you just listened.

185
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,925
I need to build an army
to exact my revenge

186
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,587
and to take back my throne.
Will you help me?

187
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,117
- Of course, I will.
- (CHUCKLES)

188
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,428
When the guys hear that
you're still alive, they'll come running.

189
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,935
I'll make sure of it.
What do you want me to do?

190
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,972
That. I want you to do that, Gabe.

191
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,439
- Right. I got it. No problem.

you're not gonna believe...

194

- (SIGHS)
- There's something off about him.

195
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,699
No argument there.

196
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,950
I don't trust him.

197
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,948
Gabe?

198
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,906
He's a human Labrador.
You whistle, he comes running.

199
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,289
Trust me. He's loyal.

200
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,917
I have this perfume.

201
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,249
One whiff,
and a man will do anything I ask,

202
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,880
including telling the truth.

203
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,044
Look, now that Gabe is here,
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

204
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,797
I have an army to build, a war to plan,

205
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,637
and we really do not know
each other that well.

206
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,267
You understand.

207
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,721
No.

208
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,606
Maybe you can ask one of your plants.

209
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,900
I do not trust you.

210
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,151
I saved your life.

211
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,028
My men are on their way.

212
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,396
You trust him?

213
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,616
But I... I thought we were friends.

214
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,365
(LAUGHS) "Friends"?

215

(LAUGHS) "Friends"?

216
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,416
Oh, you're being serious.

217
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,161
Look, don't take this the wrong way,

218
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,122
but you are a bit of a freak.

219
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,012
- Did she tell you not to trust me?
- (SCOFFS) Yeah.

Why? (GRUNTS)

Smart girl.

(PANTING)

226

The temple is some sort of maze.
Is that it'?

227
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,754
Everything is a maze, Bruce.

228
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:40,218
The only difference is whether
we realize our place within it.

229
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,428
Given enough time, I will find a way out.

230
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,012
How much time?

231
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,438
How long have you been blindly running
down the corridors of your life

232
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,145
only to end up in the same place?

233
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,023
It's time to pick a direction.

234
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,984
You can speak in cryptic riddles
all you want.

235
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,773
I'm not scared of you.

236
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,780
But you are scared of something,
aren't you?

237
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,072
Sit.

238
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,330
Let me show you what I have to offer.

(DOOR SLAMS)

240
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,967
You have some nerve showing up here.

00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,755
- We need to talk, alone.
- No, we don't.

242
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,218
You took my son from me.

243
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,055
And you took my father away from me.

244
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,809
I'd say that makes us even.

245
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,018
- Your father was killed by a drunk driver.
- No, he wasn't.

246
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,148
The driver wasn't drunk.
He hit us on purpose.

247
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,686
But I think you know that
because you paid for his lawyer.

248
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,607
Still think we have nothing to talk about?

249
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,660
If you have a question for me, son,

250
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,453
why not go ahead and ask it.

251
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,785
Did you order the hit on my father?

252
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,332
No.

253
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,539
I respected your father.

254
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,175
Much more than the son he left behind.

255
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,711
But someone did. It was a hit?

256
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,097
Yes.

257
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,139
- The Court of Owls.
- Hmm.

258
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,975
What do you know about them?

259
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,061
I know my uncle is a member.

260
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,609
- Are you?
- No.

261
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,569
But we've built a partnership which has
been mutually beneficial over the years.

262

You mean you do their bidding.

Everyone does The Court's bidding.

Some of us just know it.

The person who came to you,

266
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,950
a member of The Court?

267
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,498
- Yes.
- Who was it?

Did you order the hit on my father?

Carmine called The Court after you left.

278
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,294
You shouldn't have gone there.
It will raise suspicions.

Is it true?

280
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,474
Yes.

00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,728
Why?

282
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,018
I already told you.

283
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,814
Your father was determined
to expose The Court and became a risk.

284
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,145
- Simple as that.
- And so you had him killed?

285
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,733
Your own brother?

286
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,485
You want to shoot me, Jim?

287
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,322
You'd be doing me a favor.
But it won't change anything.

288
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,236
The only thing we can do now

289
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,282
is finish what Peter started
and bring down The Court.

290
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,687
It's what he would have wanted.

291
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,786
What my father would have wanted
is for justice to be done.

292
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,541
So do I.
