they've had messages coming up
from London to the brass.

108
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,724
And on that list was your name
and my name together.

109
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,369
What kind of a list would
have the name of a communist

110

and the name of a bookmaker
side by side?

111
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,801
Perhaps it's a list of men
who give false hope to the poor.

112

The only difference between
you and me, Freddie,

Nearly blew Ada's tits off.

162
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,841
It must have fell out of me pocket.

163
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,042
He said he found it on the
sideboard of the betting shop.

164
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,286
With bullets in it.

165
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,121
I...

166
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,801
I must have been drunk.

167
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,726
When are you not drunk?

168
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,963
Look, Aunt Polly, I'm sorry.

169
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,529
(STAMMERS) I'm... I'm sorry.

170
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,849
We'll keep this between ourselves

171
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,491
if you swear not to leave guns
lying around.

172
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,203
Look, I know having four kids
without a woman is hard,

173
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,089
but my boot's harder.
Now come on, were late.

174
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
Right!

175
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,802
I've called this family meeting because
I've got some very important news.

176
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,724
Scudboat and Lovelock
got back from Belfast last night.

177
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,247
They were buying a stallion
to cover their mares.

178
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,521
They were in a pub on the
Shankhill Road yesterday,

179
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,604
and in that pub there was a copper.

180
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,244
Handing out these.

181
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,805
"If you're over five feet
and can fight, come to Birmingham."

182
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,650
They're recruiting Protestant Irishmen
to come over here as Special.

183
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,280
- To do what?
-To clean up the city, Ada.

184
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,206
He's the Chief Inspector.

185
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,927
The last four years, he's been
clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

186
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,850
How do you know so bloody much?

187
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,328
'Cause I asked the coppers
on our payroll.

188
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,041
And why didn't you tell me?

189
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,361
I'm telling you.

190
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,410
So why are they sending him
to Birmingham?

191
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,166
Well, there's been all these
bloody strikes at the BSA.

192
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,925
And the Austin works, lately.

193
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,729
Now the papers
are talking about sedition.

194
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,521
And revolution.

195
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,010
I reckon it's communists he's after.

196
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,528
So this copper's gonna
leave us alone, right?

197
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,569
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes
who left Belfast to get away from him.

198
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,044
They say Catholic men who crossed him
used to disappear in the night.

199
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,401
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.

200
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,770
We bloody fought for the King.

201
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,131
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.

202
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,800
We're not scared of coppers.

203
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,689
- He's right.
-If they come for us,

204
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,370
we'll cut them a smile each.

205
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,650
So, Arthur. Is that it?

206
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,325
ARTHUR:
What do you think, Aunt Poll?

207
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,650
This family does everything open.

208
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,243
You've nothing more to say
to this meeting, Thomas?

209
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,161
No.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,365
Nothing that's women's business.

211
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,642
This whole bloody enterprise
was women's business

212
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,370
while you boys were away at war.

213
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,361
What's changed?

214
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,641
We came back.

215
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,091
And the lord will smite the unholy

216
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,844
when the great judgement comes.

217
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,402
And judgement is coming, my friends.

218
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,923
Judgement is coming to this wicked city.

219
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,528
And your wickedness
and your fornication will be revealed.

220
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,566
You cannot hide from the Creator.

221
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,562
You cannot hide
from the Almighty himself.

222
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,724
The Creator sees all.

223
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,449
You cannot hide
from the true and living God.

224
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,409
Get off with ya!

225
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,721
Ahh!

226
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,206
Fuck off.

227
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,405
(CHILD SHOUTING)

228
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,763
That's it. I don't go any further.

229
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,761
(CHILDREN SHOUTING)

230
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,651
I have ten minutes.
What do you want?

231
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,845
An explanation.

232
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,007
Always been able to tell
when you're hiding something.

233
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,484
People round here talk.

234
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,049
Some of them work at the BSA.

235
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,328
I've been talking to the wives
of factory hands.

236
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,529
Detectives have been asking questions
in the proofing shops.

237
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,682
Nothing happens in that factory
without you knowing about it.

238
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,361
Speak.

239
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,563
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

240
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,564
It was meant to be routine.

241
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,171
I had a buyer in London
for some motorcycles.

242
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,722
I asked my men to steal me four bikes
with petrol engines.

243
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,089
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

244
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,884
<i>There's a still inside the factory
makes tramline gin.</i>

245
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,922
<i>They picked up the wrong fucking crate.</i>

246
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,324
<i>The bays dropped it
at Charlie Strong's yard, as agreed.</i>

247
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,370
<i>Must have taken it from the
proofing bay, instead of the export bay.</i>

248
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,201
Holy sweet baby of Mary.

249
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,251
Inside we found 25 Lewis machine guns,

250
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,889
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

251
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,090
50 semi-automatic rifles,
200 pistols with shells.

252
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,321
Jesus, Tommy.

253
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,881
All bound for Libya.

254
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,650
Sitting right there
in Charlie Strong's yard.

255
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,891
Tell me you threw them in the cut.

256
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,209
We put them in the stables
out of the rain.

257
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,407
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

258
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,523
So that's why they sent a cop
from Belfast?

259
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,291
Maybe, maybe not.

260
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,282
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,
a robber, a fighting man.

261
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,930
You're not a fool.

262
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,844
You sell those guns to anyone who has
use to them, you will hang.

263
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,921
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

264
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,805
Dump them somewhere
the police can find them.

265
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,007
Maybe if they know they haven't fallen
into the wrong hands,

266
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,809
this might blow over.

267
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,327
- Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.
-No.

268
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,447
He won't move contraband
under a full moon.

269
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,723
Three days until it wanes.

270
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,601
Then you'll do the right thing?

271
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,685
You have your mother's common sense.

272
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,721
But your father's devilment.

273
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,804
I see them fighting.

274
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,405
Let your mother win.

275
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,009
I got tickets for the penny crush.

276
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,850
They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

277
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,322
I'm not in the mood
for the pictures tonight, Ada.

278
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,290
Well, I'm not doing it here again.
I got covered in mud last time.

279
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,687
Let's just walk a bit.

280
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,487
If we go down as far as Greet,
we could go to a pub.

281
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,444
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

282
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,008
They have friends everywhere,
we'd have to walk to London.

283
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,204
I'm with you 'cause you're the
only man round here not scared of them.

284
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,370
Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

285
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,207
But you love me
more than you fear them, right?

286
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,002
I don't want to be
always sneaking about.

287
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,727
- Soon, we'll tell them.
-When?

288
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,691
How did the family meeting go?

289
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,121
Usual.

290
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,609
- There's a new copper coming.
-I heard.

291
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,927
Mmm.

292
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,048
And Tommy says
he's after the likes of you.

293
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,651
So maybe you should burn your books
and stop making speeches.

294
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,526
Oh, my Ada.

295
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,001
The only princess of the Royal Family
of the kingdom of Small Heath.

296
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,525
I'm just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

I'm here about the job as a barmaid.

00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,162
- Are you mad?
-Am I what?

301
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,768
- Do you know about this place?
-I saw it in an advertisement.

I'm doing you a favour.

I'm not asking for favours,
I'm asking for employment.

(GASPS)

329
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,564
In Ireland...

330
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,847
my singing made them cry
and stopped them fighting.

331
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,450
Well, I hope you know a lot of songs.

332
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,768
Babies discarded

333
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,082
with the fish bones and egg shells.

334
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,161
Girls,

335
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,410
11 years old,

336
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,764
pierced and punctured by old men

337
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,285
for thrupence a time.

338
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,088
Rutted upon like animals.

339
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,961
Degradation.

340
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,527
Fathers with their daughters,

341
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,365
brothers and sisters sharing beds.

342
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,691
Beggars and thieves
left to run in the streets.

343
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,523
And astride the whole stinking pile
of wounds and rotting flesh...

344
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,291
your masters!

345
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,326
The men who you touch your cap to.

346
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,449
The Peaky Blinders!

347
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,885
The vicious, merciless gangs

348
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,531
who blind those that see

349
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,001
and cut out the tongues
of those who talk.

350
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,082
You are worse than them!

351
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,160
Those of you who have taken their
bribes these years since the war.

352
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,724
Those of you who look the other way.

353
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,009
You are worse than them!

354
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,609
God damn you for soiling your uniforms!

355
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,285
And then...
there are the IRA Fenians.

356
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,005
And the communists.

357
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,724
Blacker hearts still.

358
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,929
They feed on the pus
of all this corruption.

359
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,767
Like maggots in a corpse.

360
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,326
And, like maggots, if left to swell
they will eventually swarm like flies

361
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,884
and spread their rotten philosophy
across the country and across the world!

362
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,250
Those then...

363
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,210
are our enemies.

364
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,808
A three-headed beast.

365
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,928
It is my job...

366
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,924
to decapitate each one,
and by God I will do it!

367
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,246
I don't trust any of youse

368
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,521
until you earn my trust.

369
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,490
And that takes some earning.

370
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,001
These are the new men
who will bolster your ranks.

371
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,611
Good men,

372
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,690
from God-fearing families.

373
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,725
By the time the sun sets...

374
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,121
they will be sworn in
and in uniform.

375
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,886
And by sunrise tomorrow
they will be on the streets.

376
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,601
God help those who stand in our way!

377
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,206
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

378
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,161
Right.

379
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,965
WOMAN:
Move out of the way for Mr Shelby.

380
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,565
- This way.
-Mr Shelby.

381
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,241
You see, ladies,
when you're out with a Blinder

382
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,526
you don't have to queue.

383
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,761
Right.

384
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,446
I want a blow job off both of you
before they let the ordinary people in.

385
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,849
Away you go.
Take your hat off.

386
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,360
What the fuck!

387
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,009
Who the fuck are you?

388
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,207
I'm Arthur fucking Shelby!

389
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,321
Arthur Shelby.

390
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,448
Lead pack dog

391
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,204
of the Peaky Blinders.

392
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,441
(GROANS)

393
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,325
Look at me.

394
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,201
(COUGHS)

395
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,281
Bastard!

396
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,811
Your uniform?

397
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,210
Terrifying, I'm sure.

398
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,409
- Did he have a gun?
-No gun.

399
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,122
Knife in his sock.
Cosh in his belt.

400
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,246
Now, Mr Shelby,

401
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,325
I want you to see this
as me introducing myself to you,

402
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,402
you understand.

403
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,927
In all the world,
the only thing that interests me

404
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,325
is the truth.

405
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,684
What do you know about the robbery?

406
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,086
What robbery?

407
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,601
(GROANS)

408
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,243
I will ask you again.

409
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,683
What do you know about the robbery?

410
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,287
I swear to God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

411
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,768
What fucking robbery?!

412
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
(GROANS LOUDLY)

413
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,648
After 35 years of dealing
with animals like you,

414
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,723
I can tell just by sniffing the air

415
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,643
whether or not you're lying.

416
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,721
I'm not fucking lying, all right?

417
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,689
I'm not fucking lying!

418
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,521
I know.

419
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,568
I see nothing of interest
behind the blood in your eyes.

420
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,009
And no blood in your veins
that could carry...

421
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,607
even a trace of cunning or guile.

422
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,649
But understand this.

423
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,887
It is well within my power

424
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,451
to have you
and the rest of your scum family

425
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,889
face down in the canal
before the year is out.

426
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,924
On the other hand...

427
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,529
we can help each other.

428
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,684
Is it always this busy in the day time?

429
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,286
Nah, these boys
are on their way to St Andrews.

430
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,687
- To pray?
-(LAUGHS) That'll be the day!

431
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,525
St Andrews is a football ground.
The Blues are playing.

432
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,005
That's the forward line there,

433
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,929
and that's the goalie,
believe it or not.

434
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,761
Hello!

435
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,290
I need a bottle of rum.

436
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,568
Grace, whatever it is,
it's on the house.

437
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,320
- A whole bottle?
-Yeah.

438
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,170
- White or dark rum?
-Don't care.

439
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,288
HARRY: Right, lads, what' ll it be? Two?

440
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,485
Thank you.

441
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,807
Harry said it's on the house.

442
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,361
Are you a whore?

443
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,608
'Cause if you're not,
you're in the wrong place.

444
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,690
He's one of them you warned me about.

445
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,889
Look, Grace, you're a friendly girl,
but be careful.

446
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,680
If l say something's on the house,

447
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,444
then say nothing
to whoever you're serving.

448
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,763
If they decide that they want you,

449
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,320
then there's nothing
anybody could do about it.

450
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,961
Lucky for you,
since he got back from France

451
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,844
Tommy doesn't want anybody at all.

452
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,201
Yes, lads?

453
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,881
(GROANS)

454
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,001
john, wipe the blood out of his eye.

455
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,767
- Since when did you give orders?
-I'm a trained nurse.

456
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,849
(SCOFFS) Don't make me laugh.

457
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,809
- It hurts me face.
-I bloody am.

458
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,686
You went to one first aid class
in the church hall

459
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,091
and got thrown out for giggling.

460
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,561
Not before I learned
how to stop somebody from choking.

461
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,244
I'm not bloody choking, am I?

462
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,800
You will be when [wrap this cloth
round your neck.

463
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,406
Let me see him.

464
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,401
All right, have this.

465
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,721
Give me that.

466
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,725
(INHALES SHARPLY)

467
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,609
TOMMY: You're all right.

468
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,447
He said Mr Churchill sent him
to Birmingham.

469
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,891
National interest, he said.

470
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,444
Something about a robbery.

471
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,044
He said he wants us to help him.

472
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,121
We don't help coppers.

473
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,967
He knew all about our war records.

474
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,170
He said we're patriots.

475
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,086
Like him.

476
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,083
Wants us to be his eyes and ears.

477
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,564
I said...

478
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,290
(GROANS)

479
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,809
I said we'd have a family meeting,
take a vote.

480
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,085
Well, why not? Hmm?

481
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,885
We've no truck with Fenians
or communists.

482
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,811
What's wrong with you?

483
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,481

I will find them and find the guns.

I will find them and find the guns.

586
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,331

they'll have to pay.

By order of the Peaky Blinders.

599
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,845
Are you in position?

600
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,206

Have you found anything out
that might help me?

604
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,847
I interrogated the head
of the Peaky Blinders.

605
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,926
He didn't know anything.

who heads the Shelby family.

00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,761
Thomas.

610
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,486
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

611
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,244
You sound fascinated.

612
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,850
However, my opinion has not changed.

613
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,804
The bookmaker gangs have other business

614
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,326
and the communists
are too weak to have planned this.

615
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,841
I believe the guns
were taken by the IRA.

616
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,844
You must not let your personal history
cloud your judgement.

617
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,641
What history?

618
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,005
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect my judgement.

619
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,965
If you see any guns,

620
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,844
check the serial numbers
against that list.

621
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,760
Your father...

622
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,971
was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

623
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,247

624
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,403
Danny, as you know,
the man you killed was Italian.

625
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,044
Those two men over there
are his brothers.

626
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,809
If l let the Italians do this, Danny,

627
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,327
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

628
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,522
That's how those bastards do things.

629

between us and the Italians,

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,843
I suppose I ought to pray now.

646
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,290
Those fucking guns,

647
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,642
they blew God right outta me head.

648
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,764
Is that boat for me?

649
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,001
We have to get your body
out of the city, Danny.

650
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,726
This new copper, you know.

651
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,002
Don't bury me anywhere there's mud.

652
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,481
Okay?

653
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,441
Promise me.

654
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,089
Bury me on a hill,

655
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,249
and tell Rosie where.

656
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,404
You're a good man,

657
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,123
and a good soldier.

658
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,443
Yes, Sergeant Major.

659
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,804
In the bleak mid-winter...

660
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,608
ARTHUR: Where are ya?

661
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,371
It bloody won.

662
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,121
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

663
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,041
Yeah. It won.

664
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,005
And word will spread.

665
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,484
So the next time we do the powder trick,

666
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,689
it won't be just a garrison
that'll bet on the horse.

667
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,569
It'll be the whole of Small Heath.

668
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,165
And you know what?

669
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,804
The horse will win again.

670
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,407
And the third time we do it we'll have
the whole of Birmingham betting on it.

671
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,962
A thousand-quid bet on the magic horse.

672
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,690
And that time...

673
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,209
when we are ready...

674
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,645
the horse will lose.

675
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,285
Think about it.

676
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,404
CHARLIE: You okay, Danny?

677
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,641
I'm still in shock.

678
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,331
Are you sure this isn't heaven?

679
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,129
If it was heaven,
what would I be doing here?

680
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,684
Tommy wanted you to think it was real.

681
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,044
Try and knock some sense into you.

682
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,288
A shell full of sheep brains
hurts pretty bad.

683
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,646
Aye, it was meant to.

684
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,770
So, where are you taking me?

685
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,126
London.

686
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,929
Tommy has a little job for you.

687
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,480
Give you a chance to say thanks.

688
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,209
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny.

689
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,926
POLLY: Bad week?

690
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,850
Heard there was no moon last night.

691
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,764
- I checked. Did you do the right thing?
- Yes, I did the right thing.

692
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,927
