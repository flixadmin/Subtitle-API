1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,732
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,757 --> 00:00:04,171
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:05,445
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:07,391
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:08,949
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:10,426
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:13,318
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,132
But I became lost in time.

9
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:17,064
It took everything in my friends' power

10
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,099
to bring me back, and in doing so

11
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,535
our world was opened up to new threats.

12
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:24,004
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

13
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:26,640
I am the Flash.

14
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:28,975
Previously, on "The Flash"...

15
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:30,911
- What happened to me?
- Ralph Dibny...

16
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:32,679
- He used to be a cop.
- A dirty cop.

17
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,314
I was a good detective!

18
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,149
- This is not my world.
- Oh, and Earth-2 is?

19
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,284
Did you make a bunch of friends there

20
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:38,552
that I don't know about?

21
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:39,920
You said you were a good cop.

22
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:41,570
Be one.

23
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:45,092
- Let me train you.
- For what?

24
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:46,626
To do what I do.

25
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,161
What made you look into Mayor Bellows?

26
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:50,330
Oh, it was a client. Last name DeVoe.

27
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,305
Owe you for the java, rookie.

28
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:00,173
Can't believe I left my wallet at home.

29
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:01,508
Don't worry about it.
It could happen to anyone...

30
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,343
five times in a row.

31
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:05,875
And could you please
stop calling me rookie?

32
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:07,714
Sorry, uh... old habit

33
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:09,734
from when I was your superior officer.

34
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:11,852
You know, before you got me fired,

35
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:14,054
ruined my career... destroyed my life.

36
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:15,856
Crushed my spirit, left me alone

37
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:17,491
- without a friend in the world.
- Don't forget how

38
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:19,609
I turned you into
an amorphous, stretchy blob.

39
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,808
Actually, that's the one
good thing you've done for me.

40
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,796
- Yeah.
- Course, you didn't do it

41
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,093
on purpose, so you don't get credit.

42
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,551
Both of you, hand over your cash, now!

43
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,257
Hey.

44
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:30,717
Uh, pardon us, okay? One second.

45
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,086
Okay, this is perfect.
I've been teaching you, right?

46
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:34,988
Muggers are like Superhero 101.

47
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,956
- Ooh, Ralphy like-y.
- All right, what's your plan?

48
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,343
Okay, I was thinking about this

49
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:40,507
in the shower this morning:
How sweet would it be

50
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:42,539
to turn into a giant slingshot?

51
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:45,131
That's a weird plan, but okay.

52
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:47,033
Oh, I got an even cooler idea.

53
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,702
Hey! I'm still robbing you guys!

54
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:51,871
We will be right with you, sir!

55
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:53,062
Please!

56
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:55,641
Okay, what if I did, like,
a human Slinky thing?

57
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:57,477
Maybe wrap him up,
throw in a few on-theme puns?

58
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,679
Whatever, Ralph. We just gotta

59
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:00,913
- hurry up a little bit.
- Relax, rookie.

60
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:03,449
I've seen a lot of thugs.
This guy is no shooter.

61
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:07,854
- Whoa!
- My leg!

62
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:09,640
Well.

63
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,195
Our work here is done.

64
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,906
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
We can't just leave.

65
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,578
- You just shot him.
- I didn't shoot him.

66
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:16,202
- He shot him.
- Well, I...

67
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:17,497
Do you feel like I shot you?

68
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:21,834
Stop shooting him!

69
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:23,169
I am not shooting him!

70
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:25,271
Oh, they shot my ass!

71
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:27,440
Okay, so he's a little banged up, but...

72
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,968
we caught the bad guy.
Isn't that what superheroes do?

73
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:32,945
No, a superhero's first job
is to protect people.

74
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:35,181
Oh, God. What's the second job?

75
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:36,783
Long-winded lectures before noon?

76
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:38,468
- I barely...
- Take this.

77
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,821
One day, I'm gonna throw
a lightning bolt so far up...

78
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:43,414
I'm taking him to the hospital!

79
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,491
- No!
- And you owe me five coffees.

80
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:47,894
It's fine.

81
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:48,914
I know. Come on, get up.

82
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,773
I'm not gonna hurt you.
This way, come on.

83
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:58,164
Hey! He left his gun!

84
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,093
He's reformed already.

85
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:05,281
synced and corrected by susinz
*www.addic7ed.com*

86
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:09,054
We need to talk.

87
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:11,554
The only way it can end...

88
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,632
- with my victory.
- What?

89
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:20,076
Fine. Let us take the long way

90
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:21,390
and continue.

91
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,906
Today, for the first time,

92
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:25,898
events will align that give Team Flash

93
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,593
a chance to discover your identity.

94
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,502
This is earlier than you anticipated.

95
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:31,070
- It is of no concern.
- Like hell!

96
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:32,538
You know what's at risk.

97
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,673
What we are doing.

98
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,308
If you've miscalculated

99
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,077
- by even a decimal...
- There is not a decimal,

100
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,613
a fraction, an infinitesimal variable

101
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:43,031
beyond my thought...

102
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:45,585
beyond my mind.

103
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:46,601
Even now,

104
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,700
of the 7,798 variations
of this argument,

105
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:54,594
I have anticipated them all
and know how it ends.

106
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:56,085
Then how does it end?

107
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:01,836
The only way it can end.

108
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:04,460
With my victory.

109
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:24,490
Ouch. All-nighter, huh?

110
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:26,592
I haven't been this tired
since Killer Frost decided

111
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,060
to go to Burning Man.

112
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,029
Yeah? Well, how is our search

113
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:32,031
for the mysterious DeVoe coming?

114
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:34,000
Allen, we're searching
for an evil mastermind.

115
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:35,768
The only clue we have
to go on is his name,

116
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,203
of which there's
literally thousands, so how's

117
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,271
the search going? It's...

118
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:40,540
Fantastic.

119
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,408
I missed that.

120
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,921
If we're gonna find DeVoe,
we need more brain power.

121
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,398
Well, why didn't you say so?

122
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:48,537
One master detective, ready to detect.

123
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:50,382
I said "more brain power"

124
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,752
Initiating emergency oxygen purge.

125
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,055
In ten... nine...

126
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:58,224
Eight... seven... six...

127
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:00,025
Five... four...

128
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:01,360
One more second.

129
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,265
Two... one...

130
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,997
Like I said, we need more help.

131
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:06,585
Maybe I should call my friends.

132
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,850
- Your what?
- My friends.

133
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,208
Is he saying "friends"?

134
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,437
I think he's being sarcastic.

135
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:12,500
No, no, no. This is delirium.

136
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,093
He's cracked from being awake all night.

137
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:15,601
Hey, Harry, all of your friends

138
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:17,296
- are in this room.
- I have other friends.

139
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,523
You asked me to make new friends.

140
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,147
I made new friends. It was a task.

141
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:22,492
- I complete tasks.
- That's so great.

142
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:25,500
- I can't wait to meet them.
- Harry, you listened to me.

143
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:28,454
- I'm so proud of you.
- Okay, there's no pride...

144
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,951
Put that down.
Look, my friends are smart.

145
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:33,148
They'll help us. I'll call them.

146
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:40,358
All right, well, um, in the meantime,

147
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:42,417
we gotta find the rest
of these bus metas.

148
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,617
Somehow they're connected
to DeVoe's plan.

149
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:46,888
You were on the bus.

150
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,057
Can you remember anybody else who was?

151
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,742
Well, I was in between drunk
and hungover at the time.

152
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,563
She is cute. What's her deal?

153
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:56,631
- She's in jail.
- When are visiting hours?

154
00:05:57,328 --> 00:05:58,733
What about vibing

155
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,602
the rest of the bus passengers?

156
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:02,204
I mean, I-I tried, but, you know,

157
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,439
the... the dark matter we released

158
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,408
was such a massive space-time event

159
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,610
that my energy just reflected back

160
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:10,445
and I ended up vibing myself.

161
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:13,273
I'm pretty sure I relived my own birth.

162
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,437
Or was that my death?

163
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,452
You know, there are other
non-traumatizing ways

164
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:19,087
of bringing Ralph's memory back,

165
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:21,122
- like hypnosis.
- Is that really a thing?

166
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:23,091
I mean, not the whole
cartoon, pocket watch version,

167
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,526
but yeah, real hypnosis can be used

168
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:25,734
to recover memories.

169
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,962
All right. Do you know any hypnotists?

170
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:28,132
- Mm-mm.
- Not me.

171
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:30,179
- You lost me at "cartoon."
- All right.

172
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,471
So who's gonna hypnotize Ralph?

173
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,211
I'm Dr. Sharon Finkel.

174
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:36,071
Dr. Finkel, thank you so much
for squeezing us in.

175
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:38,573
Our friend Ralph here is having trouble

176
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:40,175
remembering information...

177
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,875
for a detective case. Right, Ralph?

178
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:44,695
So...

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,281
I see you didn't go to Harvard.

180
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,093
No. Did you?

181
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,570
I see what you did there.

182
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:55,365
If you could fix his personality too,

183
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,484
that'd be great.

184
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:58,600
Give it up, rookie.
This psycho hooey's never

185
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,632
gonna work on me.

186
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:01,804
Well, that was quick.

187
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,914
Now, remember with me, Ralph.

188
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:08,060
It's a month ago. You're on a bus.

189
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,762
What do you see?

190
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:14,289
I see someone... crying.

191
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,002
Dude's really bumming me out.

192
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,238
Hey, cheer up, buddy.

193
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,601
You can do it.

194
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:26,979
- What else do you see?
- I see... some women.

195
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,445
I can't see their faces.

196
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:33,152
34-32-36, 38-34-32.

197
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:34,960
Are those bus routes?

198
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:37,296
I think they are measurements.

199
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,024
Ew.

200
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,759
I see something else.

201
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,561
I see a...

202
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:45,687
It's a bison.

203
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:49,531
Does a bison mean
anything to either of you?

204
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,679
It's hocus-pocus. It's never gonna work

205
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:58,078
on a guy like me,
but we can try it if you want.

206
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:01,188
How'd you guys get over there?

207
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:46,603
Security guard found him
here this morning.

208
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:48,471
We haven't ID'd him yet.
His personal effects

209
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:51,074
are scattered everywhere,
so we didn't find his wallet.

210
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:54,750
But we may find it when we find
the rest of his briefcase...

211
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,896
and his missing hand.

212
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:59,015
Well,

213
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,717
judging by that avulsion
and the claw marks,

214
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,937
I'd say a large
predatory animal did this.

215
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,189
But whatever it was would
have to have four-inch canines,

216
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:09,426
a bite force of 5,000 P.S.I.,

217
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:10,710
and weigh over a ton.

218
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,390
That animal doesn't exist.

219
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,929
What the hell did this?

220
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,117
You don't think...

221
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,546
Do you remember back in the day

222
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:31,081
when we wouldn't calmly consider

223
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,949
a stone statue our prime suspect?

224
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,265
No, I actually don't.

225
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:46,968
Blood.

226
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,195
Hmm.

227
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:56,573
All right, my friend,

228
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,442
we got meats, we got cheeses,

229
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:02,011
we got guac, we got beer.

230
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:05,248
And of course...
we got my favorite chips.

231
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,617
Let's get this confab poppin'.
Are your friends coming?

232
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:10,131
Yeah, let me just calibrate
the multiverse holo-projector

233
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:11,354
and we'll be on our way.

234
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:13,289
Your friends are from different Earths?

235
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,859
You know, I would've thought
"multi-verse holo-projector"

236
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:18,361
would have given you that clue,
but... apparently not.

237
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:20,330
Yes, they're from other Earths.

238
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,912
And we're off and... running.

239
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:25,802
Well, allow me to make
some introductions.

240
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:28,671
From Earth-12, the holder of four PhDs

241
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,206
and the author of the book
"Everything is Meaningless,

242
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,675
So Why Did I Buy This Book?",
I give you...

243
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:35,011
Herr Harrison Wolfgang Wells.

244
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:37,514
- Guten Tag, Wells.
- Guten Tag.

245
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:40,703
Do you know that it amuses me
that you think that saving

246
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:42,595
your tiny world matters

247
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,421
when the entire multiverse
will inevitably be consumed

248
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:47,179
in a fiery heat dess?

249
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,225
- "Dess"?
- Ja, that's what I said,

250
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:50,148
dess.

251
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:52,105
- Death.
- Oh.

252
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,997
Yeah, dess. What are you, dess?

253
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,498
- Yeah.
- Oh, you must be

254
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,200
the little one that they call Cisco.

255
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:58,401
You're not that little.

256
00:10:58,403 --> 00:10:59,718
- I'm 5'7".
- Guten Tag.

257
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:02,372
All right, moving on. Um, from Earth-47,

258
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,574
I give you the billionaire inventor

259
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:05,909
and publishing tycoon,

260
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:08,044
general champion of free speech,

261
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:10,013
H. Lothario Wells.

262
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:11,546
That's right. Now keep that coming.

263
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,103
Now try the other one on.
No, not the crotchless,

264
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:14,895
that... the other... the leopard print.

265
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,419
What's going on?

266
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:17,887
He's, uh, otherwise occupied.

267
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:20,623
Oh, golly.

268
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,892
There you are. My apologies.

269
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,761
It appears that y'all have
caught us red-handed

270
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:26,362
here at the mansion on dress-up night.

271
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:27,585
You know what they say:

272
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,766
intellect is the greatest aphrodisiac.

273
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:31,367
Ja, so, nobody says that.

274
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:33,967
Here's to rising IQs and libidos.

275
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:38,541
Hate to call two a pattern here, Harry,

276
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,276
but aren't your friends just...

277
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:42,979
And from the post-apocalyptic
landscape of Earth-22,

278
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:45,548
where man and machine have
become one in order to survive,

279
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,929
I give you Wells 2.0.

280
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,631
Right-o. Let's make this quick.

281
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:54,057
Reapers have raided our petrol supplies

282
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:56,125
and stolen our water tanks.

283
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:58,795
I'd like to smash them to bits.

284
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:02,148
- It's a party now.
- Forget not about me!

285
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,515
'Tis I, Wells the Grey!

286
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:09,739
Sorry. It's a bad connection.

287
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:11,474
Ja, that was a terrible connection.

288
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:12,703
Good on ya.

289
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,378
That dude was strange.

290
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,446
- Harry?
- Yeah?

291
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:18,914
- Sidebar.
- We're gonna... sidebar.

292
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:23,096
So, remember when I said "make friends"?

293
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,221
I didn't mean with yourself.

294
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:27,190
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

295
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,359
And some of the brightest minds
in all the multiverse...

296
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,027
and good company too, I might add.

297
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,117
I mean, that Harrison Wolfgang Wells?

298
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:37,796
Guy's hilarious.

299
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:39,437
- Look, we're desperate.
- Sure we are.

300
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:42,319
So I think we should give
the Council of Wells a chance.

301
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,243
- "Council of Wells"?
- Pretty good name, right?

302
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:45,685
- Yes, it is.
- I know, all right.

303
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,710
- All right!
- Fellas.

304
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:47,718
- Fellas!
- Will you...

305
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,429
- No, do your thing.
- Here's how it's gonna

306
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:50,653
- go down...
- Nein. Halt.

307
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:52,757
So, you are unnecessary...

308
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:56,578
well, so, not wanted, so... off you go.

309
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:59,258
Off you go. Off you go.

310
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,994
He's still here. Off you go.

311
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:02,695
Even I know when
you got too many partners.

312
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:04,390
And I may be half machine...

313
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:06,699
but you're all useless.

314
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,179
I think what the fellas are
trying to say here

315
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:10,945
is that they prefer to work alone.

316
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,106
- You don't say.
- I just did.

317
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,968
- Done just said.
- Ja, he just said.

318
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:18,320
Fine. You enjoy your roadkill.

319
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,580
I'm gonna be eating my favorite chips.

320
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:23,016
We had a Cisco on my Earth once.

321
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,000
He was delicious.

322
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,843
He ate the other Cisco.

323
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:33,828
- I'm gonna...
- Hm?

324
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,515
Leave you to you.

325
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:43,436
So this stone sample shows
absolutely no unique attributes

326
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:46,139
of any kind...
totally normal granite statue.

327
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,296
Except...

328
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,642
it's filled with traces
of the dark matter

329
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:52,085
on a molecular level, as if
it's been flooded with it.

330
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,343
So, another bus meta?

331
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,474
One that somehow brings

332
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:55,742
inanimate objects to life

333
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:57,510
- and uses them to kill.
- Hm.

334
00:13:57,512 --> 00:14:00,613
How can this possibly be... possible?

335
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:03,082
My best guess? This meta has the ability

336
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:04,984
to leave a psychic imprint on objects...

337
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:06,819
a sort of telekinetic puppeteering

338
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,117
through a subconscious link.

339
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,683
That's really smart, 34-25-34.

340
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:14,394
- Did he just give my...
- No, ignore him.

341
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,195
Um... well, look.

342
00:14:16,197 --> 00:14:17,730
The good thing is, our rifles have

343
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,265
a "blow statues to hell" setting,

344
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,434
so when this meta does show up...

345
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:22,602
we'll be ready.

346
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:23,976
I hope we're ready now.

347
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:26,839
Our victim's name is Jim Fox.

348
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:29,015
He was an auctioneer at Wetherby's.

349
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:31,047
He was transporting
a Native American artifact

350
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:33,583
when he was attacked.
We just don't know which one.

351
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:35,226
Oh, wait. Maybe we do.

352
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,218
A bison necklace.

353
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,322
Ralph, you said you saw
a bison on the bus, right?

354
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:42,460
I mean... nothing in our world
is a coincidence.

355
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,727
- Vindicated.
- No one said you were lying.

356
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,148
I could see it in your eyes.

357
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:47,429
According to this auction report,

358
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,515
the necklace was separated
into three pieces.

359
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,515
The first was in the briefcase,
the third is unknown,

360
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,769
but the second was in the hands
of a private collector.

361
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:56,172
- "Christoph Banks."
- I'll get the CCPD.

362
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,074
Get his address. He may be in danger.

363
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,542
Then we better pay him a visit.

364
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:01,277
- You ready to suit up?
- Oh, yeah.

365
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:03,562
Where's my suit?

366
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:06,359
Now, this is just a prototype,

367
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:09,662
but she's got an adaptive
nano-weave structure

368
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,320
that is... wait for it... malleable...

369
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,546
on a sub-molecular level.

370
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,292
Don't know what that means, don't care.

371
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:18,710
Just yank the tarp off.
I'm ready for my super-suit.

372
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:20,781
Ralph...

373
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:23,545
this tarp is your super-suit.

374
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,470
When you stretch, it stretches.

375
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:30,179
When you squish, it squishes.

376
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:32,546
Squishes into something butt-ugly.

377
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,984
Where's the style, the flair?

378
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,579
Dibny needs to peacock.

379
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:38,314
Dibny needs to wear the prototype

380
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,082
Cisco so lovingly made for him.

381
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:42,312
Either that, or you fight crime naked.

382
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:44,954
Nope! Don't fight crime naked!

383
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:50,062
What is this, a puppy's raincoat?

384
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,742
The collection really is
quite impressive, isn't it?

385
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:01,343
It's taken no small amount
of resources to acquire.

386
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:05,835
I'm just glad to share it
with someone who appreciates it.

387
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,812
- That I do.
- So, this book you're writing.

388
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:11,515
It's on Sioux artifacts?

389
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:15,117
My entire bloodline
is Sioux... Lakota, to be exact.

390
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:16,523
Ah.

391
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:19,640
Then you're gonna love this.

392
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,085
This...

393
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:24,593
is a Lakota peace pipe.

394
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,329
Had to have it taken apart and repaired

395
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:27,562
so it can be smoked.

396
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,546
Wanna try it?

397
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:34,003
That which you call a "peace pipe"

398
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:35,271
is no such thing.

399
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:37,073
It is a sacred gift for prayer

400
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:39,953
from Ptesan-Wi, bringer of
the seven sacred rights...

401
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:41,914
the White Buffalo Calf Woman.

402
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:45,000
You'd never hang a Christian
cross upside down...

403
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:47,683
or lay an American flag on the floor.

404
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:49,710
Yet, you destroy that which is wakan...

405
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:53,585
what is holy... by letting it
touch your filthy flesh.

406
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:56,559
But I am here to teach you
the price for your impudence.

407
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:57,693
Who do you think you are?

408
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:59,390
I am the Black Bison.

409
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:14,429
Enough.

410
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:20,156
Whoa. Now, that is a cool suit.

411
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:22,826
Remember to take some pics for Cisco.

412
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:28,335
Help! Don't leave me!

413
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:44,093
You let her get away.

414
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:50,318
I'm getting the same traces

415
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,686
of dark matter from this

416
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:52,726
that I was from the tiger statue.

417
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,423
Looks like our meta isn't restricted

418
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,957
- to animating just stone.
- No,

419
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,492
but she does have some limitations.

420
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,960
Out of all the artifacts in the office,

421
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:00,390
she could only control the knight.

422
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,130
So then maybe
her psychic imprint abilities

423
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:03,231
are just restricted to effigies.

424
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:07,269
- It just means "statues"
- Yeah, I don't know.

425
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:08,670
Sounds kinda dirty to me.

426
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,718
So if the statues look like people

427
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:12,670
or animals, she can bring them to life.

428
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:14,261
- Mm.
- Good thing there's only

429
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:15,796
thousands of those in the city.

430
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:18,165
Oh, I got a hit on facial recognition.

431
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:21,101
"Mina Chaytan, professor
of cultural anthropology"?

432
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,970
- She's a teacher?
- Was.

433
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:24,805
She became an activist,
but she lost her job

434
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,307
six months ago after being arrested.

435
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,976
Breaking and entering,
trespassing, burglary...

436
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:30,978
quite an activist.
The charges were dropped,

437
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,746
but the university still let her go.

438
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:35,616
She was trying to reclaim
several Sioux art pieces

439
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:37,451
from the museum. Chaytan was at this

440
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:39,186
even before she was a meta.

441
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:41,455
Yeah, except now she's
upped her game to homicide.

442
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:43,157
She wants the third piece
of that necklace?

443
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,325
- Let's find it before she does.
- Okay.

444
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,195
West and West are on the case.

445
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,726
What's wrong with you?

446
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:53,740
You let her get away.
We could've caught her.

447
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,903
Yeah, I let her go,
but I also saved Banks's life.

448
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:58,105
That was the most important
thing in that situation.

449
00:18:58,107 --> 00:18:59,673
Really, Allen? Because to me,

450
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,642
when I was a cop, getting the bad guy...

451
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:03,610
that was the most important thing.

452
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:05,078
You're the Flash.

453
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,014
You could've saved him and caught her.

454
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:08,415
All right, look, Ralph.

455
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,983
I'm always gonna make the decision

456
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:12,252
to help the person in danger first.

457
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,588
That's what we do here.

458
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,490
All right, well, we'll file that

459
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:19,359
under "superhero lesson
of the day," you know?

460
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,097
You look like a plucked chicken.

461
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,195
Guys, guys!

462
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:27,067
I still think the best thing we can do

463
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,569
is figure out what is DeVoe's goal.

464
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:29,870
And then from there, we can track all...

465
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:31,238
That's a simple plan

466
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,806
from a simple man.

467
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,041
- That's not helping.
- Why don't we use

468
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:35,843
the Bates-Novick method first?

469
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:38,679
We determine why each meta
developed their super powers...

470
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:40,280
and then we smash them to bits.

471
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,949
I've seen a lot of strange here,

472
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,051
but... this takes all the cakes.

473
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:47,020
Okay, Council of Wells! How we doing?

474
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:48,789
Have we found our mystery foe yet?

475
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,425
No, we can't even agree
on what methodology to use.

476
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:52,960
- What?
- Yes.

477
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,294
- You've had an entire day.
- I know.

478
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:55,515
- Wait.
- What?

479
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:57,171
- Weren't there three of you?
- Whoo!

480
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,372
Thanks for the merry-go-round,
sweetheart.

481
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:00,963
You know what I mean.

482
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,164
Oh, sorry. I had to take care

483
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,432
of some off-camera business.

484
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,000
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

485
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,664
I can see your frank and beans.

486
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:07,929
Come on, now.

487
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,601
I do my best thinking commando. Plus,

488
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,507
it ain't like we all haven't
seen it before.

489
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:12,968
I haven't seen it!

490
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:15,266
Ah, you Earth folk.
You guys are so uptight.

491
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:16,868
I... can... Can we just

492
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,536
get back to the task at hand?
We need answers.

493
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:20,938
The best answer is always the simplest.

494
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,175
Why don't we go to
every DeVoe we can find...

495
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:25,820
and interrogate 'em?

496
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:31,382
- What, even the baby DeVoe?
- Especially the baby DeVoe.

497
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:33,117
Baby violence solves nothing.

498
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,786
Guys... guys...

499
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,587
All right... gentlemen!

500
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:38,804
Clearly, this isn't working.
And by the way,

501
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,976
it's not me. It's you.

502
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:42,937
This...

503
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,835
was a bad idea.

504
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,115
It's like your junk has been
burned into my brain.

505
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,437
You're welcome.

506
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,525
We've got the third piece
of the necklace.

507
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,384
My dad found out that it was on display

508
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,819
at Central City Museum,
but when they figured out

509
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,888
- that it was a target...
- It's on the move.

510
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,024
Yeah, it's being transferred
via armored car

511
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,953
to a secure storage facility
in Brookfield Heights.

512
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:04,372
- I pinged the truck's GPS.
- All right.

513
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:06,207
Ralph? Let's go.

514
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:09,429
I'll get my ugly suit.

515
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:26,265
Kittens.

516
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:58,799
Hello.

517
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:01,400
Are you ready to go to jail?

518
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,752
This doesn't belong in an auction house.

519
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,602
It doesn't belong
in someone's collection.

520
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:09,471
It belongs to the Sioux people...

521
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:11,606
- my people.
- Mina... I know

522
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:13,742
you've been through a lot,
but this is not the way to...

523
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:16,544
I don't need to listen
to men like you anymore, Flash.

524
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:19,682
A few weeks ago,
something inside me changed...

525
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:23,127
changed for the better...
for the more powerful.

526
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:26,087
And now there's just the Black Bison.

527
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:35,997
Oh, no, you don't.

528
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:04,292
The power lines! Get those people clear.

529
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:06,494
But I can catch the meta!

530
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:10,774
Laura!

531
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:13,891
Whoa!

532
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:24,266
Told you I'd get her.

533
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:26,648
Hey, the power's out.

534
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,750
Help!

535
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:30,118
- Laura!
- I can't keep holding it up.

536
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,524
Laura!

537
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:33,586
I got her.

538
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,805
EMTs are almost here.

539
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,827
She's still breathing.

540
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,695
Come on, wake up, honey.

541
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:42,263
Honey, come on! Wake up!

542
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh, God, oh, God. Wake up, honey.

543
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:48,903
Oh, God, honey. Honey, wake up.

544
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,572
Come on, honey.

545
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,006
Okay, you just rest up, okay?

546
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:59,133
I'm gonna come back and check
on you in a little while.

547
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:04,281
Well, mild concussion,

548
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:06,164
a hairline fracture in her leg.

549
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,833
She's young. She'll heal fast.

550
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,935
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

551
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:12,671
You're very welcome.
But, considering the accident,

552
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:14,555
she's very lucky to be alive.

553
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,577
Look, Ralph. We need to talk.

554
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:20,867
- You can't...
- Don't.

555
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:24,922
Just... just forget it, okay?

556
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:38,625
Hey, buddy.

557
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:40,765
You planning on bringing
the band back together,

558
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,656
or should I clear out the Speed Lab?

559
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,936
Broom it. We don't need

560
00:24:44,938 --> 00:24:46,471
that Council of Incompetents.

561
00:24:46,473 --> 00:24:48,707
Huh! Is that what
we're calling them now?

562
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,575
'Cause, uh, I distinctly
remember you saying

563
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:53,047
they were "the brightest minds
in all the multiverse."

564
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:55,288
And the most annoying. I thought

565
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,123
if I surrounded myself
with people like me,

566
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,791
I would like them. I don't like them.

567
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:00,399
I hate them. I hate them all.

568
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:02,228
Hm. Strong words.

569
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,130
You saw them, Ramon, right?

570
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:06,432
That Wolfgang Wells?
He's always correcting people...

571
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:08,301
an extremely annoying habit.
The other guy...

572
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,503
the "Free Willy" Wells?
He's so full of himself.

573
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:11,742
And the other, Cyborg Wells?

574
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,446
You know how he lost his eye?
His daughter gouged it out

575
00:25:13,452 --> 00:25:15,319
at the Solstice Combat Games.
I don't blame her.

576
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:17,649
I'd have done the same. I'd like
to gouge out the other eye.

577
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,516
- Harry.
- What?

578
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:23,172
You know you're essentially
complaining about yourself, right?

579
00:25:23,203 --> 00:25:25,028
Ramon...

580
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,804
do your best to pay attention
to the conversation.

581
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:29,649
I'm not complaining about myself.

582
00:25:29,674 --> 00:25:30,992
I'm complaining about them.

583
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:33,492
Yes, we're doppelgangers. We look alike.

584
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:35,992
We have completely
different personalities.

585
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:37,804
So, you don't think

586
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:39,339
you can be quick to correct people?

587
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:40,840
You don't think you can
be full of yourself?

588
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,821
Full of myself? No, I'm amazing.

589
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,978
I'm fantastic. I'm talking about them.

590
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,485
I don't like them. I hate them.

591
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,543
I hate them all.

592
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:50,836
You know what I think?
I think this is entirely about yourself.

593
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:53,186
I think underneath
all your brain and bluster,

594
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:54,554
you actually don't have
a very high opinion

595
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:55,852
- of yourself.
- What?

596
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:58,291
Why do you think it's so hard
for you to make new friends?

597
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:00,860
- I don't have a hard time...
- Harry.

598
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:04,274
No one's gonna like you if
you don't like yourself first.

599
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:08,328
These weirdos over here, they...

600
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:10,914
they didn't have to answer
our call for help.

601
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:14,741
But they did...'cause
you would've done the same.

602
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,645
And yes, there are some
really annoying, rough parts

603
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:19,913
of you, but you know what?

604
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:21,875
I've seen some amazing parts too.

605
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:26,938
'Cause sometimes, you're
a hard-ass, you're a hero.

606
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:29,766
Sometimes... you're a wizard, Harry.

607
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:34,242
The Council of Wells...

608
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,922
if you wanna make that work...

609
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,384
you have to start treating
yourself with some compassion.

610
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:44,039
All of yourselves.

611
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:53,213
Now is the time
that Simple Harry has come

612
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:54,539
to insult us even more?

613
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:56,555
I didn't call to insult. I called to...

614
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:01,914
- Apologize.
- Apologize?

615
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,914
Apologizing is punishable by banishment

616
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:07,772
under Krung the Face-Crusher!

617
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:10,597
All right, well... that's unfortunate.

618
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,667
Look, I know you guys prefer
to work alone.

619
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:15,902
You don't wanna work with other people.

620
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:17,904
You think you're so smart,
you can just push them away,

621
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:19,572
and I can say that
because I'm one of you,

622
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,555
but if we're going to find our DeVoe...

623
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:25,235
then we have to work together.
We have to work as...

624
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:28,383
- friends.
- Friends...

625
00:27:29,203 --> 00:27:30,571
- with benefits?
- Yeah, no,

626
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:31,922
we're not doing that,
but I'm sure we can

627
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:34,516
all find something
that we like in one another...

628
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,977
like you, Wells 2.0.
You're clearly very...

629
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,188
resourceful and strong. And you,

630
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:42,179
you're extremely charismatic.
I'm sure you can recruit

631
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:44,004
top talent to your research teams.

632
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,496
- Oh, I bring the talent.
- Yeah... and you,

633
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:47,969
Herr Wells, you're very...

634
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:51,688
- blunt.
- Ja. Obviously.

635
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,872
Right, but can we just... can you...

636
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,054
Yeah, sure. And I'm sorry, man.

637
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,779
What I said before
about your... you know,

638
00:27:57,804 --> 00:27:59,470
your theory on
the behavioral upbringings

639
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:01,329
of nano-serial killers being un-chill...

640
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:03,153
that was uncalled for.
I shouldn't have said that.

641
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:05,180
It's a very groovy theory. Good on you.

642
00:28:06,188 --> 00:28:07,742
Ja... uh, danke.

643
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:12,361
I suppose that when I said
that your theory on narcotics

644
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:15,086
in molecular psychiatry was
stupider than a theory

645
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:18,258
made by tiny babies, that
that was uncalled for also.

646
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:20,650
- There we go.
- Yeah, and I'm digging

647
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:23,142
the whole creepy half-man,
half-metal vibe

648
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,883
- you got going on.
- I just wanna say...

649
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:28,539
all of you... I really respect the fact

650
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:29,938
that each one of you...

651
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,531
has two eyes.

652
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:35,641
Yeah... hey, well, um,

653
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:36,836
we all agree on something. That's great.

654
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:39,862
So, on that note, I hereby reconvene

655
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,287
the Council of Wells.
Now, about our DeVoe...

656
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:46,192
Well, about DeVoe...
perhaps if we were to combine

657
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:49,062
the Bates-Novick
of our mutant friend here

658
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:51,598
with my models
of statistical elimination...

659
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,299
I'll do you one more. Maybe we enhance

660
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:55,635
your elimination models
with a psych profile

661
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:57,804
based on DeVoe's previous action.

662
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:59,641
I could whip up a predictive algorithm.

663
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:00,961
- Ja, ja, ja, ja.
- Run it through

664
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,969
my quantum cerebral chip,
we'll find him in no time.

665
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:06,235
I'm starting to see
why you called these guys.

666
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,328
Yeah.

667
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:08,672
All right, gentlemen.

668
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,664
Let's get to work.

669
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,894
If you're here to tell me
how I royally screwed up,

670
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:22,367
letting that little girl get hurt...

671
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:25,500
trust me... I know.

672
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:28,133
I keep feeling all these feelings...

673
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:33,172
guilt... remorse... heartburn.

674
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:36,209
Well, I can't help you
with that last one,

675
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:38,071
but maybe I can help with the rest.

676
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,477
- What are all those?
- Past cases.

677
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,594
Those were simpler times.

678
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:49,298
Husband stepping out on wife,
wife stepping out on husband...

679
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:51,656
husband stepping out
on wife and husband.

680
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:54,816
That one was a little less simple.

681
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,674
Ralph, it was like you were
gonna make a point?

682
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,555
My point is...

683
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:01,922
when I was a P.I., I...

684
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:06,008
I didn't have to worry about
little girls in hospitals.

685
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:09,024
I just had to get the dirt.

686
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:12,313
Whatever happened after that,
I wasn't there to see it.

687
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:16,605
Now all I see are people getting hurt

688
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,774
or about to get hurt.

689
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:21,969
And then for five years,
I got by without caring

690
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,078
about anyone.

691
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:27,774
Now I have to care about a whole city?

692
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:31,977
It's a part of the job, Ralph.

693
00:30:32,782 --> 00:30:34,563
Maybe the most important part.

694
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:36,203
How do you do it?

695
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:38,921
How do you walk around knowing

696
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:40,860
what could happen to all those people?

697
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:45,211
I... don't always handle it well.

698
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:47,852
I've made bad decisions,

699
00:30:47,877 --> 00:30:50,024
and sometimes it got more people hurt.

700
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,039
You just gotta do the best you can.

701
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:54,797
And when that's not enough,

702
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:56,274
you lean on the people around you.

703
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:01,672
Oh... you... you mean you.

704
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:03,774
Yeah, me, Ralph.

705
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:06,466
Look, I brought you into this
because I think that

706
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:09,180
you have the makings of a hero,
but I would be lying

707
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:10,992
if I said there won't be hard days.

708
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:14,039
And when there are,
you need someone to turn to.

709
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,352
I can be that person...

710
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:18,156
if you want.

711
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,875
You'd do that for me?

712
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:23,917
I will make it my personal mission

713
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,184
to protect your heart.

714
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:29,455
Look, Ralph, I-I actually think
it's great

715
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:30,922
you're feeling all this stuff.

716
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,196
But don't forget:

717
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:34,985
that little girl is gonna be okay.

718
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:36,750
And we got the bad guy.

719
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,617
Yeah.

720
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:42,602
We got the bad guy.

721
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:49,792
Don't I know you from somewhere?

722
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:51,895
- Not likely.
- No, I do.

723
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:54,477
I arrested you after one of
those protests last year.

724
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:55,735
Don't touch me.

725
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,952
Those artifacts are headed
for the museum.

726
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,435
And once the warden's people get here,

727
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:00,985
you're headed to Iron Heights.

728
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:23,560
Gentlemen, feast your eyes
on this wonder.

729
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:25,028
This bad boy is replete

730
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,363
with polymer-coated,
flame-resistant armor,

731
00:32:27,365 --> 00:32:29,414
frontal impact deflection panels,

732
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:31,305
a dual-filtered gas mask...

733
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:33,305
so you don't cry on your own supply.

734
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,008
Especially with this bad boy.

735
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:37,656
Call it the Onion.

736
00:32:39,177 --> 00:32:40,367
Any questions?

737
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:13,468
It's time we go collect what's ours.

738
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:19,401
Joe just called.

739
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:20,869
Chaytan escaped from CCPD.

740
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,204
Apparently, she made a tactical dummy

741
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:23,739
go full "Terminator" at the station.

742
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:25,313
Well, we know where she's going.

743
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:27,342
- The necklace.
- The two pieces she stole

744
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:29,544
have been reunited with
the third piece at the museum.

745
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:31,513
She has killed for these before.

746
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:33,548
She will kill anyone that gets
in her way to reclaim them.

747
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,922
It's up to us. Are you ready?

748
00:33:36,196 --> 00:33:38,386
Well... I was until you said that.

749
00:33:38,388 --> 00:33:40,021
- What are you...
- Jeez Louise, man.

750
00:33:40,023 --> 00:33:42,524
What kind of rousing
"Braveheart" speech was that?

751
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:44,559
- Just put your thing on.
- Wanna help me?

752
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:45,927
- No.
- It's really tight.

753
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:47,062
Hurry up!

754
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:59,047
Hello, beautiful.

755
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:14,711
Put it down, Mina.

756
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:17,835
- That belongs in a museum.
- This is a museum.

757
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,427
I realized that after I said it.

758
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,530
Yes. You keep it here

759
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:23,211
as part of American history.

760
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:26,668
But we're not history.
We are still here...

761
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:29,641
still sacred, as is this necklace.

762
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,703
It's going back to the Sioux.

763
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,196
Get out of my way.

764
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,410
Not after the people you've hurt, Mina.

765
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:36,955
And you're not gonna hurt anyone else.

766
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:38,219
Is that so?

767
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:52,094
Don't. Move.

768
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:55,547
Their vision. Is based. On movement.

769
00:34:59,603 --> 00:35:01,289
That movie is filled with lies!

770
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:06,451
We have a T. rex.

771
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:16,274
Aah!

772
00:35:26,163 --> 00:35:27,617
What's going on in here?

773
00:35:28,332 --> 00:35:30,367
Stop! I got you.

774
00:35:35,105 --> 00:35:37,391
Whatcha gonna do, superhero?

775
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:46,039
For the love of Jeff Goldblum, stop!

776
00:35:58,028 --> 00:36:00,355
You're really never going to
stop chasing me, are you?

777
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,130
No, I'm really not.

778
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,506
Do you have any idea how many things

779
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:06,268
I can bring to life in this place?

780
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,836
The gargoyles on the roof.

781
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:09,471
The reliefs carved into the walls

782
00:36:09,473 --> 00:36:10,872
and support pillars.

783
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:12,440
I can bring this whole place down

784
00:36:12,442 --> 00:36:14,609
- in a matter of seconds.
- But you won't,

785
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:15,944
because there is one thing
you care about

786
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:18,024
more than vengeance, isn't there?

787
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:30,759
I kind of can't believe
you fell for that.

788
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:32,391
Come on.

789
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:44,606
You almost let her escape.

790
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:45,813
Well...

791
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:47,594
I kept hearing your stupid voice

792
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,619
telling me to protect the innocent.

793
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:51,547
Nice job... rookie.

794
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:04,117
Good boy. Stay.

795
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,086
All right, sounds good.
I'll let everybody know.

796
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:19,454
Hey. That was Joe.

797
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,679
He says that Warden Wolfe
has Chaytan locked up

798
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:24,672
at Iron Heights... far, far away
from any mannequins,

799
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:26,625
- statues, or...
- Effigies.

800
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:28,156
Looked it up.

801
00:37:28,355 --> 00:37:30,088
Still say it sounds kind of dirty,

802
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:32,359
but I'm not the mayor
of the dictionary, so whatever.

803
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:34,859
Joe also said that the cleanup crew

804
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:37,194
at the museum still hasn't
found the bison necklace.

805
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:38,219
Huh.

806
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,231
Guess somebody might have mailed it back

807
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:41,610
to the Sioux reservation.

808
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:44,571
Somebody?

809
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,836
You gonna yell at me again?

810
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,549
No, not for this one.

811
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:06,156
Mina's friends and family...

812
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,821
they've been hurt for too long.

813
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,963
And I'm not sure if you've
heard this saying before,

814
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:16,571
but... a superhero's first job
is to protect people.

815
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:19,946
Wise words.

816
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,188
You want a coffee... on me?

817
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:24,779
For real this time.

818
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:27,641
Uh... thanks, but...

819
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:31,985
I gotta see about a girl.

820
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,071
Hey, kid.

821
00:38:48,877 --> 00:38:49,930
How you doing?

822
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,211
Better, thanks.

823
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,031
That...

824
00:38:55,147 --> 00:38:56,413
that's awesome.

825
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,461
But I'm really bored.

826
00:38:58,878 --> 00:38:59,969
Yeah...

827
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,289
Do you like balloon animals?

828
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:18,629
Ruff.

829
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:19,758
Ruff, ruff, ruff.

830
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:22,328
Do a giraffe next.

831
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,766
Okay, but... that might take some toes.

832
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,524
Hey.

833
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:38,500
What's going on?
We think we know who he is.

834
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:40,217
According to Harry's friends,

835
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:42,119
the name we're looking
for is Clifford...

836
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:43,586
Clifford DeVoe.

837
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:45,956
92% match to our psychological profile.

838
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,558
No other DeVoe comes close.

839
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,727
Guy keeps a low profile.
No social media,

840
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:52,688
- no criminal record...
- And we know where he's hiding.

841
00:39:53,313 --> 00:39:55,232
43 Hibbard Lane.

842
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:57,274
Well, if he's as dangerous
as you said...

843
00:39:57,737 --> 00:39:59,977
I can call Singh.
We can get a squad over there.

844
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:01,895
No.

845
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:04,360
Let's go get him.

846
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:10,039
Guys, Thawne, Zoom, Savitar...

847
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,516
for once, we actually have a chance here

848
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:14,071
to get ahead of our enemy.

849
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,000
Let's go get DeVoe.

850
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:22,039
We're about to have guests.

851
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:25,149
Then let's be ready to greet them.

852
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,024
Is this the place?

853
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:31,406
This is the one.

854
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:34,041
- Is everyone set?
- "Eye in the Sky" is a go.

855
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:36,088
I have eyes on the front door.

856
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,774
Snow and Frost standing by.

857
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,265
Just give us the word
and we'll breach in.

858
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:45,821
What kind of criminal mastermind
has a welcome mat?

859
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,125
Hi. Can I help you?

860
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:02,833
Uh, yes, ma'am.
I'm Detective Joe West, CCPD.

861
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,766
This is Barry Allen, my associate.

862
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,570
Is everything all right?

863
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:08,339
Uh, yes... uh, we were just hoping

864
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,524
to talk with Clifford DeVoe. Is he here?

865
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,524
Yes, he is.

866
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:16,280
May I ask what this is about, officers?

867
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:18,156
We just need to ask him some questions.

868
00:41:18,384 --> 00:41:20,718
Is something wrong?
Is my husband in trouble?

869
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,844
- Your husband?
- No, ma'am.

870
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:24,922
Clifford.

871
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,063
The police are here. They'd like a word.

872
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:33,656
Thank you, dear.

873
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,961
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

874
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:37,742
I'm Clifford DeVoe.

875
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,680
How may I be of help?
