1
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,414
Katie!

2
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,042
Cora!

3
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,085
You love your sister?

4
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,337
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

5
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,845
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,346
How am I looking, Paul?

7
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,139
That's better.
That's better.

8
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,700
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

9
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,034
Some Danish this morning?

10
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,246
No, just two pieces of dry
toast, Hector. Thanks.

11
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,998
Leftover's fine.

12
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,458
Dry and cold, same as always.

13
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,585
Cold is better.

14
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,211
Hmm.

15
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,046
Especially on those long walks.

16
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,716
Am I right?

17
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,052
Don't let Nurse
Godzilla catch you.

18
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,721
She'll raise holy hell.

19
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,973
You know we're not supposed
to let you wander off.

20
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,896
Where do you go every day?

21
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,260
What do you do
up in those hills?

22
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,149
Just walk.

23
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,443
I like to walk.

24
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,989
You try not to
fall down, bust a hip.

25
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,409
I don't wanna be in
no damn search party.

26
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,523
What? Do you want
this man constantly in your life?

27
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,400
Explain the moral basis of that.

28
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,484
I admit
I've made mistakes.

29
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,152
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

30
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,488
No, it's not...
She can't ask nothin', okay?

31
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,572
You can't ask nothin'.

32
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,055
I had six kids myself.

33
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,661
Why do we always
watch this stuff?

34
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,913
It's interesting.

35
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,374
Interesting?

36
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,710
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

37
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,587
All they ever talk
about is fucking.

38
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,176
It ain't no way
in this God green earth

39
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,758
I'm gonna have
a father like that!

40
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,927
If what you say is true...

41
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,345
No,
I'm talking now!

42
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,930
I'm talking now!

43
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,015
What kind of a mother are you?

44
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,683
One that
causes people more than...

45
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,227
is going to let you
try the Body Strider...

46
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,312
You're dead!
You can't come back!

47
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,399
It's back.
The Popeil Pocket Fisherman.

48
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,152
All right, all right.
Take my husband, take my kids...

49
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,070
Are you all right?

50
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,196
Hmm?

51
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,824
You look tired.
You're not yourself.

52
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,243
No, I'm... I'm fine.
I promise.

53
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,246
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day,

54
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,789
that's what I think.

55
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,750
Not that you asked me.

56
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,461
I just didn't
sleep well, is all.

57
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,757
I had a few bad dreams.
It happens. Lt...

58
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,009
I'll be fine.

59
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,675
What do you think of that?

60
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,437
Oh, if Madge
doesn't care, I certainly don't.

61
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,397
Neither do I.
All I know is...

62
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,441
Now, this here is worth a look.

63
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,321
Paul, what is it?

64
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,908
My God.

65
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,707
I've got to get out of here.

66
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,275
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you

67
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,236
whether you want it to
or not. It's silly.

68
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,240
Was it the film?
It was, wasn't it?

69
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,245
I haven't spoken of these
things for a long time, Ellie.

70
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,497
Over 60 years.

71
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,000
Paul, I'm your friend.

72
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,967
I ever tell you that I was a prison
guard during the Depression?

73
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,886
Uh, you've mentioned it.

74
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,472
Did I mention that I was
in charge of death row,

75
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,683
that I supervised
all the executions?

76
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,025
Usually, death row is
called "The Last Mile."

77
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,528
We called ours
"The Green Mile."

78
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,948
The floor was
the color of faded limes.

79
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,285
We had the electric chair.

80
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,079
"Old Sparky," we called it.

81
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,209
Oh, I've lived
a lot of years, Ellie.

82
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,420
But,  1935,

83
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,297
that takes the prize.

84
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,259
That year, I had

85
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,346
the worst urinary
infection of my life and...

86
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,766
It was...

87
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,852
It was also the year

88
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,979
of John Coffey and...

89
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,900
the two dead girls.

90
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,945
Old Alabama

91
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,324
J'ines the state of Floridy

92
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:44,667
At Mobile, lordy, at Mobile

93
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:54,843
Old Alabama is
a hog killing country

94
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:08,232
Old Alabama is
a hog killing country

95
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,155
Every fall, lordy, every fall

96
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,207
All right,
now, hold on!

97
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,589
Up on the tower!
New prisoners coming in!

98
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,717
You men down in the yard, step
off the fence! Clear that gate!

99
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,893
Put me through to E Block.

100
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,159
E Block.

101
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,910
Yeah.

102
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,746
Right.

103
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,676
Oh.

104
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,935
Paul? Prisoner.

105
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,937
Christ, give me a minute.

106
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,778
You all right in there?

107
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,034
For a man pissing razorblades,
yeah.

108
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,285
Ah!

109
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,208
Oh.

110
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,134
You should've took the day
off, gone to see the doctor.

111
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,346
With a new arrival?
You know better.

112
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,390
Besides...

113
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,558
It's not as bad as it was.

114
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,477
I think it's clearing up.

115
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,232
All right. Let's look alive, Dean.
Yes, sir.

116
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,824
Damn.

117
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,327
They're riding on the axle.

118
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,338
What'd they do?

119
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,215
They bust the springs?

120
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,763
Holy...

121
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,267
Dead man!

122
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,978
Dead man walking!

123
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,146
Who...

124
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,523
We got
a dead man walking here!

125
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,068
Jesus, please us,
what is he yelling about?

126
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:01,989
Paul,

127
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,285
you might wanna reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

128
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,953
He's enormous.

129
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,038
Can't be bigger than you.

130
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,087
Dead man walking.

131
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,050
Dead man!

132
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,052
Dead man walking!

133
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,554
Dead man!

134
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,473
Dead man walking!

135
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,392
Dead man walking here!

136
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,270
Dead man!

137
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,692
We got a dead man walking here!

138
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,570
Dead man walking!

139
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,699
We got a dead man walking here!

140
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,242
Percy.

141
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,119
That's enough.

142
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,770
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

143
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,901
Can you talk?

144
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,952
Yes, sir, boss.
I can talk.

145
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,588
Move your ass. Let's go.

146
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,340
Come on.

147
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Percy,

148
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,475
they're moving house
down in the infirmary.

149
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,396
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help?

150
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,815
No. They got all
the men they need.

151
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,109
Why don't you just
go and make sure?

152
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,987
Uh-uh.

153
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,238
I don't care
where you go, Percy,

154
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,657
just as long as it's not here
at this very moment.

155
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,288
All right.

156
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,382
Ow!

157
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,344
God, you bust my finger.

158
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,264
I wiped that grin off your
shit-poked face, didn't I?

159
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,600
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

160
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,814
Uh-huh.

161
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,739
Fuck you, Percy.

162
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,407
We're gonna get
that looked at, Del.

163
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,117
In the meantime,
you just stay quiet.

164
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,703
Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,543
I let Harry take
those chains off you.

166
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,295
You gonna be nice?

167
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,980
Your name is John Coffey.

168
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,274
Yes, sir, boss.

169
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,319
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

170
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,488
Oh, you can spell, can you?

171
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,115
Just my name, boss.

172
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,036
J-O-...

173
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,664
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

174
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,376
If I'm not here, you can ask for Mr.
Terwilliger,

175
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,587
Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton,
these gentlemen right there.

176
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,299
Questions?

177
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,386
Do you leave
the light on after bedtime?

178
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,350
'Cause I get a little scared
in the dark sometime,

179
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,269
if it's a strange place.

180
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,986
It stays pretty bright
around here all night long.

181
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,532
We always keep a few lights
burning out in the corridor.

182
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,284
The corridor?

183
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,579
Right out there.

184
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,234
You can sit.

185
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,717
I couldn't help it, boss.

186
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,345
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

187
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,978
Dean, pull Delacroix's card,

188
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,146
take him down to the infirmary,

189
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,564
see if those fingers are broken.

190
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,899
Yes, sir.
Of course they're broken.

191
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,776
I heard the bones crack.

192
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,194
Did you hear what he was yelling

193
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,779
when we brought
the big dummy in?

194
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,906
How could I miss it, Harry?
The whole prison heard.

195
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,991
Goddamn Percy.

196
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,620
You'll probably have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

197
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,414
Hmm. I'll chew that
food when I have to.

198
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,583
Right now I wanna hear
about this new inmate.

199
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,752
Aside from how big he is, okay?

200
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,380
Monstrous big.
Damn.

201
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,800
Oh, he seems meek enough.

202
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,551
Is he retarded, you figure?
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,638
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

204
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,099
Imbecile or not, he deserves
to fry for what he done.

205
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,563
Make your blood curdle.

206
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,297
What? For God's sake, what?

207
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,300
The girls!
The girls are gone!

208
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,178
Papa! Papa, look!
There's blood.

209
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,059
Oh, my God.

210
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,986
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone now!
You tell them we headed west.

211
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,864
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

212
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,616
Central! Are you on the line?

213
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,537
Oh, God, please! Somebody
took my little girls!

214
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,092
Katie!

215
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,761
Cora!

216
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:56,463
Jesus.

217
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,975
I'll kill you!

218
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,356
I'll kill you!

219
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,302
I... I couldn't help it.

220
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,057
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

221
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,730
Boy, you under arrest
for murder.

222
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,901
I interrupt?

223
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,823
Well, I'm just about done.

224
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,125
Hey,

225
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,460
how's that pretty gal of yours?

226
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,631
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

227
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,591
Not so well at all.

228
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,886
More headaches?

229
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,306
Got laid up with
another one yesterday.

230
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,225
Worst one yet.

231
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,147
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

232
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,442
Head X-rays and
who knows what else.

233
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,153
She is scared to death.

234
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,657
Truth to tell, so am I.

235
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,953
If it's something they
can see on the X-ray,

236
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,205
maybe it's
something they can fix.

237
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,499
Maybe.

238
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,964
This just came in.

239
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,716
DOE on Bitterbuck.

240
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,722
You didn't come all the way down
here just to hand me a DOE.

241
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,852
I had an angry call from the state
capitol about 20 minutes ago.

242
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,897
Is it true you ordered
Percy Wetmore off the block?

243
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:19,981
It is.

244
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,735
Now, I'm sure
you had reason, Paul,

245
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,071
but like it or not,

246
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,907
the wife of the governor of
this state has only one nephew,

247
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,034
and his name happens
to be Percy Wetmore.

248
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,078
Little Percy calls his aunt,

249
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,206
and squeals like
a schoolroom sissy.

250
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,627
He also mention
he assaulted a prisoner

251
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,629
this morning out
of sheer petulance?

252
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,548
Broke three fingers on Eduard
Delacroix's left hand?

253
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,092
I didn't hear that part.

254
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,134
I'm sure she didn't either.

255
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,428
The man is mean
and careless and stupid,

256
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,722
and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

257
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,934
Sooner or later, he's gonna
get somebody hurt or worse.

258
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,852
Stick with it, Paul.

259
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,646
It may not be much longer.

260
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,815
I have it on good authority

261
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,359
that Percy has an application
in at Briar Ridge.

262
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,153
Briar Ridge?
The mental hospital.

263
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,446
Administration job.

264
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,573
Better pay.

265
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,908
Hmm.

266
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,035
Then why is he still here?

267
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,289
He can get that
application pushed through.

268
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,874
Hmm.

269
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:21,501
Hell, with his connections,

270
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,670
he could have
any state job he wants.

271
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,381
You know what I think?

272
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,427
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

273
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,017
Well, he'll get his chance,
then, won't he?

274
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,980
Maybe then he'll be
satisfied and move on.

275
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,690
In the meantime,

276
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,483
you'll keep the peace?

277
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,821
Of course.

278
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,907
Thank you, Paul.

279
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,495
Hal,

280
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,833
you give Melinda my love, okay?

281
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,420
I'm sure that X-ray will
turn out to be nothing at all.

282
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,840
You bet.

283
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,534
Paul.

284
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,912
Hey, you.
Hey.

285
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,206
The music too loud?

286
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,012
There's just this big,
empty spot in the bed

287
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,878
where my husband usually sleeps.

288
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,635
He said to tell you he's having a little
trouble with that tonight.

289
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,932
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

290
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,559
Is that what's got you up?

291
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,603
Yeah, that...

292
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,981
and things.

293
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,275
Things.

294
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,199
We got a new inmate today.

295
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,452
Simple-minded fella.

296
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,206
Do I wanna know what he did?

297
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,625
No.
Mmm.

298
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,295
Things that
happen in this world.

299
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,674
It's a wonder God allows it.

300
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,222
Why don't you come to bed?

301
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,558
I think I have something
to help you sleep.

302
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,643
Mmm.

303
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,020
Mmm. You can
have all you want.

304
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,275
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

305
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,610
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

306
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,112
Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?

307
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,196
No.

308
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,364
Paul.

309
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,493
Because he's just gonna
want me to take sulfa tablets,

310
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,577
and I'll spend
the rest of the week

311
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,062
puking in every
corner in my office.

312
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,123
It will run its
course all by itself.

313
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,083
Thank you very much
for your concern.

314
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,713
Poor old guy.

315
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,049
Oh.

316
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,937
Paul. Dean.

317
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:33,735
Yeah?

318
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,154
Come here. Go on.

319
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,701
I guess the legislature loosened
up the purse strings enough

320
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,703
to hire on a new guard.

321
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,172
Look again.

322
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,465
He's right...

323
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,175
there.

324
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,978
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people this way.

325
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,855
Maybe it's rabid.

326
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,190
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my Christ.

327
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,274
Yeah, it could be.

328
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,109
Oh, the big mouse expert.

329
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,111
The Mouse Man.

330
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,615
What, you see him foaming
at the mouth, Mouse Man?

331
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,075
I don't see its mouth at all.

332
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,128
Oh, Brutal, no.
We'll be hip-deep in mice.

333
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,464
I just wanna see what he'll do.

334
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,966
In the interest
of science, like.

335
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,717
He's in the damn restraint room.

336
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,761
And you just know he's chewing
the padding out of the walls,

337
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,305
making himself
a nice little nest.

338
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,062
All right.

339
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,857
Let's go get the damn mouse.

340
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,744
Boss.

341
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,205
Saw me a mouse go by.

342
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,624
Can't put anything over on you.

343
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,049
All right. Just watch your toes.
Watch your toes.

344
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,724
Yeah. All right.
Here we go.

345
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,117
You let him get past you.

346
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,537
No, I did not. I've
been here all the time.

347
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,664
Then where the hell is he?

348
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,458
Well, I don't know.

349
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,170
Three grown men

350
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,215
outsmarted by a mouse.

351
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,511
Well,

352
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,304
bright side is,
all this commotion

353
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,181
probably scared
him off for good.

354
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,141
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,561
Yeah, that's
the last we'll see of him.

356
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,990
You little son of a bitch.

357
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,744
Well, I'll be damned.

358
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,746
There he is,
big as Billy-be-frigged.

359
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,040
I thought Brutal
was pulling my leg.

360
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,168
And that's a goddamn mouse.
Yeah.

361
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:05,006
Brute said he was
in here last night,

362
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,216
begging for food.

363
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,844
He comes right on
up to the desk.

364
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,763
Give him some room, Percy.
Huh?

365
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,098
Yeah, see what he does.

366
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,224
All right.

367
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,654
He's a brave little bastard.

368
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,531
Gotta give him that.

369
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,102
Damn!

370
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,897
You little scurvy!
Damn!

371
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,901
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?

372
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,195
I'm gonna kill you!
Percy!

373
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,532
I'm gonna take you out!
Percy! Percy!

374
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,662
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

375
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,497
It's just a little mouse,
dumb merde.

376
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,916
You ugly little piece of...

377
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,752
Are you listening to me?
Fuck!

378
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Percy!

379
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,464
I'm gonna rip your
diseased head off,

380
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,257
you little piece of shit!

381
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,510
Get on out of there!

382
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,387
I want you to stop this!

383
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,765
Pipe down.
I'm talking to you.

384
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,229
Percy.

385
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,433
Hey, boss!
Hey, Captain, what's going on?

386
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,072
Percy met your mouse.

387
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,995
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

388
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,292
Percy, we already tried that.

389
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,462
Huh?

390
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,381
What'd you say?

391
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,091
I said that we...

392
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,513
Knock yourself out.

393
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,931
Hope you nail the bastard.

394
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,892
Oh, yeah.

395
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,906
Gosh. He ain't
in there, huh?

396
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,868
Don't that beat the mousy band?

397
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,330
Percy,

398
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,626
you wanna think about
what you were doing just now?

399
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,212
I was trying to get the mouse.

400
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,630
Are you blind?

401
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,009
You also scared the living
crap out of me and Bill,

402
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,011
not to mention the inmates.

403
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,721
So what?

404
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,598
They aren't in cradle school,

405
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,683
in case you didn't notice.

406
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,186
Although you treat 'em
that way half the time.

407
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,439
We don't scare them any more
than we have to, Percy.

408
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,357
They're under
enough strain as it is.

409
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,401
Men under strain can snap.

410
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:16,071
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

411
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,574
talking,

412
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,701
not yelling.

413
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:22,787
You'd do better
to think of this place

414
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,955
like it's an intensive
care ward of a hospital.

415
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,501
I think of it as a bucket
of piss to drown rats in.

416
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,586
That's all.

417
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,756
Anybody doesn't like it? Hmm?

418
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,591
You can kiss my ass.

419
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,136
Don't.
Yeah, you try it. Go on.

420
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,429
Try it.

421
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,932
You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

422
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,850
Okay, Brutal.

423
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,615
We all know who your
connections are, Percy.

424
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,159
You ever threaten
a man on this block again,

425
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,203
we all gonna have a go.

426
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,955
Job be damned.

427
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,875
You done?

428
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,005
Get all this shit back
in the restraining room.

429
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,383
You are cluttering up my Mile.

430
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,656
Arlen,

431
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,617
your daughter
and her family are here.

432
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:53,210
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

433
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,091
Uh, settle down, settle down!

434
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,343
Rehearsing now.
Everybody settle!

435
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,387
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

436
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,433
Stepping forward, stepping
forward, stepping forward.

437
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,184
Is his head properly shaved?

438
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,978
Nope. it's all dandruffy,
and it smells.

439
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,981
I will take that as a yes.
Let's go, Arlen.

440
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,484
Walking the Mile,
walking the Mile,

441
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,280
walking the Mile,
walking the Mile,

442
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,406
walking the Mile,

443
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,241
walking the Mile.

444
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,369
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

445
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,164
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

446
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,499
I'm sorry for all
the bad shit I've done

447
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,044
and people I've tramped on
and everything.

448
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,295
And I hope they forgive me,

449
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,298
and I'll never do it again,

450
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,424
that's for sure.

451
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,511
Paul, we're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here,

452
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,680
hooping, hollering
and shaking his dick, are we?

453
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,765
Well, actually...

454
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,183
Still praying, still praying.

455
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,935
Getting right with Jesus.

456
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,145
Do it quietly, you old gink!

457
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,606
As I was saying, I don't believe

458
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,816
they actually shake
their dicks, Harry.

459
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,693
Be that as it may,
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,

460
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,487
so we've got
Reverend Schuster coming in.

461
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,282
Oh, he's good. He's fast, too.
Doesn't get 'em all worked up.

462
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,410
On your feet. Come on, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

463
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,788
Getting to my feet.
Walking the Mile,

464
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,790
walking the Mile,
walking the Mile,

465
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,750
walking the Green Mile.

466
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,627
Walking the Mile.

467
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,462
Walking in the Mile.

468
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,131
Sitting down now.

469
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,217
Sitting down.

470
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,719
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

471
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,179
What do I do?

472
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,682
Watch and learn.

473
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,392
Watch and learn.

474
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,232
Getting strapped.

475
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,985
Getting clamped.

476
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,238
Gettin' wired.

477
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,533
All right.

478
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,452
Getting all electrode.

479
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,584
Roll on one.

480
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,797
"Roll on one" means
I turn the generator up full.

481
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,174
You see the lights go
brighter in half the prison.

482
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,051
Arlen Bitterbuck,

483
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,013
you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers

484
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:12,182
sentence imposed by a judge in
good standing in this state.

485
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,167
You have anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

486
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,645
Yeah.

487
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,274
I want a fried chicken dinner
with gravy on the taters,

488
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,775
and I want to shit in your hat.

489
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,528
I got to have Mae West
sit on my face

490
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,697
'cause I'm one
horny motherfucker.

491
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,120
You bastard.

492
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,123
That's a good one.

493
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,374
Quiet.

494
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,876
Quiet! Shut up!

495
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,003
Shut up!
Sorry, boss.

496
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,422
Toot, one more remark like that,

497
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,215
I'll have Van Hay
roll on two for real.

498
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,635
And I'll have one less crazy
old trusty in the world.

499
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,804
It was pretty funny.

500
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:51,969
That's why I don't like it.

501
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,693
We'll be doing this
for real tomorrow night.

502
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,350
I don't want anybody
remembering some

503
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,644
stupid joke like that
and getting going again.

504
00:39:58,855 --> 00:39:59,938
You ever try not
to laugh in church

505
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,190
when something funny
gets stuck in your head?

506
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,400
It's the same goddamn thing.

507
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,528
I'm sorry, Paul.
You're right.

508
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,113
Let's keep going.

509
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,364
Harry.

510
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,496
Soak the sponge.

511
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,001
Putting on the black hood.

512
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,547
And I'm putting on my cap.

513
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,591
Why's he putting
that sponge on his head?

514
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,719
Conducts electricity directly to
the brain, fast like a bullet.

515
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,181
You don't ever throw the
switch on a man without that.

516
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,186
Hush up there, Toot.

517
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,775
Getting screwed.

518
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,985
I'm getting the cap.

519
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,200
Arlen Bitterbuck,

520
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,660
the electricity
shall now be passed

521
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,787
through your body
until you are dead

522
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,081
in accordance with state law.

523
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,959
God have mercy on your soul.

524
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,545
Amen.

525
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,215
Roll on two.

526
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,095
And that's that.

527
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,601
I'm frying! I'm frying!

528
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,064
I'm a done tom turkey!

529
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,402
This is a shocking experience!

530
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,282
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

531
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,204
Goodbye.

532
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,999
All right.
Let's do it again,

533
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,458
and let's get it
right this time.

534
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,878
Get that idiot out of the chair.

535
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,566
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong,

536
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:55,030
that he might get to go back to the
time that was happiest for him,

537
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,990
and live there forever?

538
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,578
Could that
be what heaven's like?

539
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,791
I just about believe
that very thing.

540
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,003
Hmm.

541
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,341
Had me a young wife
when I was 18.

542
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,428
Spent our first
summer in the mountains.

543
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,097
Made love every night.

544
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,517
And she'd lie there after,

545
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,479
bare-breasted
in the firelight.

546
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,900
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

547
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,072
That was my best time.

548
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,511
it'll be fine.

549
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,014
You'll do fine.

550
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,801
Arlen Bitterbuck,

551
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,346
electricity shall now be
passed through your body

552
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,599
until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

553
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,935
God have mercy on your soul.

554
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,790
Roll on two.

555
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,460
Again.

556
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,302
Adiós, chief.

557
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,680
Drop us a card from hell.

558
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,390
Let us know if it's hot enough.

559
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,562
He's paid what he owed.

560
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,481
He's square with
the house again.

561
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:19,067
So keep your
goddamn hands off him.

562
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,423
What's up his ass?

563
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,841
You.

564
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,052
Always. You, Percy.

565
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,805
On account I hate the new boy?

566
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,223
That the way it is around here?

567
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,312
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

568
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,523
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
I know all about it.

569
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,486
Sounds to me like
a pretty good job.

570
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,365
Yeah, I might just take it, too,
soon as you put me out front.

571
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,035
Yeah, you heard me.

572
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,205
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

573
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,877
Seeing a man die,
now that's not enough.

574
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,254
You gotta be close enough
to smell his nuts cook.

575
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,298
I just wanna be
out front, is all.

576
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,927
Come on. One time.

577
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,721
And then you know what?

578
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,599
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

579
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,392
And if I say no?

580
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,439
Well, I might just
stick around for good.

581
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,067
Make me a career of this...

582
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,819
Boss.

583
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,040
You are not gonna believe this.

584
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,844
Look.

585
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,514
I done tame me that mouse.

586
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,350
We see that.

587
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:01,605
Oh, oh. Watch this.
Watch what he do.

588
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,488
Ain't he something now?

589
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,618
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

590
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,952
Mr. Jingles?

591
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:18,872
That his name.
He whispered in my ear.

592
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,291
Hey, captain...

593
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,585
Could I have a box for my mouse

594
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,003
so he can sleep in here with me?

595
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,756
I notice your English gets
better when you want something.

596
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,966
Wanna see what else he can do?

597
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,719
Hmm? Watch, watch, watch.

598
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,222
Mr. Jingle?
Mr. Jingle, wanna play fetch?

599
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,475
Wanna play fetch?

600
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,019
Play fetch.
Watch, watch, watch.

601
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,208
He fetch it every time.
Every time.

602
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,336
That's some smart mouse, Del.

603
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,755
Like he a circus mouse
or somethin'.

604
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,967
Correct.
That just what he is, too.

605
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,302
He's a circus mouse.

606
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,267
When I get out of here,
he's gonna make me rich.

607
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,182
You just watch and
see if he don't do that.

608
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,434
Play fetch?
We play fetch again?

609
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,354
Well, well, well.

610
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,558
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend there, Del.

611
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,650
Don't hurt him.

612
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,403
Okay?

613
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,696
Is that the one I chased?

614
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,281
Yeah, that's the one.

615
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,326
Only Del says his name
is Mr. Jingles.

616
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,620
Is that so?

617
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,623
Del's been asking for a box.

618
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,209
Thinks the mouse will
sleep in it, I guess.

619
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,128
Might keep it for a pet.

620
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:51,840
What do you think?

621
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,720
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box,

622
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,639
and, uh, get some cotton batting

623
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,641
from the dispensary
to line it with.

624
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,310
Yeah.

625
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,521
Yeah.
That should do real nice.

626
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,825
Man said get a cigar box.

627
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,295
Morning.

628
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,384
Hal, you wanted to see me?

629
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,553
Yeah.

630
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,889
Close the door.

631
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,606
So you know...

632
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,860
You got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

633
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,529
William Wharton.

634
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,658
He's what you call
a problem child.

635
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:05,205
Got "Billy the Kid"
tattooed on his left arm.

636
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,834
Been rambling all over the
state last few years,

637
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,879
causing all kinds of trouble.

638
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,548
Finally hit the big time.

639
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,761
Killed three people in a holdup.

640
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,722
One of them a pregnant woman.

641
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,726
Bad news all around.

642
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,813
Hal?

643
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,742
It's a tumor, Paul.

644
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,912
A brain tumor.

645
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,749
They got...

646
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,417
X-ray pictures of it.

647
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,463
It's the size of a lemon,
they said.

648
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,801
And...

649
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,428
Way down...

650
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,599
Deep inside,
where they can't operate.

651
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,395
I haven't told her.

652
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,773
I can't think how.

653
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,988
For the life of me, Paul...

654
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,950
I can't think how
to tell my wife

655
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:29,747
she's going to die.

656
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,515
Oh.

657
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,059
Ah.

658
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,356
Aah.

659
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,250
Oh... Oh, God.

660
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,878
Oh, God.

661
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,342
I'm going.

662
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,468
What?

663
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,762
To see Dr. Bishop.
I'm going.

664
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,264
Today.

665
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,017
Soon as we get that new
inmate squared away.

666
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,978
That bad?

667
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,896
Oh, yeah.

668
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,421
The boy is doped to the gills.

669
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,840
Hmm?

670
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,591
Dean, hand me them clothes.

671
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,263
William Wharton?

672
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,975
Hey! You put on these
clothes now, you hear?

673
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,484
We're gonna have to do this.

674
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,238
Hellraiser, huh?

675
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,490
Look more
like a limp noodle to me.

676
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,369
Hey.

677
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,913
You've been
declared competent, son.

678
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,665
You know what that means?

679
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,918
It means you're gonna
ride the lightning. Yeah.

680
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,672
Percy, could you shut up,
give us a hand here?

681
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,008
Hellraiser.

682
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,832
Boss,
you don't look so good.

683
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,878
Look like you're
running you a fever.

684
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,469
Boss Edgecomb?

685
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,680
I needs to see you
down here, boss.

686
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,587
I got things to tend to just
now, John Coffey. You just...

687
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,982
You just stay still
in your cell.

688
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,454
E Block.

689
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,200
Come on, let's go.

690
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,453
Come on.
Look alive, big boy.

691
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,428
Careful.

692
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,976
- Careful.
- Step up. Step up.

693
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,833
Where you going?
Where you going?

694
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,143
Ain't this a party now?

695
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:25,686
Is it or what?
Let him go.

696
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,539
Shoot him.
Shoot! See who you hit.

697
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,440
Shoot the son of a bitch.
Come on, shoot me!

698
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,566
Shoot him!

699
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:33,152
Hit him, Percy!
God damn it! Hit him.

700
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:34,904
Hit me, you limp noodle.

701
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:35,988
Hit him, Percy!

702
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,240
God damn it, hit him!

703
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,783
Come on, Percy. Hit me.

704
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,409
Wharton, I'm warning you.

705
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,119
You warning me?
Warn me now.

706
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,412
I'm warning you!

707
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,498
- You're warning me?
- Shoot him!

708
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,333
Well, come on...

709
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,966
You're a big fucker.

710
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,385
Where'd you come from?

711
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,439
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

712
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,358
All right. Now, just breathe.

713
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,069
That's it.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

714
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,948
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

715
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,449
Didn't see it coming.
Come on, boy, breathe.

716
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,118
Didn't see it coming.

717
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,078
Come on. Just breathe.

718
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,874
We thought he was doped.

719
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,713
Didn't we? Didn't we all
of us think he was doped?

720
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,464
You didn't ask?

721
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,634
Well, I guess
that's not a mistake...

722
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:42,054
you'll be needing to make
again anytime soon, is it?

723
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,572
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

724
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,409
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

725
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,828
Start out by saying the
situation's under control.

726
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,912
It's not a story.

727
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,749
He will not appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

728
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,251
Well, what about you? You're
about ready to collapse.

729
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:15,338
Ah, I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

730
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:17,965
Go on, now. Go.

731
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,101
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

732
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,797
Boss,
I needs to see you down here.

733
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:05,221
This is not a good time,
John Coffey...

734
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,264
Not a good time at all.

735
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:11,352
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

736
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:34,834
Closer.

737
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,503
Boss, you know you ain't
supposed to do that.

738
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,090
Mind your business, Del.

739
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,852
What do you want, John Coffey?

740
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:54,972
Just to help it.

741
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,151
Don't be afraid.

742
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:01,735
Help!

743
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,281
Help! John Coffey's
killing Boss Edgecomb!

744
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,116
Help!

745
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,784
What are you doing?

746
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,494
Help!

747
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,707
Boss Howell! Help!

748
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,376
Boss Stanton!
Somebody, come!

749
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,712
Help!

750
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,769
Help!

751
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,189
Help! Boss Howell!
Boss Stanton!

752
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,484
Somebody, come! John Coffey's
killing Boss Edgecomb!

753
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,903
Del, for Christ sakes, shut up!

754
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,868
What did you just do to me?

755
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,580
I helped it.

756
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,375
Didn't I help it?

757
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,253
I just took it back, is all.

758
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,464
Awful tired now, boss.

759
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,925
Dog-tired.

760
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,202
Boss,
what that man do to you?

761
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,351
Hey, honey.
How you feeling?

762
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,688
Oh, not too bad.

763
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,524
What did the doctor say?

764
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,321
Oh, you know doctors.

765
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,573
Gobbledygook, mostly.

766
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,076
Gobbledygook.

767
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,884
Having stew tonight.

768
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:05,854
What are you doing?

769
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,613
What does it feel like?

770
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,616
Well, I know what it feels like.

771
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,455
It feels great.

772
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,400
Mmm.

773
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,491
Paul.
Yeah?

774
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,910
Not that I'm complaining...

775
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,287
Uh-huh.

776
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:07,541
But we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 19.

777
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,418
Yeah, we did,
at your mom's, yeah.

778
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,794
Mmm-hmm.

779
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,006
Wanna tell me what's going on?

780
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,844
Well...

781
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,097
See, the thing is...

782
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,727
I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

783
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,649
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

784
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,569
I'm thinking of taking
the morning off sick.

785
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,696
You cover the fort for me?

786
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,991
That's swell. Thanks.

787
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,952
Yeah, no.
I'm sure I'll feel better.

788
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,913
Okay. Okay.

789
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,325
You're sure
you ought to do this?

790
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,549
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

791
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:17,110
Burt, you got some company.

792
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,113
Can I offer you a cold drink?

793
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:22,866
Oh, yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

794
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:24,898
Mr. Hammersmith,
your office said

795
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,829
I might find you at home today.

796
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,580
Hope I'm not troubling you.

797
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,416
Well, that depends, Mr...

798
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,587
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block
supervisor up on Cold Mountain.

799
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,340
The Green Mile.

800
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,385
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

801
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,971
I'd like to ask you
about one of 'em.

802
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,141
Have a seat.
Thank you.

803
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:53,939
Which client?

804
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,569
Now you got my
curiosity aroused.

805
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,487
John Coffey.

806
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:01,572
Ah.

807
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,198
Coffey.

808
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,575
He causing you problems?

809
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,535
No. No, can't say he is.

810
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,745
He doesn't like the dark
and cries on occasion,

811
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,539
but other than that...

812
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,917
He cries, does he? Well, got
a lot to cry about, I'd say.

813
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,794
You know what he did.

814
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,297
I read the court transcript.

815
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:20,507
Thank you, missus.

816
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:21,800
My pleasure.

817
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,221
Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

818
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,931
Coming, Mama!

819
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:31,101
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

820
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:34,146
I've wondered if he ever did
anything like that before.

821
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,566
Why? Has he said anything?

822
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,360
No, but a man who
does a thing like that

823
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,238
has often developed
a taste for it over time.

824
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,115
It occurred to me

825
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,784
that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail.

826
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,161
Find out.

827
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:53,332
A man his size, and colored to
boot, can't be that hard to trace.

828
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,127
You'd think so,
but you'd be wrong.

829
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,379
Believe me, we tried.

830
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,548
Like he'd dropped
out of the sky.

831
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,676
How can that be?

832
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,595
We're in a depression.

833
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,931
A third of the country's
out of work.

834
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,933
People are drifting
by the thousands,

835
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,268
looking for jobs,
for greener grass.

836
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:16,438
Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't
get noticed everywhere he goes.

837
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,608
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

838
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:21,860
He is, uh...

839
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,488
strange, I admit.

840
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:28,659
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

841
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,079
I know violent men,
Mr. Hammersmith.

842
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,206
I deal with them
day in and day out.

843
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,197
You didn't come
up here to ask me

844
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,669
whether he might
have killed before.

845
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,046
You came up here to see
if I think he did it at all.

846
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:44,716
Do you?

847
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,303
One seldom sees
a less ambiguous case.

848
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:50,514
He was found with
the victims in his arms.

849
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,265
And yet you defended him.

850
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,477
Everyone is entitled
to a defense.

851
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,313
Kids! Lunch!

852
01:11:58,398 --> 01:11:59,690
Y'all listen to your mama now!

853
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:06,196
I'll tell you something.

854
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,106
And you listen close, too,
because it might be something

855
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,659
you need to know.

856
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,077
I'm listening.

857
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,579
We had us a dog.

858
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:17,708
Just a sweet mongrel.

859
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,292
You know the kind.

860
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,089
Well, in many ways, a good
mongrel dog is like a Negro.

861
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,717
You get to know it.

862
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:31,471
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use,

863
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:34,516
but you keep it around because
you think it loves you.

864
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,186
if you're lucky,
Mr. Edgecomb,

865
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,814
you never have to
find out any different.

866
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,191
My wife and I were not so lucky.

867
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,487
Caleb, come here for a second.

868
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,157
Come here.

869
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,743
Please, Son.

870
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,246
He still has the one good eye.

871
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,542
I suppose he's lucky

872
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,711
not to be completely blind.

873
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:09,176
We get down on our knees and thank
God for that much at least.

874
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,595
Right, Caleb?

875
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,390
Okay, go on in now.

876
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,563
That dog attacked
my boy for no reason.

877
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,357
Just got it in his mind one day.

878
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,902
The same with John Coffey.

879
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:31,156
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

880
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,909
But those little girls...

881
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,161
stayed raped and murdered.

882
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,081
Maybe he'd never done it before.

883
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,834
My dog never bit before.

884
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,380
But I didn't concern
myself with that.

885
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,883
I went out there with my rifle

886
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,511
and grabbed his collar
and blew his brains out.

887
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:54,971
Is Coffey guilty?

888
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,684
Yes, he is.

889
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:01,186
Don't you doubt it.

890
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,856
And don't you turn
your back on him.

891
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,025
You may get away with it once

892
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,528
or even a hundred times.

893
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,197
But in the end,

894
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:15,867
you'll get bit.

895
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,882
Oh, me! Oh, my!

896
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,845
John.

897
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,221
John.

898
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,850
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

899
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,185
It's from my missus.

900
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,316
She wanted to thank you.

901
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,111
Thank me for what?

902
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:53,071
Well, you know.

903
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:56,950
For helping me.

904
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,244
Helping you with what?

905
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,204
You know.

906
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,375
Oh...

907
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,588
Was your missus pleased?

908
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,091
Several times.

909
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:32,110
Oh, John, I can smell that from over here.
I surely can.

910
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,282
Can I give Del
and Mr. Jingles some?

911
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,659
Well, it's yours, John.

912
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,494
You can do with it
as you please.

913
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:48,001
Here. This for Del
and Mr. Jingles.

914
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:52,380
Hey! What about me? I'm gonna
get some, too, ain't I?

915
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:57,636
It's yours, John.
As you please.

916
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,972
I think I'll
just keep the rest, then.

917
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,980
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

918
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,985
Oh, John, that's so very fine of you.

919
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,072
I thank you.
Mr. Jingle thank you.

920
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,865
My mama would thank you,
too, but she dead.

921
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:20,742
Welcome.

922
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,869
Hey! What about me?

923
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:26,164
Don't you hold out on me,
you big dummy nigger.

924
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,836
Ooh, here come the boss man.

925
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,173
You'll keep a civil
tongue on my block.

926
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,687
You get that one for free.

927
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:51,273
But that's the last one.

928
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,066
That's it?

929
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,443
Just that little
itty-bitty one?

930
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:59,072
I guess I'm gonna have to pay
you out for the rest, huh?

931
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,086
Yee-haw!

932
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,212
Good shot, weren't it?

933
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:18,717
The look on your face!

934
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,597
Do you believe this?

935
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,850
That son of a bitch
pissed on me.

936
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,935
Did y'all like that?

937
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:32,105
I'm currently cooking up
some turds to go with it.

938
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,024
Nice soft ones.

939
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:36,860
Have 'em out
to y'all tomorrow.

940
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,822
We've been meaning
to clean out that room

941
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:41,990
for a while, haven't we?

942
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,325
Oh, yeah.

943
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:47,203
Hey! Hey! Be careful with that.
That's fragile.

944
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:51,875
Hey. Hey! What is it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

945
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:54,085
Y'all wanna come on in
here and dust a little?

946
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:57,714
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

947
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:14,022
You can come in here
on your legs,

948
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,524
but you'll go out on your backs.

949
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,319
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

950
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:23,656
Come on, fuck-stick. No
sneaking up on me this time.

951
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:25,492
We'll go man-to-man.

952
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,413
Piss on me?

953
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,734
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

954
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,403
Don't you call me that!

955
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,406
Wild Bill Hickok
wasn't no range rider!

956
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,658
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

957
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,702
Dumb son of a bitch sat
with his back to the door,

958
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:09,786
killed by a drunk.

959
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:12,539
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

960
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,416
Oh, you just never know
what you're gonna get

961
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,750
when you come to work every
day on the Green Mile.

962
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,672
Thank you, Wild Bill.

963
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,683
Not in there. Not in there. I'll be good.
Fellas, I'll be good.

964
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,977
Honest Injun,
I will. I will.

965
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,359
Christ, he's pitching a fit.

966
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,319
He'll be fine, boys.
Trust me on this one.

967
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,612
One, two, three.

968
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,491
Hey. Hey!

969
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,285
Hey! Hey!

970
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,995
Hey, hey!

971
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:53,955
Hey, fellers.

972
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,208
Hey, it's not funny.
You won't leave...

973
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:03,840
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

974
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,050
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

975
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:16,769
I... I learned my lesson.

976
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:18,313
I'll be good.

977
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,451
Psst.

978
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:32,577
Hey, Toot.

979
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,748
Give you a nickel
for that MoonPie.

980
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:15,245
Ooh, ooh.

981
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:17,705
Little Black Sambo! Yo!

982
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,585
Yes, sir, yes, sir.
How do you do?

983
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,339
Hope your bags are packed.

984
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:28,675
My bags are packed!
I'm ready to go!

985
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,677
Where are we going? Let's go!

986
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:37,350
No! No! No!

987
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:40,687
No! No! No!

988
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,023
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

989
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:47,819
That MoonPie thing was pretty original.
Gotta give him that.

990
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,197
Oh, yeah.

991
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:10,133
Del, grab up your things. it's a
big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

992
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:11,593
What you talking about?

993
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:15,471
Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

994
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,181
Not just
prison guards either.

995
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,226
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol I believe.

996
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:24,188
You fellas coming?

997
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,190
No, we got other fish
to fry just now, Del,

998
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,445
but you knock 'em
for a loop, yeah.

999
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,323
You knock 'em for a loop, Del.

1000
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,700
Just like Mr. Harry says.

1001
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:50,031
All right. Let's move briskly, folks.
There's not much time.

1002
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,259
All right, rehearsing now!

1003
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:55,887
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

1004
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,599
I been fixing the plumbing
here for 10 years.

1005
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:02,101
Ain't never had to wear
no damn tie before.

1006
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:05,521
Well, you're the VIP today,
Earl, so just shut up.

1007
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,276
All right, everybody,
have a seat.

1008
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:27,543
This is great.

1009
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,592
All right.

1010
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,179
Eduard Delacroix,

1011
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,015
electricity shall now be
passed through your body

1012
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,268
until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

1013
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:47,605
God have mercy on your soul.

1014
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:57,865
Roll on two.

1015
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:02,954
That's that.

1016
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:09,127
Very good.
Very professional.

1017
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:13,756
Let's do it again.

1018
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:17,385
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

1019
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:18,845
Thank you.
Yep.

1020
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:21,973
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

1021
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,641
You got that chin
strap good and tight

1022
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,226
because his head
is gonna buck...

1023
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,687
All right, break it up.

1024
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,777
So?
Oh, they love Mr. Jingles.

1025
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:36,195
They laugh over there,

1026
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,657
they cheer,
they clap their hands.

1027
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,618
Well, that's just aces.

1028
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,204
Isn't that something?

1029
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:46,831
You done good, old-timer.

1030
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,875
We're happy for you.

1031
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:52,712
Yeah, we are.

1032
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,223
Boo!

1033
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:10,646
Percy, you shit.

1034
01:25:13,484 --> 01:25:15,651
Come on. Del, get up.

1035
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:19,322
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

1036
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:22,450
I was just playing.
Come on, now.

1037
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,702
I was just having...

1038
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,664
- Ain't you sweet?
- Wharton.

1039
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,626
- Soft like a girl.
- Let him go.

1040
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,711
I'd rather fuck your asshole,

1041
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:35,838
than your sister's
pussy, I think.

1042
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:37,590
Wharton!

1043
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:46,891
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

1044
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,393
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty little head.

1045
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,939
Your noodle ain't
limp at all, lover boy.

1046
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:55,733
I think you sweet
on old Billy the Kid.

1047
01:25:56,944 --> 01:26:00,029
Ooh, but smell you.

1048
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,412
Look.

1049
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,164
He done piss his pants.

1050
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,335
Oh, my God.

1051
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:16,911
Look what
the big man done.

1052
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,925
He bust other people with a stick.
Come on, get in.

1053
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,178
Somebody touch him,

1054
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:26,514
he make water in his pants
like a little baby.

1055
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:29,976
Del!

1056
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,602
Learn when to shut up.

1057
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,355
All right, now.

1058
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,817
Don't touch me.

1059
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,833
You...

1060
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,586
You talk about this to anyone...

1061
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:59,213
I'll get you all fired.

1062
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:02,550
I swear that to God.

1063
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:08,389
What happens on the Mile stays
on the Mile. Always has.

1064
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:19,358
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

1065
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,903
You just keep on laughin'!

1066
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:28,576
Wetmore a good name for you!

1067
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,787
Percy Wetmore do a dance.

1068
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,206
Listen to him
squishing in his pant.

1069
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,887
Well,
what about Dean?

1070
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:49,347
He's got a little boy.

1071
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,515
He'd love to have
a pet mouse, I bet.

1072
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:57,521
How could a boy be
trusted with Mr. Jingle?

1073
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,899
Maybe forget to feed him.

1074
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,109
How he keep up
with his training?

1075
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,362
I mean,
he just a boy, n'est-Ce pas?

1076
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,113
Hmm.

1077
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,707
All right.
I'll take him, then.

1078
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,085
Me.

1079
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:22,004
Thank you kindly, but...

1080
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,841
You live out in the woods.

1081
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,385
Mr. Jingle, he be...

1082
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,055
He be scared to live
out in the big woods.

1083
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,521
How about Mouseville?

1084
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,690
Mouseville?

1085
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,900
Tourist attraction
down in Florida.

1086
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,861
Tallahassee, I think.

1087
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,239
Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?
Yeah, yeah.

1088
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,949
Tallahassee.

1089
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,910
It's just down the road a-piece
from the dog university.

1090
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:59,834
You think, uh... You think
they'd take Mr. Jingles?

1091
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,545
You think he's got the stuff?

1092
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:04,588
Well, he is pretty smart.

1093
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:07,633
What is Mouseville?

1094
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:10,094
Tourist attraction, I said.

1095
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:11,846
They got this big
tent you go into.

1096
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,610
You have to pay?
What, are you shitting me?

1097
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,516
Of course you pay.

1098
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,227
Dime apiece.
Two cents for the kids.

1099
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:19,353
For the kids.

1100
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:21,522
Inside the tent
they got this, uh...

1101
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:23,607
Mouse city,

1102
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:26,193
made out of

1103
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,946
old boxes and
toilet paper rolls,

1104
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:30,948
little windows
so you can look in.

1105
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:35,369
Plus, they got the Mouseville
All-Star Circus.

1106
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,373
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

1107
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:43,586
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

1108
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:48,799
Yeah, that's it.

1109
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:52,219
That's the place
for Mr. Jingles.

1110
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,057
Oh!

1111
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:59,810
You gonna be
a circus mouse after all.

1112
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:03,981
You're gonna live in a mouse
city down in Florida.

1113
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:09,278
Oh, there he goes.

1114
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,744
No!

1115
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,121
Mr. Jingles!

1116
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:22,249
No! No! No!

1117
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:29,298
You kill my mouse.

1118
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:31,342
I knew I'd get him
sooner or later.

1119
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,928
It was just a matter
of time, really.

1120
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,889
You fucking
cruel bastard!

1121
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,441
Give him to me.

1122
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:50,778
Give him to me.
Might still be time.

1123
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,459
What are you doing?

1124
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:07,711
Paul?

1125
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:10,673
What the hell?

1126
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:12,091
Please, John.

1127
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:14,969
Help him.

1128
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:17,930
Please, Johnny, help him.

1129
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,228
Oh, dear Jesus.

1130
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,147
The tail.

1131
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:28,274
Look at the tail.

1132
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:55,444
You're back.

1133
01:32:58,740 --> 01:32:59,990
What did you do?

1134
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,534
I helped Del's mouse...

1135
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:04,995
He's a circus mouse.

1136
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:08,749
Gonna live in
a mouse city down in...

1137
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:12,795
Florida.

1138
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:17,549
Boss, Percy bad.

1139
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:19,510
He mean.

1140
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,178
He step on Del's mouse.

1141
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,848
I took it back, though.

1142
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,684
Merci.

1143
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:33,857
Brute...

1144
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,901
You come along with me.

1145
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,071
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

1146
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:05,556
Now, don't start in on me.

1147
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:07,933
It was just a mouse.

1148
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,978
Never belonged here
in the first place.

1149
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:12,896
The mouse is fine.

1150
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:15,149
Just fine.

1151
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,313
You're no better at mouse-killing
than you are at...

1152
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,903
Hell, at anything
else around here.

1153
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:24,783
Yeah, you expect me
to believe that? Huh?

1154
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:28,746
I heard the goddamn
thing crunch.

1155
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,540
Aren't you glad
Mr. Jingles is okay?

1156
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:34,585
After all those
talks we had about...

1157
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:37,046
keeping the prisoners calm?

1158
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,089
Aren't you relieved?

1159
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:41,091
What kind of game is this?

1160
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:42,259
It's no game.

1161
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:44,345
See for yourself.

1162
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:48,640
Go on.

1163
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:04,281
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle.

1164
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,621
You switched him.

1165
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,539
You switched him somehow,
you bastards.

1166
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:17,503
I always keep a spare mouse in my
wallet for occasions such as this.

1167
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:20,547
Oh, yeah, you playing with me, huh?
Both of you.

1168
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:22,716
Just who the hell
you think you are, huh?

1169
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:23,801
Ah!

1170
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,690
We're the people
you work with, Percy.

1171
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,431
But not for long.

1172
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,059
Percy, I want your word.

1173
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:34,311
My word?

1174
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:37,189
I put you out front for Del...

1175
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:41,652
you put in your transfer to
Briar Ridge the very next day.

1176
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:46,407
Well, what if I just
call up certain people

1177
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:48,325
and tell 'em
you're harassing me?

1178
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:50,119
Bullying me.

1179
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:51,245
Go ahead.

1180
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,873
I promise you'll leave your
share of blood on the floor.

1181
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:56,417
Over a mouse?

1182
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,501
No!

1183
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:00,671
But four men will
swear you stood by...

1184
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,132
while Wild Bill tried
to strangle Dean to death.

1185
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,258
About that, people will care.

1186
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:06,218
Even your uncle, the governor...

1187
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,344
will care about that.

1188
01:36:07,429 --> 01:36:09,346
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

1189
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:14,351
Work record can follow a man
around for a long, long time.

1190
01:36:14,853 --> 01:36:16,395
I put you out front,

1191
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:19,022
you put in for that transfer.

1192
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:22,359
That's the deal.

1193
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:30,409
All right.

1194
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:39,877
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1195
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:43,815
Hey, boys.

1196
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:48,237
No, now, say,
"Hey," Mr. Jingles.

1197
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:53,033
Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1198
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:09,299
Boss Edgecomb?

1199
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:11,301
Yes, Del?

1200
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:14,137
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1201
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,975
Here. You take him.

1202
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,065
Del...

1203
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,987
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1204
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:32,990
You know.

1205
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,326
I'll take him, boss.

1206
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,830
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1207
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:44,042
Yeah.

1208
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,336
Yeah, you take him, John.

1209
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,672
You take him till
this foolishment be done.

1210
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:12,321
You gonna take him to Florida,
to that Mouseville?

1211
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:14,906
We'll do it together,
most likely.

1212
01:39:16,743 --> 01:39:18,368
Maybe take
a little vacation time.

1213
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:20,162
Yeah.

1214
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:22,456
People pay a dime
apiece to see him.

1215
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,167
Two cents for the kids.

1216
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:26,293
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1217
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:27,711
That's right, Del.

1218
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,007
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1219
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:37,012
You, too, Boss Edgecomb.

1220
01:39:41,225 --> 01:39:43,894
I sure wish I could've met
you guys somewheres else.

1221
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:25,686
Hope he's good and scared.

1222
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,854
Hope he knows
the fires are stoked

1223
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,773
and that Satan's
imps are waiting.

1224
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:41,201
Del, it's all right.

1225
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:25,579
Roll on one.

1226
01:41:37,258 --> 01:41:39,634
You be still,
Mr. Jingles.

1227
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:44,389
You be so quiet and so still.

1228
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,145
Eduard Delacroix,

1229
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:53,565
you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers,

1230
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:57,819
sentence imposed by a judge in
good standing in this state.

1231
01:41:58,321 --> 01:42:01,198
You have anything to say before
sentence is carried out?

1232
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:11,541
I sorry for what I...

1233
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,717
I sorry for what I do.

1234
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:23,553
I give anything to take it back.

1235
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:26,431
But I can't.

1236
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:29,684
God have mercy on me.

1237
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:32,687
Amen.

1238
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:42,989
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1239
01:42:45,868 --> 01:42:46,910
Hey,

1240
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:49,704
there's no such place.

1241
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:53,625
That's just a fairytale these
guys told you to keep you quiet.

1242
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:59,506
Just thought
you should know, faggot.

1243
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,028
Eduard Delacroix,

1244
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:06,072
electricity shall now be
passed through your body

1245
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:09,242
until you are dead
in accordance with state law.

1246
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:13,204
God have mercy on your soul.

1247
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:53,536
Roll on two!

1248
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:11,888
The sponge is dry.

1249
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:13,390
What?

1250
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,855
Jack, the goddamn sponge is dry!

1251
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,399
Well, don't you stop it!

1252
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:24,317
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1253
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:41,835
Is this normal?

1254
01:45:41,919 --> 01:45:44,087
God, the smell.

1255
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:45,213
Oh.

1256
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,173
He's cooking now!

1257
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:48,466
They cooking him good!

1258
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,635
They're about done, I reckon!

1259
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:55,265
Yeah!

1260
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:57,434
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1261
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:03,898
Yeah!
He's cooking now!

1262
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:06,776
He's cooking now!

1263
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:10,864
We gonna have a hoedown!
'Cution gumbo.

1264
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:12,991
Give me some!

1265
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:16,411
Give me some!
I'm smelling gumbo!

1266
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:19,789
I'm smelling...
I said, give me some!

1267
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,503
I smell it!

1268
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:29,132
I smell it!

1269
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:38,141
Should I kill the juice?

1270
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:39,809
No!
Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1271
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:06,294
He's frying now!
He's frying now!

1272
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,171
He's frying now!

1273
01:47:09,715 --> 01:47:11,091
Why don't you shut it down?

1274
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,467
He's still alive.

1275
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:14,431
You want me to shut down
while he's still alive?

1276
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:23,186
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1277
01:47:24,897 --> 01:47:27,649
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1278
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:31,069
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm!

1279
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:37,909
Kill it!

1280
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:45,959
You do it!

1281
01:47:46,043 --> 01:47:47,585
You're running
this show, ain't you?

1282
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:18,491
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1283
01:48:19,577 --> 01:48:20,910
Brutal!

1284
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:23,163
Brutal, no!

1285
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:24,247
No! No!

1286
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:25,415
What do you mean, "No"?

1287
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,292
How can you say no?
You saw what he did!

1288
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:28,418
Delacroix's dead!

1289
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:30,503
Now, there's nothing can change
that and Percy is not worth it!

1290
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:32,839
So he just gets away with it?
Is that how it works?

1291
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:44,184
What in the blue fuck was that?

1292
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:47,520
Jesus Christ.

1293
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:49,731
There's puke all over
the floor up there.

1294
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,025
And the smell.

1295
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,777
I got Van Hay
to open both doors,

1296
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:57,030
but that smell won't go out
for five damn years.

1297
01:48:57,114 --> 01:48:58,448
That's what I'm betting.

1298
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,368
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1299
01:49:03,537 --> 01:49:04,954
You can hear him up there!

1300
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:07,582
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1301
01:49:18,969 --> 01:49:20,595
Okay, boys, okay.

1302
01:49:21,597 --> 01:49:24,515
Now, what in the hell happened?

1303
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:25,975
An execution.

1304
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,852
A successful one.

1305
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:32,148
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1306
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:35,235
Eduard Delacroix is dead...

1307
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:38,154
isn't he?

1308
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,494
Percy?
Yeah.

1309
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:46,496
Something to say?

1310
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:52,919
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1311
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:57,006
How many years you spend
pissing on a toilet seat

1312
01:49:57,258 --> 01:49:59,008
before someone
told you to put it up?

1313
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:00,885
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1314
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:02,804
Pure and simple.

1315
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:05,640
That's your official position?

1316
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:07,100
Don't you think it should be?

1317
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:11,145
He's putting in for a transfer
request to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1318
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:14,148
Moving on to bigger
and better things.

1319
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:16,192
Isn't that right, Percy?

1320
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:19,529
Yeah. Yeah.

1321
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:22,865
Barbecue, me and you

1322
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:25,702
Stinky, pinky Phew, phew, phew

1323
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:29,289
Weren't Billy,
Jilly, Hilly or Pa

1324
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:32,792
it was a French-fried
Cajun named Delacroix

1325
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:33,960
Whoo!

1326
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:37,505
Barbecue, me and you

1327
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:40,800
Stinky, pinky Phew, phew, phew

1328
01:50:41,218 --> 01:50:42,635
Weren't Billy, Jilly...

1329
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:45,430
You're about 10 seconds
away from spending

1330
01:50:45,514 --> 01:50:47,557
the rest of your life
in the padded room.

1331
01:51:06,243 --> 01:51:07,368
Poor old Del.

1332
01:51:09,038 --> 01:51:10,121
Yeah.

1333
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:12,582
Poor old Del.

1334
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:16,169
John?

1335
01:51:18,797 --> 01:51:20,089
You okay?

1336
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:23,593
I could feel it from here.

1337
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:26,054
What do you mean?

1338
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:27,889
You could hear it.

1339
01:51:28,557 --> 01:51:29,849
Is that what you mean?

1340
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:30,933
You could hear it.

1341
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,769
He out of it now, though.

1342
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:35,146
He the lucky one.

1343
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:38,232
No matter how it happened,

1344
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:39,984
Del the lucky one.

1345
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:48,368
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1346
01:51:49,745 --> 01:51:51,871
He run away under that door.

1347
01:51:53,624 --> 01:51:55,625
Don't think he'll be back.

1348
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:59,670
He felt it too, through me.

1349
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:03,466
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1350
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:06,511
All that hurt just spill out.

1351
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:15,603
Awful tired now, boss.

1352
01:52:17,856 --> 01:52:19,190
Dog-tired.

1353
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:27,198
Me too, John.

1354
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:30,868
Me, too.

1355
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:32,388
I hate this.

1356
01:53:33,348 --> 01:53:34,557
I know.

1357
01:53:49,615 --> 01:53:52,074
Melinda, hi.

1358
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:58,581
I am so happy to see you.
Oh.

1359
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:01,417
Look at you.

1360
01:54:02,753 --> 01:54:04,670
Well, we missed you at church.

1361
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:08,508
Oh!

1362
01:54:08,592 --> 01:54:10,468
Ah, my hair...

1363
01:54:11,136 --> 01:54:12,220
You look fine.

1364
01:54:12,304 --> 01:54:13,930
I'm just a mess.

1365
01:54:19,394 --> 01:54:21,812
She's having one
of her good days.

1366
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:24,232
I thank God for that.

1367
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,319
What's a bad day?

1368
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:33,616
Sometimes she's...

1369
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,577
She's not herself anymore.

1370
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:38,538
She swears.

1371
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:40,373
She swears?

1372
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:42,083
It just pops out.

1373
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,919
Most awful language
you can imagine.

1374
01:54:45,629 --> 01:54:47,713
She doesn't even
know she's doing it.

1375
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:51,425
I didn't know she'd
ever heard words like that.

1376
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:55,054
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice.

1377
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:01,644
I'm glad she's
having a good day, Paul.

1378
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,481
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1379
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,165
Honey,

1380
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:26,002
if you don't tell me
what's on your mind,

1381
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:29,213
I'm afraid I'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1382
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:40,683
I'm thinking I love you.

1383
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:45,688
I'm thinking I don't know what
I would do if you were gone.

1384
01:55:48,525 --> 01:55:49,525
Oh.

1385
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:55,698
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1386
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:02,997
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1387
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:04,540
Well, thank you.

1388
01:56:04,625 --> 01:56:07,418
This is one delicious treat,
ma'am, before I go to work.

1389
01:56:07,502 --> 01:56:09,045
Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

1390
01:56:09,546 --> 01:56:10,671
Hey, Brutal.
Hmm.

1391
01:56:10,756 --> 01:56:11,964
You gonna hog all them taters?

1392
01:56:12,049 --> 01:56:13,215
Yes, I am.

1393
01:56:13,967 --> 01:56:15,843
Harry, you want some taters?
Come on, now.

1394
01:56:16,136 --> 01:56:17,136
What?

1395
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:20,014
Very soon we'll just see your
feet sticking out of there, Brutus.

1396
01:56:20,098 --> 01:56:21,599
Y'all saw what
he did to the mouse.

1397
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,688
I could've gone the rest of the
day without you bringing that up.

1398
01:56:27,773 --> 01:56:29,440
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1399
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:31,567
He did the same thing to me.

1400
01:56:32,361 --> 01:56:33,903
He put his hands on me.

1401
01:56:35,238 --> 01:56:36,947
He took my
bladder infection away.

1402
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:45,247
It's true. When he came
home that day, he was...

1403
01:56:47,209 --> 01:56:48,709
all better.

1404
01:56:50,087 --> 01:56:52,171
Oh, now, wait.
You're talking about...

1405
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:54,256
an authentic healing?

1406
01:56:56,259 --> 01:56:57,718
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1407
01:56:58,637 --> 01:56:59,679
I am.

1408
01:57:00,555 --> 01:57:01,639
Oh, yeah.

1409
01:57:02,182 --> 01:57:04,642
Well, if you say it,
I accept it.

1410
01:57:06,269 --> 01:57:07,520
What's it got to do with us?

1411
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:09,855
You're thinking about Melinda.

1412
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:11,399
Melinda?

1413
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:13,651
Melinda Moores?

1414
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:15,069
Yeah. So, Paul,

1415
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:16,904
you really think
you can help her?

1416
01:57:17,656 --> 01:57:19,281
It's not a bladder infection

1417
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:21,534
or even a busted mouse,

1418
01:57:22,953 --> 01:57:24,353
but I think there
might be a chance.

1419
01:57:24,454 --> 01:57:25,913
Hold on now.

1420
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,040
You're talking about our jobs.

1421
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:30,376
Sneak a sick woman
into a cellblock?

1422
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,545
Oh, no. No, no. Hal would
never stand for that.

1423
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:36,215
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything if it fell on him.

1424
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:37,550
So you're talking about

1425
01:57:38,468 --> 01:57:39,927
taking John Coffey to her.

1426
01:57:45,726 --> 01:57:47,685
That's more than
just our jobs, Paul.

1427
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:50,563
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1428
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:51,939
You're dang right, it is.

1429
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:53,899
No,
not for you, Dean.

1430
01:57:53,984 --> 01:57:57,236
See now, the way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1431
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:58,821
That way,
you can deny everything.

1432
01:57:59,823 --> 01:58:01,157
Why do I have to stay behind?

1433
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:04,827
Well, our boy's grown up,

1434
01:58:05,495 --> 01:58:06,996
gone off to school.

1435
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,165
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1436
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,083
Brutal's a single man.

1437
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:14,420
You're the only one here with two
children, another one on the way.

1438
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:18,174
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1439
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:22,845
Brutal, help me out here.

1440
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:26,599
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1441
01:58:26,683 --> 01:58:28,100
The finest.

1442
01:58:28,185 --> 01:58:30,644
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1443
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:33,230
To the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1444
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:34,899
I have no doubt.

1445
01:58:36,485 --> 01:58:38,527
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do, do we?

1446
01:58:38,862 --> 01:58:41,655
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1447
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:44,700
Now, what if he escapes?

1448
01:58:45,285 --> 01:58:48,204
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison,

1449
01:58:48,872 --> 01:58:52,124
but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1450
01:58:52,209 --> 01:58:53,529
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

1451
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:57,087
In fact,

1452
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:01,342
I don't think he did it at all.

1453
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:06,180
I do not see God

1454
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:10,684
putting a gift like that in the
hands of a man who'd kill a child.

1455
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:12,645
Well, that's a very
tender notion,

1456
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:15,272
but the man is on
death row for the crime.

1457
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:18,400
And plus,

1458
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:20,486
he's huge.

1459
01:59:20,987 --> 01:59:22,613
If he tried to get away,

1460
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:25,761
it'd take a lot of
bullets to stop him.

1461
01:59:26,076 --> 01:59:27,701
Oh, we'd all have shotguns,

1462
01:59:28,078 --> 01:59:29,578
in addition to side arms.

1463
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:31,831
I'd insist on that.

1464
01:59:33,124 --> 01:59:35,918
If he tried anything,
anything at all,

1465
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:37,962
we'd have to take him down.

1466
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:40,089
You understand?

1467
01:59:52,018 --> 01:59:53,102
So...

1468
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,271
Tell us what you had in mind.

1469
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,030
- Oh, there it is.
- Oh, I see it.

1470
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:18,127
You think this is enough?

1471
02:00:19,629 --> 02:00:21,130
I don't know.

1472
02:00:57,959 --> 02:00:59,793
You fellas thirsty?

1473
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:01,587
Fresh out of the icebox.

1474
02:01:01,671 --> 02:01:03,964
You bet. That's swell,
Brutal. Thanks.

1475
02:01:04,049 --> 02:01:05,382
Oh, yeah.

1476
02:01:05,467 --> 02:01:07,760
Hot in here.
Boy, howdy.

1477
02:01:07,844 --> 02:01:10,763
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some, too, ain't I?

1478
02:01:11,222 --> 02:01:12,932
My ass, you get some, too.

1479
02:01:13,016 --> 02:01:14,600
What makes you think
you deserve any?

1480
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:17,186
Because I got a big pecker.

1481
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:20,189
Well, the day report
says he's been okay.

1482
02:01:20,982 --> 02:01:23,525
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

1483
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:25,361
Don't be stingy hogs.

1484
02:01:28,573 --> 02:01:29,698
Come on.

1485
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:32,785
Come on.
Come on now, fellers.

1486
02:01:34,329 --> 02:01:35,579
Come on, boss.

1487
02:01:35,956 --> 02:01:37,706
I been good all day.

1488
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:42,294
It's hot in here.

1489
02:01:42,837 --> 02:01:45,923
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1490
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:48,217
Why don't you give me some?

1491
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,350
Come on.

1492
02:02:01,648 --> 02:02:02,773
You gonna stay behaved?

1493
02:02:03,692 --> 02:02:05,234
Come on, you clunk,
give me that.

1494
02:02:05,527 --> 02:02:06,735
You promise me,

1495
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:09,650
or I'll drink this myself
right here in front of you.

1496
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:12,366
Don't, don't, don't... Come on, now.
Don't be that way.

1497
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:14,243
I'll be good.

1498
02:02:39,436 --> 02:02:40,519
Cup.

1499
02:03:31,362 --> 02:03:33,489
Anybody wants out,
now's the time.

1500
02:03:34,532 --> 02:03:36,075
After this,
there's no turning back.

1501
02:03:37,869 --> 02:03:38,911
So?

1502
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,580
We gonna do this?

1503
02:03:41,664 --> 02:03:44,416
Sure.
That'd be just fine.

1504
02:03:44,876 --> 02:03:46,502
I'd like to take a ride.

1505
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:53,801
Guess we're all in.

1506
02:04:05,563 --> 02:04:06,688
What is this?

1507
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:10,192
Payback.

1508
02:04:10,527 --> 02:04:11,610
That's right.

1509
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:17,991
No, you let me go!

1510
02:04:18,076 --> 02:04:19,493
Let go of me!
Settle down.

1511
02:04:19,577 --> 02:04:20,786
Let go!
Settle down.

1512
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,538
What are you doing?
Settle down.

1513
02:04:29,629 --> 02:04:30,838
Oh!

1514
02:04:31,422 --> 02:04:32,548
"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."

1515
02:04:32,632 --> 02:04:34,258
Oh, Percy.

1516
02:04:34,342 --> 02:04:35,467
What would your mother say?

1517
02:04:35,552 --> 02:04:37,719
You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1518
02:04:37,804 --> 02:04:40,639
I know people. Big people!

1519
02:04:41,057 --> 02:04:43,767
Percy, stick out your
arms like a good lad.

1520
02:04:44,185 --> 02:04:46,520
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1521
02:04:46,604 --> 02:04:48,397
Oh, you're dead wrong
about that, you know.

1522
02:04:54,779 --> 02:04:57,114
You gonna put your arms up, huh?

1523
02:04:57,907 --> 02:04:59,867
A big man is ripping
your ears off, Percy.

1524
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:01,118
I'd do as he says.

1525
02:05:03,246 --> 02:05:04,496
There you go.

1526
02:05:13,214 --> 02:05:14,381
Please, Paul.

1527
02:05:14,883 --> 02:05:17,009
Please don't put me
in with Wild Bill.

1528
02:05:17,093 --> 02:05:18,552
Please don't.

1529
02:05:19,762 --> 02:05:21,096
You would think that.

1530
02:05:23,558 --> 02:05:26,018
No, no, no,
you can't do this to me.

1531
02:05:26,102 --> 02:05:28,604
You can't do this to me.
You can't.

1532
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:31,190
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Percy.

1533
02:05:31,274 --> 02:05:33,442
We can and we are.

1534
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:42,784
We'll give you a few hours
of quiet time, Percy,

1535
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:45,913
so you can reflect
on what you did to Del.

1536
02:05:45,997 --> 02:05:49,124
And if you get lonely, just
think about Miss Leadpipe.

1537
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:00,886
All right, let's go
over it one more time.

1538
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:02,638
What do you say
if somebody stops by?

1539
02:06:04,933 --> 02:06:06,600
Coffey got upset
just after lights out,

1540
02:06:06,684 --> 02:06:09,478
so we put the coat on him, locked
him in the restraint room.

1541
02:06:10,396 --> 02:06:12,356
They hear any kicking and
fussing, they'll think it's him.

1542
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:13,523
What about me?

1543
02:06:13,608 --> 02:06:15,400
You're down in Admin
pulling Del's file,

1544
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:16,965
going over the witnesses
on account of

1545
02:06:16,986 --> 02:06:19,529
how big a screw up
the execution was.

1546
02:06:21,908 --> 02:06:23,659
We going for the ride now?

1547
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:25,702
That's right.
We going for the ride.

1548
02:06:28,498 --> 02:06:30,207
What about us, Dean?

1549
02:06:30,291 --> 02:06:34,169
You, Harry, Percy, all down in
the laundry doing your wash.

1550
02:06:34,254 --> 02:06:36,004
Take you'll a few hours
before you're back.

1551
02:06:40,385 --> 02:06:41,802
Where you think you going?

1552
02:06:48,851 --> 02:06:50,352
You a bad man.

1553
02:06:50,687 --> 02:06:52,938
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1554
02:07:00,697 --> 02:07:02,614
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1555
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:03,907
What's wrong?

1556
02:07:28,266 --> 02:07:30,809
Whole room...
Whole room's spinning.

1557
02:07:31,728 --> 02:07:33,562
It's like
I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1558
02:07:34,105 --> 02:07:36,023
Had me some shine or...

1559
02:07:37,233 --> 02:07:38,483
Or what?

1560
02:07:40,945 --> 02:07:43,739
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1561
02:07:43,823 --> 02:07:45,032
White man...

1562
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:48,201
ought not to have to sit in
no nigger electric chair.

1563
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:50,245
No, sir.

1564
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:59,546
He a bad man.

1565
02:08:19,734 --> 02:08:20,817
Look, boss.

1566
02:08:25,365 --> 02:08:27,616
It's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair.

1567
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:30,577
Shh!  John,
we have to be quiet now.

1568
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:33,538
You see her?
You see the lady?

1569
02:08:33,623 --> 02:08:35,874
Yeah, we see her,
John. Come on.

1570
02:08:47,387 --> 02:08:49,304
Let's go. Go, go!

1571
02:08:53,476 --> 02:08:54,768
Now!

1572
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:32,848
All right, big boy.
Let's get moving. Come on.

1573
02:10:07,383 --> 02:10:09,509
Upsy-daisy.

1574
02:10:17,018 --> 02:10:18,101
John,

1575
02:10:18,686 --> 02:10:20,366
do you know where
we're taking you tonight?

1576
02:10:24,025 --> 02:10:25,192
Help a lady?

1577
02:10:27,403 --> 02:10:28,570
That's right.

1578
02:10:29,822 --> 02:10:30,864
But how do you know?

1579
02:10:32,658 --> 02:10:34,034
Don't know.

1580
02:10:35,953 --> 02:10:37,120
Tell the truth, boss,

1581
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:39,706
I don't know much of anything.

1582
02:10:41,751 --> 02:10:43,043
I never have.

1583
02:11:18,329 --> 02:11:19,913
We can still turn back.

1584
02:11:22,166 --> 02:11:24,876
Boss, look.
Someone's up.

1585
02:11:27,004 --> 02:11:28,421
This was a mistake.

1586
02:11:29,298 --> 02:11:31,383
Oh, Christ, Paul,
what were we thinking?

1587
02:11:31,467 --> 02:11:33,927
It's too late now.
John, you stay.

1588
02:11:38,975 --> 02:11:41,518
Harry, you keep John
here till we call you.

1589
02:11:52,154 --> 02:11:54,823
Who the hell goes there at
2:30 in the goddamn morning?

1590
02:11:54,907 --> 02:11:56,992
Hal, it's us.
It's Paul and Brutal.

1591
02:11:57,326 --> 02:11:58,702
It's us.
Jesus.

1592
02:11:59,161 --> 02:12:01,621
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1593
02:12:01,706 --> 02:12:03,540
No.
Hal, for God's sakes,

1594
02:12:03,624 --> 02:12:05,208
just take your finger
off the trigger.

1595
02:12:05,293 --> 02:12:06,376
Are you hostages?

1596
02:12:07,587 --> 02:12:09,254
Who's out there?

1597
02:12:09,338 --> 02:12:10,422
Who's by that truck?

1598
02:12:10,506 --> 02:12:11,506
Harry, the lights!

1599
02:12:15,761 --> 02:12:17,178
John Coffey.

1600
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:19,431
- Halt!
- Hal.

1601
02:12:19,515 --> 02:12:20,849
You stay
right where you are!

1602
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:22,225
Relax, now.
Take it easy, now.

1603
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:23,768
Don't you move!
Wait!

1604
02:12:23,853 --> 02:12:25,133
I'm warning you.
John, wait!

1605
02:12:25,187 --> 02:12:27,188
Hal, listen! Halt
right there or I'll shoot!

1606
02:12:27,315 --> 02:12:28,982
I said, halt!
Hal, put the gun down!

1607
02:12:29,066 --> 02:12:30,233
Halt!
Hal.

1608
02:12:30,318 --> 02:12:31,526
Hal!

1609
02:12:33,571 --> 02:12:34,654
Hal!

1610
02:12:34,989 --> 02:12:37,198
Who you talking to down there?

1611
02:12:37,742 --> 02:12:39,117
God damn it!

1612
02:12:39,201 --> 02:12:41,202
Hal, now, nobody is hurt.

1613
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:43,622
And we are here to help.

1614
02:12:43,706 --> 02:12:45,040
Help what?

1615
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:47,000
I don't understand.

1616
02:12:47,043 --> 02:12:49,586
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1617
02:13:06,604 --> 02:13:07,729
What do you want?

1618
02:13:08,189 --> 02:13:09,648
Hal!

1619
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:12,734
Make them go away!

1620
02:13:13,736 --> 02:13:16,404
I don't want no salesmen

1621
02:13:17,156 --> 02:13:19,240
in the middle of the night.

1622
02:13:20,076 --> 02:13:23,995
Tell them to take
a flying fuck at a rolling...

1623
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:25,372
Just to help.

1624
02:13:25,998 --> 02:13:28,375
Just to help, boss.
That's all.

1625
02:13:29,543 --> 02:13:30,877
You can't.

1626
02:13:31,545 --> 02:13:32,712
No one can.

1627
02:13:44,183 --> 02:13:45,475
Stay out of here!

1628
02:13:45,559 --> 02:13:46,685
Don't you go in there!

1629
02:13:46,894 --> 02:13:49,771
- Whoever you are, just stay out!
- Don't you do it!

1630
02:13:50,356 --> 02:13:52,774
I'm not
dressed for visitors.

1631
02:13:54,694 --> 02:13:57,070
You stop now.
You hear me?

1632
02:13:57,822 --> 02:13:59,531
Paul, I don't want him up there.

1633
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:02,367
Boss, you just be quiet now.

1634
02:14:50,958 --> 02:14:53,418
it's all right, Hal.
It's all right.

1635
02:14:53,502 --> 02:14:55,754
Hal, watch.
Just watch him.

1636
02:15:02,136 --> 02:15:04,679
Don't come near me, pig fucker.

1637
02:15:18,694 --> 02:15:21,529
Why do you have so many scars?

1638
02:15:23,824 --> 02:15:26,534
Who hurt you so badly, huh?

1639
02:15:27,661 --> 02:15:29,871
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1640
02:15:32,541 --> 02:15:34,501
What's your name, huh?

1641
02:15:34,585 --> 02:15:36,294
John Coffey, ma'am.

1642
02:15:36,378 --> 02:15:37,712
Like the drink.

1643
02:15:38,297 --> 02:15:40,256
Only not spelt the same.

1644
02:15:47,306 --> 02:15:48,473
Ma'am?

1645
02:15:56,232 --> 02:15:58,399
Yes, John Coffey?

1646
02:15:59,985 --> 02:16:01,236
I see it.

1647
02:16:02,238 --> 02:16:03,530
I see it.

1648
02:16:10,704 --> 02:16:12,956
What's happening?

1649
02:16:14,124 --> 02:16:19,254
Shh, you be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1650
02:17:45,633 --> 02:17:47,967
Come on, John.
Sick it up.

1651
02:17:48,052 --> 02:17:50,511
Come on. Cough it
out like you done before.

1652
02:17:52,097 --> 02:17:54,724
He's choking. Whatever
he sucked out of her,

1653
02:17:54,808 --> 02:17:55,850
he's choking on it.

1654
02:17:56,435 --> 02:17:57,518
John.

1655
02:17:59,188 --> 02:18:01,731
I'll be fine.
Just let me be.

1656
02:18:15,329 --> 02:18:16,621
How did I get here?

1657
02:18:19,416 --> 02:18:24,212
We... We were going
to the hospital in Vicksburg.

1658
02:18:24,713 --> 02:18:25,755
Remember?

1659
02:18:25,839 --> 02:18:28,049
Shh...  Melly.

1660
02:18:28,926 --> 02:18:31,469
It doesn't matter.

1661
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:33,221
It doesn't matter anymore.

1662
02:18:33,305 --> 02:18:35,098
Did I have the X-ray?

1663
02:18:36,392 --> 02:18:37,558
Did I?

1664
02:18:40,729 --> 02:18:42,063
Yes.

1665
02:18:42,815 --> 02:18:45,566
Yes. it was clear.

1666
02:18:45,651 --> 02:18:46,901
There was no tumor.

1667
02:18:51,740 --> 02:18:52,782
Oh.

1668
02:18:54,076 --> 02:18:55,743
Hal.

1669
02:19:02,876 --> 02:19:05,795
John, can you stand up?

1670
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:08,089
Can you turn around
and see this lady?

1671
02:19:20,561 --> 02:19:22,186
What's your name?

1672
02:19:23,564 --> 02:19:25,273
John Coffey, ma'am.

1673
02:19:26,984 --> 02:19:28,526
Like the drink.

1674
02:19:30,154 --> 02:19:32,113
Only not spelt the same.

1675
02:19:32,656 --> 02:19:35,908
No, ma'am,
not spelt the same at all.

1676
02:19:39,329 --> 02:19:42,081
Melly. No, you can't.

1677
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:08,941
I dreamed of you.

1678
02:20:12,196 --> 02:20:14,989
I dreamed you were
wandering in the dark.

1679
02:20:16,492 --> 02:20:17,950
And so was I.

1680
02:20:20,162 --> 02:20:22,330
And we found each other.

1681
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:25,958
We found each other in the dark.

1682
02:20:45,562 --> 02:20:47,188
Take it, John.
It's a present.

1683
02:20:47,731 --> 02:20:49,524
It's St. Christopher.

1684
02:20:51,026 --> 02:20:53,111
I want you to have it,
Mr. Coffey.

1685
02:20:54,154 --> 02:20:56,197
And wear it.
He'll keep you safe.

1686
02:20:57,032 --> 02:21:00,201
Please. Wear it for me.

1687
02:21:15,592 --> 02:21:16,884
Thank you, ma'am.

1688
02:21:18,929 --> 02:21:20,555
Thank you, John.

1689
02:21:27,729 --> 02:21:29,647
Christ, he goes down,

1690
02:21:29,731 --> 02:21:32,358
it'll take three mules and a
crane to pick him up again.

1691
02:21:32,442 --> 02:21:34,485
Take it easy, John.
Come on, now.

1692
02:21:34,570 --> 02:21:35,736
You gotta stay on your feet.

1693
02:21:51,879 --> 02:21:54,547
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1694
02:21:55,465 --> 02:21:57,675
He swallowed that
stuff for a reason.

1695
02:21:58,385 --> 02:22:00,803
I give him a few days.

1696
02:22:00,888 --> 02:22:03,514
One of us will be doing a cell
check, and there he'll be,

1697
02:22:03,599 --> 02:22:04,640
dead on his bunk.

1698
02:22:04,725 --> 02:22:07,268
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1699
02:22:07,352 --> 02:22:09,270
Let's just get him
back on the Mile.

1700
02:22:23,452 --> 02:22:25,286
Oh, boy, am I happy
to see you fellows.

1701
02:22:25,370 --> 02:22:28,539
You were gone so long, Wild Bill's
making noise like he's gonna wake up.

1702
02:22:28,624 --> 02:22:29,824
What the hell happened to him?

1703
02:22:29,958 --> 02:22:32,543
He's hurting, Dean.
He's hurting bad.

1704
02:22:36,465 --> 02:22:38,382
Okay, John.

1705
02:22:38,467 --> 02:22:41,928
We gonna set you
down on your bed now.

1706
02:22:42,012 --> 02:22:43,387
Here we go.

1707
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:02,615
Well?

1708
02:23:04,660 --> 02:23:06,535
What about Mrs. Moores?

1709
02:23:08,664 --> 02:23:10,539
Was it like the mouse?

1710
02:23:11,792 --> 02:23:13,042
Was it...

1711
02:23:15,003 --> 02:23:17,421
You know, a miracle?

1712
02:23:18,006 --> 02:23:19,215
Yes.

1713
02:23:20,592 --> 02:23:22,343
Yes, it was.

1714
02:23:23,387 --> 02:23:24,553
Damn.

1715
02:23:40,195 --> 02:23:41,445
Now,

1716
02:23:42,030 --> 02:23:44,907
I want to talk, not shout.

1717
02:23:44,992 --> 02:23:47,702
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1718
02:23:47,786 --> 02:23:49,036
Mmm-hmm.

1719
02:23:50,706 --> 02:23:53,541
My mother always says you do it
fast, it won't hurt so much.

1720
02:23:57,337 --> 02:23:59,088
Guess she was wrong.

1721
02:24:02,509 --> 02:24:03,926
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1722
02:24:04,011 --> 02:24:06,304
In a minute.
Now! Right now!

1723
02:24:06,388 --> 02:24:08,931
I want out now...

1724
02:24:11,893 --> 02:24:13,644
Shut up and listen.

1725
02:24:14,896 --> 02:24:17,231
Now you deserved to be punished
for what you did to Del.

1726
02:24:17,316 --> 02:24:18,482
You accept it like a man.

1727
02:24:19,359 --> 02:24:21,444
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

1728
02:24:22,321 --> 02:24:25,489
We'll tell people how you
sabotaged Del's execution...

1729
02:24:25,574 --> 02:24:26,866
Sabotaged?

1730
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:28,868
How you pissed yourself
like a frightened little girl.

1731
02:24:28,952 --> 02:24:31,162
Ooh, yes. Yeah, we will talk.

1732
02:24:32,414 --> 02:24:33,914
But, Percy,

1733
02:24:34,416 --> 02:24:36,042
you mind me, now.

1734
02:24:37,085 --> 02:24:40,504
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1735
02:24:42,591 --> 02:24:43,799
We know people, too.

1736
02:24:45,427 --> 02:24:47,595
Are you so foolish
you don't realize that?

1737
02:24:50,098 --> 02:24:52,933
Let bygones be bygones, hmm?

1738
02:24:54,269 --> 02:24:57,188
Nothing's hurt so far
but your pride.

1739
02:24:57,272 --> 02:24:58,552
No one ever need
know about that,

1740
02:24:58,607 --> 02:25:01,442
except the people
in this little room.

1741
02:25:01,902 --> 02:25:04,779
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1742
02:25:06,365 --> 02:25:07,740
Always has.

1743
02:25:12,245 --> 02:25:13,621
Hmm.

1744
02:25:17,042 --> 02:25:19,460
May I be let out
of this coat now?

1745
02:25:39,398 --> 02:25:40,481
My things?

1746
02:25:43,735 --> 02:25:45,528
Think it over, Percy.

1747
02:25:46,655 --> 02:25:48,239
Oh, I intend to.

1748
02:25:49,408 --> 02:25:52,284
I intend to think
it over very hard.

1749
02:25:54,037 --> 02:25:55,788
Starting right now.

1750
02:26:05,674 --> 02:26:08,843
He'll talk.
Sooner or later.

1751
02:26:09,344 --> 02:26:10,386
Hmm.

1752
02:26:23,442 --> 02:26:24,650
Hey, let him go!

1753
02:26:24,734 --> 02:26:25,776
John, let go!

1754
02:26:25,861 --> 02:26:26,861
Let go, John!

1755
02:26:26,945 --> 02:26:28,696
John, God damn it! Let him go!

1756
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:29,947
Let go, John! No!

1757
02:26:31,366 --> 02:26:32,908
Back off!

1758
02:26:33,869 --> 02:26:36,412
John, stop it!
Stop it, John!

1759
02:26:36,496 --> 02:26:38,581
Let him go! Back off!
John, let him go!

1760
02:27:39,434 --> 02:27:41,936
Easy, now. Easy.

1761
02:27:43,730 --> 02:27:45,064
Easy. Hey.

1762
02:27:46,233 --> 02:27:47,274
Hey.

1763
02:27:51,363 --> 02:27:52,530
Percy.

1764
02:27:55,659 --> 02:27:57,326
Are you all right?

1765
02:28:29,985 --> 02:28:31,652
Boy, what you looking at?

1766
02:28:39,786 --> 02:28:40,995
What you looking at?

1767
02:28:41,746 --> 02:28:43,497
You limp noodle.

1768
02:28:43,915 --> 02:28:45,791
You wanna kiss my ass?

1769
02:28:46,626 --> 02:28:48,002
You wanna suck my dick?

1770
02:29:00,098 --> 02:29:01,223
No!

1771
02:29:09,232 --> 02:29:11,317
Grab the gun!
Dean, grab the gun!

1772
02:29:17,699 --> 02:29:18,782
Oh, no.

1773
02:29:19,826 --> 02:29:21,493
No, no, no.

1774
02:29:22,245 --> 02:29:23,912
Oh, no.

1775
02:30:14,130 --> 02:30:16,340
I punished them bad men.

1776
02:30:17,133 --> 02:30:18,801
I punished them both.

1777
02:30:19,177 --> 02:30:20,427
Why?

1778
02:30:21,388 --> 02:30:22,471
Why Wild Bill?

1779
02:30:23,932 --> 02:30:27,434
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1780
02:30:29,104 --> 02:30:30,854
I saw what Wild Billy done.

1781
02:30:31,773 --> 02:30:33,524
Saw it plain as day.

1782
02:30:35,110 --> 02:30:37,611
You can't hide
what's in your heart.

1783
02:30:38,154 --> 02:30:39,321
What?

1784
02:30:41,074 --> 02:30:42,408
You saw what?

1785
02:30:46,413 --> 02:30:48,122
Take my hand, boss.

1786
02:30:51,626 --> 02:30:53,085
You see for yourself.

1787
02:30:55,171 --> 02:30:57,756
Paul, no.

1788
02:31:02,262 --> 02:31:03,470
Please.

1789
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:13,981
No, no, no.

1790
02:31:14,315 --> 02:31:15,315
Please.

1791
02:31:15,358 --> 02:31:17,651
I gots to, boss.

1792
02:31:17,736 --> 02:31:20,237
I gots to give you
a little bit of myself.

1793
02:31:21,948 --> 02:31:22,948
A gift.

1794
02:31:24,784 --> 02:31:28,746
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1795
02:31:50,685 --> 02:31:53,228
Hot cross buns with warm milk.

1796
02:32:22,884 --> 02:32:24,176
Klaus!

1797
02:32:26,721 --> 02:32:29,848
Suppertime!
Bring the girls.

1798
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:36,396
Girls! You heard your mama!

1799
02:32:37,732 --> 02:32:40,317
Yes, Papa!
We're coming!

1800
02:32:58,878 --> 02:33:01,964
Come on, Billy. I worked
you enough for one day.

1801
02:33:02,757 --> 02:33:04,758
Come get you some supper.

1802
02:33:07,428 --> 02:33:11,807
God is great, God is
good, and we thank you...

1803
02:33:36,165 --> 02:33:37,958
You love your sister?

1804
02:33:38,042 --> 02:33:40,294
You make any noise,
you know what happens?

1805
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:43,338
I'm gonna kill her
instead of you.

1806
02:33:43,423 --> 02:33:45,632
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her.

1807
02:33:45,717 --> 02:33:48,468
You understand?

1808
02:33:49,095 --> 02:33:50,596
Shh...

1809
02:34:07,155 --> 02:34:10,991
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1810
02:34:12,535 --> 02:34:14,411
Now you see how it is.

1811
02:34:16,039 --> 02:34:18,332
That's the way it is every day.

1812
02:34:19,250 --> 02:34:23,003
That's the way it is
all over the world.

1813
02:34:33,598 --> 02:34:35,390
- Percy.
- Percy Wetmore.

1814
02:34:35,475 --> 02:34:36,892
Percy.

1815
02:34:36,976 --> 02:34:40,020
Son?
Percy. Percy Wetmore.

1816
02:34:41,189 --> 02:34:42,230
Son?

1817
02:34:42,982 --> 02:34:44,608
Son, can you hear me?

1818
02:34:44,692 --> 02:34:45,984
Speak up if you can hear us.

1819
02:34:46,986 --> 02:34:49,738
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1820
02:34:51,866 --> 02:34:55,035
Percy, I got to
ask you a few questions.

1821
02:34:55,119 --> 02:34:58,330
That's right. One minute, he
was fine, and the next, blammo.

1822
02:34:58,414 --> 02:35:00,832
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars few days back.

1823
02:35:00,917 --> 02:35:02,918
Scared the boy so bad,
he wet hisself.

1824
02:35:04,587 --> 02:35:07,339
See, we didn't even...
We didn't see it happen.

1825
02:35:11,552 --> 02:35:16,640
I'll cover for you as much as I
can, even if it means my job.

1826
02:35:17,892 --> 02:35:19,643
But I have to know,

1827
02:35:20,269 --> 02:35:21,389
does this have anything to do

1828
02:35:21,396 --> 02:35:23,146
with what happened at my house?

1829
02:35:26,317 --> 02:35:27,818
Does it, Paul?

1830
02:35:29,862 --> 02:35:30,904
No.

1831
02:36:58,493 --> 02:36:59,659
Does Hal know?

1832
02:37:00,244 --> 02:37:02,329
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1833
02:37:03,581 --> 02:37:05,248
Well, can he help?

1834
02:37:05,833 --> 02:37:08,460
Does he have the influence
to do something about this?

1835
02:37:09,003 --> 02:37:10,420
Stop the execution?

1836
02:37:10,505 --> 02:37:11,505
No.

1837
02:37:14,842 --> 02:37:16,760
Then don't tell him.

1838
02:37:16,844 --> 02:37:18,929
If it can't help,
don't tell him.

1839
02:37:19,597 --> 02:37:20,680
Ever.

1840
02:37:23,059 --> 02:37:24,643
I won't.

1841
02:37:36,239 --> 02:37:38,615
There's no way out of
this for you, is there?

1842
02:37:40,409 --> 02:37:41,451
No.

1843
02:37:42,537 --> 02:37:45,122
And I've been thinking
about it, believe me.

1844
02:37:45,206 --> 02:37:48,416
I've been running it through
my head any number of ways.

1845
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:50,001
No.

1846
02:37:51,254 --> 02:37:52,963
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1847
02:37:54,882 --> 02:37:59,052
I've done some things in my
life that I am not proud of,

1848
02:38:00,221 --> 02:38:04,391
but this is the first time I've
ever felt real danger of hell.

1849
02:38:06,310 --> 02:38:07,394
Hell?

1850
02:38:09,147 --> 02:38:10,564
Oh, Paul.

1851
02:38:13,317 --> 02:38:14,734
Talk to him.

1852
02:38:16,154 --> 02:38:17,612
Talk to John.

1853
02:38:19,782 --> 02:38:21,700
Find out what he wants.

1854
02:38:38,718 --> 02:38:39,759
Hello, boss.

1855
02:38:40,761 --> 02:38:42,137
Hello, John.

1856
02:38:43,514 --> 02:38:45,807
I guess you know
we're coming down to it now.

1857
02:38:46,767 --> 02:38:48,351
Another couple of days.

1858
02:39:01,949 --> 02:39:04,451
Is there anything special you
wanna eat for dinner that night?

1859
02:39:05,453 --> 02:39:07,287
We can rustle you up
most anything.

1860
02:39:17,798 --> 02:39:19,758
Meat loaf be nice.

1861
02:39:19,842 --> 02:39:23,762
Mashed taters, gravy. Okra.

1862
02:39:25,389 --> 02:39:28,141
Maybe some of that fine
corn bread your missus make...

1863
02:39:28,976 --> 02:39:30,894
if she don't mind.

1864
02:39:33,314 --> 02:39:34,648
Now, uh...

1865
02:39:35,316 --> 02:39:36,733
What about a preacher?

1866
02:39:36,817 --> 02:39:39,694
Someone to say
a little prayer with.

1867
02:39:40,363 --> 02:39:42,280
Don't want no preacher.

1868
02:39:43,658 --> 02:39:46,117
You can say a prayer,
if you like.

1869
02:39:46,911 --> 02:39:48,286
Me?

1870
02:39:50,998 --> 02:39:53,541
Suppose I could,
if it came to that.

1871
02:39:57,838 --> 02:39:58,922
John,

1872
02:40:01,884 --> 02:40:04,636
I have to ask you
something very important now.

1873
02:40:06,514 --> 02:40:08,515
I know what you gonna say.

1874
02:40:09,183 --> 02:40:10,517
You don't have to say it.

1875
02:40:11,018 --> 02:40:13,728
No, I do. I do.
I have to say it.

1876
02:40:15,231 --> 02:40:16,690
John,

1877
02:40:18,359 --> 02:40:20,527
tell me what you want me to do.

1878
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:23,405
You want me to
take you out of here?

1879
02:40:24,740 --> 02:40:26,783
Just let you run away?

1880
02:40:26,867 --> 02:40:28,576
See how far you could get?

1881
02:40:30,371 --> 02:40:32,664
Why would you do
such a foolish thing?

1882
02:40:35,001 --> 02:40:37,627
On the day of my judgment,

1883
02:40:37,712 --> 02:40:40,171
when I stand before God

1884
02:40:40,256 --> 02:40:43,550
and he asks me why did I...

1885
02:40:44,427 --> 02:40:48,805
did I kill one
of his true miracles,

1886
02:40:50,433 --> 02:40:52,350
what am I going to say?

1887
02:40:53,561 --> 02:40:55,270
That it was my job?

1888
02:40:57,732 --> 02:40:59,149
It's my job.

1889
02:40:59,859 --> 02:41:03,862
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1890
02:41:07,658 --> 02:41:09,826
I know you're
hurting and worrying.

1891
02:41:10,828 --> 02:41:12,829
I can feel it on you.

1892
02:41:12,913 --> 02:41:14,497
But you ought to quit on it now.

1893
02:41:15,583 --> 02:41:18,084
I want it to be
over and done with.

1894
02:41:19,378 --> 02:41:20,462
I do.

1895
02:41:25,426 --> 02:41:27,010
I'm tired, boss.

1896
02:41:28,554 --> 02:41:30,430
I'm tired of being on the road,

1897
02:41:30,514 --> 02:41:32,599
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1898
02:41:34,268 --> 02:41:37,062
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with,

1899
02:41:37,646 --> 02:41:41,608
to tell me where we's going
to, coming from, or why.

1900
02:41:43,110 --> 02:41:46,821
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1901
02:41:48,282 --> 02:41:52,077
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world,

1902
02:41:52,703 --> 02:41:54,037
every day.

1903
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:56,456
There's too much of it.

1904
02:41:56,999 --> 02:42:00,126
It's like pieces
of glass in my head,

1905
02:42:00,961 --> 02:42:02,420
all the time.

1906
02:42:04,965 --> 02:42:06,674
Can you understand?

1907
02:42:09,678 --> 02:42:12,305
Yes, John, I think I can.

1908
02:42:15,142 --> 02:42:17,582
Well, there must be
something we can do for you, John.

1909
02:42:20,731 --> 02:42:22,565
There must be
something that you want.

1910
02:42:32,326 --> 02:42:35,870
I ain't never seen
me a flicker show.

1911
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:04,584
Why, they's angels.

1912
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:08,505
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1913
02:45:09,233 --> 02:45:11,192
it be all right, fellas.

1914
02:45:12,653 --> 02:45:14,696
This here's the hard part.

1915
02:45:16,198 --> 02:45:17,657
I'll be all right in a while.

1916
02:45:18,659 --> 02:45:22,912
John, I should have
this just for now.

1917
02:45:27,459 --> 02:45:29,419
I'll give it back after.

1918
02:45:32,756 --> 02:45:37,010
You know, I fell asleep this
afternoon and had me a dream.

1919
02:45:38,846 --> 02:45:40,680
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1920
02:45:42,099 --> 02:45:43,182
Did you, John?

1921
02:45:43,851 --> 02:45:48,521
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1922
02:45:48,606 --> 02:45:50,481
That Mouseville place.

1923
02:45:51,233 --> 02:45:53,401
I dreamed there's kids.

1924
02:45:54,194 --> 02:45:57,905
And how they laughed at his tricks.
My!

1925
02:45:59,867 --> 02:46:03,328
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

1926
02:46:04,038 --> 02:46:06,039
They's laughing, too.

1927
02:46:06,123 --> 02:46:09,375
I put my arms around them
and set 'em on my knees.

1928
02:46:09,460 --> 02:46:11,502
And there's no blood
coming out of they hair,

1929
02:46:11,587 --> 02:46:13,588
and they's just fine.

1930
02:46:13,672 --> 02:46:16,799
We all watched
Mr. Jingles roll that spool.

1931
02:46:18,302 --> 02:46:19,594
How we did laugh.

1932
02:46:19,678 --> 02:46:21,429
Fit to bust, we was!

1933
02:46:37,571 --> 02:46:38,696
John.

1934
02:46:39,907 --> 02:46:44,077
They's lots of
folks here that hate me. Lots!

1935
02:46:45,913 --> 02:46:47,413
I can feel it.

1936
02:46:48,123 --> 02:46:50,041
It's like bees stinging me.

1937
02:46:50,417 --> 02:46:52,627
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1938
02:46:54,129 --> 02:46:55,213
We don't hate you.

1939
02:46:56,757 --> 02:46:58,216
Can you feel that?

1940
02:47:00,552 --> 02:47:02,470
Kill him twice, you boys!

1941
02:47:03,430 --> 02:47:07,558
You go on and kill that
raping baby killer twice!

1942
02:47:07,643 --> 02:47:09,185
That'd be fine!

1943
02:47:25,994 --> 02:47:28,454
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1944
02:47:28,872 --> 02:47:30,123
Yes, sir.

1945
02:47:42,219 --> 02:47:43,386
Roll on one.

1946
02:47:51,437 --> 02:47:54,814
Does it hurt yet?
I hope it does.

1947
02:47:55,816 --> 02:47:57,817
I hope it hurts like hell.

1948
02:48:00,070 --> 02:48:01,779
John Coffey,
you've been condemned to die

1949
02:48:01,864 --> 02:48:04,031
in the electric chair
by a jury of your peers.

1950
02:48:04,116 --> 02:48:07,952
Sentence imposed by a judge in
good standing in this state.

1951
02:48:08,036 --> 02:48:10,830
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1952
02:48:13,083 --> 02:48:15,042
I'm sorry for what I am.

1953
02:48:27,681 --> 02:48:29,140
Please, boss,

1954
02:48:30,684 --> 02:48:33,144
don't put that thing
over my face.

1955
02:48:34,646 --> 02:48:36,647
Don't put me in the dark.

1956
02:48:37,649 --> 02:48:39,859
I's afraid of the dark.

1957
02:48:49,953 --> 02:48:51,329
All right, John.

1958
02:49:11,725 --> 02:49:14,727
Heaven,
I'm in heaven

1959
02:49:14,812 --> 02:49:17,814
Heaven, heaven

1960
02:49:17,898 --> 02:49:19,649
I'm in heaven

1961
02:49:20,192 --> 02:49:22,735
Heaven, heaven

1962
02:49:23,278 --> 02:49:24,737
I'm in heaven

1963
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:26,781
Heaven

1964
02:49:27,741 --> 02:49:30,243
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1965
02:49:30,828 --> 02:49:35,957
I'm in heaven

1966
02:49:36,792 --> 02:49:41,003
Heaven

1967
02:49:45,843 --> 02:49:47,260
John Coffey,

1968
02:49:48,387 --> 02:49:50,012
electricity shall now be passed

1969
02:49:50,097 --> 02:49:51,681
through your body
until you are dead

1970
02:49:51,765 --> 02:49:53,599
in accordance with state law.

1971
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:59,564
May God have mercy on your soul.

1972
02:50:34,474 --> 02:50:35,516
Paul.

1973
02:50:38,729 --> 02:50:40,479
You have to say it.

1974
02:50:42,316 --> 02:50:44,442
You have to give the order.

1975
02:51:02,711 --> 02:51:05,004
He killed 'em
with they love.

1976
02:51:05,088 --> 02:51:09,175
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1977
02:51:23,690 --> 02:51:25,232
Roll on two.

1978
02:53:09,880 --> 02:53:12,548
It was the last
execution I ever took part in.

1979
02:53:13,425 --> 02:53:16,052
I just couldn't do it
anymore after that.

1980
02:53:16,136 --> 02:53:19,388
Brutal either.
We both transferred out,

1981
02:53:19,473 --> 02:53:22,391
took jobs with
Boys' Correctional.

1982
02:53:23,268 --> 02:53:24,894
It was all right.

1983
02:53:25,729 --> 02:53:28,230
"Catch them young"
became my motto.

1984
02:53:31,818 --> 02:53:33,110
You don't believe me.

1985
02:53:33,904 --> 02:53:36,530
I don't imagine
you'd lie to me, Paul.

1986
02:53:37,157 --> 02:53:39,575
It's just that...
it's quite a story.

1987
02:53:39,659 --> 02:53:41,368
It's quite a story.

1988
02:53:42,245 --> 02:53:44,705
One thing I don't understand.

1989
02:53:44,790 --> 02:53:50,002
You said you and Jan
had a grown son in 1935.

1990
02:53:50,587 --> 02:53:52,088
Is that right?

1991
02:53:52,547 --> 02:53:54,507
The math doesn't work, does it?

1992
02:54:00,180 --> 02:54:02,515
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1993
02:54:23,411 --> 02:54:24,662
Watch your step.

1994
02:54:25,413 --> 02:54:27,414
Now let your eyes adjust.

1995
02:54:39,553 --> 02:54:40,719
There.

1996
02:54:43,223 --> 02:54:47,059
Hey. Wake up,
old fella. Wake up.

1997
02:54:51,064 --> 02:54:54,817
Paul, it isn't. it can't be.

1998
02:54:59,322 --> 02:55:00,739
Come over here, boy.

1999
02:55:01,366 --> 02:55:03,576
Come on over here
and see this lady.

2000
02:55:06,580 --> 02:55:09,248
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

2001
02:55:32,189 --> 02:55:34,106
Go on, you can do it.

2002
02:55:41,781 --> 02:55:45,659
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

2003
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:50,414
But we make do.
Don't we, old fella?

2004
02:55:57,505 --> 02:56:00,424
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

2005
02:56:01,676 --> 02:56:06,055
I think when we electrocuted
Del, and it all went so badly...

2006
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:08,891
Well, John could
feel that, you know.

2007
02:56:09,392 --> 02:56:11,977
And I think a part of

2008
02:56:13,063 --> 02:56:15,731
whatever magic was inside of him

2009
02:56:15,815 --> 02:56:18,484
just leapt into
my tiny friend here.

2010
02:56:20,362 --> 02:56:21,987
As for me,

2011
02:56:23,448 --> 02:56:25,908
John had to give me
a part of himself,

2012
02:56:26,451 --> 02:56:28,744
a gift, the way he saw it,

2013
02:56:28,828 --> 02:56:31,789
so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

2014
02:56:34,668 --> 02:56:36,418
When John did that,

2015
02:56:38,463 --> 02:56:40,256
when he took my hand,

2016
02:56:41,758 --> 02:56:43,509
a part of the power

2017
02:56:44,094 --> 02:56:45,678
that worked through him

2018
02:56:46,513 --> 02:56:48,097
spilled into me.

2019
02:56:48,932 --> 02:56:50,182
He what?

2020
02:56:51,017 --> 02:56:54,645
He infected you with life?

2021
02:56:56,189 --> 02:56:58,274
It's as good a word as any.

2022
02:56:59,985 --> 02:57:04,029
He infected us both, didn't he, Mr.
Jingles? With life.

2023
02:57:08,702 --> 02:57:11,036
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

2024
02:57:11,997 --> 02:57:15,541
I was 44 the year that John
Coffey walked the Green Mile.

2025
02:57:19,212 --> 02:57:21,130
You mustn't blame John.

2026
02:57:21,673 --> 02:57:23,132
He couldn't help what happened.

2027
02:57:23,216 --> 02:57:26,510
He was...
He's just a force of nature.

2028
02:57:28,096 --> 02:57:31,890
Oh, I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

2029
02:57:33,518 --> 02:57:35,728
Another century come to pass.

2030
02:57:36,730 --> 02:57:38,063
But I've...

2031
02:57:39,274 --> 02:57:43,444
I've had to see my friends and loved
ones die off through the years.

2032
02:57:44,195 --> 02:57:45,779
Hal and Melinda,

2033
02:57:46,614 --> 02:57:48,115
Brutus Howell,

2034
02:57:48,199 --> 02:57:50,409
my wife, my boy.

2035
02:57:53,872 --> 02:57:55,456
And you, Elaine.

2036
02:57:56,791 --> 02:57:58,417
You'll die, too.

2037
02:57:59,961 --> 02:58:03,672
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

2038
02:58:05,884 --> 02:58:07,968
It's my atonement, you see.

2039
02:58:08,887 --> 02:58:10,554
It's my punishment

2040
02:58:10,847 --> 02:58:13,432
for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning,

2041
02:58:15,226 --> 02:58:17,436
for killing a miracle of God.

2042
02:58:19,356 --> 02:58:21,774
Almighty,
everlasting God,

2043
02:58:22,650 --> 02:58:24,610
the source of all
being and life...

2044
02:58:25,362 --> 02:58:29,114
You'll be gone like all the others.
I'll have to stay.

2045
02:58:31,534 --> 02:58:34,995
Oh, I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

2046
02:58:36,331 --> 02:58:39,458
I have no illusions
of immortality.

2047
02:58:40,627 --> 02:58:42,961
But I will have wished for death

2048
02:58:43,630 --> 02:58:45,714
long before death finds me.

2049
02:58:47,384 --> 02:58:50,344
In truth, I wish for it already.

2050
02:59:03,233 --> 02:59:04,650
Mr. Jingles?

2051
02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:15,953
Where you been, hmm?

2052
02:59:16,704 --> 02:59:20,833
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry, hmm?

2053
02:59:20,917 --> 02:59:23,252
Let's go see if we can't
find you something to eat.

2054
02:59:24,504 --> 02:59:26,255
A few crumbs anyway.

2055
02:59:26,339 --> 02:59:28,257
I know you'd like that.

2056
02:59:29,551 --> 02:59:31,552
Look at you. Mr. Jingles.

2057
02:59:32,637 --> 02:59:35,848
I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

2058
02:59:36,683 --> 02:59:38,058
And I wait.

2059
02:59:39,352 --> 02:59:42,438
I think about all
the people I've loved,

2060
02:59:42,522 --> 02:59:44,022
now long gone.

2061
02:59:45,483 --> 02:59:47,985
I think about my beautiful Jan,

2062
02:59:48,069 --> 02:59:50,487
how I lost her
so many years ago.

2063
02:59:52,365 --> 02:59:57,411
And I think about all of us
walking our own Green Mile,

2064
02:59:57,495 --> 02:59:59,288
each in our own time.

2065
03:00:01,082 --> 03:00:04,209
But one thought
more than any other

2066
03:00:04,294 --> 03:00:06,378
keeps me awake most nights.

2067
03:00:08,173 --> 03:00:11,425
If he could make
a mouse live so long,

2068
03:00:12,677 --> 03:00:14,720
how much longer do I have?

2069
03:00:19,142 --> 03:00:21,560
We each owe a death.

2070
03:00:22,145 --> 03:00:24,104
There are no exceptions.

2071
03:00:25,356 --> 03:00:26,815
But, oh, God,

2072
03:00:28,401 --> 03:00:30,068
sometimes,

2073
03:00:30,695 --> 03:00:33,530
the Green Mile seems so long.
