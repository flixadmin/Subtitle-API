1
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,035
They say,
if you wanna tell a story right,

2
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,828
you gotta start at the beginning.

3
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,251
Too far? Fine.

4
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,088
This is me, Harleen Quinzel.

5
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,174
When I was a kid, my dad traded me
for a six-pack of beer.

6
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,735
But however many times
he tried to ditch me...

7
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,927
Daddy!

8
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,595
- ...I kept coming back.
- Ah!

9
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,014
Eventually, he found me a new home.

10
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,099
The good sisters

11
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,685
of St. Bernadette's
taught me a lot.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,897
But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.

13
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,817
All things considered, I did good.

14
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,235
I even went to college.

15
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,945
Got my PhD.

16
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,989
Had my heart broken
once or twice.

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,199
Finding love, it's not easy.

18
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,535
So I threw myself into my work,

19
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,869
became a psychiatrist.

20
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,122
That's when I met him.

21
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,958
Mr. J. My Joker.

22
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,501
Oh, I fell hard.

23
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,170
Like out of a plane without a parachute,

24
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,439
right in your dumb fucking face

25
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,548
kinda hard.

26
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,134
I lost all sense of who I was.

27
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,845
I only had eyes for Puddin'.

28
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,471
We all know the saying,

29
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,140
"Behind every successful man,

30
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,683
there's a badass broad.”

31
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,560
Well that was me.

32
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,562
I was the brains
behind some of

33
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,230
- Mr. J's greatest stunts.
- Ha-ha!

34
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,815
Not that he let anyone know it.

35
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,941
Puddin'?

36
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,986
I guess all good things
have to come to an end.

37
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,614
So...

38
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,409
...we broke up.

39
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,913
I handled it real mature.

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,083
But Mr. J was super broke up about it.

41
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:13,133
I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.

42
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:20,223
It gave me the space to really reflect
on the mistakes of my past.

43
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,064
I had to find a new identity.

44
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,067
A new me.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,488
It wasn't easy.

46
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,449
But after a while,
I even opened myself up

47
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,077
to the possibility of new love.

48
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,122
Hi.

49
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,167
Hello, nice baby.

50
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,339
Here's the thing about new love...

51
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,466
I take payment-in-kind.

52
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,843
...you have to feed it.

53
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,357
Soon enough, I was back on my feet.

54
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,069
Ready to move on, to make new friends.

55
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,030
She means fucking business!

56
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,615
- Oh, here we go!
- Whip me!

57
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,325
She has taken
a whip from the pivot,

58
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,244
catapulted to the high side!

59
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,954
Oh!

60
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,839
Yeah! Come on!

61
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,801
It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,

62
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,679
so I really put myself out there.

63
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,515
Ride that pole
like you ride your man!

64
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,148
God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.

65
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,524
What?

66
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,278
I said sit your skinny ass down,
you dumb slut.

67
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,612
Okay.

68
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,910
You broke my fucking legs!

69
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,662
Oh, boo-hoo.

70
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,792
What?

71
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,546
It's not a party without a little drama,
am I right?

72
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,090
Come on! Turn it up!

73
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,384
Shots on the house.

74
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,180
Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.

75
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,599
- Miss Quinn.
- Romy.

76
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,058
That was my driver.

77
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,393
Oh, whoops.

78
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,767
Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.

79
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,980
Consider me grateful.

80
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,815
Especially since
I know you don't like me.

81
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,194
I agitate his already delicate sense
of mental equilibrium.

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,405
That and his obsessive-compulsive need
to be the center of attention.

83
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,574
Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?

84
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,536
Not tonight, Romy. Not tonight.

85
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,415
Well, enjoy yourself, Miss Quinn.
And do give the Joker my best.

86
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,292
Okay, fine, so I hadn't

87
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,519
told people about the breakup.

88
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,212
But you don't understand.

89
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,671
Find me a new driver.

90
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,841
Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.

91
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,095
I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,

92
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,015
and no one ever dared to object.

93
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,935
Two for one
You know a bitch buy four

94
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,020
And two left feet
You know I always drop

95
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,730
First thing a girl did
Was a bop

96
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,774
I'm the whole damn cake
And the cherry on top

97
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,193
Shook up the bottom
Made a good girl pop

98
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,671
You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club tryna pipe a Barbie

99
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,322
And don't let him give you shit, okay?

100
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,241
You have to stick up for yourself.

101
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,160
I don't wanna
Row, row, row the boat

102
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,120
Wrist full of rocks
And I hope I float

103
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,914
Big up yourself
'Cause you know they don't

104
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,677
I chew, chew, chew
'Cause they hope I choke

105
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,668
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss

106
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,711
I'm a bitch and a boss
And I shine like gloss

107
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,505
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss

108
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,382
I'm a bitch and a boss
And I shine like gloss

109
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,217
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss

110
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,945
I'm a bitch and a boss
And I shine like gloss

111
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,679
Oh, please.
I give it a few days

112
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,922
before they're back together.

113
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,598
Even when I did
try and tell people,

114
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,850
they didn't believe me.

115
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,285
Come on.
She told me they're really

116
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,477
broken up this time.

117
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,104
Sure they are, Shell.

118
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,648
That's why she's still wearing
that tacky "J" necklace.

119
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,694
She is going to be running
right back into his arms

120
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,070
the minute he snaps his fingers.

121
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,364
If not him,
the next closest alpha male

122
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,532
- with a pulse.
- Mmm-hmm.

123
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,742
Some people just aren't born

124
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,178
- to stand on their own.
- Oh, girl,

125
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,596
- let's drink. Come on.
- All right.

126
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,955
I knew I needed to find

127
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,164
some way to show the world

128
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,334
that I'd cut ties with Mr. J for good.

129
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,627
Harley!

130
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,174
Some people have the
Eiffel Tower, or Olive Garden.

131
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,426
The Joker and I?

132
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:28,763
Our love bloomed in a highly toxic
industrial processing plant.

133
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,521
And luckily for me,

134
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,648
I have all my best ideas drunk.

135
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,611
I have the best ideal!

136
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,788
The fuck?
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

137
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,259
This is where it all began, Pudding.

138
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,721
You motherfucker!

139
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,042
It was the closure I needed.

140
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,543
A fresh start.

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,671
A chance to be my own woman.

142
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,104
But I wasn't the only dame
in Gotham looking for emancipation.

143
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,191
This is our story.

144
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,238
And I'm telling it, so I'll start
where I fucking want.

145
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,908
Meet the cop.

146
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,576
I got 50 says it was turf war.

147
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,744
Not him.

148
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,431
Well, as always, you're wrong, Munroe.

149
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,623
Her. Renee Montoya.

150
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,002
Raised on '80s cop shows,
she's always saying cheesy shit like...

151
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,753
There was only one shooter.

152
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,588
Inside.

153
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,882
This guy shot out the glass.

154
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,092
Serrano.

155
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,927
Yo. Hey.

156
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,865
Have Ballistics check for a bullet
in one of those parked cars.

157
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,767
Ten years ago,
she broke a career-making case.

158
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,561
- Did I stutter?
- Go ahead.

159
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,230
But her partner at the time
took all the credit.

160
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,648
So while he made captain,

161
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,109
she got stuck at detective level
with this idiot.

162
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,069
Okay, you think one guy got all four?

163
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,154
Wait, wait, wait.

164
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,531
I'm just saying, we got
four dead bodies here, you know.

165
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,494
- One guy... Bullet holes.
- I'm trying to work.

166
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,494
I'm sorry.
Go ahead and work. Go ahead.

167
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,377
The shooter got close before drawing.
Six rounds.

168
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,254
Two for each of these three.

169
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,589
Yo, mind your debt.

170
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,067
- I'm telling you.
- That girl, Angelina, she's a princess.

171
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,259
- Whoa. Hey.
- Look at this.

172
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,902
- Is it Halloween?
- Hey. How you doing?

173
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,483
And it wasn't about them.

174
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,278
It was all about this guy, right here.

175
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,367
Do you know who I am?

176
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,370
You fucking bitch.

177
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,299
And this arrow through his throat...

178
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,804
She wanted him to die slowly.

179
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,056
- She?
- We got a hair.

180
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,642
And he's got a new assassin.

181
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,810
Who does?

182
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,022
Roman Beauvais Sionis.

183
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,274
Jesus Christ.

184
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,735
This is Montoya. What the hell was that?

185
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,114
Shit.

186
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,366
Wow.

187
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,701
- Detective.
- Yep?

188
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,411
Found this necklace.

189
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,249
Holy shit.

190
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,960
Good work, Officer.

191
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:28,837
What is it?

192
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,091
Harley Quinn and the Joker broke up.

193
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,384
What?

194
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,094
This was their spot.

195
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,097
She just publicly updated
her relationship status.

196
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,434
Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.

197
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,186
She did not think this one through.

198
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,605
Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.

199
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,068
I'm about to learn that a lot of people
in this city want me dead.

200
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,446
And at the top of that list is this guy.

201
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,076
Mr. Keo
and his lovely wife and daughter.

202
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,787
You kinda forced my hand here.

203
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,206
Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.

204
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,463
I gave you a great pitch. Didn't I?

205
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,967
And I thought-- Shh!

206
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,555
I thought we could
build something beautiful together.

207
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,390
I thought we could be family.

208
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,198
I'm gonna set you free.

209
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,533
Mmm...

210
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,206
What about her?

211
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,837
I think we can let her go.

212
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,757
I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.

213
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,514
Baby. Aww.

214
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,433
Don't cry.

215
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,313
Thank you.
Thank you.

216
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,689
You're welcome.

217
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,318
Is that a snot bubble?

218
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,612
- Ew. Gross.
- What?

219
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,198
Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.

220
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,325
No. No!

221
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,120
The wack job with the penchant

222
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,040
for peeling faces
is Roman Sionis,

223
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,166
aka

224
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,085
Black Mask.

225
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,508
The fact that he wants me dead
hasn't yet hit my radar.

226
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,386
See, I was halfway across town,

227
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,889
hungover, and thinking about breakfast.

228
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:51,145
Egg, bacon, American cheese.

229
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,484
Soft, toasted buttered roll.

230
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,112
Just a dash of hot sauce.

231
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,655
Not too much, Sal.

232
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,949
I wanna taste the cheese.

233
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,952
What a way to start my new life.

234
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,416
With the perfect egg sandwich.

235
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,084
Mmm!

236
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,212
You're a lifesaver, Sal.

237
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,884
And I'm good for the 75 cents, okay?
I promise.

238
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,096
That's all the money
I got in the world,

239
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,889
and it's so worth it.

240
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,271
I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,

241
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,816
or the fact that his cheese slices
are always six months out of date,

242
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,570
but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.

243
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,697
I mean it, Sal. No one.

244
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,298
Freeze! Gotham PD.

245
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,051
Yeah, I don't think so.

246
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,844
Are you fucking kidding me?

247
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,933
Yo! Police.

248
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,102
It had been six short hours

249
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,314
since my little stunt at Ace Chemicals
announced to the world

250
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,108
that Mr. J and I were dunzo.

251
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,029
The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.

252
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,616
Cops who never would've dared
come after me before

253
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,659
were suddenly doing this.

254
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,292
Ooh!

255
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,585
Freeze!

256
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,170
- And what's worse?
- Move!

257
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,506
Every person I ever wronged
now felt free

258
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,109
to come and take their pound of flesh.

259
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,236
Turns out I wronged a lot of people.

260
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,990
Come on, boy. Get him!

261
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,451
Oh...

262
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,467
Finally.

263
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:36,978
And then...

264
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,463
We're gonna
get through this, okay?

265
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,939
...tragedy struck.

266
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:54,579
It took losing something I truly love

267
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,582
for me to see
that the target on my back

268
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,916
was bigger than I thought.

269
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,086
Freeze.

270
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,422
With the walls
closing in around me,

271
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,507
I made a carefully calculated,

272
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,718
highly strategic move.

273
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,688
Fine. It was dumb luck. But still...

274
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,064
That felt pretty great.

275
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,529
Sorry for busting in on you like that,
but thanks for the shortcut.

276
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,989
See ya. Oh!

277
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,116
There she is.

278
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,576
Harley Quinn.

279
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,328
Yeah?

280
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,705
I've waited a long time for this.

281
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,582
You have?

282
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,125
Oh...

283
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,419
I haven't had breakfast yet.

284
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,297
What did I do to you?

285
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,924
Are you serious?

286
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,635
Look at my face.

287
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,846
Look at my face!

288
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,062
Oh...

289
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,106
That wasn't me.

290
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,942
But you dared him to do it.

291
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,587
Yeah, but I dare a lot of people
to do a lot of things, okay?

292
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,655
- Come on. I'm not even with him anymore.
- I know.

293
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,698
That means

294
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,535
there's no one here to stop me.

295
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,764
- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.

296
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,081
Ooh. A penny.

297
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,838
They're shooting arrows now?

298
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,433
Ah, crap.

299
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,935
Him, too?

300
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,238
Parley?

301
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,078
Fuck, Montoya,
you smell like a dead rat's asshole.

302
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,288
Not today, Simpson.

303
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,832
Hey, it's Detective Montoya.
Respect your elders.

304
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,917
I mean, your elderly.

305
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,688
You're only a few years younger than me,
and you're still behind that desk.

306
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,963
You wanna go there?

307
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,090
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

308
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,509
Cassandra Cain,
back already?

309
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,679
Thought by now you'd figure out
how not to get caught.

310
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,348
What? No comeback?

311
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,270
You all right?

312
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,189
You smell like shit.

313
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,444
Yo, Simpson.

314
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,405
Any clean clothes in lost and found?

315
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,328
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

316
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,165
The Sionis family name is on
half the museums and schools in Gotham.

317
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,709
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

318
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,379
Montoya's day is going
almost as badly as mine.

319
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,715
Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?

320
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
That's him.

321
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,052
He had four people killed
alone last night.

322
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,054
If Roman Sionis is such a mastermind,

323
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,139
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

324
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,184
The Janus Corporation is
his father's company, thank you.

325
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,144
And by the way, they cut him off.

326
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,147
Where does the DA's office stand
on all this?

327
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,523
To make matters worse,

328
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,359
the assistant DA?
That's her ex.

329
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,778
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders--

330
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,446
There's a shipment coming in.

331
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,989
Drugs?

332
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,449
- A diamond.
- A diamond.

333
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,493
Wow, Montoya. Should we call
the Feds for backup?

334
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,745
Listen,
I had a source at the club.

335
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,829
His driver.

336
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,099
He said that Roman
couldn't stop talking about this thing.

337
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,518
And he said that he overheard something
about laser-encoding.

338
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,919
Now, I did some research.

339
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,588
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.

340
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,341
You remember
the Bertinelli massacre, right?

341
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,926
Quick history lesson.

342
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,844
Fifteen years ago, one of the wealthiest

343
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,514
Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.

344
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,141
It was a power grab,
but the real target

345
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,729
was the Bertinellis'
super-secret offshore bank accounts,

346
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,540
the details of which
were said to be encoded

347
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,026
in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.

348
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,861
The rock was lost.

349
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,156
And with it,
the only key to the Bertinelli fortune.

350
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,786
Which is exactly why Roman Sionis
is trying to get his hands on it.

351
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,830
That's what makes him so dangerous.

352
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,540
He's already building an army.

353
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,916
If he gets the diamond,

354
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,559
he'll have all the money
and connections

355
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,922
to bribe every single judge and cop
he needs to get a monopoly on the city.

356
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,966
You said you had someone on the inside?

357
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,719
Yes. He's...

358
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,840
He's no longer there, but...

359
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,556
So basically, you have nothing.

360
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,142
You are trying to go after

361
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,978
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

362
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,147
and all you've got
is rumors and a hunch?

363
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,982
Well, you know,

364
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,105
the DA's office is building
a case against him, too.

365
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,485
Isn't that right, Miss Yee?

366
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,654
Listen, if the DA is
willing to throw himself

367
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,282
out in front of this, it's fine with me.

368
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,491
Captain, no.

369
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,871
Listen, Munroe, find me some tangible
connection to Sionis, all right?

370
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,998
- Yes, Sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

371
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,416
This is my case, okay?

372
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,183
I've been working on this
for six months.

373
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:56,213
We need something that
we can actually use, Detective.

374
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,883
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

375
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,972
- Look, I'm sorry about that, but I--
- No.

376
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,225
That is my job you are fucking with.
What is wrong with you, Renee?

377
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,935
Me? He gave my case away.

378
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,103
Oh, poor Renee.

379
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,123
Why don't you pour yourself a drink?
It's almost noon.

380
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,148
Wow.

381
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,987
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

382
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,197
Why the fuck haven't you

383
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,175
been picking up your phone?
We've got a situation.

384
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,533
What... What situation?

385
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,951
You didn't hear this from me,

386
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,204
but you gotta find her
before someone else does.

387
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,610
She's got the diamond,
and trust me, Roman will kill her.

388
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,375
- My diamond? Who? Who's got it?
- This kid.

389
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,504
She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

390
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,589
Holy fuck.

391
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,309
Can I help you?

392
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,811
Why, yes. Yes, you can.

393
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,063
I'm here to report a terrible crime.

394
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,942
And what terrible crime is that?

395
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,487
This one.

396
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,172
Hi, boys.

397
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,512
Meeting's over.

398
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,197
Run, piggy, run.

399
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,999
Where can I find Cassandra Cain?

400
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,712
Hold up, hold up.
I'm telling this all wrong.

401
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,880
Let's rewind.

402
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,508
For you to understand why me, the cop,
and that dame on the toilet...

403
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,801
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

404
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,554
...are all looking
for this Cain character...

405
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,806
I gotta take you back a few days,

406
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,644
to that night I got shitfaced
at the Black Mask Club.

407
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:04,318
This is a man's world

408
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:11,992
This is a man's world

409
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,827
This is Dinah Lance.

410
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,996
But it would be nothing

411
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,623
But she prefers Black Canary.

412
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,001
Nothing

413
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,670
She's got a killer voice.

414
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,255
Without a woman or a girl

415
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,715
But there was some other shit

416
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,800
going down that night.

417
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,343
...short notice like this.

418
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,762
I'm not talking
superficial partnerships.

419
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:35,975
I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.

420
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,895
The Golden Lions can't just
wander into Gotham National Bank.

421
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,480
I can.

422
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,024
Loans, liquidity, laundering.

423
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,194
Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,

424
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,572
there are no limits
to what we could achieve together.

425
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,492
I'm building something special.

426
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,370
I appreciate your offer, Mr. Sionis.

427
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:01,792
But with all due respect,
the Golden Lions are a family business.

428
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,587
Fuck family.
All due respect, but fuck that.

429
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,874
Family's a fucking illusion.

430
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,216
You know what my family gave me?
Nothing.

431
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,010
I know what everyone says.

432
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:15,139
"Here comes Roman Sionis.
He was handed life on a silver spoon."

433
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,224
"Gin and tonics at 5:00."
"'l have the duck."

434
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,935
Blah, blah, blah. Fake fucking fucks.

435
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,148
But look at me now.

436
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,692
I've located the Bertinelli diamond.

437
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,694
I'm about to own this city.

438
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,612
Not just the East End.

439
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,573
I am thinking big, baby.

440
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,658
And I want you there with me.

441
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,661
We could make our own family.

442
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:38,871
Mr. Sionis,

443
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,082
the Golden Lions have operated in Gotham
for nearly 100 years.

444
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,086
We have no need of your protection.

445
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,881
He's gonna regret that.

446
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,017
Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?

447
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,727
Run it by
that beautiful wife of yours,

448
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,271
and I'll come see you at the docks,
day after tomorrow.

449
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,522
Okay?

450
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:16,325
This is a man's world

451
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,160
It would be nothing

452
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,038
Without a woman or a girl

453
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,375
Who's having a good time?
You are.

454
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,044
Lost in the wilderness

455
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,378
Food is good?

456
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,089
Do you need any more cocktails?

457
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,340
Lost in the bitterness

458
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,175
Your good health.

459
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,928
He's lost in the loneliness

460
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,515
He's lost

461
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,976
This is a man's world

462
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,271
It wouldn't be nothing

463
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:59,368
Without a woman or a girl

464
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,790
Canary's been singing
at Roman's club for years.

465
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:05,958
Come on!

466
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,793
He calls her his little bird,

467
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,588
and he's got her wrapped
right around his fancy little finger.

468
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,179
- Here you go, Canary.
- Thank you.

469
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,142
How do you spell "mercenary"?

470
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,394
Merceninny...

471
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,729
Merceran?

472
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,446
Singer lady woman!

473
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,449
You're really, really good.

474
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,951
Yeah.

475
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,334
Know what a harlequin is?

476
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,881
Janky-ass clown with bad eye makeup?

477
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,507
Oof!

478
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,551
Ouch!

479
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,473
A harlequin's role

480
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,643
is to serve.

481
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,979
An audience.

482
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,523
A master.

483
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,446
You know, a harlequin's
nothing without a master.

484
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:24,369
And no one gives two fucks
who we are beyond that.

485
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,173
Yeah, I don't know who you think I am,
lady, but I'm not her.

486
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,802
Puddin' and I broke up.

487
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,562
I haven't told that to anyone.

488
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,565
Yeah.

489
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,901
For good this time.

490
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,281
And for the first time in a long time,

491
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,701
I'm all on my lonesome.

492
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,916
It's great.

493
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,088
Welcome to the club.

494
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,548
Thanks.

495
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,761
Hey, don't be lonesome.
How about another drink?

496
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,638
- Yes!
- Yeah?

497
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,306
- Yeah.
- It's on me.

498
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,892
- Sure. Drinks!
- Hey, two shots.

499
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,272
Hey.

500
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,325
We're all good here.

501
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,091
- I don't wanna go home.
- Oh, no? No.

502
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,634
No.

503
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,847
Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.

504
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,808
Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.

505
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,018
Are we getting breakfast?

506
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,811
Hey, buddy,
I'm gonna need some help.

507
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,438
This is my friend.

508
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,647
I told you all about...

509
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,292
Hey, get the door, man.
I got her, I got her.

510
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,151
- There we go.
- Wait.

511
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,278
Isn't that Joker's girl?

512
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,446
Not anymore.

513
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,739
Got room for one more?

514
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,906
Hey.

515
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,284
Huh?

516
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,123
I don't need your help. I got this.

517
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,959
You got this? You sure about that?

518
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,420
Yeah, no wonder everyone hates you.

519
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,633
Uh...

520
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:54,894
You got this!

521
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,857
You motherfucker!

522
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,902
Whoo!

523
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,367
Well, well, well,
well, well, well.

524
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,745
Could that be our little Miss Lance?

525
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:16,416
All these years, I thought she was just
a pretty face and a fine set of lungs.

526
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,044
Ooh.

527
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:24,299
Mr. Zsasz, I've had an amazing idea.

528
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,142
That's my little bird.

529
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,440
Don't touch
what you can't afford, mister.

530
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,817
Shut up.

531
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,196
Oh, songbird.

532
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,949
You drive as good as you fight?

533
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,994
Who's asking?

534
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,579
The boss.

535
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,540
You're getting promoted.

536
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,169
You're his new driver.

537
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,923
Huh. Thanks, but I think I'm good
with the singing gig.

538
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,925
You'll be good at the driving gig.

539
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:12,389
Be here tomorrow. 9:00 a.m. Sharp.

540
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,058
So, that's how Canary
got herself a job

541
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,477
driving around
Gotham's newest Godfather.

542
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,314
A position, I might add,
that wouldn't have been vacant

543
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,025
without the help of yours truly.

544
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,864
Red for the light
Gotta stop this thing

545
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,366
Find a song to sing
That is everything

546
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,451
Morning.

547
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,494
That I meant to say

548
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:39,040
I meant to say

549
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,380
You're
the one who wanted the kid!

550
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,132
I never wanted her!

551
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,136
Let me guess. Parents?

552
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,054
Foster parents.

553
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,222
Right.

554
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,766
Sorry, kid.

555
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,561
Sorry about your face.

556
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,731
Shit, you do have something
on your face.

557
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,067
You should've seen
the other guy.

558
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:09,613
Uh...

559
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,657
I want
that kid out of my fucking house!

560
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,160
You know, Kid, not every day
is gonna be like this.

561
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,163
You just gotta hang in there.

562
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,837
Get something to eat.

563
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,133
Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.

564
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,227
Don't talk to me like that.

565
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,731
Canary spends the next week

566
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,443
settling in to her new job
as Roman's personal driver.

567
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,329
Ew. Okay.

568
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,499
What she didn't know
is that driving Mr. Face-peely-pants

569
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,001
was gonna put her
right in the crosshairs

570
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,379
of my favorite little piggy.

571
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,256
Dinah Lance?

572
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,715
Who the hell are you?

573
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,135
I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.

574
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:20,350
Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.

575
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,227
Oh, really?

576
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:26,231
He told me that there was
a shipment coming in. A diamond.

577
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,733
A very special diamond.

578
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,113
Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.

579
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,598
Do you know who you're working for?

580
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,762
You're damn right, I do.
He's the man who gave me a job.

581
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,121
Took me off the streets.

582
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,957
Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.

583
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,793
A criminal. A murderer.

584
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,480
What would your mother think of
you working for a guy like that?

585
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,716
You have the same power she had.

586
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,642
Don't you think
she would want you to use it?

587
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,469
The hell do you know about my mother?

588
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,598
Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.

589
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,683
- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.

590
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,519
She was a damn good woman.

591
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,814
The kind of woman who put
everyone else's lives before her own.

592
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,151
And when she was found
dead in the street,

593
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,654
where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?

594
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,242
Now you wanna come and knock on my door
and ask me to help you out

595
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,620
and make the same mistake she did?

596
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,207
Yeah. Good luck with that.

597
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,044
That's fair enough.

598
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,588
And I'm sorry for your loss.

599
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,424
For the record,

600
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,803
that would never happen on my watch.

601
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,725
The Sprang Bridge
Soldiers capituated.

602
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,645
"Capitulated."
Of course they did.

603
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,938
I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.

604
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,108
It sure did, boss.

605
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,152
It sure fucking did.

606
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,529
Crossbow Killer

607
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,240
struck again last night.

608
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,534
Rossi and four of his guys.

609
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,537
People don't kill people I own
without my permission.

610
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,539
Why doesn't this crossbow guy know that?

611
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,166
- You know that!
- I know it.

612
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,294
Why doesn't this crossbow guy?
Why don't I own the crossbow guy?

613
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,630
- You should own him.
- mean, I like crossbows.

614
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,174
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.

615
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,385
- Morning.
- Come in. Come in.

616
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,012
We're just finishing up
a little business. Look around.

617
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,139
- You're late.
- It's fine.

618
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,242
Should she come back another time,
'cause she's late?

619
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,102
No. Isn't this stunning?

620
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,856
That is a Chokwe mask.

621
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,235
I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe

622
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,404
in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?

623
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,655
- I've never been.
- Mmm.

624
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,778
I've heard it's beautiful.

625
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,491
- It's dirty.
- Oh...

626
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,578
Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.

627
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,247
Shuar of Ecuador.

628
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,974
They're amazing people.
Surprisingly gentle.

629
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,000
- I think you might like them.
- Really?

630
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,253
Mmm. They boil the heads
of their enemies

631
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,088
and they make
these little fellas.

632
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,965
- Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
- Mmm-hmm.

633
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,260
Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.

634
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,220
- Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
- Wow.

635
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,156
And now he's just an ornament
in my living room.

636
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,224
- Ew! I love it.
- Yeah?

637
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,017
These are ancient acupuncture models.

638
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,729
As you can see,
they have all the acupuncture points.

639
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,898
And we found these
buried in the mountains.

640
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,985
Ace Chemicals
got blown sky high last night.

641
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,528
All right, all right,

642
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,211
let's find the Crossbow Killer.
I get it.

643
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,741
Is he an acupuncture model, too?

644
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,910
He is not an acupuncture model.
This is a statue of me.

645
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,797
It was made by a very famous
Gotham artist--

646
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,539
Harley Quinn did it.

647
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,834
Some kind of "fuck you" to the Joker.

648
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,586
They split.

649
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,630
What's wrong with you, Victor?

650
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,468
- Talk about burying the lede.
- Yeah.

651
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,928
This is spectacular news!

652
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,848
She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.

653
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,141
Have the boys go find her.

654
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,393
Round her up, bring her back.
I want her.

655
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,437
You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.

656
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,856
Something super-duper important, okay?

657
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,274
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

658
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,201
- Yeah, go with Victor.
- It's just a pickup.

659
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,694
No, he's harmless.

660
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,654
Do as you're told. Go.

661
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,004
All right. We can go.

662
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,506
I'll take that.

663
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,072
Mr. S said for me to hold on to it.

664
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,967
Go get your car.

665
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,723
That rock.
That rock's about to become the key

666
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,352
to whether or not I live
to enjoy my newfound independence.

667
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,440
Get off me.

668
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,067
What the hell are you doing here?

669
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,819
You're not the only one
who makes money

670
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,821
off of dumb, rich, white people.

671
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,113
Well, you know what?

672
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,241
One day you're gonna
pick the wrong pocket, sis.

673
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,535
Okay. Whatever.

674
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,498
Dumb-ass kids.

675
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,210
Excuse me. Sorry.

676
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,471
I really like your earrings.

677
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,598
Why, thank you.

678
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,102
There's the thief. There's the thief.

679
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:17,897
Get off of me!

680
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,567
That little girl took my watch.

681
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,402
I didn't do nothing.

682
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,340
Where the fuck's the diamond?

683
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,866
I just fucking had it.

684
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,450
Cass!

685
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,037
Wait!

686
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,414
Wait, wait!

687
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,208
Halt!

688
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,043
Fuck!

689
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,398
In the storytelling business,

690
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,693
this dummy swallowing that diamond

691
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,487
is called a complication.

692
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:11,159
A complication
I didn't exactly need right now.

693
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,163
Parley?

694
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,418
We lost the diamond.

695
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,628
What?

696
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,504
We're really sorry, Mr. S. This kid--

697
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,798
We never even got our hands on it.

698
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,217
Ow!

699
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,304
Help!

700
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,389
Get out! Get out of here!

701
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,809
You, too! Go! With your fucking sage
stinking my place up.

702
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:37,976
Fuck off!

703
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,187
Here she is.

704
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,939
She's a child!

705
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,166
- Mr. Sionis.
- She's just a kid.

706
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,191
She's... What?

707
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,610
We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.

708
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,070
Fuck off! Get out.

709
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,696
Fucking out!

710
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,406
Fuck! These are my things.

711
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,075
- This diamond is my things.
- Yes.

712
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,241
My things!

713
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,453
Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?

714
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,289
- No.
- Why is this happening to me? Why?

715
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,918
I'm gonna get your diamond back.

716
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,253
I promise.

717
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:09,550
Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?

718
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,845
Blow off a little steam.

719
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,140
Yeah, I have wanted to do that
for quite some time.

720
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,687
Okay. I'll go get changed.

721
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,620
Shit, Cass.

722
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,045
I don't care what it takes,
I want my diamond back.

723
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,381
We're working on it.

724
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,217
Now, let's go have a little fun.

725
00:41:56,222 --> 00:42:00,768
Harleen Quinzel.

726
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,186
Whoo!

727
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,856
Hiya, Romy.

728
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,110
Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?

729
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,778
When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,

730
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,364
there are a lot of possible answers
to this question.

731
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,824
Breaking his driver's legs.

732
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,385
There's that time
I called it an "expresso.”

733
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,619
Having a vagina in the first place
pisses this guy off.

734
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,710
Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.

735
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,129
- You're here because--
- Oh, God, stop.

736
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,381
You're gonna do that thing
where you open up

737
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,008
a weird-ass case of torture devices

738
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,552
while inexplicably
detailing your master plan

739
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,928
and how I don't fit into it.

740
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,931
- I'm building a better--
- Seriously, you don't have to. Really!

741
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,558
You're building a criminal empire

742
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,077
because Daddy kicked you out
of Janus Corp.

743
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,954
And you think this is a big "fuck you,"
but in actuality

744
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,914
it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.

745
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,275
I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.

746
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,502
And you're really not as clever
as you think,

747
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,360
because now I'm gonna slice your--

748
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,571
Oh, Jesus Christmas.

749
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,907
Now you're gonna say
that you wanna kill me

750
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,784
to set an example.
Christ, you're boring.

751
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,495
- I wanna kill you...
- Shit.

752
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,789
...because without the Joker around,

753
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,958
I can.

754
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,090
For all your noise and bluster,

755
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,343
you're just a silly little girl
with no one around to protect her.

756
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,933
- Whoa. Wait.
- What?

757
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,684
- Don't kill me.
- Ha! Right.

758
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,394
No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.

759
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,271
Come on. There's gotta be something,

760
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,148
something we can figure out. Hey!

761
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,567
Wait, wait! You lost something, right?

762
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,670
You lost something.
I heard you say it.

763
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,695
A diamond.

764
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,494
Yeah.

765
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,039
I can help you find it.

766
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,167
Seriously.
Look in my pocket.

767
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,630
Other pocket.

768
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,169
I'm starting up my own business.

769
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,491
See what it says?
Second from the bottom.

770
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,816
I know the East End better than anybody.

771
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,736
You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.

772
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,240
Mr. J once lost a rare photograph
of a nude Eleanor Roosevelt,

773
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,701
and I found it in a bird's nest
in Robinson Park.

774
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,953
If you let me go,

775
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,957
just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.

776
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,244
What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,

777
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,128
swear to God,
you can kill me later.

778
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,672
Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.

779
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,215
You're so tiresome!

780
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,510
If you want my mercy,

781
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,555
shut that hole in the middle
of your face and listen.

782
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,683
You're gonna
get me my diamond.

783
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:56,527
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental

784
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,323
But diamonds are
a girl's best friend

785
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,160
A kiss may be grand

786
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:08,247
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat

787
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,292
Or help you at the automat

788
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,504
Diamonds

789
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:16,756
I will be waiting.

790
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,840
Diamonds

791
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:18,966
Diamonds

792
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,176
The diamond.

793
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,928
Diamonds

794
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,179
Romy, Roman.

795
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,765
I will be waiting.

796
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,018
But diamonds

797
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,729
Diamonds are a girl's best

798
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,818
I'll give you till midnight.

799
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,114
And then I'm gonna peel off
that pretty face

800
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,991
and pickle it.

801
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,910
Okay?

802
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,665
Call me old-fashioned,

803
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,043
but I always thought the guy
was meant to get the girl a diamond.

804
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,134
I won't let you down, Romy. I promise.

805
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,220
Let's make it half a mil.

806
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,472
It's more fun if she's got competition.

807
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,433
Send it to every mercenary in Gotham.

808
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,936
Oh, hey, you're that singer
no one listens to.

809
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,313
Hey, you're the asshole no one likes.

810
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,792
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

811
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,085
We've got a situation.

812
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,628
This kid,
she's got the diamond.

813
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,588
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

814
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,132
Holy fuck.

815
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,345
Where can I find Cassandra Cain?

816
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,306
Okay. Now we're good.

817
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,060
Cell seven.

818
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,484
Thanks, doll. You're a peach.

819
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,238
Hey, I know that guy.

820
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,135
Access denied. Access denied.

821
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,137
Access denied. Access denied.

822
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,890
Access denied.
Access denied. Denied.

823
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,726
Denied. Denied. Denied.
Denied. Denied. Denied.

824
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,773
Hmm. Perfect.

825
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,247
Hold up, hold up.

826
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,249
- Remember me?
- She stole my car!

827
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,667
- Harley Quinn.
- Hey, Quinn!

828
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,604
- Let us out, see what happens.
- Don't mind me, guys.

829
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,505
- You killed my chinchilla!
- Here for the kid.

830
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,590
What's up, girl?
You're the reason I'm in here!

831
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,384
Yeah, sorry about that.

832
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,760
You're dead!

833
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,883
I'm gonna kill you, Quinn!

834
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,304
Hey, kid.

835
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,264
You're that psycho

836
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,492
- from the roller derby.
- Yeah, yeah.

837
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:14,934
Are you Cassandra Cain?

838
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,268
Yeah.

839
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,365
I need to know where--

840
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,669
Hold, please.

841
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,295
Harley--

842
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,481
Let you think you get the picture

843
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,299
Bitch, you don't know
How good I treat ya

844
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,177
Shake it off
This pride and glory

845
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,013
You dig up so many stories

846
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,724
Oh, you're so under the thumb

847
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,561
Four fingers from a knuckle sandwich

848
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,147
Try my blood
It's just a starter

849
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,150
No one tastes like me, yeah

850
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:08,529
I'm pretty like a car crash

851
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,073
Ugly as a lullaby

852
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,784
You really wanna try it

853
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,370
Experiment on me

854
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,581
Experiment on me

855
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,375
Experiment on me

856
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,212
Experiment on me

857
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,127
Hmm.

858
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,799
I got you, you little shit.

859
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,385
Who are you guys?

860
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,180
Go, go, go.

861
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,643
Keep the kid alive.

862
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,286
Mmm!

863
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:29,920
Whoa Black Betty, bam-ba-lam

864
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,630
Yeah Black Betty, bam-ba-lam

865
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,799
Black Betty had a child, bam-ba-lam

866
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,175
Damn thing gone wild, bam-ba-lam

867
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,428
She's always ready, bam-ba-lam

868
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,430
She's all rock steady, bam-ba-lam

869
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,931
Whoa Black Betty, bam-ba-lam

870
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,601
Yeah Black Betty, bam-ba-lam

871
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,440
All right

872
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,745
Whoa Black Betty, bam-ba-lam

873
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,538
Go Black Betty, bam-ba-lam

874
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,582
Really gets me high, bam-ba-lam

875
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,306
Oh, yeah

876
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,390
A little help.

877
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:24,849
All right

878
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,686
All right

879
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,314
Oh, yeah

880
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,565
Mmm...

881
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,649
All right

882
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,444
Oh, yeah

883
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,078
Does she have to keep running?

884
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,859
Roman, you trustafarian fuck bag.

885
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,154
You!

886
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,364
You!

887
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,116
Step away from the kid.

888
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,326
Drop it.

889
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,120
The phone?

890
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,996
Sure.

891
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,053
Mmm.

892
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,408
Whoa.

893
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,368
Oh, good. You're awake.

894
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,245
Toss that for me, will ya?

895
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,052
What the fuck?

896
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,971
Who did I just blow up?

897
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,056
Either someone who wants me dead,

898
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,475
or someone looking to collect

899
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,278
the half-million dollar reward
on your head.

900
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,479
Half a million dollars?

901
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:34,897
Yeah.

902
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,483
Do I look like I'm
worth half a million dollars?

903
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,860
- Not really.
- You've got the wrong kid.

904
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,820
Now, uncuff me.

905
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,739
Oh, sure.

906
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,216
As soon as you give me the diamond.

907
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,867
What diamond?

908
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,583
Fuck you!

909
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,544
Look at me.

910
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,757
What?

911
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,051
I don't know nothing about no diamond.

912
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,529
The inflection in your voice,
the way you can't hold eye contact,

913
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,515
and the fact that you're a filthy
little thief, all suggest that you do.

914
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,100
Now, you can give it to me,
or I can give you

915
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,727
to the man that diamond belongs to.

916
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,896
But trust me when I say,
you're not gonna like

917
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,022
what he's gonna do to ya.

918
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,526
Now, hand it over.

919
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,529
Yeah, not gonna happen.

920
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,658
- Come again?
- I said I can't.

921
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:28,992
One more time.

922
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,786
- I can't give it to you.
- Why not?

923
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,871
Because I ate it, okay?

924
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,129
Yes.

925
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,882
What are we even doing here?

926
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,052
There are two ways
that diamond's coming outta ya.

927
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,429
This way,

928
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,432
or this way.

929
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,936
That's what I thought.

930
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,813
Also, I'm outta groceries.

931
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,111
So, how long you been a mercenary?

932
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,530
Hey, where did you get--

933
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,032
You're so busy
looking at my right hand,

934
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,909
you haven't even thought
about my left.

935
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,078
Your left hand is cuffed to mine.

936
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,543
I'll have to learn that one.

937
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:21,920
Can we get this?

938
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,756
You're not gonna try to run, are you?

939
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,050
Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,

940
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,897
I figure I'm better off with
the person who's not gonna cut me open.

941
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,181
Fine. But if you try to run,
I will kill you.

942
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,517
I do not care that you're a kid.

943
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,771
I saw that.

944
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,567
Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?

945
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:47,029
I mean, shopping at fancy-ass stores,

946
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:50,282
you're making bank,
you have your own business.

947
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,243
How'd you do it?
Come on, tell me.

948
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,578
Woman to woman.

949
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:59,207
Being a pickpocket's fine and all,
but I got real potential.

950
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,251
I mean, how do I be like you?

951
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:05,005
Well, except for the crazy part.
But other than that.

952
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,592
Number one, no one is like me.

953
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,803
If you wanted to even come close,
you would have to go to medical school.

954
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,932
Become a psychiatrist,
work in an asylum.

955
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,310
Fall in love with your patient,
break said patient out of said asylum.

956
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,561
Begin a life of crime.

957
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,040
Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.

958
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,732
Get arrested by the Batman.

959
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,585
Go back to jail, get out of jail
with a bomb on your neck.

960
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,170
Save the world, go back to jail,
and break out of jail

961
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,571
before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman

962
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,365
and going out on your own.

963
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,119
Number two...

964
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:39,498
Six bucks for tap water
with a fucking cucumber stick in it?

965
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:40,666
That's crazy.

966
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,544
I'm not shopping at this store.

967
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,631
I'm robbing this store.

968
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,968
Consider this your first lesson.

969
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,220
Paying is for dummies.

970
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,686
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

971
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,813
Move it!

972
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,736
Whoops. Ah...

973
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,825
This is Doc's Place. And this is Doc.

974
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,371
Lotus flower!

975
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,999
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

976
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:26,253
He's the Taiwanese grandpa I never had.
He knows everything and everyone.

977
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,106
Nothing happens around here,
let me tell you,

978
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,506
without Doc knowing about it.

979
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,092
And he happens to be the only person

980
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,511
who actually cares about me.

981
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,179
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

982
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,891
She's been ordering #32
with extra chili for many years.

983
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,311
Lesson number two,
you always want extra chili with #32.

984
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,938
So you don't have
to taste his cooking.

985
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,858
Lotus flower, you have to get upstairs
before someone sees.

986
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,360
Everyone's looking for you.
And you.

987
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,571
We know.

988
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,949
I'm telling you,
if you want boys to respect you,

989
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,993
you have to show them
that you're serious.

990
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,163
Blow something up. Shoot someone.

991
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,541
Nothing gets a guy's attention
like violence.

992
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,585
Shut that door. Lock it.

993
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,129
Keep your sticky paws to yourself, okay?

994
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,183
This place...

995
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,549
Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

996
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,312
...is so fucking dope.

997
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:30,400
Oh, shit. Is that a hyena in a bathtub?

998
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,403
I named him Bruce
after that hunky Wayne guy.

999
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,323
He's my little dumpling, aren't you?

1000
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,575
Aren't you, my little baby?

1001
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,660
Aren't you, Brucey? Yes.

1002
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,454
I love you.

1003
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:47,584
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

1004
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,797
Who, that? It's Cass.

1005
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,759
You're so pretty.

1006
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,471
Who's this?

1007
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,807
It's a beaver.

1008
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,183
Hmm.

1009
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:09,898
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

1010
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,026
What's this?

1011
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,074
It's art. Don't touch.

1012
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,912
He your ex or something?

1013
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,123
You don't know who that is?

1014
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,792
The Joker.

1015
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,586
The Clown Prince of Crime?

1016
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,421
My former partner in madness?

1017
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,841
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

1018
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,884
You've never heard of him?

1019
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,095
Well, sounds like a dick.

1020
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,266
Huh.

1021
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,569
Milk.

1022
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,875
I'm not going soft
or nothing, but I gotta admit,

1023
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,252
it was kinda nice having the kid around.

1024
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,891
Give me a #32. Mild.

1025
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,018
Uh... Yeah, sure.

1026
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,540
Who are you?

1027
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,958
They call me...

1028
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,253
H...

1029
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,297
My bad.
I should've introduced you.

1030
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,715
I'll make it quick.

1031
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:08,141
Meet the daughter of the richest,
most powerful Mafia don in Gotham City.

1032
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,769
Helena Bertinelli.

1033
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:13,313
Yep, that Bertinelli.

1034
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,860
One day, she comes home to find
her whole family in the living room.

1035
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,153
Momma.

1036
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:26,326
Anyone and everyone
with Bertinelli blood is there.

1037
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:31,581
Oh, and that? That's Stefano Galante.

1038
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,335
The guy making the play for
the Bertinelli turf and fortune.

1039
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,570
When one of the goons
finds the kid alive,

1040
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:07,033
the big softy sneaks her outta there
and hides her away in Sicily.

1041
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,455
Where she is raised by his own
father and brother. Both assassins.

1042
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:24,092
She spends the next 15 years
thinking only of revenge.

1043
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,845
So, she starts training.

1044
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:29,973
When she was ready,

1045
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,266
and by "ready" I mean

1046
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,393
a badass motherfucking
killing machine,

1047
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,983
she moves back to Gotham.
Starts working on that kill list.

1048
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,910
She has the murder stuff down,
but the rest?

1049
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,120
Do you know who I am?

1050
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,706
Do you know who I am?

1051
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:55,999
Still a work in progress.

1052
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,295
Do you know who I am?

1053
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:01,880
The Crossbow Killer.

1054
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,131
They call me...

1055
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,175
The Crossbow Killer.

1056
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,885
They call me...

1057
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:09,721
The Crossbow Killer?

1058
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,056
They call me...

1059
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,352
Huntress.

1060
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,063
She calls herself Huntress.

1061
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,565
Fucking fabulous, if you ask me.

1062
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,610
And who are you looking for?

1063
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,409
Great club.

1064
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,702
Quinn got the girl.

1065
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,120
And?

1066
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,414
And they disappeared.

1067
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,251
Fuck!

1068
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,046
Fuck!

1069
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,221
What is she laughing at?

1070
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,265
Is she laughing at me?

1071
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,433
She is.

1072
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,185
No, she's not. She's...

1073
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,562
What are you laughing at, Erika?

1074
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,107
Roman, you gotta hear this.

1075
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,109
- It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.

1076
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:05,944
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1077
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,154
You're being a total kook.

1078
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,199
Get on the fucking table.

1079
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,079
This is my club. Get up now.

1080
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,206
- Okay.
- Now.

1081
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,168
Whoa.

1082
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,755
Now, dance.

1083
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,013
Dance. Dance, Erika!

1084
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,473
Okay.

1085
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,650
This dress is fucking hideous.

1086
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,570
Take it off.

1087
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,990
Take your dress off.

1088
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,286
Get up there and fucking cut it off her.

1089
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,872
Do it now!

1090
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,374
Take her fucking dress off.

1091
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,835
Just rip it off her. Hurry up!

1092
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,253
Hurry up!

1093
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,773
- Fucking do it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1094
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:09,883
Do it.

1095
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,139
Yeah. Beautiful.

1096
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:34,115
You wouldn't betray me, would you?

1097
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,661
I was just gonna
go look for the girl.

1098
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,830
Oh, no, no, no.
I want you to stay here with me.

1099
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,291
I want you to stay here with me close.

1100
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,669
You soothe me, little bird.

1101
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,435
Oh, good. You got it.

1102
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:03,853
Did you trace the messages?

1103
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,397
You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,

1104
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,841
and then had it sent to my office.

1105
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,735
Renee, what were you thinking?

1106
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:13,446
Roman is the one
that put a price on the kid's head.

1107
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,198
Okay? I had to.

1108
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,576
- I can't get into it right now...
- Renee, you need help.

1109
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,078
What are you talking about?

1110
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,330
She's right.

1111
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,668
You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.

1112
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:28,962
What?

1113
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,005
I'm sorry. Okay?

1114
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,882
You gave me no choice.

1115
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,801
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

1116
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,970
You're suspended.

1117
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,223
Your badge and your gun, now.

1118
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,522
If you've ever watched
any cop movie ever,

1119
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:50,358
you know that
this is when shit gets real.

1120
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,193
What's the point of the badge,

1121
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,072
when it means fuck all anyway?

1122
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,325
Right, Captain?

1123
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:04,163
No cop ever gets anything done
until after they've been suspended.

1124
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:10,795
Which would've had me worried,
only I had more pressing concerns.

1125
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:14,674
And that is why you should never partake
in paying federal income taxes.

1126
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,176
Hey, you'll ruin your nails.

1127
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,889
Thank you.

1128
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,017
Anyway, lesson 37.

1129
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,101
Why--

1130
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,271
You said they wouldn't find us.

1131
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,316
Chillax. No one knows we're here.

1132
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:34,193
Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

1133
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,862
Okay. So they know.

1134
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,488
Let's scram.

1135
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,034
Open the door.

1136
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,411
Holy back door, Beavy.
This is getting outta hand.

1137
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:44,746
Bruce, come here.

1138
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,289
I can hear you!
Open the door.

1139
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:48,583
What is that?

1140
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,045
See you in hell, Harley!

1141
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,341
Get under the table!

1142
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,553
Bruce? Bruce!

1143
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,763
Come here! No!

1144
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,441
Bruce?

1145
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,779
Come here, boy. Bruce?

1146
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:21,783
Bruce?

1147
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,452
Bruce?

1148
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,039
This doesn't make sense.

1149
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,625
It doesn't make sense.
I don't understand.

1150
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,629
No one knew we were here.
No one knew we were here, except...

1151
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,631
Doc.

1152
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:37,799
Oh, my God. Doc?

1153
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,928
Doc? Where is he?

1154
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,555
Doc?

1155
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:48,559
I can't find Bruce.
I can't find him. I...

1156
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:56,275
No.

1157
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,695
I'm sorry, lotus flower.

1158
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,863
You sold me out?

1159
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,991
Too many people offering me
too much money.

1160
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,204
I have enough now
to open up a new restaurant.

1161
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,289
A really nice one.

1162
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,749
But, Doc,

1163
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,960
it's me.

1164
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,295
It's just business.

1165
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,534
This next bit
ain't very pretty.

1166
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,704
- You're right.
- Harley?

1167
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,497
He's right.

1168
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,334
Business is business.

1169
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,254
I've got the kid.

1170
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,716
But I'm gonna need to renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

1171
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,593
If I hand her over,

1172
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,137
I want everyone who's after me
to back off.

1173
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:09,557
Quinn,
bring me the rock now

1174
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,476
and I guarantee your safety.

1175
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:15,188
I own this town.
You'll have my protection.

1176
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:16,814
Fine.

1177
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:21,110
Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.

1178
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,079
Quit judging.

1179
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,375
Zsasz!

1180
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,467
Come on, kid.

1181
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,552
Let's get you somewhere safe.

1182
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,221
We got them.

1183
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,226
Little bird!

1184
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,854
You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

1185
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:01,234
Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

1186
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,361
Do we have to bring them back?

1187
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:07,448
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

1188
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,493
Just bring me back my diamond.

1189
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:58,749
What is it?

1190
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,210
Nothing.

1191
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,725
Pull over.

1192
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,059
What?

1193
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,812
Pull the fucking car over now.

1194
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,066
I gotta take a leak.

1195
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,072
She betrayed you, boss.
She betrayed you.

1196
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,657
Are you sure?

1197
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,493
Your little bird's a fucking rat.

1198
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,753
You want me to kill her?

1199
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,174
No.

1200
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,092
No. No.

1201
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,345
I'll come to you.

1202
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,549
I thought we were friends. And you...

1203
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:34,011
You saw what it's like for me out there.
I didn't have a choice.

1204
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:37,348
And if you go before he gets here,
everything will be fine.

1205
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,643
Harley.

1206
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:43,521
I'm sorry, kid. I am.

1207
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,074
That was fast.

1208
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,370
She's in--

1209
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,539
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1210
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:04,041
You? Again?

1211
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:14,385
Are you drunk?

1212
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:15,845
Come on.

1213
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,138
Okay.

1214
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,828
Right in the tit.

1215
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,919
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1216
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:51,130
Cass.

1217
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,431
You killed my sandwich!

1218
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,023
Bye-bye, birdie.

1219
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:11,609
Ow!

1220
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,820
No fair.

1221
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,781
Was that really necessary?

1222
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,866
You don't know her like I do.

1223
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,576
Cass?

1224
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,040
Oh, thank God.

1225
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,368
I'm gonna get you outta here.

1226
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:29,835
Did she really tape you

1227
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,420
- to a damn toilet?
- Mmm-hmm.

1228
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,256
Hmm.

1229
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,883
This is nice.

1230
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,469
You're still conscious.

1231
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,098
You can still feel?

1232
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,226
Look at me.
Are you a good girl, now?

1233
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:51,107
“I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl."

1234
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,494
I got one

1235
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:09,333
for all the little birds
I helped fly away from this world.

1236
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:12,378
I'm saving a special spot for you.

1237
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,214
Right here.

1238
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,446
You're gonna have to be quiet.

1239
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,596
-Ow!

1240
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,098
What are you guys doing?

1241
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,855
Oh, I know where the diamond is.

1242
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,275
Is that rock still inside you?

1243
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,821
Oh, God.

1244
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:42,992
Stop.

1245
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,537
The hell, Zsasz?

1246
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,622
Cut her open.

1247
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:49,999
Stop fucking around.

1248
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,208
You heard me.

1249
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,002
Cut her fucking open.

1250
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,797
Okay. No, no. No, no, no.
See, she's just a kid.

1251
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,383
You're a filthy fucking rat.

1252
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,676
I'm a rat?

1253
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:04,388
I knew you couldn't be trusted.
Roman's little bird.

1254
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,515
You little fucking bird.

1255
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,768
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1256
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:14,732
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1257
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,986
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1258
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:20,905
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1259
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:22,114
Prove it to me.

1260
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,743
Rip open her little tummy.

1261
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,203
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1262
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,538
Now! Rip it open!

1263
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,304
You piece of shit!

1264
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:54,688
Freeze!

1265
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,069
Don't fucking move.

1266
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,114
Who the fuck are you?

1267
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,331
Go get the kid.

1268
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:13,916
All right.

1269
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,085
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Back the fuck up!

1270
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,420
- Get away from me. All of you.
- Put that shit down.

1271
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,798
Shoot them, kid.

1272
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:24,718
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1273
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,638
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm--
- Don't move!

1274
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:28,806
Okay.

1275
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,725
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1276
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:33,352
But I know that this shit stick...

1277
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,897
...just tried to gut me.

1278
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:38,899
And you.

1279
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,778
Thought you were different.

1280
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:46,991
I'm sorry, kid.

1281
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,121
I'm just a terrible person, I guess.

1282
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,087
Ooh!

1283
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,006
Ooh, I'm back.

1284
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:05,759
Okay, I feel like I've just walked in on
something I don't give two shits about.

1285
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,238
This guy's dead, so I'm just
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1286
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,265
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1287
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:12,850
Excuse me? I work for Sionis?

1288
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,646
I'm not letting you sell the kid to him.

1289
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,816
I wasn't going to sell the kid.
I was going to trade the kid.

1290
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,651
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin. Huh?

1291
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,738
I'm not proud of what I did,
but I had half the city after me.

1292
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,698
Even the fucking Crossbow Killer.

1293
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,491
I'm not the Crossbow Killer!

1294
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:30,617
Whoa.

1295
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:33,579
They call me...

1296
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:34,747
Helena Bertinelli.

1297
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,290
For fuck's sake.

1298
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:38,459
As in the Bertinelli massacre?

1299
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:42,379
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1300
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,845
I killed Galante.

1301
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,642
I killed his firing squad.

1302
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,858
I killed Victor Zsasz.

1303
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,366
And now I'm done.

1304
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,285
Bravo.

1305
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:20,292
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1306
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:21,543
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1307
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,798
I hate to be the one to break it to you,
sweetheart, but you are not done.

1308
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,009
Who do you think funded
Galante's little power grab, huh?

1309
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,053
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1310
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,555
Roman killed your whole family
looking for that rock.

1311
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,849
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1312
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,103
That diamond is our only chance
of stopping him.

1313
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,270
You guys.

1314
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:42,773
Hey, I think you should see this.

1315
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,443
Oh.

1316
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,112
It's Sionis.

1317
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,167
We're fucked.

1318
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,711
He bought himself an army.

1319
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:14,555
They're all here for me.

1320
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,183
Aren't they?

1321
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:26,608
- No.
- They're not?

1322
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,026
No, they're not.

1323
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,362
Do you know what that means?

1324
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,340
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1325
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:33,574
He's after all of us.

1326
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:36,243
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1327
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,830
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1328
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,833
And you're dumb enough
to be building a case against him.

1329
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,253
So, unless we all wanna die
very unpleasant deaths

1330
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,631
and let Roman go finger-fishing
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1331
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,618
we're gonna have to work together.

1332
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,012
With you?

1333
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,221
Yeah.

1334
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,848
We're gonna work together,

1335
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,651
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1336
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:04,980
Okay.

1337
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:08,442
Yeah. Okay.

1338
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,404
Sure.

1339
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:13,947
Yes!

1340
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,241
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1341
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,326
Mmm-hmm.

1342
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:23,749
Will this do?

1343
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,335
No.

1344
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,128
Not at all.

1345
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,174
We're dead.
We're fucking dead.

1346
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:34,092
That slimy jizznozzle!

1347
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,179
- I can't believe he took it all!
- We're fucked.

1348
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,847
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

1349
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,355
Okay.

1350
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:02,538
Friends, brothers,
men of Gotham.

1351
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:07,584
I have funded you. I've protected you.

1352
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,880
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1353
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:15,008
Well, now it's time to say thank you.

1354
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:21,974
Go show those little bitches
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.

1355
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:25,894
Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

1356
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,896
The rest you can kill.

1357
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,237
Dope.

1358
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,699
Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.

1359
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:40,867
Sentimental value. Try this.

1360
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,455
- You're kidding.
- What? Gotta take care of the girls.

1361
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,083
Isn't this fun? It's just
like a sleepover.

1362
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,502
We should order pizza. Make cosmos.

1363
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,546
- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

1364
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,466
Hey, nice. What the hell is up
with this bow and arrow shtick?

1365
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:59,636
It's not a fucking bow and arrow.
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.

1366
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:01,471
I love this chick.
She's got rage issues.

1367
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,098
I don't have rage issues.

1368
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:05,976
You know, psychologically speaking,

1369
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,604
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.

1370
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:09,688
Yeah.

1371
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,441
Are we ready? Bad guys, just outside.

1372
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,155
Shit. Get down.

1373
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,116
Down here!

1374
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:23,994
Cass!

1375
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,371
- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!

1376
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:27,497
Go!

1377
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,670
Holy shit!

1378
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:55,942
What?

1379
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,736
You are so cool.

1380
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,655
Okay. This way.

1381
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,040
Get ready, ladies.

1382
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,111
Don't worry.
You're gonna make it.

1383
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,637
Okay? Okay.

1384
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:26,223
What the... Go! Go, go, go!

1385
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:28,100
Fuck.

1386
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,520
Shit.

1387
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:42,823
Whoa. Shit!

1388
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,510
Motherfucker.

1389
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,859
Let me go!

1390
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,527
Gotcha.

1391
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:22,738
This way!

1392
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,448
Come on. Come on. It's okay.
Come on.

1393
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:26,158
You shouldn't have to see this.

1394
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,326
Here, hold on to this for me, okay?

1395
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,554
That's all you think about.

1396
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,338
Just close your eyes
and hold it tight. Okay?

1397
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,499
Here. Get down. Come on. You'll be safe.

1398
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:17,709
Canary!

1399
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,504
You okay?

1400
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,798
We gotta go this way!

1401
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,218
Ugh. More?

1402
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,633
When the fuck did she have time
to do a shoe change?

1403
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:29,763
Come on.

1404
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:37,979
Thanks.

1405
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:52,577
Duck!

1406
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,124
- Hair tie?
- Yeah.

1407
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:00,335
Ah, fuck!

1408
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:06,550
I got him!

1409
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:11,263
Get back here, kid!

1410
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:16,518
Who's got the kid?

1411
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:30,323
Get down!

1412
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:43,461
Please, no more.

1413
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,509
So, forgive me yet?

1414
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:50,760
Get off me.

1415
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,934
Anyone else hungry?
I know a great taco spot.

1416
01:29:58,101 --> 01:29:59,301
- I'm starving.
- I love tacos.

1417
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:00,478
Really?

1418
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,655
Down! Get down!

1419
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,365
You're okay.
You're okay.

1420
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:14,784
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Let me check it.

1421
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,371
Get off!

1422
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:19,915
I got you.

1423
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,041
Ooh!

1424
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:24,210
Aren't you glad you wore that?
Sexy and bulletproof.

1425
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,255
Harley! No! Get off me!

1426
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:28,422
Harley!

1427
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:30,133
They got the kid. Shit!

1428
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,428
We can't let them get her. I trust you.

1429
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,389
- One bullet?
- Please help me!

1430
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:37,849
Has anyone got any bullets?

1431
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,601
Fuck. I'm out.

1432
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,854
I can't get out there.
I just need to get through.

1433
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,357
- We gotta go. We gotta move.
- Shit.

1434
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:47,275
Guys, they're in the car.

1435
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:48,693
They're getting away.

1436
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:50,570
- Get in there!
- Get off!

1437
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,158
Shit! I'm out.

1438
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:56,701
Guys, come on.
They're closing in.

1439
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,122
Canary, you know what you have to do!

1440
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:04,459
Cover your ears!
You better get her back.

1441
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,856
Told ya she had
a killer voice.

1442
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:49,295
Need a ride?

1443
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:16,322
Get her!

1444
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,230
Oh!

1445
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,034
Whip me!

1446
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:02,160
What?

1447
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:03,495
- Whip me!
- Okay.

1448
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:12,545
Kid!

1449
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,255
Harley!

1450
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:16,424
Shoot her!

1451
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:26,017
Harley!

1452
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:27,811
Hit the brakes!

1453
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:48,832
No!

1454
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,304
Uh-oh.

1455
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,457
Kid!

1456
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:44,929
Harley!

1457
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:05,783
Well, we always did share
a love of the dramatic.

1458
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:06,951
Didn't we?

1459
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,955
And look at us now.

1460
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,043
But don't you see?
You're trying to kill me.

1461
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:17,503
I'm the only one who can protect you!

1462
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:22,842
You know you can't
stand on your own, Quinn.

1463
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:24,135
You're not the type!

1464
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:28,306
But me? You need me!

1465
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:46,032
Here's the thing, Romy baby.

1466
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:51,788
Your protection is based on the fact
that people are scared of you.

1467
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:54,415
Just like they're scared of Mr. J.

1468
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:02,423
But I'm the one
they should be scared of.

1469
01:36:02,799 --> 01:36:05,260
Not you, and not Mr. J.

1470
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:08,346
'Cause I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

1471
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:17,188
Shit.

1472
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:20,525
That was super embarrassing.

1473
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,277
Hmm. Sure was.

1474
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:25,947
You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.

1475
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,200
I'm sorry, kid.

1476
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:33,246
And I'm sorry I tried to sell you.
That was a dick move.

1477
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:36,541
For what it's worth,

1478
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:41,170
you made me want to be
a less terrible person.

1479
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:43,339
Ew.

1480
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:46,843
If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.

1481
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:48,303
Excuse me!

1482
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,805
I stole something from you.

1483
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,890
You slippery-fingered little turd.

1484
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:54,267
I took your ring.

1485
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:55,810
My ring?

1486
01:36:58,646 --> 01:36:59,647
Dope.

1487
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,252
Cass! Harley!

1488
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,087
We're okay.

1489
01:37:26,883 --> 01:37:28,301
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1490
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,179
- He's gone?
- Mmm-hmm.

1491
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:33,097
Good. Fuck that guy.

1492
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,974
Yeah. Tacos?

1493
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:37,560
No, but seriously.

1494
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,520
You were very impressive with that bow.

1495
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:40,855
Very impressive.

1496
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:41,939
It's a crossbow.

1497
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:43,083
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

1498
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:44,525
- Mmm-hmm.
- Morning margaritas!

1499
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:45,735
Thank you. I got you.

1500
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:47,236
- You drink, right, kid?
- Yeah.

1501
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:48,613
I don't think so.

1502
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:50,782
And I love that fucking name, Huntress.

1503
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,367
- Really?
- Yeah.

1504
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:53,826
Oh, great name.

1505
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,161
Wow.

1506
01:37:55,536 --> 01:38:00,166
Um... I really like how you were able
to kick so high in those tight pants.

1507
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:01,709
- Yeah, that is cool.
- Yeah.

1508
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:02,835
- Thanks.
- Oh, um...

1509
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:05,922
Thanks for the car.

1510
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:08,841
You're welcome.

1511
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,219
Kid, if that burrito
doesn't make you shit,

1512
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,096
I don't know what will.

1513
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:16,099
Give me a minute.

1514
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:18,809
Yes!

1515
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:20,895
Right.

1516
01:38:22,688 --> 01:38:24,649
I've given her prune juice, laxatives.

1517
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:26,859
I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.

1518
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:29,112
And you know what?
I owe you an apology.

1519
01:38:29,862 --> 01:38:30,863
Me?

1520
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:34,867
I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.

1521
01:38:36,285 --> 01:38:37,578
I'm used to it.

1522
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:41,290
Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.

1523
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:44,377
Ladies.

1524
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,170
Have fun with that.

1525
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:49,590
So, what now?

1526
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,676
Sionis is gone, but it's just

1527
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,594
a matter of time
before some other asshole

1528
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,041
tries to finish what he started.

1529
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:56,097
Right.

1530
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:59,016
We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.

1531
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:02,270
Does she always talk like
the cop in a bad '80s movie,

1532
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,563
or is that just me?

1533
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:04,772
Fuck you.
And fuck you.

1534
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,065
What?

1535
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:08,276
I mean, we were amazing there.

1536
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:09,986
Yeah! Hell yeah!

1537
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:13,156
I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.

1538
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:14,323
Thank you.

1539
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:15,533
Right.

1540
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:16,617
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

1541
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,538
She stole my fucking car!

1542
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:21,706
What?

1543
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:26,878
I'm sorry.

1544
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:28,880
I know what you're thinking.

1545
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:30,631
You think I'm a dick
after all that.

1546
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:34,635
But you heard what the cop said.
Sionis is gone.

1547
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:39,599
And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.

1548
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,934
Montoya's boss picked up

1549
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:43,895
the gangbangers
at the Booby Trap.

1550
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:46,981
And took all the credit
while he was at it.

1551
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:48,357
Again.

1552
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:55,615
It was the kick in the balls
she needed

1553
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:59,243
to see that she had nothing to prove
to those blowhard assholes.

1554
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:02,205
She quit the same day.

1555
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:09,337
We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.

1556
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,797
And Huntress got her family money back.

1557
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:15,927
She's using it to fund
a little crime-fighting outfit.

1558
01:40:19,055 --> 01:40:22,099
They call themselves the Birds of Prey.

1559
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:25,978
I call them dorky little do-gooders.

1560
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:32,777
The rock itself was worth
a chunk of change, so I pawned it.

1561
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:35,029
And I invested the cash
in a little startup

1562
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:36,322
making waves in the East End.

1563
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:42,662
Oh! And I found Bruce.

1564
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:45,039
He was wandering around Chinatown.

1565
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:48,668
I guess it proves the theory
that hyenas really do have nine lives.

1566
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:12,275
Yeah, yeah.
I made the kid my apprentice.

1567
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,735
Call me a softy.

1568
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,154
I dare ya.

1569
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,035
Mmm!

1570
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:29,834
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

1571
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,044
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

1572
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:34,672
Southern girl in me
I ain't afraid to catch a case

1573
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:37,466
VVS's on me and I flooded out the face

1574
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,052
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

1575
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:42,263
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

1576
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:44,849
I don't need you
I've got flooded out baguettes

1577
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:47,059
I don't need you
All my diamonds dripping wet

1578
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:50,646
I'm a super shero, bitch
Don't try me, hoe

1579
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,190
Bad like a villain
I pop it and then I reload

1580
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:55,693
All the best things in life
Come for free

1581
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:58,195
But don't you think that applies to me

1582
01:41:58,279 --> 01:41:59,673
I do what I want
'Cause I know that I'm hot

1583
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:00,966
I ain't a band but you know how I rock

1584
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:02,217
Don't need no clippers
To give you a chop

1585
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:03,468
Took me to dinner then I took him out

1586
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:04,772
I like it when you call me crazy

1587
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:06,120
Long as you keep callin' baby

1588
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:07,431
He think it's cute
That I know how to shoot

1589
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:08,849
Don't you get scared
If I point it at you

1590
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:10,833
Broke up with my ex
Dumped him in a text

1591
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:13,461
Would wish you the best
But I already left

1592
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:16,005
Date night with my bitches
Gettin' real twisted

1593
01:42:16,088 --> 01:42:18,758
You know what you could do?
Give my ass a bunch of kisses

1594
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:21,093
I love me this much

1595
01:42:21,177 --> 01:42:23,679
My pear shape all dripped up

1596
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:25,598
It's freezing

1597
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:27,933
In my bag

1598
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:31,312
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

1599
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,397
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

1600
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,941
I don't need you
I've got flooded out baguettes

1601
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:38,361
I don't need you
All my diamonds dripping wet

1602
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,572
I know how to work a gun
I don't need a range

1603
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:44,158
And I can take a hit
I ain't scared of the pain

1604
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:46,661
And I don't really bang
But I came with the gang

1605
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,246
And if you get too close
I might snatch off your chain

1606
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,999
You want me to be
A little more lady-like?

1607
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:54,227
Come through with my girls
And beat your ass on ladies' night

1608
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:57,254
You don't want to go
Toe to toe with my pedicure

1609
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:59,590
Everyone you know be like
“Bro, how you handle her?"

1610
01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:01,300
Diamonds are my new boyfriend

1611
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:03,886
So that mean
I will never ever fuck with you again

1612
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:06,514
And I ain't never need him
So it's so easy to leave him

1613
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,433
And I be doing me
I ain't never tr yin' to please him

1614
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,560
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

1615
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:14,313
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

1616
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:16,982
I don't need you
I've got flooded out baguettes

1617
01:43:17,066 --> 01:43:19,527
I don't need you
All my diamonds dripping wet

1618
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,363
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier

1619
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:27,243
Got bridges to burn
And places to run

1620
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:29,286
Yeah, this smile is a loaded gun

1621
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:32,915
It's my party, my body, my business

1622
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:35,793
It's my town and my ground
And my hit-list

1623
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:38,337
It's my world
And you're just living in it

1624
01:43:38,421 --> 01:43:40,840
Did I, did I, did I finish?

1625
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:43,342
They are my girls
And it's us who's deciding

1626
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:46,053
It's our door
Did we say you're invited?

1627
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:48,806
Leave your name
And we'll call if we like it

1628
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,183
If we, if we, if we like it

1629
01:43:51,267 --> 01:43:53,894
-No more
-Mrs. Sweet and Miss Nice

1630
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:56,439
-No more
-Mrs. Fucking Polite

1631
01:43:56,522 --> 01:43:59,066
-Time's up
-Mrs. Taking What's Mine

1632
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,360
You don't need him

1633
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:03,738
Got bridges to burn
And places to run

1634
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:05,865
Yeah, this smile is a loaded gun

1635
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:10,911
All these fakers
They come to a stop with me

1636
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:13,080
Trying to step on my rungs

1637
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:16,000
All these boys
Trying to play my discography

1638
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:18,711
Never heard of them once

1639
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,255
They keep chasing my props

1640
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:23,799
But I'm leaving them numb

1641
01:44:27,762 --> 01:44:30,389
Bridges to burn
And places to run

1642
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:32,933
Bridges to burn
And places to run

1643
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,561
Bridges to burn
And places to run

1644
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:37,980
Bridges to burn
And places to run

1645
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:40,816
-No more
-Mrs. Sweet and Miss Nice

1646
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:43,444
-No more
-Mrs. Fucking Polite

1647
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,946
-Time's up
-Mrs. Taking What's Mine

1648
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:48,365
You don't need him

1649
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:51,035
I've got got bridges to burn
And places to run

1650
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,537
Bang bang and your party's done

1651
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:56,040
I've got got bridges to burn
And places to run

1652
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,083
Yeah, this smile is a loaded gun

1653
01:44:58,709 --> 01:45:01,504
I've got got bridges to burn
And places to run

1654
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:03,422
Bang bang and your party's done

1655
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:06,467
I've got got bridges to burn
And places to run

1656
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,552
Yeah, this smile is a loaded gun

1657
01:45:17,603 --> 01:45:20,731
I found you naked on the floor, hungover

1658
01:45:20,815 --> 01:45:23,734
Got some number
Written sloppy on your palm

1659
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:24,902
It's over

1660
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:28,322
Yeah, I recognize
Just who you truly are, a liar

1661
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:32,034
So I set all of your records
And your clothes on fire

1662
01:45:32,117 --> 01:45:34,036
Like what's up?

1663
01:45:34,119 --> 01:45:35,913
I'm gone now

1664
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,832
Feeling good, feeling great

1665
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:39,416
I'm done now

1666
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:41,168
Like bye-bye

1667
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:43,254
I'm set free

1668
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:46,090
Not on my mind, no lie
You're just a bad

1669
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,299
You're just a bad memory

1670
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:55,140
You're just a bad memory

1671
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:02,815
You're just a bad memory

1672
01:46:03,566 --> 01:46:06,610
Bad, bad, bad memory

1673
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:10,239
Bad, bad, bad memory

1674
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:13,993
Bad, bad, bad memory

1675
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:17,454
Bad, bad, bad memory

1676
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:43,767
Are you dummies
still sitting there?

1677
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:45,936
Fine. Since you stuck it out this long,

1678
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:48,230
I'll tell you
a super-duper secret secret.

1679
01:48:48,397 --> 01:48:49,898
But you can't tell anyone.

1680
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:52,234
Okay. Did you know that Batman...
