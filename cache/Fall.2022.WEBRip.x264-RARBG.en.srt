What happened...

821
00:44:21,554 --> 00:44:23,894
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

822
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:30,161
And I want to spread that
message, that life is short,

823
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:31,279
too short.

824

you should just be yourself.

an old RV thing down there.

837

we don't get service up here,

did down there.

Okay, so we don't know at
what point we lost service.

851

Maybe it was just up here

852
