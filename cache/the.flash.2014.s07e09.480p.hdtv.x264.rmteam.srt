1
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:03,636
- She's dead.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,377
You killed Alexa.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,205
Nora:
Barry and I did it together.

4
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:08,511
That was the only way.

5
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:10,730
She was the strongest.

6
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,515
I needed every ounce of power,

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:14,038
including your strength,
to kill her.

8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,910
- I'm supposed to protect
lives, not destroy them!

9
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:18,782
- I'm helping you clean up
your mess, Barry.

10
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,523
This is your fault.

11
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:23,874
The night you brought me back,
you created these monsters.

12
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:26,572
You and your lightning rod.

13
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:30,881
When you regained your speed,

14
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,840
I wasn't the only thing
you two willed into existence.

15
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:36,800
- That's impossible.
- Really?

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,544
Alexa was afraid to come here,
but she trusted you.

17
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:44,372
Why?

18
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:48,812
Because deep down, she could
feel a connection with you.

19
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:51,554
The same connection
that you feel with me now.

20
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:53,512
But, these new forces?

21
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:56,167
The way they've merged with the
people they chose as avatars?

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,300
It's corrupted them
because it's unnatural.

23
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,565
But once the other two
are gone--

24
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,523
- I won't help you kill again.

25
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:06,177
- Oh...

26
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,876
My beautiful boy.

27
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:13,837
You have no choice.

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,403
Because if you don't,

29
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:19,625
those things will kill everyone
you've sworn to keep safe.

30
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:21,584
Is that what you want?

31
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:27,285
Then, please, Barry...

32
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:28,808
help me.

33
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:34,074
- No.

34
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:36,555
- You have to help me,
damn it!

35
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,688
- Nora, stop.

36
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:44,737
- I will destroy
those other forces, Barry,

37
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,958
with or without your help.

38
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,264
Then you'll see that I'm right.

39
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,793
 What a day.

40
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:22,492
First, Frost is sent to
Iron Heights for life,

41
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,929
and now Alexa's dead.

42
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:26,931
- I can't let this happen
again.

43
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:28,846
- I'll get to work.
I need to figure out

44
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,109
how Nora was able to...

45
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:32,589
- Kill a god?

46
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:34,156
- She could
because she had help.

47
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,983
- Barry, she tricked you.

48
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,246
- No, she manipulated me,

49
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,725
just like she's been doing
the whole time.

50
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:41,902
- Honey, I know how you feel,but...

51
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,817
not everything she did
and said was a lie.

52
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,645
I mean, there were moments
that felt real too.

53
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:46,646
That must mean--

54
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,171
- Iris, we can't trust her
anymore.

55
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,827
- What about
what Nora said

56
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:56,743
about you two
creating the other forces?

57
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:58,919
- I mean,
there's no proof.

58
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:02,401
- Well, what if we find out
if Nora's telling the truth?

59
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:04,490
If she is, then that means
the other forces

60
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,405
would have been born
the same day she was.

61
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,754
- I'll pull satellite scans

62
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,147
from the night we fought
Mirror Monarch.

63
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,628
- Please, and thank you.

64
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:17,721
- Okay, you see that cluster of
kinetic energy readings?

65
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,202
Pretty sure
that's the Speed Force

66
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:22,508
being reborn in the Speed Lab.

67
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:25,250
Whoa. There they are.

68
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:28,601
Three brand-spanking-new
isotopic signatures.

69
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:33,127
- Nora was right.

70
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,696
- We created the forces.

71
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,266
- Fuerza's dead.

72
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,050
Nora killed her.

73
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:45,139
- She killed
the Strength Force?

74
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,665
- And now she wants to kill
the other two forces.

75
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,059
- Maybe I should go to
San Francisco.

76
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,757
- What?

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,107
- My series of photos
on Eva's attacks

78
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,848
got accepted
at a gallery there.

79
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:59,153
- Babe, congrats!

80
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,199
Well,
I was thinking of going

81
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:02,983
to help them install
the exhibition.

82
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:06,552
I'd ask you to come, but I know
you have your perfect job

83
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,902
at S.T.A.R. Labs
and your amazing friends.

84
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:11,731
I mean...you're an OG member
of Team Flash.

85
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:17,041
You okay?

86
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:18,260
- Yeah...

87
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,610
Yeah, I'm fine.

88
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:23,917
This is an isotopic
scanning lens.

89
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:26,659
It can detect the signatures
of all four forces,

90
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:29,532
even kinetic signatures
from Speed Force Nora.

91
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:31,055
And if one's nearby--

92
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:33,710
- It lights up like
an overexposed landscape.

93
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,452
- In which case,
you run the other way.

94
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:39,498
- Okay? I'm serious.

95
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,675
I just want you to be safe.

96
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:46,636
- Are you sure you're okay?

97
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,032
- Ohh, it's Barry.

98
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:54,470
I gotta get back--they could
have found Nora...

99
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:56,646
or worse, she's come back
on her own.

100
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:01,303
- How bad is it?

101
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:03,087
- Okay--did Nora
kill somebody else?

102
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,307
- No, and I have a way to make
sure she never does.

103
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,221
- Okay, how?

104
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,788
- I'm here.

105
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:10,573
What's going on?

106
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:12,531
- I spent all night

107
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,446
coming up with a way
to fix all this.

108
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,014
- Okay, what's the solve?

109
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:20,322
- We need to wipe the new
forces out of existence.

110
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:21,801
- Barry, what are you saying?

111
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:25,414
- I want to go back in time...
and uncreate them.

112
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,164
- Barry, you're talking about
creating another Flashpoint.

113
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,101
You know we can't do that.

114
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:37,754
- Not if I can figure out
a way to go back

115
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:39,408
that doesn't affect
the timeline.

116
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:41,823
- Which would be impossible.
- Barry, look.

117
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,522
I know that you're devastated
about Alexa.

118
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:47,438
But uncreating forces?

119
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,874
That crosses a line.

120
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,137
- I convinced Alexa
to come here.

121
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,095
Her death is my fault.

122
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,576
If we don't get these new
forces out of Psych and Deon,

123
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,274
Nora will kill them, too,
so it's on us to fix this.

124
00:05:58,318 --> 00:06:00,799
- By killing Deon and Psych?
- No, I'm not killing them.

125
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:03,367
I'm saving them from the forces
that took over their lives.

126
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,759
Whoever they were before this,
they can

127
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,457
go back to being those
same people again.

128
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,155
- And what about the other
force that was born that night?

129
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,549
Nora. If you uncreate her--
- We're only gonna target

130
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:13,855
the new forces, not Nora.
That's the plan.

131
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,640
- But if something
goes wrong,

132
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:17,642
Barry, you might
lose your speed.

133
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:19,905
- Then I lose my speed.
All right?

134
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:22,647
It's--it's worth the risk
to keep everyone safe.

135
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,605
- And what about the risk
to Nora?

136
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,520
Does her life not matter
at all any--

137
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:30,132
- Nora's not a person, Iris.

138
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:32,700
She never was.

139
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:35,790
Look, if we uncreate
these forces,

140
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:38,489
we can put everything
back to normal.

141
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,360
Hopefully that'll fix her too.

142
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:42,710
- Hopefully?

143
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:44,886
Barry, do you hear yourself
right now?

144
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,237
- Iris, I'm trying
to save people.

145
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:51,719
How--how do you not see
this is the right thing to do?

146
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:53,547
- The right thing to do

147
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:55,723
would be trying to
get through to Nora.

148
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,203
Just like how we beat Eva,

149
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,900
just like how we talked down
Abra Kadabra.

150
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:01,903
That is what we do.
- We tried talking to her.

151
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:04,036
All Nora did was double down.

152
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,778
- There's no reaching her.

153
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,910
Obviously we disagree on this.

154
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:11,957
- Yes, we do.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,437
- I have to do it.

156
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:21,923
- Then you'll be doing it
without me.

157
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:31,759
- Wait...you want to go
after a force of nature?

158
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:34,632
- Yeah, if I can convince Nora
not to kill Deon and Psych,

159
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:37,765
then...Barry will see that
she can be reasoned with.

160
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,158
- But, how do we find her?

161
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,247
I mean, she's the freakin'
Speed Force.

162
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,509
- Well, if she finds us first,

163
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:45,947
at least we'll know
she's coming.

164
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,820
Holy crap...you guys gotta
see this.

165
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,302
You see that bright spot
at the center of you?

166
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:56,001
I think that's kinetic energy.

167
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:58,177
- Guys, this is gonna sound
really wild, but...

168
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,267
- Yeah, 'cause a ghost-hunting
lens isn't weird enough...

169
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,835
- But, if Barry and I created
these forces,

170
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:06,620
what if there's a little bit of
each of them inside of us?

171
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:09,710
- Like you're all connected?

172
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,712
- Wait, Iris...
when you're over by the door,

173
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,192
your glow was brighter.

174
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:14,802
Like there's something
in that direction

175
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,587
that was intensifying it.

176
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,241
What if...
- That something is Nora?

177
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:24,464
Guys, we can use me as a
divining rod to track her down.

178
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:27,728
- Yup, that's weirder.

179
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,515
- Elemental Force Particles?

180
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,778
- They're the particles
that created the new forces.

181
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,693
The lightning bolt
that rebirthed the Speed Force

182
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:37,738
was full of them.
- Now if we can extract

183
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:39,348
a sample
of these force particles

184
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:40,654
from the lightning,

185
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,743
then we can send out
an electromagnetic pulse

186
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:44,658
that'll seek out those
same particles,

187
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:46,312
wherever they may be
along the temporal spectrum.

188
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:50,098
- And you can erase the new
forces from existence.

189
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:52,057
That's not bad.

190
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,624
Small detail, though.

191
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,843
How in the world
are you supposed to

192
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:59,934
extract these particles
from a giant bolt of lightning?

193
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:02,720
- A few weeks ago when
Barry was Spock-Flash,

194
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:05,113
he modified the Tachyon
Enhancer to siphon

195
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:07,115
Mirror Monarch's
dark matter photons.

196
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,204
- So all we have to do
is tweak the Enhancer

197
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,164
to siphon Force Particles
instead of photons.

198
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,254
- Tweaking the
Tachyon Enhancer...

199
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:18,431
and then send out an EMP
to eighty-six the forces.

200
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,565
That's genius. I mean
it's foolproof, even.

201
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,571
But it still doesn't answer how
we're supposed to do this

202
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:30,617
and protect the timeline.

203
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:33,141
- I'll figure out.
Somehow, I will.

204
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:34,708
I'll figure it out.

205
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:37,711
- Man, I wish Nash Wells
was here.

206
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,757
I mean, he came up with
most of these equations

207
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,106
for the A.S.F. Machine.

208
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,457
I feel like
he'd crack this easy peasy.

209
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,025
- Modify the Particle Harness
Collector.

210
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:48,722
I'll be back as soon as I can.

211
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:51,986
- Roger that,
but where are you going?

212
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,946
- To get the one person that
can help us pull this off.

213
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:04,085
- Oh, no...Tess.

214
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:06,305
President Bartlett
just mixed up his meds.

215
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:09,482
That's not gonna be good,
but...great TV.

216
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,615
Whoa!

217
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:17,664
Allen. Allen.

218
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:21,581
I'm guessing
this isn't a social call?

219
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,671
- Not exactly.
We need your help.

220
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,412
- How bad is it?

221
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,327
- That depends.
- On...

222
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,678
- Whether or not you can help
us do the impossible.

223
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:49,957
- Well, well, well.
Honey, I'm home.

224
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:53,787
- Holy deus ex machina...
Timeless Wells.

225
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,965
- Perfect timing.
- Always.

226
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,446
So, apparently, there's danger
in Central City.

227
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,796
- Apparently.
- Well, let's get busy.

228
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,232
- Well, you really think

229
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:06,844
we can do this without
affecting the timeline?

230
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,497
- I know we can.

231
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,543
As long as we use me
as your guide.

232
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,327
- Harrison was there when
the forces were created.

233
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,329
So if we used the other "him"
from that night

234
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,766
as a beacon to lock onto--

235
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,856
- Hopefully I can go back
to that exact moment,

236
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,727
also bring Allen along
for the ride,

237
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:22,686
and he'll collect
the particles.

238
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:26,167
- Oof, wait, so you can travel
through time with a plus one?

239
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,169
- It should work...

240
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:30,650
When Allen and I go back
to that exact moment

241
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:33,609
that those dangerous forces
were created 17 days ago,

242
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:37,570
I will--I will create
a protective-time bubble

243
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,312
from that moment until now,

244
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:42,706
preserving those days
in this timeline,

245
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:47,362
and preventing
anything from changing.

246
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,758
- Which would also allow us
to wipe out the new forces

247
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:54,630
without altering
any of the events

248
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:55,849
that have happened
since then--

249
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:59,200
Yo! That is--that is trippy.

250
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:00,941
- Cisco, this will work.

251
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,551
- What about Iris?

252
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:05,293
- When she sees everyone safe,
she'll come around.

253
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:06,642
She has to.

254
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:09,689
- You're not convinced.
I wasn't either,

255
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,431
when Allen told me about this,
I thought of Tess.

256
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:17,175
I thought of my wife, and how
my future with Tess was...

257
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,133
ripped from me.

258
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,831
Until this gift...

259
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:26,227
which has allowed me to relive
every single day with Tess,

260
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:29,056
but only...

261
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,449
because I took a chance.

262
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,156
- All right.

263
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,289
I'm in.

264
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:51,905
- It's brighter.
We must be getting close.

265
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,781
She should be here.

266
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,653
- Maybe it was
a false positive.

267
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,917
- Maybe since Nora
is the Speed Force,

268
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:06,485
her isotopic signature
is all over the city by now.

269
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:08,530
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

270
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:10,619
But we are running
out of time.

271
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,665
- Well, Cisco always says
you can't solve a problem

272
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,232
till you're asking
the right question.

273
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,974
- Isn't "Where's Nora's
kinetic energy leading us"

274
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,411
the right question?

275
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:20,847
- No.

276
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,632
The right question is
"Where's Nora?"

277
00:13:23,676 --> 00:13:25,504
We've been trying to find
the Speed Force

278
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:28,594
when we should be looking
for... the person.

279
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:32,424
- So where would the real
Nora Allen go?

280
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,382
- Home.

281
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:35,906
Come on.

282
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,521
- Harness modifications
complete.

283
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,002
Let's get some time particles.

284
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:48,570
Actually, you know what?
Um...

285
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:51,008
Let me run just one more
diagnostic

286
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:52,879
on the collection disc.

287
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:56,752
[muttering] I just need
one more, just one more...

288
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,024
- Oh, frak.

289
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,330
Yo, yo, Deon.

290
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:10,766
What's--what's uh...

291
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,857
What's good, man?
- You tell me.

292
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:17,730
Something drew me here.

293
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,167
Was it you?

294
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:21,647
- I'm--I don't think
it was...

295
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,172
- Who's this?
I'm sorry, who are you?

296
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,826
- Who am I? Who are you?

297
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,306
- Who is he?

298
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,569
Look, guys, all's good
in the hood.

299
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:32,136
All right, look.

300
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,529
Barry, this is Deon.

301
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,445
Still Force.

302
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:39,186
And--and Deon,
this is Barry,

303
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,362
who's actually--

304
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:46,411
owner of this, uh,
fine establishment.

305
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:49,544
- So you're the landlord.

306
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,286
What's that got to do
with anything?

307
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,375
- Deon...

308
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:56,203
it's good to meet you.

309
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:57,770
- Actually, you remember me?

310
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,598
I was with him, you called us
one of the Urkels.

311
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:01,556
- Oh, yeah...the cornballs.

312
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,516
Cornball. He's so funny.

313
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:06,910
- Who's the egghead?

314
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:10,391
- Harrison Wells.

315
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:12,132
I'm a fellow--

316
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,920
Uh, visitor to Barry's place.

317
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:21,881
- You know, y'all are being
real friendly right now.

318
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:24,579
But I think--

319
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,233
I think y'all are acting
like that

320
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:28,627
because you're afraid of me.

321
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,978
Now why is that?
- No, we're just...

322
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:34,459
we're just making a--we're just
doing an experiment--

323
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:36,156
- Shut up!

324
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,261
Now...

325
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:58,962
why do I get the feeling...

326
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,573
you're reason I'm this way?

327
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:07,274
- Because that's true.

328
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:09,363
And I'm sorry.

329
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,975
I never meant
for this to happen.

330
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:15,239
So please let me fix it.
- Fix it?

331
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,676
Fix it?
So I'm a mistake?

332
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:21,027
- I didn't say that--
- You didn't have to.

333
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,510
I can feel it.

334
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:33,474
You want to destroy me.
- No, I want to save you.

335
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:35,868
Deon....Deon.

336
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,438
There are three other forces--
people like you.

337
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:45,138
One of them?
She wants to kill you.

338
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:48,011
Now, she's already killed
one of the other forces--

339
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:50,578
the Strength Force,
and she didn't care

340
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:55,366
when the person containing
that force died too.

341
00:16:55,409 --> 00:17:00,675
So I need to make it so the
Still Force never found you.

342
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,287
It's the only way
to keep you safe.

343
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,989
 Nah.

344
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,035
I like being me.

345
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:21,305
Oh, I get it.

346
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:25,309
Oh, I get it.
- Yeah?

347
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:26,832
- No, I get it. I get it.

348
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,660
This is what you're gonna
use to do it, huh?

349
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:29,878
This is what you're gonna use

350
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:31,054
to make it like I neverexisted?

351
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:33,360
- Not you,
just the force inside--

352
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:35,928
- Man, I am that force!

353
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,062
Do you have any idea
what it's like

354
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:41,629
to be told that you
shouldn't be here?

355
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:48,897
I never asked to be born.

356
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,508
- Deon, listen to me.

357
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,858
Look at what you're doing.

358
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:55,339
Okay, you--you don't understand
what you are.

359
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:59,125
- Yeah, I do.

360
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:03,869
I'm a god.

361
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:06,393
Maybe it's time
you understood that.

362
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:07,699
- Deon, wait--

363
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,272
- Time to bounce.

364
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,970
-...right?

365
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:24,194
- What the hell
just happened?

366
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:31,723
- I think your friend Deon
just stopped time.

367
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:33,594
- Yeah, he does that.

368
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:36,031
- Why'd he leave?

369
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:38,382
- Because I couldn't stop him.

370
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,651
- Deon just aged the harness
a thousand years.

371
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:48,350
How bad is it?
- Pretty bad.

372
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,787
- But not hopeless.

373
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:54,051
See I figured if we can find
some way to--

374
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:56,750
somehow create some sort of...

375
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,190
I was working on the collection
disc when Deon showed up.

376
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:04,323
I figured I better hide it
just in case.

377
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:06,368
Chester.

378
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,456
You're a lifesaver.

379
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,024
As for the vest,

380
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,982
I'm used to working with junk.

381
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,071
I'll just need a bunch of
replacement parts

382
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:16,291
from my garage and she'll be up
and running in no time.

383
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:20,077
With a little help, that is.
- I'm with you.

384
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:28,347
- What's up?

385
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,177
- I think Deon's right.

386
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,874
We can't just...

387
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:37,225
uncreate these forces
like that.

388
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,923
- Uh--so what, we--we...

389
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,709
we should just give up?

390
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:44,493
- On this? Yeah, we give up.

391
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:47,366
Doesn't that feel like
the right thing to do?

392
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:52,980
- Cisco, Nora will kill him

393
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:55,417
if I don't do something
to prevent it.

394
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,332
Just like she killed Alexa.

395
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,813
'Cause she's not gonna stop
until all the forces--

396
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:03,164
and the people connected
to them--are dead.

397
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,210
Why can't you see?
I'm trying to save him.

398
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,864
- He doesn't want to be
saved by you!

399
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:11,216
He just wants to be given
the chance to be himself.

400
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:15,350
And Iris understood that.

401
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:19,049
- Look, every second that we
leave these forces

402
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,617
inside Deon and Psych,
people are in danger.

403
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:23,880
It's only a matter of time
before someone dies

404
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,447
in one of Psych's nightmares

405
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,276
or gets killed by some kind
of Deon time anomaly.

406
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,061
Not to mention Nora
declared war.

407
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,063
She doesn't care how many
people she kills

408
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,804
as long as the forces die.

409
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:37,372
- You're right.
Yes, you're absolutely right.

410
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,548
And something needs to be done
about that.

411
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:41,942
And I don't have
all the answers.

412
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:44,901
All I know is...

413
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:47,904
this can't be it.

414
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,911
- You guys understand, right?

415
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,263
I--I have to uncreate
these forces.

416
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,790
- Like I said, I am--I'm
Team Flash all the way.

417
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,141
But...

418
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:10,013
Cisco has a point, man.

419
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:14,888
- Harrison?

420
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:17,107
- If uncreating these forces is

421
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,761
what you feel in your heart
is right,

422
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,937
I'll take that voyage with you.

423
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:25,855
But all I ask is that you
think--truly think

424
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:28,554
about the choice you're making.

425
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,478
- Please fix the harness.

426
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:46,528
- Good luck.

427
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,322
- Iris, you were right.

428
00:21:57,365 --> 00:22:00,412
These isotopic readings
are off the chart.

429
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,544
- Where are we?

430
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,067
- The old Allen house.

431
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:07,897
This is where Barry's mom
was killed.

432
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:11,336
He also said this is where the
Speed Force went when she died.

433
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,993
- Whoa.
That old car is hella vintage.

434
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:19,169
Almost looks brand new.

435
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:22,347
- Must be a collector
or something.

436
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,392
- We can ask him
when we're done.

437
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:26,394
Assuming we survive.

438
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:35,534
- Caitlin called me
about Alexa.

439
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,450
- So it turns out,

440
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:41,975
when Iris and I brought back
the Speed Force,

441
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:46,283
we also created
three new forces.

442
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:51,419
It's our fault that they're out
in the world hurting people.

443
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:53,421
Killing them.

444
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:55,380
So I feel like...

445
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:58,600
I have to be the one
to take them out.

446
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,994
- These forces.

447
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:04,693
You think
they're above saving, too?

448
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:10,046
- I think it would be safer for
everybody if they didn't exist.

449
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:13,659
- You remember when Wally
first showed up?

450
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:16,792
Man, it wasn't just that
I'd found out I have a son.

451
00:23:16,836 --> 00:23:18,403
I found out

452
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:23,103
I have a son who kept getting
his butt in trouble.

453
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:26,454
Boy, he was mad at the world.

454
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:28,413
There was one point

455
00:23:28,456 --> 00:23:32,329
he said to me that he wished
he had never been born.

456
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:38,074
So I tried to get close.

457
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:40,120
And he pushed me away.

458
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:42,731
I tried to give him space,

459
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:44,907
then he felt abandoned.

460
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:46,909
No parent is perfect.

461
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:50,696
But one thing I never
stopped doing

462
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:52,567
was trying.

463
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:55,004
And look at the man
he grew up to be.

464
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:59,531
Strong. Kind. Good.

465
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:03,099
- Yeah I get it, I--I do,but...

466
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:05,101
I mean, these forces?

467
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:07,756
They're not my children.
- You sure?

468
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,455
You said it yourself.

469
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:13,240
You brought them
into this world.

470
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:17,940
Look, I know they've all done
terrible things.

471
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:20,552
But what if they could change?

472
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:27,123
You never judge your kids
for who they are now.

473
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,604
You help them become...

474
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:35,305
who they know they can be
when they grow up.

475
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,613
So lead with love.

476
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:44,010
After that, it is up to them.

477
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:04,160
- This is Barry's old room.

478
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:27,053
Nora?

479
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,369
Psych.

480
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:45,724
- Hi, Mom.

481
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:58,693
- Esperanza, don't kill me!

482
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:00,695
- They're everywhere.
We need to keep them out.

483
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:03,089
- Psych, stop. You're hurting
them--please.

484
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:05,004
- Oh, they're hurting
themselves.

485
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:06,571
Sure, I pull back the curtain.

486
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:08,268
But what they see
is up to them.

487
00:26:08,311 --> 00:26:10,705
Now, before I show you
your worst fear,

488
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:12,228
why were you looking for me?

489
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:13,490
- I wasn't.

490
00:26:13,534 --> 00:26:14,753
- No...

491
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:18,060
You're looking for
the Speed Force?

492
00:26:18,104 --> 00:26:19,888
Nora. Why?

493
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:21,368
Why are you so desperate
to find her?

494
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:22,761
Is it to hurt her?

495
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:24,589
- I want to talk to her
so I can help her.

496
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,721
- Are you sure?
Because I am

497
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:30,377
feeling the pain that she
has inflicted upon you.

498
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,162
How deeply she's torn apart
your relationships.

499
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:34,424
Your whole life.

500
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,644
Actually, the suffering
she's caused is

501
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:38,646
quite beautiful.
- That wasn't Nora.

502
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,648
She's lost control.
Just like you have.

503
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:42,781
But if you let me,
I can help you both.

504
00:26:42,824 --> 00:26:44,434
I don't need your help.

505
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:47,873
Besides, I can feel
what you fear the most.

506
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:50,963
It's the person you seek.

507
00:26:51,006 --> 00:26:53,661
Well, your wish is my command.

508
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:12,027
- Sweet dreams,
my beautiful boy.

509
00:27:16,423 --> 00:27:17,903
You'll never measure up.

510
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:24,039
- Okay. It's working.

511
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,694
Now, when you're close enough
to cycle particles,

512
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:28,696
the disc will light up.

513
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,916
- Guys, I appreciate you
helping me.

514
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,135
- Make sure the proton
collection housing's

515
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,224
double-fused.

516
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:37,531
- We did.

517
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,838
And it's good to see you.

518
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:41,622
- What changed your mind?

519
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:43,580
- Look, this is dangerous.

520
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:45,800
And it doesn't feel right.

521
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:51,327
But I'm always gonna
have your back.

522
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:52,677
No matter what.

523
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:58,508
- Chester. Let's get it going.

524
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,206
- Okay, so. Barry.

525
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:02,338
All you need to do is
get close enough to the

526
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:05,777
Speed Force lightning to
collect a sample of each force.

527
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,912
The PHC and Timeless Wells'
time bubble should do the rest.

528
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,088
Theoretically.

529
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:16,439
- Ready?

530
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,624
- Nothing's happening.

531
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:30,410
You gonna--
- Wait for it.

532
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:31,541
Wait for it.

533
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,726
Incredible.

534
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,728
- We're at 100% organic speed.

535
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:45,512
- We need you...

536
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:46,861
I need you.

537
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:06,489
- I remember this moment.

538
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:09,275
This is where it all started.

539
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:17,674
- We should get to the roof.

540
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,794
- You think you can be
a good wife?

541
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,796
Good mother?

542
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,059
But you never will.

543
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:57,889
Everything you do pales
in comparison to me.

544
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:01,283
Besides...
how could you be a good mother

545
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:04,634
if you never even had one?
- I'm not listening to you.

546
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,071
- You don't have to.

547
00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:07,072
You already know
it's the truth.

548
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:08,987
- No. You're not real.

549
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,206
- There's no escaping
your own fear.

550
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,035
- I know you're still here,
Psych.

551
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:17,473
- Very good. Mm.

552
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:19,040
It is not every day that

553
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,956
somebody can sense my presence
in their nightmare.

554
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,916
- I'm not just someone.
We have a connection.

555
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,656
I know you can feel that too.

556
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,485
- Perhaps. It's not going to
help you, though.

557
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:32,227
Escape one nightmare and I'll
just serve up another.

558
00:30:32,271 --> 00:30:35,883
Because there's always more
terror to unlock.

559
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:44,718
- But before you
had those powers,

560
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,982
before you became a force.
You were a person.

561
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:50,680
I'm talking to that person
right now.

562
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,334
I have friends. I have a team.

563
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:54,902
They can help you fight this
monster that's inside of you.

564
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:57,122
We can help you regain control
of your body.

565
00:30:57,165 --> 00:31:00,299
- What makes you think
I'm not in control?

566
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:03,432
- I know you didn't...
choose to have these powers.

567
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:06,087
And you shouldn't have to
go through this alone.

568
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,307
I know that we're not flesh
and blood.

569
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,613
But in a way...

570
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:14,008
I'm--I'm like a parent.

571
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:19,405
So please let me help you.

572
00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:47,563
- Well, then there's something
I should tell you, Mother.

573
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:49,739
I hated my parents.

574
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:16,244
- The isotopic energy readings
are going down.

575
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:18,420
- The forces are dying.

576
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:26,254
- These fools gonna learn.

577
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:28,300
You mess with Deon.
You get dealt with.

578
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:40,225
- Another 20 seconds, and
they'll be gone forever.

579
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:43,968
Barry did it.

580
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:45,970
- Okay.

581
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:48,015
- Wait...wait.

582
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,191
What is that?

583
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:59,679
- I think that is an act
of creation.

584
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,337
- I have the particles.

585
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,382
Shouldn't the forces be dying?

586
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:10,995
- Perhaps they are.
Somewhere.

587
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,129
In time, but right here?
Right now?

588
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,784
They're being born.

589
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,495
- What are you doing to me?

590
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,280
- I wasn't able to get
through to him.

591
00:33:35,323 --> 00:33:38,239
And now it's too late.
- Boss, we can't stay here.

592
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:53,385
- Allen.

593
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:55,517
You okay?

594
00:33:55,561 --> 00:34:01,306
- Never judge your kids
for who they are now.

595
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:08,139
You help them become
who they know they can be.

596
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:10,054
- They're almost gone.

597
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:11,533
- 5%.

598
00:34:11,577 --> 00:34:12,665
4...

599
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:16,799
3%...

600
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,066
2%...

601
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:56,404
- What's happening?

602
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:58,363
Everything just stopped.

603
00:34:58,406 --> 00:35:00,408
- The numbers
are going back up.

604
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:03,194
It's as if the forces
are still here...

605
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:08,895
- Iris was right.

606
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:11,158
You all were.

607
00:35:11,202 --> 00:35:14,422
I--

608
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:15,989
I couldn't do it.

609
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:33,290
- Iris...

610
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:34,291
I'm sorry.

611
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:35,379
- Yeah, me too.

612
00:35:43,213 --> 00:35:44,954
- Barry, I--um...

613
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:46,695
I went looking for Nora.

614
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:49,045
I thought that if I could just
talk to her,

615
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:51,482
that I could fix everything.

616
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,136
But, um.

617
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,662
I ended up finding Psychinstead.

618
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:57,837
You were right.

619
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,665
I couldn't get through to him.

620
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:03,538
And it probably would have been
the same with Nora.

621
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:04,974
I should have listened to you.

622
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:07,977
- No, I'm the one who should
have listened.

623
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:12,808
- Harrison told me about
the birth of the forces.

624
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:15,419
Sounds incredible.

625
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:17,334
- It was.

626
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,687
Can't believe how close I came
to erasing them.

627
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,691
- What changed your mind?
- You.

628
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:28,519
Joe. Everyone.

629
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:31,697
Even the forces themselves.

630
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,176
I could...

631
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,572
I could feel how they would
affect the future.

632
00:36:37,615 --> 00:36:40,749
All the speedsters' and heroes'
lives they'd shape.

633
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:44,231
Some of them were family,
Iris.

634
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:47,408
Our family.

635
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:49,845
- Barry, we both know how
dangerous these forces can be.

636
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:51,281
I mean, if you couldn't
uncreate them,

637
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:54,197
and I couldn't get through toPsych...

638
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:56,634
What are we supposed to do?
- Try again.

639
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:58,680
Together this time.

640
00:36:58,724 --> 00:37:01,552
Joe helped me realize
that we can't judge

641
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:05,034
Psych and Deon
for who they are now.

642
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:08,168
We have to help them become
who they can grow up to be.

643
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:10,344
- 'Cause
that's what parents do.

644
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:18,395
 Alexa.

645
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:25,794
- What happened?
- There was a tremor.

646
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:28,536
And Alexa sat up
and looked at me.

647
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,103
- Alexa's alive?

648
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:33,410
- She was for a second,
but she's not anymore.

649
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:37,240
Which doesn't make any sense,
medically speaking.

650
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:39,068
- What if us being back in sync

651
00:37:39,112 --> 00:37:40,940
is what woke her up for
the moment?

652
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:43,943
- And then she reconnected
with the Strength Force.

653
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:49,513
- Is it crazy to think
that we did this?

654
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:51,167
- No.

655
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:53,082
'Cause we're all connected.

656
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:55,258
And if we woke her up once.

657
00:37:55,302 --> 00:37:59,088
- Then we could bring her back
permanently?

658
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,393
Why is everyone looking at me?

659
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:54,230
- Listen.
I'd ask you to say, but...

660
00:38:54,274 --> 00:38:55,928
I already know the answer.

661
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:58,495
- A man's gotta be
where his heart lies.

662
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:04,850
He's just gotta learn to
listen to it.

663
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:14,816
One more thing
before I go.

664
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,297
Whether it's me...

665
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:23,346
or any of the many Wells
predecessors,

666
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,089
I want you to know
that you taught us

667
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:30,963
every inch as much
as we taught you.

668
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:32,703
Maybe more.

669
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:48,894
- Yeah, I'm never gonna
get used to that.

670
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:56,597
You okay?

671
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,991
- Yeah.

672
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:01,558
For the first time
in a long while.

673
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:03,909
Yeah, I feel okay.

674
00:40:05,258 --> 00:40:06,476
- Good.

675
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,391
Um...'cause I've been thinking
about something.

676
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:12,961
And after tonight,
I know I have to do it.

677
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:15,311
- Okay, that's just weird.

678
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:21,187
I was literally about to say
the exact same thing to you.

679
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,929
I have to leave
Central City.

680
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,150
Thank God.

681
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:31,110
- Are you kidding me?

682
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:32,676
Oh, my God.

683
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,071
Babe, what are you gonna
tell Team Citizen?

684
00:40:36,115 --> 00:40:38,944
- What are you gonna tell
Team Flash?

685
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:09,061
- You're the one
who's after me?

686
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:11,280
You don't look so tough.

687
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:21,595
What are you?

688
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:23,858
- A reckoning.
