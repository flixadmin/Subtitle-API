1
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,475
You can do this.

2
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,478
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

3
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,831
...number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

4
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,711
Third try.
Walt, if you're there, please pick up.

5
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,149
I really wanted to do this together
but I can hear him getting up.

6
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,113
It's not like I can keep him
from seeing the thing.

7
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,995
So, I'm sorry, but I've waited
as long as possible and I...

8
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,760
I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead
without you.

9
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,475
So call me.

10
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,555
- Hey.
- Hey. Happy birthday, sweet 16.

11
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,595
Thanks, Mom.

12
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,234
Of course,
I thought you might sleep through it.

13
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,795
So since it's almost, oh, noon...

14
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,074
...I think your first big birthday
decision is breakfast or lunch?

15
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,829
- Pancakes?
- Pancakes it is.

16
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,473
Oh, could you do me a favour?

17
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,240
I forgot to get the paper.
Can you grab it for me?

18
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,192
- Sure.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,309
Surprise.

20
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,795
It's from me and your dad.
It's pretty slick, huh?

21
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,912
Yeah. Thanks, Mom. It's... It's great.

22
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,992
I really did a lot of research...

23
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,237
...and, I don't know,
this car just really stood out to me.

24
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,831
It's got a ton of great features,
power everything, solid engine.

25
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,669
It's really roomy so you can,
you know, carpool with all your friends.

26
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,952
And, of course,
it is safe because I'm still your mother.

27
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,593
And it has a CD player...

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,473
...so you can listen to tunes
while cruising around.

29
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,073
So you know what? Breakfast can wait.
You wanna take it for a spin?

30
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,312
Maybe later. I'm kind of starving.

31
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,880
Yeah, okay. Well, let's...
Let's get those pancakes going.

32
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,234
Saul, he's here.

33
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,715
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

34
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,399
Saul?

35
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,112
Send him in.

36
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,515
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

37
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,636
- Hey.
- Yeah, hi.

38
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,637
Have a seat, please.

39
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,038
I...

40
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,198
I don't understand why I'm here.

41
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,710
- Something to do with my creditors?
- Creditors? No.

42
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,599
I'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Beneke.
I have some bad news.

43
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,309
Nothing but lately.

44
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,909
Your Great-aunt Birgit passed away.

45
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,989
I'm sorry, who?

46
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,679
Apparently she passed away
in Diekirch, Luxembourg.

47
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,155
And this was- Wow, eight years ago.

48
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,636
I just assumed you two were close,
given that...

49
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,868
Well, maybe this is good news.

50
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,710
Birgit left behind a sizeable estate...

51
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,196
...of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

52
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,355
What?

53
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,075
She had no immediate relatives
so the estate's just been sitting...

54
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,875
...while the folks over in the EU
searched for a living heir.

55
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,513
Well, I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg.

56
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,632
Definitely no one
who would name me in their will.

57
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,788
Well...

58
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,590
Well, here we go. She left no will.
So that's probably why it took so long.

59
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,109
They traced the inheritance
to your father.

60
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,949
But having passed- My condolences.
- You are the next in line...

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,679
...to the tune of $621,552.33.

62
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,116
And when does Don Eladio arrive?

63
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,200
Let's see how the cook goes first.

64
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,272
Who's the chemist?

65
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,079
Is this a joke?

66
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,635
He's asking if you're the chemist.

67
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,955
I'm one of them.

68
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,993
Okay, we've all met.

69
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,353
Let's get to work.

70
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,120
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

71
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,029
Please show him the phenylacetic acid.

72
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,311
We synthesize it ourselves.

73
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,517
All the ingredients are here.

74
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,476
They synthesize their own.

75
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,673
What?

76
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,794
I don't do that.

77
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,555
What's the problem?

78
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,753
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid
from the barrel with the bee on it.

79
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,952
That's how I know how to do it.

80
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,990
Mr. Pinkman was under the impression
that the phenylacetic acid...

81
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,556
...would already be synthesized
upon his arrival.

82
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,839
Any sophomore chemistry
student can make it.

83
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,033
What kind of amateur
have you brought us?

84
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,350
- What's he saying?
- We're working it out.

85
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,515
This is ridiculous.

86
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,393
I'm not letting some infant...

87
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,315
...who can't even synthesize
phenylacetic acid...

88
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,995
...teach me my business.

89
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,028
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn
how to make my product...

90
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,358
...he's gotta do it my way.
The right way.

91
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,709
I speak English.

92
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,748
So you understand
what "asshole" means.

93
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,556
Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid,
asshole.

94
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,834
How long is it gonna take
to get him what he needs?

95
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,555
I don't know. I have no idea.
Several hours, at least.

96
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,594
I can wait. Gives us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

97
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,950
Don't you have standards?

98
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,195
I mean, this place is disgusting.

99
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,791
All right, we're gonna scour every vat,
every tank, every cook surface.

100
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,348
We clean up every possible source
of contamination. And then we cook.

101
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,917
Who do you think you are?

102
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,749
I'm the guy your boss brought here
to show you how it's done.

103
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,952
And if this is how you run your lab,
no wonder.

104
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,075
You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.
Now, if you don't want that to happen...

105
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,389
...I suggest you stop whining
like a little bitch, and do what I say.

106
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,639
Clean up!

107
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,478
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

108
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,478
...number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

109
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,431
Dad, you there?
I'm outside. Are you okay?

110
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,839
I know you're home, your car is here.

111
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,828
You missed my party which feels like
something's gotta be really wrong.

112
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,797
I... I'm gonna have to call 911.
I don't know what else to do.

113
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,197
Dad?

114
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,589
Come in, if you're coming in.

115
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,108
What happened to you?

116
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,031
What happened?

117
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,156
I got into a fight.

118
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,319
What do you mean, a fight?
Like-? What fight?

119
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,108
Are you gonna talk to me here?

120
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,199
What are you doing?

121
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,630
- I'm calling Mom.
- Don't do that.

122
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,997
Look, I...

123
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,629
I appreciate that you're concerned,
but I'm fine.

124
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,916
Just do not call your mother.

125
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,678
Why not?

126
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,397
Because...

127
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,710
...I was gambling.

128
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,111
If you tell your mother, I just -

129
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,153
I will never, never hear the end of it.

130
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,874
So please.

131
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,990
Can we just keep this between us?
Would you do that for me?

132
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,432
Just... Just keep it to yourself.

133
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,476
I don't understand.
How'd you get into a fight?

134
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,194
And with who?

135
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,274
I made a mistake.

136
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,553
It's my own fault.

137
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,238
- I had it coming.
- Dad...

138
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,351
...it's okay.

139
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,836
It's all my fault.

140
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,478
I just...

141
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,112
I'm sorry.

142
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,913
I'm sorry.

143
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,519
Dad.

144
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,116
Come here.

145
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,595
Come on. Dad, it's okay.

146
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,473
No. Hey, hey, no.

147
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,468
- It's okay. Come on, please. It's okay.
- No.

148
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,999
Look at me. Look at me.

149
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,157
It's okay. It is. Come on.

150
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,193
Come on.

151
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,393
Come on.

152
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,750
It's-It's okay.

153
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,913
Hey.

154
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,310
How was your birthday?

155
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,759
Good. Get some rest.

156
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,793
Okay.

157
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,591
The new car...

158
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,671
...did you drive it here?

159
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,753
Yeah.

160
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,439
That's good.

161
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,517
You like it?

162
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,596
Sure. I do.

163
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,799
It drives great.

164
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,556
That's good, Jesse.

165
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,039
Yes.

166
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,798
- Yes.
- Well done.

167
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,116
The first of many.

168
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,753
Yeah? What's that mean?

169
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,270
You're staying.
You belong to the cartel now.

170
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,830
You can't come to my work like this.
You're too recognisable.

171
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,750
Your face is plastered on every
bus bench within a five-mile radius.

172
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,589
Celebrities have to get their cars
washed just like everybody else.

173
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,030
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

174
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,071
- Okay?
- What is it?

175
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,068
Well, I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke. Right?

176
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,636
Which, I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

177
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,435
Yes, but it is better than prison,
correct?

178
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,030
Marginally. Which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

179
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,275
All right, good.

180
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,755
Yeah. I can't believe
he actually bought it.

181
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,428
Great-aunt Birgit. What?

182
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,871
But you called it. People see zeroes
dance before their eyes...

183
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,958
- ...it's like highway hypnosis.
- So, what's the problem?

184
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,869
Let's just say, you and I don't
wear the same rose-coloured glasses...

185
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,991
...where Johnny Fabulous
is concerned.

186
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,715
So I kept an eye on his bank accounts,
and pulled his credit report.

187
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,878
If you would, note the time on that.

188
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,472
Three fifty-four p.m. yesterday.

189
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,310
- Three hours after leaving my office.
- He bought a Mercedes SL550.

190
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,909
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4500 down.

191
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,838
He's gonna pay 1830 a month.

192
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,918
Fully loaded.
He even got the heated steering wheel.

193
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,908
But that's upwards of 6300
that won't be going to the IRS.

194
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,910
I just thought you might like to know,
loath as I am to say, I told you so.

195
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,278
Where is he now?

196
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,599
Hey.

197
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,638
How you doing?

198
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,593
Good.

199
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,518
How are you?

200
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,638
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

201
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,028
I called her last night.

202
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,038
Oh, God.

203
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,949
I told her
I was spending the night at Louis'.

204
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,675
It's cool. So...

205
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,791
How are you?

206
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,072
I'm fine, son. I...

207
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,759
I...

208
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,957
Well, I...

209
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,119
I took these painkillers
that I had leftover from my surgery...

210
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,834
...and I made the brilliant decision...

211
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,237
...to wash them down
with a couple of beers.

212
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,753
Not my most sterling moment,
I admit.

213
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,949
But I'm fine.

214
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,111
I wish I could take back last night.
It was your birthday.

215
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,959
- This shouldn't be on your mind.
- It's okay.

216
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,115
No, it's not okay.

217
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,678
I'm your father,
and I don't want last night to be...

218
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,759
I mean, you really...

219
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,759
...can't think of me like...

220
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,155
Like what?

221
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,596
I don't understand.

222
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,756
My father died when I was 6.

223
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,554
- You knew that, right?
- Yeah.

224
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,953
He had Huntington's disease. It's...

225
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,031
It destroys portions of the brain...

226
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,032
...affects muscle control...

227
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,516
...leads to dementia,
it's just a nasty disease.

228
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,193
It's genetic.

229
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,837
Terrified my mother
that I might have it...

230
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,433
...so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid, but I came up clean.

231
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,870
My father fell very ill when I was...

232
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,119
...four or 5.

233
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,880
He spent a lot of time in the hospital.

234
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,358
My...

235
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,438
My mother would tell me
so many stories about my father.

236
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,554
She would talk about him
all the time.

237
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,869
I knew about his personality...

238
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,718
...how he treated people...

239
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,036
...I even knew how
he liked his steaks cooked.

240
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,753
Medium rare.

241
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,518
Just like you.

242
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,596
I knew things about my father.

243
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,199
I had a lot of information.

244
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,756
It's because people
would tell me these things.

245
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,077
They would paint this picture...

246
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,430
...of my father for me.

247
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,071
And I always pretended
that was who I saw too.

248
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,590
Who I remembered. But it was a lie.

249
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,191
In truth, I only have one real...

250
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,392
...actual memory of my father.

251
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,439
It must have been
right before he died.

252
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,315
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him.

253
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,069
And I remember the smell
in there, the chemicals.

254
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,874
It was as if they used up...

255
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,790
...every single cleaning product
they could find in a 50-mile radius.

256
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,115
Like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

257
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,799
There was this stench
of Lysol and bleach.

258
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,560
I mean, you could just feel it
coating your lungs.

259
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,239
Anyway, there lying on the bed...

260
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,317
...is my father.

261
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,032
He's all...

262
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,670
He's all twisted up.

263
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,711
And my mom...

264
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,037
...she puts me on her lap.

265
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,631
She's sitting on the bed next to him
so I can get a good look at him.

266
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,832
But really, he just scares me.

267
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,751
And he's looking right at me...

268
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,239
...but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

269
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,355
And your grandmother is talking...

270
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,552
...trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does...

271
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,199
...but the only thing
I could remember...

272
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,157
...is him breathing.

273
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,319
This...

274
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,150
This rattling sound.

275
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,790
Like if you were shaking
an empty spray paint can.

276
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,678
Like there was nothing in him.

277
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,639
Anyway...

278
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,191
...that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

279
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,556
I don't want you to think of me
the way I was last night.

280
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,759
I don't want that to be the memory
you have of me when I'm gone.

281
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,355
Remembering you that way...

282
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,674
...wouldn't be so bad.

283
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,309
The bad way to remember you
would be the way...

284
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,753
The way you've been
this whole last year.

285
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,034
At least last night you were...

286
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,911
You were real, you know?

287
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,354
- Bye.
- Bye.

288
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,116
Somewhere you should be?

289
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,992
Well, basically
it was a temporary hiatus.

290
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,556
But you give us two weeks, we will
be up and running 100 percent.

291
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,877
All right, you talk to your people
and get back to me, okay?

292
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,312
- Hi.
- Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

293
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,114
Okay. You bet.
Say hi to the kids for me.

294
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,199
- Hey.
- Hi.

295
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,469
Nice surprise. What's up?

296
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,035
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things are going.

297
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,438
Well, things are...
Things took a turn. It's kind of crazy.

298
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,635
Oh, yeah?

299
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,513
The universe is telling me something.
I got some good news.

300
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,676
Some very good news...

301
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,830
...and I'm getting the business
going again.

302
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,191
I figure we haven't been down long...

303
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,437
...so we should be able to get most
of our old contracts back. Sit.

304
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,710
Oh, thank you. That's -

305
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,791
Gosh, that's...

306
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,679
That's wow.

307
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,110
How is that even possible?

308
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:19,395
Well, I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

309
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,271
I guess someone's
looking out for me.

310
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,959
I guess so.

311
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,874
Is that yours, outside?

312
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,275
Yeah, well, you know...

313
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,357
...I can't be driving a piece of crap.

314
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,471
You got to present
that successful image.

315
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,276
Right. So the IRS stuff.
That's resolved?

316
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,959
Yeah, it's in progress.

317
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,275
So you paid them?

318
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,516
Well, not yet. But I will.

319
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,474
When?

320
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,349
Well, it's not that simple.

321
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,439
Here's the thing:
I never had proper legal counsel.

322
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,749
So I was thinking...

323
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,635
...I should hire someone good who can
maybe hammer out a better deal.

324
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,752
There will never
be a better deal, Ted.

325
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,155
The deal is you pay
your back taxes...

326
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,158
...you pay your penalty
and you don't go to prison.

327
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,193
That's a good deal. So...

328
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,038
Let's keep our priorities straight.

329
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,911
Well, my priority
is getting my business back.

330
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,352
And putting my employees back on the
payroll so they can pay the mortgages.

331
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,677
Right. But I think
your employees would agree...

332
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,872
...that you need to get
your financial situation in control...

333
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,071
...before you can help them.

334
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,555
Boy, the IRS
got you on commission?

335
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,149
I'm just saying that,
though I really understand...

336
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,193
...the temptation
to restart the business...

337
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,152
...maybe the universe is telling you...

338
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,749
...that you need to pay what you owe.

339
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,919
Skyler...

340
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,872
...this is my money.

341
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,996
Why are we having this conversation?
You're no longer a part of my life.

342
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,431
A decision you made, by the way.

343
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,757
So I don't understand
why you're hectoring me about this.

344
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,475
- Ted, this affects both of us.
- No it doesn't.

345
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,193
I'm telling you to drop this.

346
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,914
You need to use that money
to pay your bill.

347
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,479
By the end of this month.

348
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,433
Which you promised
the IRS in writing that you would do.

349
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,279
It is that simple.

350
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,759
Okay.

351
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,633
Okay, duly noted.

352
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,319
What does that mean?

353
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,870
Does that mean yes? Because
I really need a yes here, Ted.

354
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,072
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means. It means...

355
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,953
...in the most respectful way possible,
there's the door.

356
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,509
And I'm inviting you to, you know...

357
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,797
And thank you for your concern,
but I'm done talking about this.

358
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,472
From whom exactly do you think
you got that 600,000, Ted?

359
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,995
Great-aunt Birgit?

360
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,879
That was you?

361
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,513
Yeah.

362
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,152
What is this shit?

363
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,989
I don't get a vote?

364
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,515
I'm supposed to just
stay down here forever?

365
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,116
I promise you this:

366
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,275
Either we're all going home
or none of us are.

367
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,077
Now settle down.

368
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,478
On your feet.

369
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,794
Gustavo.

370
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,956
I'm so happy...

371
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,277
...you finally came to your senses.

372
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,716
May I present the cook.

373
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,319
This is your new employer.

374
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,590
You address him as Don Eladio.

375
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,916
It's a term of respect.

376
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,072
Hello, young man.

377
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,594
He doesn't speak
a word of Spanish, does he?

378
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,552
And he's no chemist...

379
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,153
...I'll tell you that.

380
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,388
I don't care if he's a pig farmer.

381
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,235
He cooks better meth than you do...

382
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,274
...with all your fancy
college degrees.

383
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,798
And this one will have
plenty of time to learn Spanish.

384
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,754
What's in there?

385
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,598
A gift?

386
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,559
Gustavo, you're so generous.

387
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,791
It's a token of respect.

388
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,275
In honour of our renewed friendship.

389
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,352
Let's see what's in here.

390
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,870
No, impossible!

391
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,919
Zafiro Añejo!

392
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,715
Look at this.

393
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,276
Even the bottle is a work of art.

394
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,192
It's perfection!

395
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,352
Perhaps...

396
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,120
...it's too good to share.

397
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,117
What do you think, Gustavo?

398
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,512
It's yours to do with as you choose.

399
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,595
I choose...

400
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,512
...to drink it!

401
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,912
Careful.

402
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,076
That's beautiful stuff.

403
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,838
If you spill a drop...

404
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,110
...I'll cut off your hand.

405
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,231
Come on, hurry up.

406
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,192
Gustavo.

407
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,230
Welcome to Mexico.

408
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,830
Now you say:

409
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,595
This one's an addict.

410
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,075
To work, he must be sober.

411
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,510
None for you!

412
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,192
Enough business!

413
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,516
Bring the girls!

414
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,550
No. No, no, I don't...

415
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,833
Gustavo.

416
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,833
Cheer up, man.

417
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,234
Gustavo...

418
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,556
...I'm not angry.

419
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,519
I had to spank you.

420
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,553
But what choice did I have?

421
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,588
Look, once every 20 years...

422
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,995
...you forget your place.

423
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,430
There's no place for emotion in this.

424
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,389
You of all people should understand.

425
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,155
Business is business.

426
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,672
If you'll excuse me.

427
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,196
- Where are you going?
- To use your bathroom.

428
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,271
If I may.

429
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,198
Miguel!

430
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,670
Show Gustavo the pisser.

431
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,636
And make sure he doesn't get lost.

432
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,678
Hurry up.

433
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,479
Make yourself useful. Find a gun.

434
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,477
Don Eladio is dead!

435
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,794
His capos are dead!

436
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,319
You have no one left to fight for!

437
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,076
Fill your pockets...

438
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,998
...and leave in peace!

439
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,590
Or fight me...

440
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,273
...and die!

441
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,796
I hope to hell that works.

442
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,558
Take him.

443
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,509
Keys.

444
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,438
No. No.

445
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,673
Okay. Okay.

446
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,279
Hey. Hey, you still with us?

447
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,833
Go.

448
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,111
Kid, get us out of here, kid.

449
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,473
Come on.
