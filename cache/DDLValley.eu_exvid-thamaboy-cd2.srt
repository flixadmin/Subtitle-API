1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,440
And a side of fucking Rod Stewart's jizz.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,840
Wait a minute. What are we drinking
water at a fucking bachelor party for, Phil?

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,400
You got to show my son your tits later.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,760
Promise me. Promise me.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,440
That's nice. Yeah, good.

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,200
This is great, sweetheart.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,840
Really good.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,520
Nice work. You're going deep on us, huh?

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,120
That's it.

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,840
What's this, sir?

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,080
That's just a little tip, you know,
if you give me a full package.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,080
Okay. That's a $150 additional charge.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,160
You're talking to the wrong guy.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,320
That's a little out of my price range.

15
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,080
lt includes scalp treatment, reflexology.

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,960
How much is it to tickle my pickle?

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,400
To yank my crank?
To give me a ho-jo to go?

18
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,440
Sweetheart, l'm not asking
for a finger up the ass.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,680
l just want you to just jerk it a little bit.

20
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,440
Donny, this isn't a brothel.

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,640
Then l'm completely confused
what the fuck we're doing here right now!

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,040
So, what, you're just going to
get a hand job in front of all of us?

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,680
l don't know. Am l?

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,920
l guess not!

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,280
You know, l have worked
very hard on this night, Don,

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,440
and you're being just plain rude.

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
-Phil, no! Phil!
-No, no. Don't do this.

28
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,760
Nice. That's nice.

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,080
That's good. That's good.

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,200
lt tickles.

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
Just fight through it, man. It's worth it.

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,560
lfyou stop, l swear l will kill you.

33
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,960
You know what,
if l don't see a tit in five minutes,

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,280
l'm going to strangle this motherfucker.

35
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,120
You should be ashamed of yourself
for fucking arranging this bullshit!

36
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,080
Well, l feel very relaxed,

37
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,320
and l think this was
a good use of a Groupon.

38
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,080
You fucked us, buddy!

39
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,160
Five more minutes till you
get to choose amongst four

40
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,480
artisanal house-blended
chocolates, gentlemen.

41
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,800
We can't let tonight end like this, boys.

42
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,920
We got to go out.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,040
l'm telling you, l can't let my son have a...

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,680
My son of a gun best friend
have his bachelor party be this.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,720
You fucking... You guys got your
face covered in leprechaun shit.

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
We should be getting whacked off,

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,920
all of us, as a fucking team!

48
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,600
Donny, l think
we've had enough excitement for one night.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,760
Besides, it's not like you can throw
together a whole other party this late.

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
l could have six chicks making out
with each other on our laps in 10 minutes.

51
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,840
l could stay out a little later.

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Bam!

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,400
We gonna get our dicks sucked.

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
There it is.

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,760
Unless, Mrs Ravensdale,
you want to whip them knockers out?

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
We'd love to see them.

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
All right, you know what?

58
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,920
You are an imbecilic,
immature, asinine, childish,

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,440
caveman-like, hairy-knuckled,
single-chromosomal,

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,880
obnoxious, uneducated, ignorant asshole

61
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,640
who l would like to fuck hard and long!

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,280
So, l'm going to go put a dent in that.

63
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,880
You guys get that green jizz off your face.

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
l'll be back in 20.

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
We're going out, boys!

66
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
Hey, this is the shit,
this place, l'm telling you.

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,880
The hottest chicks,
the best Denver omelettes.

68
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,040
-You have to eat one.
-All right.

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,040
-Donny!
-Yeah, this is who l was telling you about!

70
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,560
-What's up? Give me that.
-l'm so happy to see you.

71
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,400
-You look so fucking cute!
-l know, right?

72
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,240
And you brought a military man.

73
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,840
What's your name, soldier?

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,400
Chad Martin, private first class,
United States Marine Corps.

75
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,720
You think you can keep that dick
at attention for a couple hours?

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,880
That's an order!

77
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
Already on it.

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,880
Look at my man!

79
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,160
You guys, let me get in here
and introduce myself.

80
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,280
Hello. l'm Phil.
l'm married with four children,

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,160
and l have actually
only seen three vaginas in my entire life:

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,400
my wife's, my baby's

83
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,480
and my aunt's once by accident
on the back of a tandem bike.

84
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,960
Well, here's number four, baby!

85
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,320
l'm going to count that
as numbers four and five.

86
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,640
Champale would líke to dedícate thís

87
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,800
to Mr Todd Peterson.

88
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
-Yeah, baby. Yeah.
-Here you go.

89
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Oh, hey.

90
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,480
Do you want any eggs?

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,760
No. l really have to watch what l eat.

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,400
No fatty foods. But thank you.

93
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,800
l'm Brie.

94
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,200
l'm Todd. Nice to meet you.

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,040
l know who you are, Han Solo.

96
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,520
No, you can't...

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,280
Don't worry, your secret's safe.

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,960
Who did that?

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,080
-Gerald, get in the car.
-l love you, Donny!

100
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Yeah, l love you. Get in there.

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,600
Man, you got to give me the recipe, man.

102
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
Can't buy everything, Spirou!

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,760
Bro, but they use olive oil, not butter.

104
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,840
That's the big secret.

105
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,160
Okay, Chris, get him in there.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,440
Be gentle, he's protecting our country.

107
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,560
All right, good night, guys!

108
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,520
Gerald, you're a sick man, buddy!

109
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,880
Whoa.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey, what... Where's everybody going?

111
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,560
l sent them home, guy.

112
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,640
l thought we could have a little

113
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,320
best manlgroom alone time.

114
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,000
But shouldn't l go with them?

115
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,840
'Cause Jamie's gonna get mad at me.

116
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,280
Easy, guy.

117
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,320
You're gonna have plenty of time
for her to be mad at you when you're married.

118
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,680
l got you a wedding gift,
and l want to give it to you alone, all right?

119
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,760
You got me a gift?

120
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,080
Of course l got you.

121
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,560
And l think you might dig it.

122
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,440
An earring.

123
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,080
Yeah, l know, but that's an earring
that your mom gave me,

124
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,480
and l thought maybe we could
keep it in the family, you know?

125
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,680
Just kind of keep it going,
generation to generation, actually.

126
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,760
Yeah, but l don't have a pierced ear, Donny.

127
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
Yeah.

128
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,000
No.

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,760
Yeah.

130
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,800
All right, fuck it, fuck it.

131
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,040
Do it, just do it.

132
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,640
lt's not gonna hurt, buddy.

133
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
You got a nice buzz going.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
Yeah, l got it, l got it.

135
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,480
Hang on.

136
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,960
Yeah.

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Liquor it up.

138
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,320
Fuck!

139
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,680
Come here. Come here.

140
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,640
Hang in there! Go ahead, just sit still, homie.

141
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,960
Yeah!

142
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,960
How we doing?

143
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,280
Oh, God.

144
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,160
That's it. That's the way to man up.

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
-That wasn't so bad.
-Let me see it.

146
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,480
Am l bleeding?

147
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
-l don't think so.
-No?

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
Does it look good?

149
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,920
You look like you could be playing
drums for Foreigner or some shit.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,040
You look like a bad-ass.

151
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,800
-Really?
-Yeah.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
'Cause it makes me feel kind of...

153
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,320
Dangerous.

154
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,600
There he is, man!

155
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,280
That's your personality,
like when you were seven years old,

156
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,480
me and Uncle Vanny used to
Iaugh our asses off from you.

157
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,840
Uncle Vanny, that's right.

158
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,560
What happened to that guy?

159
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,040
Dude, you know what it's time for?

160
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,120
To get you back together with the old gang.

161

That's all l've been waiting for

189
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,240
More than life itself.

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,680
Hansie, Hansie.

321
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,240
Why don't you not call me
''Donny'' when no one's around.

322
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,800
You can call me ''Dad.''

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,280
Yeah, l know, l know.

324
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,520
lt's...

325
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,880
l don't know if l'm ready for that, Donny.

326
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,240
-You know?
-Yeah, yeah.

327
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,960
No prob.

328
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
Sorry.

329
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,040
Sorry if you fucking don't like me.

330
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,200
l probably would've fucked my teacher, too.

331
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,520
Yeah.

332
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,240
But...

333
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,480
So, what time are we gonna
go to the prison tomorrow?

334
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,920
Wait, you'll go to the prison?

335
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,080
Yeah, l'll go.

336
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,240
No. No, no, no, no, no.

337
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,680
That's... They cancelled that.

338
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,560
l talked to the warden, and he says
that your mother was just pulling our leg.

339
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,360
She's only got the chicken pox.

340
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,000
-What?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, l know.

341
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,880
She said she was dying because

342
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,640
they give you better food
if you're wicked sick like that,

343
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,840
like Beefaroni or microwave pizza
or some shit, so...

344
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,800
That just made me hungry.

345
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,920
Well, check your pockets.

346
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
A treasure!

347
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come on, eat it.

348
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,560
-No, it's nasty.
-Come on, l'm telling you.

349
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,560
Fucking Todd Bridges
worked hard on that thing.

350
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,280
Yeah. You like that.

351
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,400
Pretty good.

352
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,080
Look at me, l'm a fountain!

353
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,480
Throw a penny in here!

354
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,480
Make a wish, motherfucker!

355
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,280
What the...

356
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,840
Grandma D, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

357
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Well, you've had the fantasy,

358
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,960
so now it's time that you try the real thing.

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
No, no, no, l can't do that.

360
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,520
l'm sorry.

361
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
l appreciate the offer.

362
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,640
No, no, no, don't.

363
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,080
l can't. Don't you... l shouldn't.

364
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,120
Oh, God.

365
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,120
You got the old-timey bathing suit on.

366
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,120
Okay, l'm in.

367
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,760
l'm going to ride you like a Model T.

368
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,080
Yeah.

369
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,480
Jamie.

370
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,280
You're wearing your dress again.

371
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,280
You look beautiful.

372
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,840
l want you so bad.

373
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,040
Be nice to me.

374
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,200
Make me feel good.

375
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,600
All right, all right.

376
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,040
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

377
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,040
Oh, my God!

378
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,560
Help me!

379
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,680
What happened?
Are you okay?

380
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,680
Do l sound okay?

381
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
You puked all over my wedding dress!

382
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,760
Prepare to get fucked up, motherfuckers!

383
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,560
Sorry, l heard you scream.

384
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
l thought Jamie was getting murdered,

385
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,320
so l was gonna fucking
smack someone around.

386
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,240
-What happened?
-l don't know!

387
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,000
l just found my wedding dress
covered in barf!

388
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,200
And something else, something sticky.

389
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,960
lt's jizz.

390
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,520
You puked on my dress and then fucked it!

391
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,240
You're a madman.

392
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,960
No, no, no, no. No.

393
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,800
-Sweetheart, it wasn't my boy.
-You shut up.

394
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,920
Donny, just shut up!

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,240
Who wants a piece ofthis, huh?

396
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,000
-Who wants a piece?
-Whoa, no, no, no!

397
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
lt's okay, buddy.

398
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,880
Todd just fucked the dress.

399
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,360
lt's under control.

400
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,080
What is Vanilla Ice doing in our room?

401
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,360
He's my other best friend.

402
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
Yeah. And a wicked good rapper.

403
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,800
Give it up for him. Come on, now.

404
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,160
-Let's give it up.
-My boy.

405
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,360
l don't know what's going on here,

406
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,840
but l don't have time to deal with this, so...

407
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,360
Okay, this is what's gonna happen.

408
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,320
l'm gonna go take a shower.
l'm gonna go to Pilates.

409
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,240
You're gonna take that dress
to the dry cleaners!

410
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,960
And then we're gonna have
rehearsal dinner tonight,

411
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,920
and you're gonna be
the normal Todd from three days ago, right?

412
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,440
And you can start by taking out
that stupid Duran Duran earring!

413
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,000
l was thinking it's more Foreigner.

414
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,320
No? No, no,
Duran Duran's a good call, though.

415
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,520
Guess l'm gonna go
finish up with Grandma Delores.

416
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,600
-Yeah.
-ls that all right?

417
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,720
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Have fun, buddy. Have fun.

418
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,840
Not too much, though. Don't hurt her.

419
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,280
No, no. l get it right and keep it tight.

420
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,680
Okay.

421
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,600
Look, l need a couple hours to fix this.

422
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,040
Hey, we've all been in that situation,
and you'll be fine, kid.

423
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,680
l'll whip up some pancakes
for everyone else, all right?

424
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,040
-All right.
-l love it.

425
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,880
You jizzed on a mannequin.

426
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,160
Respect it.

427
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,960
But you were only 13.

428
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,960
She took advantage of you.

429
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,480
No, all right.
That's what the law says, Su-Jin,

430
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
but l don't know...
We were kind of like soul mates.

431
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,880
You know, there was...
There was a connection there.

432
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
l never had it with anyone else.

433
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,560
l'm getting a call. l'm sorry, guys.

434
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,520
Do not touch these plates. l'm cleaning them.

435
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,600
Okay, Su-Jin?

436
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,600
Go for Donny B.

437
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,320
Wassup!

438
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,320
Hey, big man. What's going on?

439
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,440
How'd it go with the lady?

440
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,960
You patch things up?

441
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,640
Yeah, pretty much. It was amazing.

442
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,400
The dry cleaner said they've
definitely seen that combo of fluid before.

443
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
You see? Yeah, those things
go together like gin and tonic.

444
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,720
Hey, lísten, whíle I got you,

445
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,000
l left you a little
best man gift on your dresser.

446
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,240
l think you'll get a kick out of it.

447
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,760
You did not. Oh, my God.

448
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,760
My whole body, like,
got a shocked feeling over that.

449
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,240
Buddy, no one gets me a gift.

450
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,360
-Where are you, anyways?
-l'm in the car.

451
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,240
l decided to go see Mom after all.

452
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,320
You did what?

453
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,080
Oh, my God. Dukes of Hazzard!

454
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,240
Hansie.

455
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,920
Donny, what are you doing here?

456
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
We got to get out of here now.

457
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,040
What? What are you talking about?

458
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,480
lt's your wedding weekend, dude.

459
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,600
You come here after the wedding.

460
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,760
You show your mother your new ring.

461
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,160
That would make her happy.

462
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,160
Wait, are you nervous to see her?

463
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,880
Hansie, can we just blow this place off
and have a beer, please? l'm begging you.

464
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,040
Look. Is that her?

465
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,720
Oh, my God.

466
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,720
There you are.

467
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:14,240
My little Hansie, you're all grown up.

468
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,960
Hi, Mom.

469
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,960
l didn't know if l'd ever see you again.

470
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,920
l know. l'm sorry l stopped visiting.

471
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
lt just got too hard.

472
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,200
No, l totally understand.

473
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,520
Wow.

474
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,880
You still have my eyes.

475
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,080
ls that the earring
that l gave you after the Loverboy concert?

476
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,120
Yes, it is, Miss McGarricle.

477
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,040
You know, l think about you every day.

478
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,960
Fuck, l love you so much, Miss McGarricle.

479
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,240
l love you, too.

480
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,840
Do you remember...

481
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Oh, God, here we go.

482
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,760
...all the nasty things
that l taught you, Donny?

483
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course l do, Miss McGarricle.

484
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,520
Are you still my dirty boy?

485
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,200
Yeah, l'm the dirtiest boy
you'll ever know, Miss McGarricle.

486
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,080
Donny.

487
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,120
Oh, fuck, yeah.

488
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,800
l'm hard right now. l'm hard.

489
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,440
Okay. Yeah, l'm hating that, so...

490
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,840
But it is really good to see you, Mom. l...

491
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,040
lt's good to see you, too, baby.

492
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,480
Can you describe
what you're feeling right now, Han?

493
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,400
TV's Randall Morgan?

494
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,520
What are you doing here?

495
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,480
Must be quite emotional
for you to be face-to-face

496
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,880
with the woman
who molested your father, isn't it?

497
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,360
-What is going on right now?
-Who is this dude?

498
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,280
Listen, before you get mad at me...

499
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,960
This is why you came to see me?

500
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,040
For some reality TV ambush?

501
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,840
-No.
-How much they paying you, Donny?

502
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,480
Nothing, l swear to God. l'm not getting...

503
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,840
Fifty thousand dollars
to deliver you to this prison.

504
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,560
All right, it was 50 grand, but l'm not...
l'm not...

505
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,160
l'm not going to do it. l swear to God.

506
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
l'm not... l would never take his money.

507
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,840
Donny Berger, what have you done?

508
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,480
Hansie, dude, it's me.

509
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,040
lt's the guy from last night.

510
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,360
We had fun. Don't fuck it.

511
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
l'm telling you, this is...

512
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,600
This is something that can be fixed.

513
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,160
-You're unreal.
-Hansie.

514
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,120
What...

515
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,600
You go after him, Donny,
and you take care of our son.

516
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,640
-Hansie.
-Come on, he is pissed. Fuck!

517
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,040
-Take care of our baby, Donny!
-Hansie!

518
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,160
Hansie, please, let me explain to you...

519
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,040
l can't believe l let you
back into my life again.

520
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,280
Guy, guy, just come on. Listen to me.

521
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,400
l owe the IRS a lot of money.

522
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,600
-Of course you do.
-l know, l know. l'm a fuck-up.

523
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,760
But if l don't give them 43 G's by Tuesday,
l'm going to prison.

524
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,720
Wait, so you're telling me,

525
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,000
if l give you 43 grand,
you don't have to go to jail?

526
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
l will pay you back, l swear to God.

527
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,520
Would you loan me the money?

528
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,240
No! Fuck you!

529
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:45,280
-Get your shit out of my boss's house!
-Okay!

530
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,480
No! Don't do that.

531
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,440
That's my boy there.

532
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,560
No.

533
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,280
l think he just shit his pants.

534
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,960
Tell me you got that on camera.

535
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,080
You made me throw out my extra underwear!

536
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,240
l'm sorry. l didn't know
you were going to shit yourself again.

537
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,600
That was awesome.

538
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,160
That was awesome.

539
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,640
Donny, couldn't have gone any better.
Loved it.

540
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,360
You know what l need from you, Todd,
is l need you

541
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,640
-to sign the release form right...
-Fuck you!

542
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Get away from me!

543
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,000
Get those cameras off me!

544
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,320
l hate you, Dad.

545
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,400
Hansie!

546
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,160
l can't pay you a dime
unless l got a release form.

547
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,240
Fuck.

548
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,840
Did l get any shit on me?

549
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,080
Let me off here. Let me off.
Let me get off. l'll fucking run up.

550
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,520
Keep it running.

551
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,920
l got to pick my shit up.

552
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,200
You're so adorable.

553
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,280
No, l know, but l told you
not to call me on this line.

554
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,800
What if Todd picks up?

555
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,240
No, no, no, l want to.

556
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,200
No, Steve.

557
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,800
Todd doesn't know anything.

558
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,400
l don't care if he finds out after the wedding.

559
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,800
There's nothing he can do
about it then anyway.

560
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,280
You're so sweet.

561
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,920
Steve, huh?

562
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,360
Well, Steve Spirou, l'm going to fuck you up.

563
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,000
l'm going to fuck you up!

564
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,520
Well, l got some great news.

565
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:02,040
l've made my decision
on who my new partner is.

566
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,520
Phil!

567
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,440
Phil, l knew you could do it.

568
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,880
Look at Phil's face.

569
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,280
l'm just busting your balls, Phil.

570
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,960
No, l'd never pick you.

571
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,240
Oh, no.

572
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,720
lt's you, Todd. Partners.

573
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,040
Partner.

574
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,120
Oh, my gosh.

575
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,320
lt's going to be a lot more hours
and a lot more responsibility.

576
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,560
You know that, right?

577
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,880
And a lot more money!

578
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,200
-Somebody's going shopping!
-Yeah!

579
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,320
l thought he left.

580
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,040
Yeah, that's what you wish, Steve.

581
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,040
l need to talk to you, homeboy. Yeah.

582
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,120
Hey, Jamie.

583
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,760
Listen. Listen.

584
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,560
Dude, this is not about you and me, all right?

585
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,520
You're not marrying the right girl.

586
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,680
She is cheating on you.

587
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,520
You are unbelievable.

588
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,600
Can't you just let it go?

589
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,920
This is my last chance to be normal.

590
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
Are you determined to ruin my life?

591
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,560
-Honey, what's going on?
-Nothing.

592
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,920
Don't ''honey'' him,
you little snake in the grass.

593
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,680
l heard your phone call.

594
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,560
''Steve, why'd you call on this line?

595
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,000
''Todd could have picked up.''

596
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,240
That's right, sonny boy.

597
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,080
Your wife-to-be's fucking your boss.

598
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Right there.

599
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,800
Fuck you, buddy.

600
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,840
You are an idiot!

601
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,000
ls that right, sweetheart?

602
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,440
-Yes, it is.
-Yeah, yeah. Why?

603
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,800
l was on the phone with Steve.

604
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:19,960
Steve Goldstein,
the Boston Herald wedding reporter.

605
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,080
Yeah, he's doing a piece on
the most beautiful places to get married,

606
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,560
and l didn't want Todd to know
because he doesn't like being in the paper.

607
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,600
So, l am sorry
that l wanted everyone in the world

608
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,600
to know l married the perfect guy.

609
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Honey, do you think you can forgive me
for keeping such a big secret from you?

610
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,440
Okay, due to this newfound evidence,

611
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,200
the conclusion might be that l'm an asshole.

612
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Bye.

613
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,760
Fine.

614
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,920
Have a good wedding.

615
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,480
l'll leave with pride.

616
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,320
l'm a good person.

617
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,480
Bye! l'll see you tomorrow!

618
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,640
Wow, what a stressful day, huh?

619
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,560
-Can't wait to get back to the beach house.
-Thank you.

620
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,560
-Bye.
-Just the two of us, you know?

621
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,120
No, honey.
l'm staying in the city tonight, remember?

622
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,920
-What? No.
-Yeah, the bride and groom,

623
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,160
they're supposed to sleep separate
night before the wedding.

624
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,400
So see you tomorrow, big guy.

625
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,280
l'm going to drop Jamie
at the Fairmont Copley.

626
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,360
Mom and Dad,
you guys got the hedgehog. Okay!

627
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
-Love you.
-Watch the door.

628
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,440
-Love you. Okay.
-Sleep well.

629
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,480
Wait, but don't they not have a car?

630
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,080
All right, Donny, go.
There's your chance. Go.

631
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,960
l ain't got no more chances, buddy.

632
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,680
The kid hates my guts.

633
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,440
Right? 'Cause you guys don't have a car.

634
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,000
l'm not talking about him, Donny.

635
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,200
-Wake up, man.
-What?

636
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,600
Jamie's the gatekeeper for your son.

637
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,160
-Yeah?
-Win her over, then she'll convince Han

638
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,440
to give you another chance. Boom!

639
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,640
How am l ever going to get her trust?
She freaking hates me.

640
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,480
Donny, you want to know
what all women love?

641
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,760
lce cream.

642
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,320
Hi. l'm Todd Peterson.

643
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,600
No, you're not. You're Donny Berger.

644
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,480
You fucked your teacher
in the seventh grade.

645
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,320
Hi. l'm Todd Peterson.

646
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,040
Hi, Mr Peterson. What can l do for you?

647
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,280
What room was my fiancée in again?

648
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
Let me check. 641.

649
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,120
You're a fucking stud.

650
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,720
Hey, when the legendary
Donny Berger comes in here

651
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,760
using a fake name, you go with it!

652
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,320
All right, l will.

653
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,760
641. 641.

654
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,840
All right, come on, sweetheart.

655
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,720
Oh, yeah!

656
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,960
What, did Todd come out here?

657
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,760
You're half the size of Todd,

658
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,440
but you use it so much better!

659
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,520
l guess not.

660
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,640
Oh, my God!

661
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,080
Oh, my God.

662
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,480
Oh, my God!

663
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,200
Oh, my God.

664
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,720
Fucking shit!

665
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,040
Fucking shit.

666
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,120
Fucking shit!

667
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Fucking shit.

668
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,320
Yeah. Okay.

669
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,560
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

670
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,480
Okay.

671
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,720
Yeah!

672
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,200
You do not deserve these treats.

673
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,680
Are you finished, sweetheart?

674
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,560
Oh, my God.

675
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,960
Your fiancé's at home, you know.

676
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,920
This really gets me upset.

677
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,320
You know why?

678
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,960
'Cause he's too good for you.

679
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,080
He is.

680
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,960
And you're sitting here gallivanting with...

681
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,040
l think l know who.

682
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,480
Don't l, Mr Steve Goldstein?

683
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,800
Wait. Are you...

684
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
What am l seeing?

685
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,840
No... It...

686
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,120
With each other?

687
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,160
Am l... This is...

688
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,840
ls he your stepbrother at least

689
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,080
or adopted or something?

690
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,440
No reply.

691
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,520
So it's real.

692
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,720
Oh, my God.

693
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,160
Donny, Donny, you don't...

694
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,560
You don't understand what's going on here.

695
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,880
l don't think Charlie Sheen
would understand what's going on here.

696
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,800
Look, l love Todd,
and we're going to get married,

697
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,600
and we're going to have a great life together.

698
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,200
And yes, l've had sex with Chad
from time to time.

699
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,760
lt's what good-looking people do.

700
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:57,880
They have sex with
other good-looking people.

701
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,680
You know? Just so happens that

702
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,240
this one particular good-looking person
is my little brother.

703
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,840
Okay.

704
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,720
lt's all making sense to me now.

705
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,360
l know that sounded bad, but, Donny,
this was going to be the last time.

706
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,600
l would never carry on
with a married woman.

707
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,280
l've got better morals than that, Donny.

708
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,560
Chad, adultery is bad,

709
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,960
but incest is fucked up!

710
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,840
Please don't let him tell Mommy
about our secret tickle time.

711
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,800
''Secret tickle time''?

712
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,840
You got a name for it?

713
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,120
And with a United States
military man, no less.

714
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,840
You are a disgrace to that uniform!

715
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,280
No, he's not a Marine.

716
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,600
He buys those uniforms on eBay

717
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,120
so Dad doesn't find out
he's a modern jazz dancer.

718
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
What?

719
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,000
That's possibly worse than the incest thing.

720
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,800
This is an abomination. l'm telling Todd.

721
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,080
-No, he won't believe you.
-Yeah, he will.

722
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:01,240
No, he bought that Steve Goldstein story.

723
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,280
Come on, you think he got
that partnership on his own?

724
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,680
With that ''beep boop beep'' shit?

725
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,760
No, l gave him a boost.

726
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,520
How many people have you fucked?

727
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,120
Well, maybe he'll believe this.

728
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,120
Nice. Save.

729
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,480
You two have fun together.

730
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,200
Sickies.

731
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,680
All right, how much?

732
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,360
l'm going to be a very rich woman.

733
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,880
l can write you a big fat cheque.

734
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,080
What's it going to take for this to go away?

735
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,800
Todd has to pop a Xanax
when he loses a contact lens.

736
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,000
What do you think he's going to do
when he finds out about this?

737
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,360
Todd's happy.

738
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,200
You really want to take that away?

739
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,880
Hey, buddy.

740
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,440
l got something to tell you, and...

741
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,680
l'm not expecting you to believe this, but...

742
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,240
l got the money.

743
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,520
That's great, Donny.

744
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,400
Your son came through for you, didn't he?

745
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,320
Yeah. His fiancée gave me $50,OOO

746
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,680
to keep quiet about her
having sex with her brother.

747
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah, l've been there.

748
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
We've all been there.

749
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,520
She said it was her last time, so...

750
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,800
Maybe thíngs wíll work out.

751
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,600
Then how come l feel like shit right now?

752
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,960
Yeah, it's kind of a moral thicket.

753
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,480
But the good news ís

754
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,040
you stay out of the slammer, ríght, Donny?

755
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,640
Donny?

756
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,680
''Go do something.''

757
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,480
l don't know, Mr Mitty.
l don't know if l can fucking handle it.

758
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,600
''Be a good person.''

759
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:05,519
Donny?

761
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,080
-No, no, don't hit me.
-No, no.

762
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,800
Just give me a moment, please, Todd.
Just a moment. Relax.

763
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,360
You know, after praying with the monsignor,

764
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,920
l realise that l committed the sin
of prideful anger in the church,

765
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,080
and l hope that you'll accept my apology

766
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,720
and allow me the honour
of being a part ofthis joyous day.

767
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
Well, what about Father Shakalu?

768
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,800
Stupid bird.

769
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,240
Come on, fly!

770
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,760
Well, he's cool.

771
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,040
Great. Sounds good.

772
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,760
By the way, Todd,

773
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,480
was it you that hit me in the head
with the bottle?

774
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
No.

775
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,280
Well, then, who, then?

776
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,680
lt was Chad.

777
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,720
lnteresting.

778
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,240
Two, three, four.

779
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,440
Fosse, and Fosse,

780
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,520
-and Fosse.
-lnteresting.

781
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,360
Yo! Donny Berger! All right!

782
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,480
l'd sign something for you, buddy,
but l got no time right now.

783
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,840
lce!

784
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,360
lce, you in there, buddy? l need you!

785
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,200
You still got the 5.O?

786
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,680
What does that mean? Is that a yes or no?
l don't understand the pose.

787
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,640
Yeah? Let's go, let's go!

788
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,720
Go, baby, go!

789
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,880
No!

790
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,560
Look at this fucking guy!

791
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Man!

792
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,040
No, no, no, no, no! We're stuck! We're stuck!

793
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,120
To hell with the 5.O. Let's run for it, man.

794
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,360
-But we need great tunes!
-Come on, let's get them!

795
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,640
Right here, l got a Walkman.

796
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,960
-The Walkman!
-Yeah, baby.

797
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Let's go!

798
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,800
-Damn it, man!
-Come on! Let's go!

799
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,960
Oh, my God!

800
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,080
Hey!

801
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:24,080
You forgot to pay!

802
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,440
So, Jamie, do you promise
to provide Todd here

803
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,840
with unending empathy,
encouragement and honesty,

804
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,800
till death do you part?

805
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,360
l do.

806
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,240
Hey, Donny. Come on!

807
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,240
What are you doing, guy?

808
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,040
You jumped?

809
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,880
There was a door right here!

810
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,880
Come on, we got to get there!

811
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,800
And you, Todd, do you promise to love,

812
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,440
honour and protect this special lady
for the rest of your life?

813
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,640
Don't answer that question!

814
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,440
Oh, shit.

815
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,560
We ran well over a mile.

816
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,840
l object to these two getting married.

817
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:37,800
No, we're past that part already.

818
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,760
What are my options, then?

819
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,880
How about leaving?

820
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,520
You shut the hell up, you satanic hose-bag!

821
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,720
Hey!

822
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,080
Gerald! l'm sorry it sounded so harsh,

823
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,400
but you'll understand
why l said that in a few minutes.

824
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,800
There ain't gonna be a few minutes,

825
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,440
-you goddamn son of a bitch!
-Calm down!

826
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,600
Calm down!

827
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,600
Let the boy talk.

828
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,400
l can't let you marry this chick.

829
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,720
l can't believe you're doing this.

830
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,240
Listen to me, buddy.

831
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:03,360
You don't love this girl.

832
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,560
l'm telling you. l had love, it's different.

833
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,240
lt's a different feeling.

834
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,120
Love is like...

835
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,440
lt just leads you to a special connection.

836
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:15,920
lt's full of, like, feelings of awesomeness.

837
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,880
And the feelings you...

838
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,480
That wrap around you.

839
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
lt's deep in your stomach.

840
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,120
lt's in your head.
It's in your fucking nut sack.

841
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,640
lt's in your dick when it gets hard.

842
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,120
There's still love at the tip.

843
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,080
And it fucking sprinkles out

844
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,840
like morning dew
shooting all over the grass.

845
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,480
Okay, l've had just about enough of this.

846
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,000
Phil, sit down before l tell your wife
what you did at the strip club.

847
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,200
Okay.

848
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,080
Son, l'm sorry, l just...
l can't let you marry this skank.

849
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,240
''Son?''

850
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,120
-Your son?
-Son?

851
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,680
What is he talking about?

852
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,880
Honey? You can tell me.

853
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,280
l'll forgive you.

854
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,400
That's what love's about, right? Forgiveness.

855
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,080
All right, fine.

856
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,760
Donny's not my best friend.

857
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,480
He's my father.

858
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Oh, my...

859
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,680
My parents didn't die in an explosion.

860
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,280
l lied because l'm the product of

861
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,920
an inappropriate
teacher-student relationship.

862
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,120
Teacher-student relationship?

863
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:22,000
Do you know how gross that sounds?

864
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,080
You're disgusting!

865
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,240
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

866
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,280
She can still cancel that cheque, Donny!

867
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Chad.

868
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,800
Cancel what cheque?

869
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
l don't...

870
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,480
She gave me 50 grand
to keep my mouth shut.

871
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,480
Fifty grand? Jamie.

872
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:39,160
Yeah, it was... l was gonna hold on to it,

873
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:41,200
you know, to get me out ofjail, but...

874
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,760
Yeah, yeah. That's what l think of that.

875
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,520
That's how much l hate this fucking whore.

876
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,320
Wait. Keep your mouth shut about what?

877
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,480
Todd, don't listen to him.

878
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,400
He's a liar and he's crazy!

879
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,400
Father McNally, please continue.
l promise to do

880
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,080
all that shit you mentioned
and so does Todd, right?

881
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:55,640
Wait, what is going on?

882
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:56,720
Tell him.

883
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,840
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell him, don't tell him.

884
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,280
You tell him or l'll tell everybody here.
It's up to you.

885
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Come on.

886
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,880
Okay. Well, that's not that bad.

887
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,120
What? You didn't tell him,
you fucking lying piece of shit!

888
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,680
Get on it now or l'll fucking crush you!

889
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
No.

890
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,120
Jame, you can tell me.

891
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,760
l mean, how bad could it be?

892
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,360
What?

893
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,800
Okay, she told him.

894
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,120
What?

895
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,880
You fuck your brother?

896
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,640
Oh, my God!

897
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:16,640
Fucking white people.

898
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:21,960
l'm not looking so bad now, am l, Dad?

899
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:23,920
l'm out of here.

900
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,480
Mom, she started all this.

901
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,840
l didn't want to. l'm still your little soldier, l...

902
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,080
-Fuck!
-Take that uniform off.

903
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,920
You're insulting us all.

904
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,640
No, no, no. Don't you see?

905
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:36,600
lt's gonna be even better now.

906
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,120
You're a mess, l'm a mess.

907
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,120
Come on. Doc Shakalu, get your ass up here!

908
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:43,840
l got to be part ofthis shit?

909
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Todd?

910
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,680
Please.

911
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,040
Come on, baby. Come on, Todd, let's do this.

912
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,120
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,160
No! Let's not do this.

914
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:00,800
Okay?

915
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,720
And for the record,
my name's not Todd Peterson.

916
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:07,000
lt's Han Solo.

917
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,880
Named after the man who made
the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.

918
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,920
And l am a Berger, like my father before me.

919
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:16,560
Also, l want to tell everyone here
that l've got a pretty huge

920
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:18,600
New Kids on the Block tattoo on my back.

921
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:20,800
The heads are warped,
but fuck you guys, it's funny.

922
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,600
lt is fucking hilarious.

923
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
And Steve?

924
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,600
Nothing personal, man, but l quit!

925
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,200
No, no. Come on, Todd, don't be like that.

926
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,040
We quit, too.

927
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,120
Fuck you!

928
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:35,640
Good call, Han Solo,

929
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,760
'cause your fiancée banged him, too.

930
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,840
What?

931
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,680
l didn't know
about the brother thing, though.

932
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,000
l am as sickened as you, believe me.

933
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:44,760
You know what? It's all right, Steve.

934
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,920
'Cause guess what?

935
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,440
Donny and Vanilla Ice fucked your mom!

936
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,600
Vanilla Ice banged Grandma?

937
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,920
That's fucking awesome!

938
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,880
Donny, look out!

939
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,640
Word to your mother, brotherfucker!

940
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,160
l'm sorry.
l know l'm not supposed to hit a chick,

941
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,000
but l got to tell you, it felt good.

942
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,600
l mean, l wouldn't do it again,

943
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,800
but with this psycho, you know,
it was warranted.

944
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,440
Donny! l'm gonna kill you!

945
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:18,480
At ease, bitch.

946
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,000
Dude! That's it! Nice!

947
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,160
Hang on, though. Hang on.

948
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:23,640
No, don't hurt me.

949
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,160
Even Steven.

950
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:32,120
Father, take off the collar.

951
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,000
That's right. You're not meant for this.

952
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,440
-Well...
-Yeah.

953
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,080
Nicely done.

954
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:40,520
All right, come on.

955
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:42,320
Let's get out of here, Dad.

956
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,760
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

957
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,800
My son called me ''Dad!''

958
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,640
He called me ''Dad!''

959
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:52,040
That's right!
The Berger boys are back, bitches!

960
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:53,880
Wassup?

961
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,280
Wassup?

962
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:57,080
Wassup...

963
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,040
Shut up.

964
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,320
His boss and her brother?

965
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,920
lt sounds like a Rodney Dangerfield joke,

966
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,920
but it actually happened to my boy here!

967
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,760
Now we got to find Han Solo
one ofthem new girls.

968
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,680
One that don't care about
all that money he make.

969
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,080
-No, no.
-Yeah, like a girl version

970
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:21,160
-of Todd Bridges would be perfect.
-That's right!

971
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,480
Female version of me. That's right.

972
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,280
Well, you know, l actually might be
doing okay in that department, so...

973
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:26,520
What's that?

974
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:27,720
What the fuck... What the heck?

975
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,640
Todd and Brie, sitting in a tree.

976
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,280

977
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:35,680

00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,760

981
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:44,200
But there's good news.

982
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,240
You know what,
Miss McGarricle gets out in three years,

983
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,600
so the timing's kind of perfect
for us to start our lives together.

984
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,040
Dad, let me just give you the money.

985
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,000
No. No. l'm not gonna do that.

986
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,880
lt's time for Donny Berger
to take responsibility for his screw-ups.

987
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,640
