1
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:03,377
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:06,414
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:10,001
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:13,038
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,574
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:18,676
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:21,913
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,316
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:28,720
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:30,021
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:31,723
Let me get this straight.

12
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,691
You're the doppelganger of our Dr. Wells.

13
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:35,593
Yeah, but that Dr. Wells'
body had been taken over

14
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:38,229
by the Reverse Flash,
who was really Eobard Thawne.

15
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:39,564
Eddie!

16
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,799
Stay with me, okay? Stay.

17
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,367
Eddie's his ancestor.

18
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,202
If Eddie dies, then
Thawne will never be born.

19
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:46,337
He'll be erased from existence!

20
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,041
Hartley Rathaway. I couldn't have built

21
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:51,643
the particle accelerator without him.

22
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:53,878
- Cisco, what did you see?
- I saw Jay.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,346
He's Zoom.

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,720
I let it happen again.

25
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:05,390
I trusted someone I shouldn't have.

26
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:08,626
Jay Garrick. Zoom.

27
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:11,296
Just like I trusted Harrison Wells,

28
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,832
or Eobard Thawne.

29
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,800
You see what I mean?

30
00:01:15,802 --> 00:01:18,103
I made the same mistake twice.

31
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:19,704
I thought they wanted to teach me how

32
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,107
to use my powers, train me to get faster,

33
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,009
but they didn't come here to help me.

34
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:26,644
They came to use me

35
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:29,314
and take everything I love away from me.

36
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:30,815
But no more.

37
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:32,083
I'm gonna crack the code.

38
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:34,219
Figure out how to improve my speed.

39
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:37,021
I'm gonna train harder,
get stronger, and run faster

40
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:38,857
than anyone's ever run before.

41
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:41,826
And then I'm gonna stop Zoom.

42
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:44,262

43
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,874
Yo.

44
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,642
Can we please get rid of Jay's helmet?

45
00:01:57,644 --> 00:01:59,611
No, sorry. It keeps me motivated.

46
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:01,880
Well, it's giving me daymares.

47
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:03,848
This is everything I could find

48
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,050
even remotely related to increasing speed.

49
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:08,486
How are these supposed to help

50
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:10,288
apply the speed equation to you?

51
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,523
The answer's got to be here somewhere.

52
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:13,007
I think I found something interesting.

53
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,608
Good interesting or bad interesting?

54
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,876
'Cause that word could go either way.

55
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,445
After running some comparative data,

56
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:20,481
it appears that you, Reverse Flash, and Zoom

57
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:23,417
are moving your legs
at essentially the same speed.

58
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,653
Then why are they so much faster than him?

59
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:27,421
Best I can tell, with each stride

60
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:29,590
their feet spend less time on the ground,

61
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:31,592
thus propelling them forward much faster.

62
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:34,829
By almost 30%. Great.

63
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:37,665
All right, well, I got to make
up that difference somehow.

64
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:42,570
Barry?

65
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,539
Look, after what that monster did,

66
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,275
I want to stop Jay
just as badly as you do...

67
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:49,844
Right.

68
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:52,113
But what if the reason you
haven't been able to run

69
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:56,317
as fast as him yet
is because you just can't?

70
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:04,925
Barry, you know what happened
to Jay is not your fault, right?

71
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:07,194
Well, I should've known better.

72
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:09,563
You? With Wells last year,

73
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,898
I should've learned my lesson

74
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,802
and dug deeper into Jay, but... I didn't.

75
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:16,203
Come on, Joe.

76
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:19,173
Point being is nobody saw this coming.

77
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:20,674
Nobody.

78
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:31,218
So I...

79
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,122
kind of went on a date.

80
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:39,326
- With who?
- The new editor at CCPN.

81
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,028
Scott Evans.

82
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,730
Your boss?

83
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,698
Okay, it wasn't like that.

84
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,901
He's a really nice guy.

85
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:51,338
He's sweet and smart and, um...

86
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:56,710
What?

87
00:03:56,712 --> 00:04:01,081
It just... it all makes me
think about Eddie.

88
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,218
I think about him every day, Barry.

89
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:08,022
It just feels wrong.

90
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,924
I know for a fact that Eddie would want you

91
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:11,125
to find love again.

92
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,927
Yeah, I know, but...

93
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,129
Look, Iris.

94
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:21,035
You're the only person who's gonna know

95
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:23,771
when you're ready to move on, but until then

96
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:28,976
don't keep yourself
completely closed off, you know?

97
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,279
You're gonna miss out on something great.

98
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,881
Yeah.

99
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:37,985
- Hey.
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

100
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,687
No, no, you're just in time.

101
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,555
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

102
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,057
Dad! Mittens!

103
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:47,595
So... my advisor loved my engine designs

104
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:49,797
and even asked me to help her out with one

105
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:52,633
- of her engineering projects.
- Okay, big man on campus.

106
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:54,235
It's not that big a deal.

107
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:55,836
It's a great opportunity,
and you should take it

108
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,338
because life doesn't
give those out all the time.

109
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,240
Isn't that right, Barry?

110
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:00,474
Yeah.

111
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:02,109
Yeah. What is the project about?

112
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,444
It's trying to push the speed limits

113
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:05,079
with smaller propulsion systems.

114
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:07,248
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Where do you even start?

115
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,849
Well, I really like to read the journals

116
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,285
of the classic engineers,
so their engine designs,

117
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,887
how they increase horsepower,

118
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,089
and learn from the best, I guess.

119
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:16,624
You read their journals?

120
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:18,225
Mmm. I mean, it's not like I can

121
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,894
just go and talk to Enzo Ferrari

122
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:22,396
or Ferdinand Porsche 'cause
they dead, but...

123
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,102
You know, doesn't mean
they can't still teach me.

124
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:29,436
I got to go.

125
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:31,071
You haven't even touched your food.

126
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:33,707
Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I just, um...

127
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,809
I just realized the key
to a case I've been working on,

128
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:39,313
so I'm gonna just... thank you, Wally.

129
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:41,282
Whoo! Um, sorry, guys.

130
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:43,684
I'll be... I'll be back later.

131
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:46,654
That dude gets weirder every time I see him.

132
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:48,055
Yeah.

133
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,491
You mean the "old" Harrison Wells?

134
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:52,126
As in Eobard Thawne?

135
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:54,361
You want him to teach you how to run faster?

136
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,230
Oh, that's rich. How are you gonna do that?

137
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,399
By running back to a time last year.

138
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,700
And what about the other you,

139
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,135
the one from that other timeline?

140
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:03,003
I'll knock him out with something.

141
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:04,738
I mean, he's not like he'll see me coming,

142
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,540
and then I'll have Wells teach me.

143
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,275
Barry, that's crazy.

144
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,711
Nothing I've read is pointing
me towards a solution,

145
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:12,646
and if there's anybody that's figured out

146
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:16,583
the key to getting faster
without V-9, it's him.

147
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,689
What do you guys think?

148
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,558
Your plan is asinine.

149
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,463
Did you find Jesse?

150
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:32,633
Does it look like I found Jesse?

151
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:34,735
How many times have you
traveled through time?

152
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:36,270
- A few.
- Do you have any idea

153
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:37,771
how many things you could screw up?

154
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,074
All I need is one
conversation with Dr. Wells.

155
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,842
- He's not Wells.
- Thawne.

156
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:44,211
I'm Wells! This man has been studying you

157
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:46,947
for 15 years... for 15 years...

158
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,782
and you don't think
he's gonna know who you are?

159
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,684
Barry's pretty good
at impersonating himself.

160
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:52,252
You should've seen him
over there on Earth-2.

161
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:54,488
I was like, "Somebody
get this man an Oscar."

162
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,557
He will know, Allen. He will know.

163
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,858
All right, then what am I supposed to do?

164
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,326
I mean, how am I supposed to stop Zoom?

165
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:00,861
Do you know the answer to this equation?

166
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,197
If Thawne figures out that it's you,

167
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,032
the timeline will be altered.

168
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,667
People can die.

169
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:08,235
Others could live, and no one will know

170
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:10,304
who or what will be affected,
but I promise you,

171
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,440
when you come back,
things will be different.

172
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:16,710
And only you will know
what those differences are.

173
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:18,579
Well, if that's what I
have to do to stop Zoom,

174
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:20,381
then so be it, because if I don't,

175
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:23,250
and Zoom gets my speed
before I learn how to stop him,

176
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:26,420
everybody I care about,
everybody in this whole city...

177
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:29,123
their world will never be the same anyway.

178
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,798
Um...

179
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,366
Do you really think you can do this?

180
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:41,235
Yeah, I do.

181
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:46,006
When I went back last year
and I saw my mom die,

182
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,608
it didn't affect the timeline.

183
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,743
Yeah, but you haven't really time traveled

184
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:51,879
on purpose like this before.

185
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,481
I have to do this, you guys.

186
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,817
Okay, let's go for it.

187
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,952
Okay, you're gonna go back to the time

188
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,621
when Wells was distracted by the return

189
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:02,890
of the major jackass, Hartley Rathaway.

190
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:05,159
This is the first time
we found out Wells knew

191
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:08,762
the accelerator might explode,
and we were all angry with him,

192
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:10,497
so anything that might seem odd

193
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:13,634
about your behavior
Wells should attribute to that.

194
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:15,436
Also remember:

195
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:18,205
Do not underestimate Hartley.
He almost killed you.

196
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,207
This is a tranq dart that
should knock "old" you out

197
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,810
for about six hours,
which lines up perfectly

198
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:25,112
for when you're going back,
because not much was happening

199
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:28,082
until Hartley attacked
the Cleveland Dam that night,

200
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,984
so that should give you time to
learn what you need and return.

201
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:33,087
One more thing. You cannot tell us

202
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,823
the truth about Wells, no matter what.

203
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:39,159
You must keep the timeline intact.

204
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:40,828
It's gonna be hard to course correct

205
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,663
if anything gets altered,
so get what you need

206
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:44,665
and come back, preferably to this moment,

207
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:47,401
this exact time you're leaving,
or else you might set off some

208
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,670
kind of "12 Monkeys" time loop
you'll never get out of.

209
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,171
Mm-hmm.

210
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:53,273
- No pressure.
- Yeah. Cool.

211
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:57,478
So, we'll see you in, like, two seconds.

212
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,981
Time travel's so weird.

213
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,151
- Godspeed, Barry.
- I'll be fine.

214
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:05,786
What could go wrong?

215
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:22,169
Eddie!

216
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:34,748
Oh, no. I'm too early.

217
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,217
You know my name? I know some names too.

218
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:39,953
This is not a good start.

219
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:46,870
Caitlyn Snow.

220
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:49,506
Cisco Ramone. Harrison Wells.

221
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,009
Gah!

222
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,479
Something's interfering with his comms.

223
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,513
Barry!

224
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:04,721
Come on! Damn it.

225
00:10:04,723 --> 00:10:06,623
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

226
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,592
Whatever Hartley's using
must be shorting out his comms.

227
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:10,527
I can hear the radio waves...

228
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:11,962
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember this.

229
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:13,397
Emanating from your suit.

230
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,765
This could still work.

231
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,667
About 1,900 megahertz.

232
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,735
Are they on the other end listening?

233
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:21,471
Will they hear you die?

234
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:23,373
No. They're gonna hear you...

235
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,042
- Get your ass kicked.
- Get your ass kicked.

236
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:27,778
Okay.

237
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,921
Is that all it takes to scare you off?

238
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,724
And he chose you over me?

239
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,859
My comms? Who are you?

240
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:45,762
I don't have time to explain
this to you right now.

241
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:07,584
I don't understand. You're me.

242
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:10,921
I'm sorry, but I have to do this.

243
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:13,290
This'll all make sense eventually.

244
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:25,836
Where are you, oh, chosen one?

245
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:36,380
Got ya again.

246
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:39,349
Looks like you're not as smart
as everyone says, huh?

247
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:41,051
Smart enough to have figured out

248
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:42,819
who Harrison Wells really is.

249
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:44,688
You see, I know his secret.

250
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,024
Barry, are you there?

251
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,126
Yeah, yeah, I'm back.

252
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:52,062
I'm bringing Hartley in.

253
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:02,773
Scanners picking up foreign
metallic objects in your ears.

254
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,641
- Take 'em out.
- I can't.

255
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:07,110
I suffered head trauma
when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

256
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:09,079
My hearing was severely damaged.

257
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:12,282
Without these, I am in pain
you can only imagine.

258
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,255
Cisco, see if the devices in his ears

259
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:23,026
are generating any low level
electromagnetic pulses.

260
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:25,429
You want me to scan for E-bombs?

261
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:27,297
I just... I mean, don't you think

262
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,599
that could've been what was
interfering with the comms?

263
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:34,771
Well, well.

264
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:36,840
Trying to go all
"Mission Impossible" on us?

265
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:38,942
Use those things to bust out of here?

266
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,315
Pump in some sound stimuli
to counteract his tinnitus.

267
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:47,417
Then we'll make some
nonexplosive replacements

268
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:48,819
for him.

269
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,253
Deal with you later.

270
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,794
Take them out, Hartley. Now.

271
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:00,664
Dr. Wells.

272
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,933
That was quite an observation you had

273
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:05,669
about Hartley in there, Mr. Allen.

274
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:09,906
Yeah, it just seemed too easy
taking him down, you know?

275
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:12,542
Mm-hmm, well, the likely reason for that

276
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:15,712
is you're getting faster.

277
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:18,648
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

278
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,318
It occurred to me that maybe
we've been going about

279
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,821
improving my speed the wrong way.

280
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,523
How so?

281
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:29,025
Well, I've been learning
different techniques involved

282
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:31,628
in running, and I was thinking

283
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,231
that there's just as much
science involved in speed

284
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,266
as anything physical or technical.

285
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:39,603
I just can't figure out how
to apply it to me when I run.

286
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:43,607
Thought if anybody could
help me, it'd be you.

287
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:48,044
This is quite the... speed equation

288
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:50,614
you've concocted here, isn't it, Mr. Al?

289
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:54,084
Yeah, I've been doing
a lot of reading in my downtime.

290
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:58,421
What on earth inspired you
to adopt such a...

291
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:02,626
what should we call this...
unorthodox approach?

292
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:06,863
I just know that I'm not
the fastest man alive,

293
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:09,399
and I need to be faster, a lot faster,

294
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,269
if I'm ever gonna be able
to take down the Man in Yellow.

295
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,841
So what do you think? Can you help me?

296
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,590
Let me see what I can do.

297
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,962
Hey, Joe.

298
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:40,530
Hey, Eddie.

299
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:41,898
Must have been a good lunch.

300
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,700
Iris is the first girlfriend

301
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:46,436
I've ever lived with, so it's
all very new and exciting.

302
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:49,506
New? Yes. Exciting? No.

303
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:52,275
Sorry. Somehow I keep
forgetting you're her dad.

304
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:54,611
Hey, try to remember for both our sakes.

305
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:56,846
Come here.

306
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:59,349
I was thinking about
what you said about Wells,

307
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:02,118
how there's something off about him.

308
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,354
I need you to do something
for me, off the books.

309
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:05,855
Joe, come on.

310
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:08,625
Just trust me, Eddie.

311
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:11,728
Okay. What?

312
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,264
Go back to his house. Search everything.

313
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:24,441
Someone there?

314
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:02,579
What the hell?

315
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:10,787
CCPD.

316
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:14,190
I'm sure they have it handled, right?

317
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:16,493
No.

318
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:17,961
You need to go.

319
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:22,232
Run, Barry.

320
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,627
Is everyone okay?

321
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,834
- Barry.
- Yeah?

322
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:13,369
- You should cover that up.
- Oh, right, yeah.

323
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,707
- Thanks.
- Joe.

324
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,077
No sign of it outside. It just disappeared.

325
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,580
- Hey, Bar.
- Hey, Eddie.

326
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:27,550
Any idea what that thing could be?

327
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:33,089
No, I don't know. Not yet.
If I figure it out I'll let you know.

328
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:36,292
Things just keep getting more
and more strange in this city.

329
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,528
Yeah, they do.

330
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,030
I'm gonna check in with Iris,
let her know I'm okay.

331
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:43,066
- Great.
- All right, see ya, Bar.

332
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,638
What the hell's going on with you?

333
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,240
What are you talking about?

334
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:52,775
Look, I know you told Iris
that you love her,

335
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:57,747
but you said you'd moved past
this whole Eddie and Iris thing.

336
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:01,050
I have, Joe. I have.

337
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:02,785
Then why are you being so weird to Eddie?

338
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:04,754
Okay, um, look. I'm sorry.

339
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:08,091
Let me just take care of all this, okay?

340
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:10,093
I'll talk to you later, I promise.

341
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:13,162
Fine. But soon.

342
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,835
Soon, yeah.

343
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,276
What's going on?

344
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:28,411
Oh, you know, just trying to figure out

345
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:30,346
how to find this Dementor that's apparently

346
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:32,315
roaming through Central City right now.

347
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:35,552
I assume that was the cause
of the CCPD alarm.

348
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:38,021
Yeah, actually, it attacked my lab.

349
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,490
- You saw it?
- No, I didn't see it, no.

350
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:43,059
I di... um... well, I didn't get there in time,

351
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:45,562
but I have seen it before.

352
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:47,697
Where?

353
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,199
It was earlier today,
actually, when I was running

354
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,135
to take Hartley down.

355
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:55,038
Uh-huh. You're just mentioning this now?

356
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,373
I... I didn't know what it was.
I thought it was

357
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,142
some sort of illusion.

358
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:00,643
I don't know. Okay, well, we need to find it

359
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:02,145
before it hurts somebody.

360
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:03,880
- Can you track it?
- What is it with you guys?

361
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:05,882
It's like you think I have ESP or something.

362
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:07,917
I can't just magically sense
where things are.

363
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,320
- What can you do, Cisco?
- I'm thinking I can reconfigure

364
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:12,188
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to look for it.

365
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,290
Um, it might take some time though.

366
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:15,658
Do it.

367
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,828
In the meantime, Mr. Allen, come with me.

368
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,330
Have a seat.

369
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,165
Is this about the speed equation?

370
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,634
As a matter of fact, it is.

371
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:26,169
Oh, great. Okay, good.

372
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:29,038
- So you figured it out?
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:36,145
Yes. I've figured it out.

374
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,099
Now, who are you?

375
00:19:56,101 --> 00:20:00,136
I mean, who are you really?

376
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:04,407
Dr. Wells, what are you doing?

377
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:06,776
None of it adds up.

378
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:11,514
The interference with the comms,
the speed equation,

379
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:14,083
the Time Wraith.

380
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,753
That's what we call them. Time Wraiths.

381
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:19,555
Scary, aren't they?

382
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:22,425
I thought, "Oh, no,
a Time Wraith has found me."

383
00:20:22,427 --> 00:20:24,394
But then I thought, "No, no, no."

384
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:26,396
You know what you're doing.

385
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:27,964
Now, the Time Wraith is after someone

386
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:32,301
who's travelled through time...

387
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:36,139
and doesn't know what they're doing.

388
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:41,044
Dr. Wells, come on. It's me.

389
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:42,979
It's... it's Barry. I don't...

390
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:44,414
Really?

391
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,650
You are good.

392
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:50,053
You are good, and I would
believe you, except that...

393
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,258
Nothing?

394
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,394
I move like this, you barely flinch.

395
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,866
You know who I am.

396
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,505
Don't you?

397
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:11,674
Oh!

398
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:14,444
And you're from the future.
Do you know how I know that?

399
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,012
Because I haven't taught my Barry Allen

400
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:19,148
how to phase through objects... yet.

401
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:26,289
Let me out of here, Thawne.

402
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:34,897
I know. You're upset.

403
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:37,667
But it does me good to hear that name again.

404
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:41,070
Now, onto the bigger question.
Why are you here?

405
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:43,306
Because I want to go faster,
and you're the only one

406
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:46,042
who can teach me.

407
00:21:46,044 --> 00:21:48,911
You're the only one
who's figured out the equation.

408
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:51,848
The Speed Force.

409
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,383
You've manipulated it.

410
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:55,818
How did you do that?

411
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:06,195
No.

412
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:09,031
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

413
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:12,668
No.

414
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,239
You'd only come here
if something went wrong.

415
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:20,943
If you're still alive, then that means...

416
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:31,487
I haven't beaten you.

417
00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:35,525
If you're still alive...

418
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:40,296
that means my plan fails.

419
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:43,633
And if my plan fails,

420
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:46,636
I don't get to go home, and if
that's the case, well, then...

421
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:48,571
No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey!
It's the opposite!

422
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:49,939
It's the opposite!

423
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:51,974
It... you trick me. You harness my speed.

424
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:54,010
We turn on the accelerator to create a path

425
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:55,444
for you to go home.

426
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:57,680
I go back in time.

427
00:22:57,682 --> 00:23:00,316
You go back to yours.

428
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:02,218
You won.

429
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:06,556
Yeah.

430
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,293
Then why are you here? Why are you here now?

431
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:13,496
Because when I got back,
a singularity had formed.

432
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:15,565
And now the only way for me
to learn how to get faster

433
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:19,335
and stop the singularity
from happening was to come here.

434
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:21,070
Now.

435
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:23,072
Well, that's good to know.

436
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:32,915
There's just...

437
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:39,722
Just one thing that occurs to me.

438
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,627
I don't need you.

439
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:47,830
Do I?

440
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:50,833
Not this you certainly.

441
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:53,302
Oops.

442
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:55,872
You probably should've thought of that

443
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:58,241
before you came back here.

444
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:00,209
Shame...

445
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:04,513
You ran all the way back here

446
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:06,883
just to die.

447
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:10,319
You kill me... Barry...

448
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:13,155
this Barry, your Barry,

449
00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:15,691
he learns it all.

450
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,694
There's a hidden letter
telling him how it ends,

451
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:22,465
how to beat you, everything.

452
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:26,636
Anything happens to me,
you never make it back home.

453
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:33,109
Go on.

454
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:35,845
Kill me, Thawne.

455
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:37,313
See how this all ends.

456
00:24:51,462 --> 00:24:56,465
Now, you're gonna help me get faster.

457
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:05,508
Please.

458
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:11,013
I want to know how these work.

459
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:13,015
I'll tell you, just kill the music.

460
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:32,068
- Thanks.
- The gauntlets, Hartley.

461
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,569
What kind of frequency is this?

462
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:14,814
Cisco, it's here!

463
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:17,417
- It's coming!
- Inside the cell, now!

464
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:18,985
Uh, sorry. What's coming?

465
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:20,553
Um...

466
00:26:23,592 --> 00:26:25,258
Holy Harry Potter.

467
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,760
Okay.

468
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:28,528
Well, isn't this fantastic?

469
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,096
Look, we're gonna be safe in here.

470
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:31,131
These cells are...

471
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:34,901
Impenetrable?

472
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:37,270
Barry! Dr. Wells!

473
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:38,471
All right. We have to help them.

474
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:39,906
You let it track you here.

475
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,708
Get me out of here! Come on!

476
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,944
If that thing comes after me
and messes with my plans,

477
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:47,213
you're all dead.

478
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:50,450
- Where are they?
- Okay, let's step back.

479
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:52,886
- You'll shatter the glass.
- You got a better plan?

480
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,621
As a matter of fact, give me those.

481
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:55,889
No!

482
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:59,426
- Now, Cisco!
- What are you gonna do?

483
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:01,528
These cells have speakers
linked throughout S.T.A.R. Labs.

484
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,530
- Yes, and?
- I rigged these gauntlets

485
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:06,566
to emit a destructive signal
if ever they're disarmed.

486
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,537
If I can just find the right frequency

487
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,839
of whatever the hell that thing
is, well, let's just say

488
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,742
you'll be glad you're in here with me.

489
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:37,030
I'm sorry that we didn't come sooner.

490
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:40,100
It's all right, Inky's gone.
I don't see anything.

491
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:41,568
You know, we'd be toast

492
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,236
if wasn't for Hartley and those gauntlets.

493
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:45,171
Well, self-preservation
is a very strong motivator,

494
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:47,340
but he stays in the cell
until I say otherwise.

495
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:49,175
- Okay, I'm just saying.
- So the two places

496
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:51,745
this thing has attacked are here and CCPD.

497
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:54,247
- The common denominator being...
- Me. Yeah, I know.

498
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:55,815
I just... I don't know why.

499
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:58,184
Well, you must have done
something to piss him off.

500
00:27:58,186 --> 00:27:59,953
- Satellite hasn't found anything.
- We need to find

501
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:01,654
a more permanent solution to this problem.

502
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:03,623
Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.

503
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,658
That's about as good a first step as any.

504
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,962
- I got some parts for it.
- Let's go for it.

505
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:09,996
You don't know how to stop

506
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:11,431
- a Time Wraith?
- None of us do.

507
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:12,365
That's why we always try and avoid them

508
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,134
- in our travels.
- "We"?

509
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:15,869
Speedsters... we're not the only
two out there, you know?

510
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:17,537
This isn't the first time
I've time traveled.

511
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:19,005
How come I've never seen one
of these until now?

512
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,241
Because you ran out of luck.

513
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,510
And Time Wraiths hate it when speedsters

514
00:28:23,512 --> 00:28:25,712
manipulate the timeline,
and now that thing's gonna do

515
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:27,881
everything it can to end you.

516
00:28:29,684 --> 00:28:31,284
Here's what we're gonna do.

517
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:33,353
You're gonna go to CCPD.
You're gonna see what you

518
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:35,455
can find to help us stop this
thing... I'll do the same here.

519
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:37,056
Well, what am I supposed to be looking for?

520
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:38,525
You're in forensics. Figure something out.

521
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:41,161
Hey, what about the equation?
Me getting faster?

522
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:43,229
If we don't stop this thing,
there's gonna be no point

523
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,798
in me teaching you anything.

524
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:53,006
No trace elements, no prints,

525
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:56,576
no sign that it was ever here
except the whole mess.

526
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:58,178
Any idea what it was looking for?

527
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,380
- Me.
- What, why?

528
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,482
It doesn't like something that I did.

529
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:04,484
And what exactly would that be?

530
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:11,291
Joe, Singh needs you in his office.

531
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,859
Hey, Eddie, do you have a second?

532
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:14,794
I kind of got to go
check out a lead for Joe.

533
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,763
Okay, actually this is for Iris's birthday.

534
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:18,998
That's two months from now.

535
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,567
Yeah, no, I know. You're right.

536
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:23,403
I just... um, I want to make
a video montage for her,

537
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:26,439
just everybody in her life
and how her being in your life

538
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:29,375
- has made it better.
- That sounds great, yeah.

539
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:32,011
I'll think of something to say.
Can we do it now?

540
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:33,913
Barry, I really got to go do this thing.

541
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:35,315
I... I know. I really...

542
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,116
it's just I kind of have to get it today.

543
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:38,651
- Sure.
- All right, great.

544
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:41,254
Just, um... just speak from the heart.

545
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:43,389
Talk as if... talk as if

546
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:47,393
it was the last thing
you could ever say to her.

547
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:48,561
Okay.

548
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,599
Go ahead.

549
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:55,835
What does Iris mean to me? Uh, wow.

550
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,771
So can these gauntlets be salvaged?

551
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:00,540
Their electron guns are fried.

552
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:01,941
So it shorted the wave tubes...

553
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:03,343
- And destroyed the amplifiers.
- And destroyed the amplifiers.

554
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,011
Yeah, but to be honest with you,

555
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,614
I don't know how to manipulate
the frequency variance.

556
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,517
Hartley would know. He's the one who did it.

557
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:15,822
See if he can help,
but he stays in the cell.

558
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,824
But then what? That thing's gonna come back.

559
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:20,827
I don't know.

560
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:24,163
Where is he? Where's the other Flash?

561
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:27,934
Right here.

562
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:40,942
Okay. Not how I expected today to turn out.

563
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:42,577
Yeah.

564
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,212
Okay, so I'm... who are... who are you?

565
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:45,814
Who is he? Who are you?

566
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:48,283
What do you... I'm Barry. I'm Barry.

567
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:50,752
Your Barry. He's... Your doppelganger.

568
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:53,121
No, not yet.

569
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:55,323
I am you, Barry.

570
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:57,292
Just... different.

571
00:30:57,294 --> 00:30:59,694
Wait a second, how do we know
which one's the real Barry?

572
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:01,896
Dude, okay, I've watched
"Wrath of Khan" with you

573
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:04,065
- like five times.
- Imposter!

574
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,301
Yeah, and every time at the
end, you turn to me and you say,

575
00:31:06,303 --> 00:31:08,803
"I have been and always
shall be your friend."

576
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:12,774
Haha! You, imposter!

577
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,509
What is going on here?

578
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:17,212
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.
This was not supposed to happen.

579
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:18,380
The tranq dart that Caitlin made

580
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:19,748
was supposed to last a lot longer.

581
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,017
I did not give him a tranq dart.

582
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,318
Okay, no, yes, not you,

583
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,988
the you from the time that I am from.

584
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,456
The time that you are from?

585
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,025
I think what he's trying to say

586
00:31:30,027 --> 00:31:31,826
is he's from the future.

587
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:32,994
- The future?
- Yeah.

588
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:34,162
- The future?
- Yes.

589
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:36,431
- Wait, the future?
- Yes.

590
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,800
Are we saying I can time-travel?

591
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:41,436
One day.

592
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:44,372
Oh, that explains the white on the symbol.

593
00:31:44,374 --> 00:31:45,607
Well, wait a second.

594
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,175
Suppose we now change your emblem.

595
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:49,844
Will it be because we
got the idea from this?

596
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:52,013
- Or, I mean, that would mean...
- Stop talking.

597
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:53,615
You stop talking too, all right?

598
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,650
More you say, the more
the timeline is disrupted.

599
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:57,318
Now I'm going to assume
that your presence here

600
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,154
is the reason that thing is attacking us.

601
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:00,455
What? What thing?

602
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:02,190
Have you ever seen "The Frighteners"?

603
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:04,459
It's sort of like that,
but scarier and faster

604
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:06,061
and it's after you... after him.

605
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:08,596
Yeah, it's been chasing me
ever since I got here.

606
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:09,964
Okay, so how do we stop it?

607
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:11,800
We don't know.

608
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:14,502
- Then what are we gonna do?
- The one thing we can.

609
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:21,109
What? What are we doing here?

610
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:24,879
We're here for the answer
to your speed equation...

611
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:28,716
the reason that you traveled
back to this time,

612
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:31,820
and the key to running faster.

613
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:36,624
Tachyon enhancement.

614
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:39,327
This was not the deal.

615
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:41,896
If you think that I'm gonna hold your hand

616
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:43,965
this entire way, you're sadly mistaken.

617
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:46,134
Everything you need is on this drive.

618
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,403
You follow its instructions,
you will enhance

619
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:52,474
the Speed Force in your system
and run faster...

620
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:54,142
than you ever thought possible.

621
00:32:57,781 --> 00:33:01,316
If this doesn't work, I'm coming back.

622
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:03,685
Dr. Wells, we need you.

623
00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:09,190
Time to go home, Flash.

624
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:14,596
Okay, our satellite has finally found

625
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:16,431
our floating friend and it's coming back.

626
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,600
- You need to go.
- I need to know how to stop it.

627
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:21,069
- Barry...
- Not now. When I get back.

628
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:23,238
You guys have a year to figure it out.

629
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,508
Okay. We'll figure something out.

630
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,978
Cisco, come here.

631
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,447
Hartley knows where Ronnie is.

632
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:33,481
Okay? What?

633
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:36,184
It's coming.

634
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:37,485
You need to leave now.

635
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:38,486
Yeah.

636
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:57,438
Thank you.

637
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:07,649
Barry, here it comes.

638
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:29,771
It's not working. It's slowing him down.

639
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:32,707
Not for long.

640
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:33,942
No! Barry!

641
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:01,903
Cool.

642
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:13,514
- It's coming!
- Did you even go?

643
00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:15,617
- The Time Wraith.
- That's a good name.

644
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:16,818
Looks like that's a yes.

645
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,220
Did you figure out how to stop it?

646
00:35:22,926 --> 00:35:25,593
Damn! We thought so!

647
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:33,568
Barry!

648
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:51,986
I suddenly realized.

649
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:54,222
Low frequency, high intensity.

650
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:55,790
I knew that.

651
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,459
Oh, hey, Barry. How was your trip?

652
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:09,022
So aside from the fact that
a Time Wraith came over here

653
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:12,207
and nearly killed us, how did it go?

654
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:13,375
It was interesting.

655
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,912
Good interesting or bad interesting?

656
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:15,980
'Cause that could go either way.

657
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:19,150
So far so... good.

658
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:23,220
How many times do we
have to tell you, Hartley?

659
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,156
Ever since Evil Wells
got erased from existence,

660
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:27,591
no one speaks Latin around here anymore.

661
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:29,860
Well, as always,
it's been a pleasure working

662
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,962
with you all on this little project.

663
00:36:31,964 --> 00:36:34,298
If you need anything in the future, call me.

664
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,433
I'm off to a late dinner.

665
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:37,968
Mm, dinner. Anyone special?

666
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,404
Very. My parents.

667
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:45,343
So? You got me on pins
and needles over here.

668
00:36:45,345 --> 00:36:46,711
What about the speed equation?

669
00:36:46,713 --> 00:36:48,179
Did Wells tell you what you need to do?

670
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:50,881
Well, let's see.

671
00:36:57,156 --> 00:36:58,889
Hmm.

672
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:01,092
Maybe it's password protected?

673
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,995
Oh... are you kidding me?

674
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:07,765
After everything I just went through...

675
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,667
this doesn't even work!

676
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,712
We got it.

677
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,618
- Hey.
- Hey.

678
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,388
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

679
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,056
Although it turns out it's easier to find

680
00:37:32,058 --> 00:37:35,493
a two-ton gorilla on this earth
than a teenage daughter.

681
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,431
I don't know what I've done.

682
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,666
You did what you thought you had to do.

683
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:44,101
You risked your life to save her.

684
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:46,871
You brought her here
to protect her from Zoom.

685
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,840
You acted like a father.

686
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:52,376
"Like a father."

687
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,746
You know, my wife had to...

688
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:58,082
she had to talk me into having kids.

689
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:03,053
Kids, you know, they're...
they're small, loud, run around.

690
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:05,890
All I needed was my science and my job

691
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:08,726
for my joy and happiness.

692
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:14,298
And then...

693
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,701
the moment we had her...

694
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:21,705
all that I wanted was her love.

695
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:24,909
Now, I don't know
if I'll ever see that again.

696
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:28,412
It seems every decision
I've made lately has...

697
00:38:28,414 --> 00:38:30,714
backfired on me.

698
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:32,616
You just have to trust that,
in the long run,

699
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:34,118
you made the right ones.

700
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,229
- Hey.
- Hey.

701
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:48,265
I put your plate from dinner in the fridge.

702
00:38:48,267 --> 00:38:49,700
Thanks.

703
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:09,420
It's been almost a year already.

704
00:39:09,422 --> 00:39:11,288
Can you believe that?

705
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,058
That's the thing, Iris.
Everything keeps moving forward.

706
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:19,497
Question is, when will you?

707
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:28,572
I don't know, Barry.

708
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,709
Well, um, I found something

709
00:39:31,711 --> 00:39:35,412
that I think might help.

710
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,983
I was putting together
this little video montage

711
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:44,154
for your birthday last year
with everybody, and...

712
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:45,422
everything happened.

713
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:49,026
Um, but, uh, take a look.

714
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:52,830
I think it might help.

715
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,732
Okay.

716
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,170
What does Iris mean to me?

717
00:40:00,172 --> 00:40:03,207
Wow.

718
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,843
You know, a lot of times I have a hard time

719
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:07,611
figuring out what to say to people,

720
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,515
but when it comes to you, Iris, I don't.

721
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:15,886
Because with you, everything
that used to feel tough

722
00:40:15,888 --> 00:40:17,955
just doesn't anymore.

723
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,158
It's one of the things I love about you.

724
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,927
You don't need me.

725
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:24,728
You can handle anything on your own

726
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:30,034
because you're fearless and independent...

727
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,903
loving, kind.

728
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:37,274
You are without question

729
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:41,078
the best decision I ever made, Iris West.

730
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,049
And I've never thanked you
for choosing to be with me

731
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:49,720
because each day with you is a gift.

732
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:51,989
So, thank you.

733
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,490
You deserve the world, Iris.

734
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,559
You deserve to be happy
the rest of your life,

735
00:40:55,561 --> 00:41:00,397
and no one wants that more for you than me.

736
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:04,401
Happy birthday, baby. I love you.

737
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:08,806
I love you too.

738
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,213
Sometimes the only way to move forward

739
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:18,082
is to revisit the things in your past

740
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:20,117
that were holding you back.

741
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,920
You have to deal with them head on,

742
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:25,823
no matter how scary they may be.

743
00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:27,691
Because once we do, you'll see

744
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,561
that you can go further
than you ever imagined.

745
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:38,669
I'm coming for you.

746
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,146
