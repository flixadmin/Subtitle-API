understanding any of this.</font>

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,559

in Hawkins? What's doing these killings?</font>

<font color="#10f700">- That's what we're trying to ascertain.
- Where is El, like, right now?</font>

- This is insane! This is insane!</font>

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,571
<font color="#10f700">So this training to get El's powers back,
how long is it gonna take?</font>

6

<font color="#10f700">- Could take weeks, could take months.
- Months?</font>

you do not speak to anyone about this.</font>

<font color="#10f700">Exactly what Eddie said
happened to Chrissy.</font>

<font color="#10f700">That's not even the bad part.</font>

37

<font color="#10f700">Fred and Chrissy,
they both came to Miss Kelley for help.</font>

39
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,752
<font color="#10f700">bad headaches
that wouldn't go away. And then…</font>

40
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:52,881
<font color="#10f700">Then the nightmares.</font>

41
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,758
<font color="#10f700">Trouble sleeping.</font>

42
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,302

43
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,013
<font color="#10f700">Then they started seeing things.</font>

costs ten bucks, with a DPR.</font>

- Pretty straightforward.</font>

99

<font color="#10f700">How can Vecna have existed in the '50s?
It doesn't make sense.</font>

107

<font color="#10f700">Far as we know,
Eleven didn't create the Upside Down.</font>

for thousands of years. Millions.</font>

110
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,065
<font color="#10f700">I wouldn't be surprised
if it predated the dinosaurs.</font>

<font color="#10f700">- Dinosaurs? What are we...
- Okay.</font>

112
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:09,822
<font color="#10f700">But if a gate didn't exist in the '50s,
how did Vecna get through?</font>

113
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,115
<font color="#10f700">- How's he getting through now?
- And why now?</font>

114
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,826

115
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,077

116
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,413

117
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,875
<font color="#10f700">Only to return 30 years later
and start killing random teens?</font>

00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:21,918
<font color="#10f700">No, I don't buy it.</font>

now and then, it wouldn't hurt you.</font>

126
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,202
<font color="#10f700">Okay, so…</font>

127
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,705
<font color="#10f700">…we have a plan.</font>

128

<font color="#10f700">Thanks to Nancy's minions,</font>

129
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:05,711
<font color="#10f700">we are now rock-star psychology students
at the University of Notre Dame.</font>

130
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:07,337
<font color="#10f700">- I'm now Ruth.
- And I'm Rose.</font>

131
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,965
<font color="#10f700">Ruth?</font>

132
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:11,801
<font color="#10f700">Nice GPA.</font>

133
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,802
<font color="#10f700">Thanks.</font>

134
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:16,471
<font color="#10f700">So we called Pennhurst Asylum,
told them we'd like to speak with Creel</font>

135
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,765
<font color="#10f700">for a thesis we're co-writing
on paranoid schizophrenics...</font>

136
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,767
<font color="#10f700">To which they said no.</font>

137
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,686
<font color="#10f700">But we landed
a three o'clock with the director.</font>

138
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,773
<font color="#10f700">Now all we have to do is charm him
and convince him to let us talk to Victor.</font>

139
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,942
<font color="#10f700">Then maybe we can rid Max of this curse.</font>

140
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,610
<font color="#10f700">About that.</font>

141
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:32,279
<font color="#10f700">We've been doing
our Victor Creel homework, and, uh…</font>

142
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,490
<font color="#10f700">…we got some questions.</font>

143
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,658
<font color="#10f700">Lots of questions.</font>

144
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,909
<font color="#10f700">So do we.
Hopefully, Victor has the answers.</font>

145
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,870
<font color="#10f700">Wait… Wait… Wait a second. Uh…</font>

146
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:42,498
<font color="#10f700">Where's mine?</font>

147
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,794
<font color="#10f700">Nancy, you're outta your mind
if you think I'm babysitting again.</font>

148
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,880
<font color="#10f700">First, they're not babies anymore.
And Max is in real danger.</font>

149
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,592
<font color="#10f700">- She needs people around her.
- I know. But why me?</font>

150
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,177
<font color="#10f700">Oh my God, you have a Tom Cruise poster.</font>

151
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:58,139
<font color="#10f700">You have a Tom Cruise poster.</font>

152
00:09:58,221 --> 00:09:59,307
<font color="#10f700">That's old.</font>

153
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,725
<font color="#10f700">It's just…</font>

154
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:04,269
<font color="#10f700">- Can you please not touch anything?
- I can't do anything here, Nance.</font>

155
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:07,023
<font color="#10f700">Maybe I can be helpful
with this asylum director dude.</font>

156
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,357
<font color="#10f700">I don't know.
I could turn on my… my charm.</font>

157
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,192
<font color="#10f700">- Not the charm we need.
- Ouch.</font>

158
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,445
<font color="#10f700">No, I just…</font>

159
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,947
<font color="#10f700">I did a little digging last night,
and it turns out this Dr. Hatch</font>

160
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,659
<font color="#10f700">is a distinguished fellow
of the American Psychiatric Association</font>

161
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,870
<font color="#10f700">and a Harvard visiting scholar, okay?</font>

162
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,999
<font color="#10f700">This is a lifelong student of the world.
If we're gonna win him over,</font>

163
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:27,250
<font color="#10f700">we're gonna have to convince him
we are too.</font>

164
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,586
<font color="#10f700">That, like him…</font>

165
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:31,672
<font color="#10f700">…we are true academic scholars.</font>

166
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,841
<font color="#10f700">Holy shit.
There's a little ballerina in here.</font>

167
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:41,182
<font color="#10f700">Academic scholar? She's giving you
an academic scholar vibe? Yeah.</font>

168
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:43,725
<font color="#10f700">No, but…</font>

169
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:44,894
<font color="#10f700">…she will.</font>

170
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,813
<font color="#10f700">Oh, please, tell me you're joking.</font>

171
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,028
<font color="#10f700">It's busy. It's still busy.</font>

172
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,783
<font color="#10f700">Did I do something wrong?
It says dial one, then the number, which...</font>

173
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:02,577
<font color="#10f700">- You can check on your kids later.
- I don't understand why it's still busy.</font>

174
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,374
<font color="#10f700">Joyce, there are certain things
one can be late to in life.</font>

175
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:07,957
<font color="#10f700">A dentist's appointment.</font>

176
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,543
<font color="#10f700">A one-year-old's birthday party,
because who cares?</font>

177
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,129
<font color="#10f700">Little idiot's not gonna remember it.</font>

178
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:15,591
<font color="#10f700">But for what is essentially
a ransom exchange,</font>

179
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,969
<font color="#10f700">for that, for that,
I think you very much need to be</font>

180
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,804
<font color="#10f700">on time.</font>

181
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,683
<font color="#10f700">I'm sorry. I'm very tense.</font>

182
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,934
<font color="#10f700">Clearly.</font>

183
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,913
<font color="#10f700">Head west, through forest.
You will see a church with a gray roof.</font>

184
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,375
<font color="#10f700">Wait inside. Yuri will meet you there.</font>

185
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,626
<font color="#10f700">So you heard from her?</font>

186
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,422
<font color="#10f700">Yeah, they arrived last night.</font>

187
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,465
<font color="#10f700">They're meeting Yuri soon.</font>

188
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,634
<font color="#10f700">If all goes well,
by tomorrow night you're home,</font>

189
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,595
<font color="#10f700">eating Enzo's with your sexy woman.</font>

190
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:02,929
<font color="#10f700">She's not my woman.</font>

191
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,350
<font color="#10f700">Of course not.
She saves your life because of friendship.</font>

192
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,020
<font color="#10f700">Look, American,</font>

193
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,524
<font color="#10f700">do not put too much hope into this dream.</font>

194
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:15,484
<font color="#10f700">I have thought long about this,</font>

195
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,570
<font color="#10f700">and I give you odds of success</font>

196
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:19,822
<font color="#10f700">fifty to one.</font>

197
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:26,245
<font color="#10f700">You don't even seem nervous, American.
I'm impressed.</font>

198
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,246
<font color="#10f700">You're a cool cat.</font>

199
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,417
<font color="#10f700">Like Steve McQueen. The Cooler King. Yeah?</font>

200
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,376
<font color="#10f700">Let's hope not.</font>

201
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:37,298
<font color="#10f700">Of course not,
because Cooler King went back to cooler.</font>

202
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,551
<font color="#10f700">So, you must be better than McQueen today.</font>

203
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,470
<font color="#10f700">I change mind.</font>

204
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,554
<font color="#10f700">Now I give you odds</font>

205
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,682
<font color="#10f700">a hundred to one.</font>

206
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:51,604
<font color="#10f700">Our nosy friend again.
Where do you want it?</font>

207
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,188
<font color="#10f700">Just not my face.</font>

208
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,442
<font color="#10f700">Of course not.
Must be pretty for your woman.</font>

209
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:58,903
<font color="#10f700">She's <i>not </i>my woman.</font>

210
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:36,440
<i><font color="#10f700">Amazing you can get
this many people and have it this quiet.</font></i>

211
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,192
<i><font color="#10f700">Keep in mind that…</font></i>

212
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:40,485
<font color="#10f700">Where are you going?</font>

213
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,447
<font color="#10f700">I'm just getting something
to drink.</font>

214
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,491
<font color="#10f700">Is that allowed or…
How does this house arrest work?</font>

215
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,576
<font color="#10f700">You're not under arrest.</font>

216
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,494
<font color="#10f700">Right.</font>

217
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,538
<font color="#10f700">No, no, you're… you're here to protect us.</font>

218
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:55,250
<font color="#10f700">And watch TV, apparently.</font>

219
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,530
<font color="#10f700">I… I mean, I don't think
they've thought this through.</font>

220
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,284
<font color="#10f700">If this goes on for a month, or months,
and people can't get a hold of us,</font>

221
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,077
<font color="#10f700">they're gonna totally freak out.</font>

222
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,663
<font color="#10f700">Meanwhile, my mom's
probably having a panic attack.</font>

223
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:34,914
<font color="#10f700">And what about Hawkins?</font>

224
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,000
<font color="#10f700">That lady's supposed
to keep it "contained."</font>

225
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,379
<font color="#10f700">Like you can contain any of this
without El. I mean…</font>

226
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,047
<font color="#10f700">Yeah.</font>

227
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,510
<font color="#10f700">If you keep staring at that,
it's not gonna change. You know?</font>

228
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:52,099
<font color="#10f700">Yeah. Yeah, you're right.</font>

229
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,817
<font color="#10f700">Before the cops came,</font>

230
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,613
<font color="#10f700">me and El, we… we had a bad fight.</font>

231
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,364
<font color="#10f700">We never fight.</font>

232
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,782
<font color="#10f700">I mean, we fought before,</font>

233
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,034
<font color="#10f700">but just, like,
silly fights, stupid fights.</font>

234
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,663
<font color="#10f700">But, I don't know,
this one just felt more adult.</font>

235
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,582
<font color="#10f700">Like, it… it just felt more real.</font>

236
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,836
<font color="#10f700">Like, a fight you can't come back from.</font>

237
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:25,298
<font color="#10f700">Maybe I should've said something,
and if I would've said that thing,</font>

238
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:28,259
<font color="#10f700">then maybe she'd want me there with her,
wherever she is.</font>

239
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,553
<font color="#10f700">No. Look, Mike,</font>

240
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:32,556
<font color="#10f700">you're gonna see her again,</font>

241
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,475
<font color="#10f700">and whatever you didn't say,
you can say it to her then.</font>

242
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,561
<font color="#10f700">Okay?</font>

243
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,520
<font color="#10f700">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

244
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,981
<font color="#10f700">She's gonna be okay.</font>

245
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,527
<font color="#10f700">She's not in Hawkins.
That's what we should be worrying about.</font>

246
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,236
<font color="#10f700">You don't trust Owens?</font>

247
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,655
<font color="#10f700">No. I don't know.</font>

248
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,822
<font color="#10f700">I mean,</font>

249
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,866
<font color="#10f700">he's been good to us and good to El,</font>

250
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,911
<font color="#10f700">but he wasn't able to protect me.</font>

251
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,371
<font color="#10f700">That was you guys who saved me.</font>

252
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,538
<font color="#10f700">That was you guys.</font>

253
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:03,461
<font color="#10f700">Looks like
it's gonna be up to us again.</font>

254
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,380
<font color="#10f700">It always is, isn't it?</font>

255
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,301
<font color="#10f700">Which is why we can't stay here.</font>

256
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,179
<font color="#10f700">Listen,</font>

257
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,393
<font color="#10f700">let's assume these friends of Owens
are telling the truth.</font>

258
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:19,894
<font color="#10f700">We can't call Hawkins
without alerting the military,</font>

259
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,480
<font color="#10f700">putting El in danger.</font>

260
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,399
<font color="#10f700">Fine. Then we'll just go to them.</font>

261
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,317
<font color="#10f700">- Go to Hawkins?
- How?</font>

262
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,070
<font color="#10f700">What are you worried about?
Ponch and Jon out there?</font>

263
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,738
<font color="#10f700">They're half-asleep now watching golf.</font>

264
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,615
<font color="#10f700">No, Jonathan. I mean,
we don't have a car or money.</font>

265
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,409
<font color="#10f700">Then we'll hail ourselves a ride.</font>

266
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,452
<font color="#10f700">A cheap one.</font>

267
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,624
<font color="#10f700">Excuse me, sir?</font>

268
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,210
<font color="#10f700">Excuse me, sir?</font>

269
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,046
<font color="#10f700">What?</font>

270
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,255
<font color="#10f700">We're hungry.</font>

271
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:52,885
<font color="#10f700">I could eat.</font>

272
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:05,941
<font color="#10f700">Surf's up. Surfer Boy Pizza,
this is Argyle speaking.</font>

273
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,193
<font color="#10f700">We make everything fresh here
at Surfer Boy except for our pineapple,</font>

274
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,528
<font color="#10f700">which comes from a can.</font>

275
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,282
<font color="#10f700">But I still highly recommend slapping
some juicy pineapple on your pie.</font>

276
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,576
<font color="#10f700">Oh, fruit on your pizza's gnarly, you say?</font>

277
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,288
<font color="#10f700">Well, I say try before you deny.</font>

278
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,290
<font color="#10f700">Hello?</font>

279
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,183
<font color="#10f700">- I know you guys are staring at me.
- What, sorry?</font>

280
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,519
<font color="#10f700">- You said you needed something?
- Just hanging out.</font>

281
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,355
<font color="#10f700">How you think your eyes
boring into the back of my head</font>

282
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,025
<font color="#10f700">is protecting me from Vecna, I don't know.</font>

283
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,910
<font color="#10f700">- You can look at me now.
- Thank you. Sorry.</font>

284
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:58,993
<font color="#10f700">- Sorry.
- Sorry.</font>

285
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,663
<font color="#10f700">For you.</font>

286
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,375
<font color="#10f700">For you.</font>

287
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,336
<font color="#10f700">And, um, you.</font>

288
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,758
<font color="#10f700">Oh, and, um,
give these to Mike, El, and Will.</font>

289
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,636
<font color="#10f700">If you can ever get a hold of them again.</font>

290
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,723
<font color="#10f700">What are you doing? No, don't.
That's not for now. Don't open it now.</font>

291
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:21,682
<font color="#10f700">Don't… Okay.</font>

292
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,936
<font color="#10f700">I'm sorry. What is this?</font>

293
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:25,979
<font color="#10f700">It's, um…</font>

294
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,898
<font color="#10f700">It's a fail-safe.</font>

295
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:30,608
<font color="#10f700">For after.</font>

296
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,319
<font color="#10f700">If things don't work out.</font>

297
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:36,906
<font color="#10f700">Wait, whoa.
Max, things are gonna work out.</font>

298
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,825
<font color="#10f700">No!</font>

299
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,037
<font color="#10f700">No, I don't need you to reassure me
and tell me it's all gonna work out.</font>

300
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,874
<font color="#10f700">People have been telling me that
my entire life and it's almost never true.</font>

301
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,751
<font color="#10f700">It's never true.</font>

302
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,255
<font color="#10f700">I mean, of course this asshole curses me.</font>

303
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,633
<font color="#10f700">Should've seen that one coming.</font>

304
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,519
<font color="#10f700">If we go to East Hawkins,
will this reach Pennhurst?</font>

305
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,856
<font color="#10f700">- Of course. Yeah.
- Why are we talking about East Hawkins?</font>

306
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,237
<font color="#10f700">No. No. No!</font>

307
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:18,073
<font color="#10f700">Max, Max. Seriously.</font>

308
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,784
<font color="#10f700">Seriously, I'm not joking.
I'm not driving you anywhere.</font>

309
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,828
<font color="#10f700">If you think I'm going to spend
what is likely the last day of my life</font>

310
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,164
<font color="#10f700">in the armpit
that is Mike Wheeler's basement,</font>

311
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,249
<font color="#10f700">you're out of your mind.</font>

312
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,750
<font color="#10f700">Either take me where I need to go
or tie me down,</font>

313
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,752
<font color="#10f700">which is technically
kidnapping of a minor.</font>

314
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:35,632
<font color="#10f700">And if I live to see another day, Steve,
I swear to God, I will prosecute.</font>

315
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,301
<font color="#10f700">Open the door.</font>

316
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:40,052
<font color="#10f700">Uh, no.</font>

317
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,180
<font color="#10f700">I know a good lawyer.</font>

318
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,441
<font color="#10f700">Henderson, that super walkie of yours
better reach Pennhurst.</font>

319
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,191
<font color="#10f700">I can't breathe in this thing,
and I'm itchy. I'm itching all over.</font>

320
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:36,151
<font color="#10f700">It's not all about comfort.</font>

321
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,402
<font color="#10f700">Okay? We're academics.</font>

322
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,695
<font color="#10f700">Who are evidently coming
straight from Easter brunch.</font>

323
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,532
<font color="#10f700">Also, this bra that you gave me
is really pinching my boobs.</font>

324
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:47,663
<font color="#10f700">Okay. Could you just let me
do the talking? If that's even possible?</font>

325
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,873
<font color="#10f700">It's not only possible, it's inevitable.</font>

326
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,625
<font color="#10f700">Because shortly,
I'll be dead from strangulation.</font>

327
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,628
<font color="#10f700">3.9 GPAs.</font>

328
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,547
<font color="#10f700">Both of you.</font>

329
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:00,467
<font color="#10f700">Impressive.</font>

330
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,929
<font color="#10f700">And this is a recommendation
from Professor Brantley.</font>

331
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,557
<font color="#10f700">Yeah, I know Larry. Quite well, actually.</font>

332
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,309
<font color="#10f700">Eh, you know what they say.</font>

333
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,064
<font color="#10f700">"Those who can't do, teach."</font>

334
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:21,363
<font color="#10f700">Uh, yes, yes,
that's actually why we're here.</font>

335
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,825
<font color="#10f700">I mean, we can only
learn so much in a classroom.</font>

336
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:25,741
<font color="#10f700">Mmm.</font>

337
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,662
<font color="#10f700">And I'm sympathetic
to your struggle, truly.</font>

338
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,540
<font color="#10f700">But there is a protocol
to visiting a patient like Victor.</font>

339
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,166
<font color="#10f700">You put in a request</font>

340
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,711
<font color="#10f700">and then undergo a screening process,</font>

341
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,088
<font color="#10f700">at which point
the board will make a decision.</font>

342
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:43,384
<font color="#10f700">I can see you're disappointed.</font>

343
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,138
<font color="#10f700">But I'm more than happy
to give you a tour.</font>

344
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:50,892
<font color="#10f700">Perhaps you can even speak
to some patients in our low-security wing.</font>

345
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,894
<font color="#10f700">And we'd… we would love that.</font>

346
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:56,522
<font color="#10f700">It's just that, um…</font>

347
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:59,233
<font color="#10f700">…our thesis is due next month.</font>

348
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,986
<font color="#10f700">And you're out of time.</font>

349
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:02,112
<font color="#10f700">Whose fault is that?</font>

350
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:04,030
<font color="#10f700">Ours. Absolutely.</font>

351
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,824
<font color="#10f700">And I do apologize...</font>

352
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,242
<font color="#10f700">Don't apologize, Ruth. Screw that.</font>

353
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:11,538
<font color="#10f700">The fact is, we did put in a request
months ago and were denied.</font>

354
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,082
<font color="#10f700">And then we reapplied
and were denied again.</font>

355
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,461
<font color="#10f700">And coming here was
our last-ditch effort to save our thesis.</font>

356
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,338
<font color="#10f700">And I really…
I can't breathe in this thing.</font>

357
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,383
<font color="#10f700">Well, Rose, maybe you'd like
to go outside and get some air.</font>

358
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,384
<font color="#10f700">- Maybe I should, Ruth.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

359
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,971
<font color="#10f700">Because I'm starting to think
this whole thing is a colossal mistake.</font>

360
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,891
<font color="#10f700">I'm breaking out in a rash.</font>

361
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,559
<font color="#10f700">My boobs hurt.
And I'll tell you the truth, Anthony.</font>

362
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,063
<font color="#10f700">May I call you Anthony?
These aren't my clothes.</font>

363
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:39,566
<font color="#10f700">I borrowed them
because I wanted you to take us seriously.</font>

364
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:42,986
<font color="#10f700">Because nobody takes girls seriously
in this field. They just don't.</font>

365
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:46,655
<font color="#10f700">We don't look the part or whatever.
But can I tell you a story?</font>

366
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,159
<font color="#10f700">1978, I was at summer camp.</font>

367
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:52,453
<font color="#10f700">And my counselor Drew
told me and everyone in Cabin C</font>

368
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,082
<font color="#10f700">the true story
of the Victor Creel Massacre.</font>

369
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:58,125
<font color="#10f700">And little Petey McHew…
You know Petey, right, Ruth?</font>

370
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,044
<font color="#10f700">Of… Of course.</font>

371
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:03,507
<font color="#10f700">Yeah. Little Petey McHew
started sobbing right there on the spot.</font>

372
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,384
<font color="#10f700">Full-on hyperventilating.</font>

373
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,426
<font color="#10f700">The other campers
couldn't sleep for weeks.</font>

374
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,721
<font color="#10f700">I couldn't either,
but not 'cause I was scared.</font>

375
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,722
<font color="#10f700">Because I was obsessed with the question,</font>

376
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,684
<font color="#10f700">"What would drive a human being
to commit such unimaginable acts?"</font>

377
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,355
<font color="#10f700">Other kids wanted to be astronauts,
basketball players, rock stars.</font>

to see polar bears.</font>

409

Words, letters.</font>

545

I need to check on anyway, so…</font>
