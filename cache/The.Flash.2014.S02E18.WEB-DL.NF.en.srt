{\an8}No, he refused.

136

{\an8}Doesn't want me or anybody
opening the breaches again.

and punched in the face,

{\an8}Why?

141
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,264
{\an8}Barry, it worries the hell out of me,

{\an8}the thought that you wanna
go back to Earth-2.

145
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,566
I can take him down.

146

All I'm saying is, you already
escaped the hornet's nest once.

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,369
Wally. We got some pizza here
all the way from Keystone City.

150
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,538
Hope it's cool, I brought my laundry over.

151
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,749
Of course. Barry used to
do his laundry here all the time

when he was in college.

153

That's 'cause those machines in the dorm
always eat your quarters, right?

Actually, I'm not

00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,677
Since room and board
became way more expensive than I thought.

157
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,971
Man, I can help you out with that.

158
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,222
I mean, I figured your money

159
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,391
must be tight after payin'
all your mother's medical bills.

160
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,645
<i>How much more is it?</i>

161
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,147
No, it's, uh... It's cool.

162
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,524
Come on, Wally, let me help you out.

163
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,652
Plus I got that mini-fridge in the garage.
You can use that, too, if you want.

164
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,278
Joe, I'm good, really.

165
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,446
All right.

166
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,701
Uh, let me just put these in real quick.

167
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,956
Man, I can't figure
that kid out sometimes.

168
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,959
I wonder if his doppelganger's
that complicated.

169
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,426
BARRY: Hey.

170
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,136
Wow. Um...

171
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,345
Any ideas?

172
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,348
Well, the best plan
we've come up with so far

173
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,811
is to set off a nuclear warhead
next to the city's electrical grid. So...

174
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,396
We're not gonna do that. Um...

175
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,857
I think I thought of something, though.

176
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,196
Tell me everything that you know
about Cisco's doppelganger.

177
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,363
Reverb?

178
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,075
What were Reverb's powers on your earth?

179
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,912
Well, he could tap into the
multi-dimensional energies between earths.

180
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,665
He could see through dimensions,
find breachers.

181
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,874
Like Ramon.

182
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,251
I mean, we saw Reverb
do more than that, though, right?

183
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:08,172
I mean, we saw him
shoot vibrational bursts out of his hands.

184
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,757
Really painful ones.

185
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,008
What do you mean?

186
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,385
I... I mean, Reverb had the ability

187
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,639
to somehow manipulate
that multi-dimensional energy.

188
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,807
What's your point, Allen?

189
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,602
My point is, if his powers are linked

190
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,771
to the energy
that ties together the multi-verse

191
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,565
and he can manipulate it?

192
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,983
Then he can open a breach

193
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,735
-to any earth he wants.
-Exactly.

194
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,614
And if Reverb could do it,
I could do it, too.

195
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,744
Cisco, I think that
the way back to Earth-2, is you.

196
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,756
I got nothin'.

197
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,215
Try again, okay?

198
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,718
Barry, what if he can't do it
because he thinks he can't do it?

199
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,928
He can do it, though. You can do it.

200
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,181
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

201
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,984
You... It's gonna work, okay? And it...

202
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,987
Maybe we're just not in the right place.

203
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,616
Or maybe I'm just not
the right man for the job, right?

204
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,784
Let's go.

205
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,035
Cisco.

206
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,038
I'm sorry, Barry.

207
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,417
It's gonna work.

208

Um...

211
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,056
I need to ask you a...

212
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,725
You've got company.

213
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,143
-Um...
-WALLY: No, it's cool.

214
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,812
I should be studying anyway.

215
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,481
You know, you kind of look like that guy.

216
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm not him.

217
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,068
Okay.

218
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,486
Later, Joe.

219
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,366
Well.

220
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,586
Thank you. Uh, look, I apologize
for droppin' by unannounced.

221
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,046
I just...

222
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,299
Have you had any luck
locating my daughter?

223
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,592
Not yet.

224
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,804
But I've circulated her picture
through every department in the region.

225
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,306
And I've reached out
to some friends in Keystone.

226
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,891
She's smart.

227
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,435
She's gonna know
how to stay hidden. She's...

228
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,937
We'll find her.

229
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,605
Right.

230
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,900
There's another thing also, Detective.

231
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,318
A favor.

232
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:41,450
I would ask you to talk Barry out of
reopening the breaches to my earth.

233
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:42,994
(LAUGHING)

234
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,750
I can't do that.

235
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:53,420
No, you can find a way to change his mind.

236
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,840
For both our children's sakes.

237
00:11:56,257 --> 00:12:01,053
Look, I think it's just as dumb as you do,

238
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,266
but I learned a long time ago,
I can't talk Barry out of anything

239
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:06,893
once he sets his mind to it.

240
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,603
Zoom is terrorizing
this other world, your world.

241
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,815
He can't let it go.

242
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,069
But look, why don't you do me a favor?

243
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,571
Go with Barry.

244
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,407
Help him.

245
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:22,741
Help him?

246
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,162
Why would I do that?

247
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:31,417
Because he's got a much better chance
of defeating Zoom if you're involved.

248

316
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,654
But having Wally around will be cool, too.

317
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,490
Just, we won't get
to have as much pizza from Keystone.

318
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,410
Yeah, it kind of sucks. I'm sorry.
(CHUCKLES)

319
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,287
I better get used to that. (LAUGHING)

320
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,291
They really have a special bond,
don't they?

321
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,501
Yeah, they sure do.

322
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,671
Are you okay?

323
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,091
(SIGHS) I don't know what I am.

324
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,179
Last night I was supposed to go on a date.

325
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,764
My first real date since Eddie died.

326
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,435
But at the last second, I just...
I couldn't do it.

327
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:02,271
Is that because of Eddie
or because of Barry?

328
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,192
I've noticed the way
you've been looking at him recently.

329
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,734
Is it that obvious?

330
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,986
Only to a woman who's been through
the same thing.

331
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,782
Everything seems to be telling me
that Barry and I are meant to be together.

332
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,909
<i>I mean, on Earth-2 we're married.</i>

333
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,870
In the future, we're supposedly married.

334
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,956
<i>And now that I'm finally ready to move on,</i>

335
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,792
I just wonder
if that should be with Barry.

336
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,587
Everything seems to be
pointing in that direction.

337
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,048
Do you believe in destiny, Caitlin?

338
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,425
Maybe for you.

339
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,099
Hello?

340
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,186
Joe?

341
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,063
JOE: <i>Wally, I'm up here.</i>

342
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,526
-Hey.
-What are you doin'?

343
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,736
It's not done, yet.

344
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,072
I mean, you can decorate it how you like.
Make it your own.

345
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,282
Wait, wait, Joe, what is this?

346
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,119
Wally, forgive me.

347
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,248
When Barry and Iris went to college,
they couldn't get away fast enough.

348
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,541
They wanted nothing to do
with their old man.

349
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,587
It didn't even occur to me
that you might feel differently.

350
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,049
It's embarrassing,
but it took Barry to help me see that.

351
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,763
So if you still haven't found
a place to live, live here.

352
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:21,725
<i>I mean, it's yours. If you want to.</i>

353
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,270
You're serious?

354
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,480
Look, I'm not gonna do your laundry,

355
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,107
-and I'm not washing dishes after you...
-(CHUCKLES)

356
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,401

every morning before you leave,

357
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,612
and there will be no beer in that fridge,
but, yeah.

358
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,030
It's yours.

359
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,949
When can I move in?

360
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,951
Whenever you want.

361
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,246
All right.

362
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,290
Thanks, Dad.

00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,224
Look, um...

367
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,853
I know what it's like.

368
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,523
Zoom, getting in your head.

369
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,609
How scary that can be.

370
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,199
It's not Zoom.

371
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,826
It's me.

372
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:22,828
What do you mean, it's you?

373
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,582
It's like, right now I'm Anakin Skywalker.

374
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,751
I've got the midi-chlorians,
I've got the goods,

375
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,753
the Force is strong with me.

376
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,589
That is something I can feel.

377
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,676
But if I start opening breaches
into other worlds,

378
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,971
doing all this other crazy stuff
Reverb was doing, then,

379
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,184
what if this is how I become Vader?

380
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,602
Dude, you're never gonna become Vader.

381
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,769
<i>But you don't know that.</i>

382
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,521
That is what happened to Reverb.

383
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,525
He learned how to use his abilities,
and when he felt that...

384
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:59,615
When he felt that power,
he succumbed to the dark side.

385
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,575
(CHUCKLES)

386
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,870
Look, I get it. I... I really do.

387
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:07,206
Every time I've learned a new ability,

388
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,916
I've been terrified about
what it might mean for me,

389
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,211
what it could do to me, you know?

390
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:18,217
But you were there with me
when I learned how to run on water.

391
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,846
When I ran up a building
or traveled through time.

392
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,850
Just like I'm going to be there
every step of the way with you.

393
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,605
You got something that Reverb never had,

394
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,234
and that's Caitlin and Joe
and Iris and Wells and me.

395
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,653
Friends who are gonna look out for you.

396
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,071
And we're more than just friends.
We're your family.

go another round?

Hey, Cait.

I know how hard this is gonna be for you,
but we have to stop him.

408
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,904
I know, and I wanna be supportive.
I just...

409
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,156
I can't face Jay.

410
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,575
Whatever his real name is.

411
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,618
What does that mean?

412
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:29,538
Well, you remember when I was
looking for his doppelganger, right?

413
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,665
Yeah, I mean, you couldn't find him.

414
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,834
Because there is no Jay Garrick
on this earth.

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,587
His doppelganger's name is Hunter Zolomon.

416
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,630
HARRISON: Hunter Zolomon?

417
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,925
Are... Are you sure?

418
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,469
Yeah, why?

419
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,974
Well, because on my earth,

420
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,977
Hunter Zolomon
was a convicted serial killer.

421
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,648
That's Jay?

422
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,776
No, that is Hunter.

to this... There was a podcast.

427
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:15,501
When Hunter was 11, his father
killed his mother right in front of him.

428
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,253
Father sent to prison,
Hunter grew up in the foster care system.

429
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,257
Years later, he was convicted
on 23 counts of murder?

CISCO: <i>23?</i>

That's, like, some real
Hannibal Lecter-type level.

432
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,264
After the trial,

433
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,351
<i>Hunter was sent to the St. Perez
Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane.</i>

The dark matter crept into
the mental asylum.

439
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:52,370
I'd thought piping the explosion
underground would limit exposure.

How do you use this?
