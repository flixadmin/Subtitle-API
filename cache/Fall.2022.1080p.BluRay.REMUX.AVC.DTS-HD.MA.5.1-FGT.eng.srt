1
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,530
There's a big gap.

2
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,860
This feels
like the only route, let's keep going.

3
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,660
You okay?

4
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,630
It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.

5
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,710
Okay.

6
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,180
- One, two, three!
- Be careful.

7
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,720
You okay?

8
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,760
Okay.

9
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,730
- Oh, my god.
- Never better.

10
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Okay.

11
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,570
- Whoa, whoa, you're good.
- Shit.

12
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,410
You're good. Yeah?

13
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,990
- You're good?
- No.

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, you've done way scarier than this.

15
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,370
Remember a.J. Hackett, snake dike?

16
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,750
Stupid singing competition.
God, you married this sad sack,

17
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,380
for Christ's sake.

18
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,420
- Yeah? Okay.
- Okay.

19
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,840
Two...

20
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,930
Three!

21
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,220
Come on! I got you.

22
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,930
That's my girl.

23
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,770
Ew! Gross!

24
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,810
You guys, get a room!

25
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,320
Here comes Ethan hunt.

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,280
Careful, h, there's loose rock
around the elbow.

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,820
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

28
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm fine.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,370
Whoo!

30
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,990
Try to keep up!

31
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,960
Taking your time there, hotshot.

32
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,380
Hunter, you show off!

33
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,760
Whoo!

34
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,570
Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,890
Dan, are you okay?

36
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,230
Just hold on. I'm coming down.

37
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,480
Come on. Come on. I can't make it.

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,730
- [Gaspingl oh, my god.
- Okay, Becky, Becky.

39
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,940
I need a little more length.

40
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,440
Can you UN-clip? Are you secure?

41
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,030
- Are you secure?
- Yeah.

42
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,200
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,700
Just UN-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

44
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,490
- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,620
Ready?

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,420
Can you reach it?

47
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,920
Just... just one second.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,380
All right. I think I can make it.

49
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,340
Hold on, Dan.

50
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,270
- I'm almost there.
- Just need a little more momentum.

51
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
Okay.

52
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,090
No!

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,260
Dan!

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey!

55
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,210
This is Becky and Dan.
Leave a message.

56
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, Becky, it's me.

57
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,760
Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.

58
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,010
But I...

59
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,800
I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.

60
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,430
Sweetheart, I'm worried about you.

61
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,480
So whenever you stop hating on me,

62
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,890
I am here.

63
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,550
Hey, what's up?

64
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,680
This is just the voice mail.
You've reached Dan.

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,890
Just leave a message,
I'i/ hit you back when I can.

66
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,520
Get it off at the beep.

67
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,850
Hey.

68
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,860
Miss you.

69
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,280
Dad, what? Are you stalking me now?

70
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,700
No, I just don't know what else to do,
'cause you're not answering your phone.

71
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,790
- Take a hint.
- I-I think this is getting

72
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,130
- a little bit ridiculous.
- "Ridiculous"?

73
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,210
You told me I shouldn't be so broken up
about him because he was an asshole.

74
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,970
No. I said that maybe he didn't
belong on this pedestal

75
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,190
that you were putting him up on,

76
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,220
that he wasn't this martyr
that you've been making him out to be.

77
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,010
This is how you console your daughter?

78
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,350
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

79
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,480
I don't want to move on. I miss him!

80
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,860
Every day, I miss the way he looked at me.

81
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,900
- I miss the way he made me feel.
- Sweetie.

82
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,570
- Don't!
- Don't what?

83
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,170
What do you think you're doing, Becky?

84
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,210
- Getting away from you.
- You are not driving. Stop it.

85
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,570
Fuck off!

86
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,320
You don't get to talk to me like that.

87
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,290
Your mother and I,
we raised you better than that.

88
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,420
So getting shit-faced
and pushing the people away that love you,

89
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,710
it's not gonna work.

90
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,550
All right, look,
a horrible thing happened to you,

91
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,840
but you have to start
living your life again.

92
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,130
All right? There's a whole big wide world
out there that needs you

93
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,930
and believe it or not, I need you.

94
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,140
Let me give you a ride home.

95
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,810
I'd rather walk.

96
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,110
Let me ask you something.

97
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,110
If roles reversed, if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

98
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,820
do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?

99
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,280
Drowning in booze, grief, sorrow,
whatever the hell this is?

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,120
He's not.

101
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,750
And you damn well know it.

102
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,670
God damn it, Becky, I need you to try.

103
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,290
Do you know what I need, dad?

104
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,720
I need you to leave me alone.

105
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,190
God damn it.

106
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,450
The number you have
called has been disconnected.

107
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,660
Mwmm

108
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,410
- Hi!
- Hey.

109
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,200
You look, um...

110
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,580
- Awful.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,790
Yeah, like really freakin' awful.
Well, come here.

112
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,800
So, what brings you back?

113
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,590
Are you finally ready to rest?

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,220
I'll rest when I'm dead.

115
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,230
I have something that's planned
and I need a partner in crime.

116
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,110
Look, your dad called me a few weeks ago.

117
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,820
He didn't know who else to turn to,
and he said that you were in a bad place.

118
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,200
- He had no right to do that.
- He's worried about you.

119
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,660
It's coming up on a year.
He doesn't want you to be alone.

120
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,700
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

121
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,660
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there

122
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,830
is my best friend stuck in here with him.

123
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,210
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

124
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,210
You're not gonna like it,
but just try to keep an open mind.

125
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,800
The 8-6? TV tower.

126
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,810
It's only a six-hour drive from here.

127
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,850
I was planning on climbing it this weekend

128
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,350
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

129
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,190
It would be an adventure,
like old times.

130
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,820
And you could scatter Dan's ashes on top.

131
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,080
- I just... I haven't climbed since...
- I get it.

132
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,910
But if you don't confront your fears,
you are always going to be afraid.

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,620
What is it that Dan used to say?

134
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,840
"Don't... die if you wanna live

135
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,510
or keep living even if you're dying."

136
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,310
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

137
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,140
No, I'm sorry.

138
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,220
Hunter, I just... I can't.

139
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,020
It's like I know I can't do it, I'm sorry.

140
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,770
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

141
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,770
- I can't.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

142
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,190
It's okay.

143
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,730
Morning, Princess.

144
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,520
What's wrong?

145
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,780
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

146
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,610
That's what Dan used to say.

147
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,990
Let's do it.

148
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,450
Let's climb your stupid tower.

149
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Oh, my god, Becky, baby, I'm so excited!

150
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,220
I've never
actually seen this video.

151
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,760
Shit, I was really ripped.

152
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,180
Yeah! You're awesome.

153
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,270
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

154
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,100
Aw!

155
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,310
Holy shit! Look at your beaming face.

156
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,070
Now, who's this in the photo with you?

157
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,690
I don't know. It's an oldie.

158
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,360
- Who is it?
- Nobody.

159
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,280
- Just give it back.
- Hunter has a boyfriend.

160
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,490
It's nothing. Just some guy.

161
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,160
Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

162
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,220
Yo, what's up, guys?

163
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,970
Danger d, and I'm back stateside, yo!

164
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,930
Hashtag, super badass.

165
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,520
Okay, in my defense,

166
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,770
I may act like a total dick on camera,
but it's worth it.

167
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,230
I get paid for this shit.

168
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,560
It's enough to keep me traveling
and you know me,

169
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,230
I have to be doing dangerous shit
to keep my blood pumping,

170
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
so I might as well monetize that.

171
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,030
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna be a youtuber,

172
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,990
why not be yourself? You are awesome.

173
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,700
- Natural born clickbait.
- No.

174
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,870
What we're doing here, this is clickbait.

175
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,210
Excuse me?

176
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,300
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

177
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,050
Power ain't free, ma'am.

178
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,340
Oh, and do you know
where the b-67 TV tower is?

179
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,510
We can't find it on the map.

180
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,560
You don't need a map.
You see that light way up there?

181
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,020
That's your tower.

182
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,150
That's insanely high.

183
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,830
What's with the light? I thought you said
it was out of commission.

184
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,530
So aircraft can see it.

185
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,450
You know, this was once
the tallest structure in the us.

186
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,120
Now it's just this old relic.

187
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,580
They're due
to tear it down next winter.

188
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,790
Becky?

189
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,000
Becky?

190
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
- What?
- Give me your phone charger.

191
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,750
What are you doing?

192
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
A very cool life hack.

193
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,390
Now I'm just gonna line up the prongs

194
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,640
with the elements in the lamp. And...

195
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,100
How's that for a dumb youtuber?

196
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,420
Hey, honey.

197
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,420
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you sleep well?

198
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,220
I love you.

199
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,230
You're not gonna say it back?

200
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,350
I am saying it.

201
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,230
Four...

202
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Three...

203
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,280
I love you.

204
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,090
Hey, come on, becks. Sun's up.

205
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,480
What up, El capitan?

206
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,980
I don't know,
but something's up, sports illustrated.

207
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,610
Tits for clicks.

208
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,820
Are you live streaming?

209
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,030
No, dude. Shoot now, post later.

210
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,330
Oh, good. I don't wanna be in it.

211
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,950
Hey, guys. Danger d here

212
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,830
and I have somebody
very special for you to meet.

213
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,290
- Say hello, Becky c.
- Hi.

214
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,840
And we have something
totally batshit crazy for you guys today.

215
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,760
The b-67 TV tower.

216
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,100
This bad boy is over 2,000 feet tall.

217
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,440
And your homegirls are gonna be climbing
to the tippy, tippy top.

218
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,360
But don't worry, Becky c,

219
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,150
- because you're safe with...
- Watch out!

220
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,870
Holy shit!

221
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,990
Whoo!

222
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,040
Eight more lives, baby!

223
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,780
Shit.

224
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,170
Looks like we're walking from here.

225
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,090
- How far?
- I don't know.

226
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,680
Like a mile?

227
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,010
Maybe two-ish?

228
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,600
Damn, it's hot.

229
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,940
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

230
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,620
We've got enough water, you think?

231
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,110
Water's check. Harnesses check.

232
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,780
Super badass 4k drone check.

233
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,900
Selfie stick, all the essentials.

234
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,410
Food?

235
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,010
Nah, we'll be back in time before lunch...

236
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,700
Oh, Jesus.

237
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,790
Holy shit, they're big.

238
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,590
It's still alive. Get off of him!

239
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,010
- Hey! Hey!
- Go away!

240
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,930
Just go. Go!

241
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,060
Poor thing.

242
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,270
Pricks.

243
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,550
Survival of the fittest, right?

244
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,860
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

245
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,120
- "Feeling peckish."
- Hunter.

246
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,370
What? That's funny.

247
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,930
- Holy shit, 300 likes.
- Oh, wow.

248
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,850
350.

249
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,520
I wonder how many
of your followers are serial killers.

250
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,020
Holy shit.

251
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,690
Looks a lot bigger up close, right?

252
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,820
This is sick.

253
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,780
This is awful.

254
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,490
Hey, guys!

255
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,040
Danger d here.

256
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,290
And we are at the foot
of this stomach-churningly massive

257
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,340
fourth-highest structure in the us.

258
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,210
We 're gonna begin our grueling journey

259
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,800
with an 1,800-foot ladder climb

260
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,300
inside a steel cage.

261
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,720
And then after the cage...

262
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,680
We have a zoo-foot, vertigo-inspiring
mast with an external ladder.

263
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,690
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

264
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,730
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

265
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,990
- The ledge. The top of the world, ma.
- Hunter?

266
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,030
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

267
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Babe, of course you can.

268
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,160
No, um, I really can't. I'm, like...

269
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,830
I'm petrified. I'm, like, shaking.

270
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,380
I'm here.

271
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,590
Take a breath.

272
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,760
After Dan died,
I was afraid of my own shadow.

273
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,850
But I pushed through.

274
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,470
I overcame the fear. I took control.

275
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:35,400
Do not let this fear consume you.
Come at it head on and kick its ass.

276
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,150
If you can beat it, you can beat anything.

277
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,360
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

278
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,490
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

279
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,830
So shut your shit and let's do this.

280
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,790
God, hunter.

281
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,880
You know, that's the kind of shit
you should be posting on Instagram.

282
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,340
Come on.

283
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,890
Dude, this is so cool.

284
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,350
Holy shit.

285
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,310
Look at this.

286
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,390
Damn it, hunter.
You are such an asshole.

287
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,270
- What are you getting us into?
- Don't worry.

288
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
We've got 50 feet of rope between us.

289
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,360
We're clipped in and we're all good.

290
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,990
Okay.

291
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,320
One rung at a time,
and let me know if you have to rest.

292
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,070
Okay, okay.

293
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,370
See?

294
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,870
It's easy.

295
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,710
Sure.

296
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,090
You're doing great. Come on.

297
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,670
You okay?

298
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,310
You're doing great.

299
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,430
Come on.

300
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,970
Hunter?

301
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,350
- Hunter?
- Yeah?

302
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,640
Can we rest a moment?
I need a drink.

303
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,150
Of course.

304
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Those guylines means we're halfway up.

305
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,660
Perfect spot.

306
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
You wanna know something crazy?

307
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
What?

308
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,790
Halfway up?

309
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,750
That means we've climbed about 1,000 feet.

310
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,040
So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

311
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,250
Please don't say shit like that, hunter.

312
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,970
Whoa!

313
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,550
There's the motel. And the diner.

314
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,470
No way. Looks like a little toy town.

315
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,440
- Let's just get this over with.
- Yeah.

316
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,570
Come on. Catch up.

317
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,960
That's it.

318
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,260
Becky, you're doing amazing.

319
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,350
Come on! Come on, Becky!

320
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,990
Okay.

321
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,490
This is the end of the internal ladder.

322
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,700
One step at a time, okay? You got this.

323
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,710
The next 200 feet is external.

324
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,840
I'm not gonna lie.

325
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,010
It's gonna get a little bit crazy
when we're out of the cage in the open.

326
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,380
But don't panic.

327
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,770
Hunter. Hunter!

328
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,360
Hunter! Hunter!

329
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,320
Becky! You gotta come up. It's so sick!

330
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,240
Okay.

331
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,250
- Hunter?
- I'm here.

332
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,050
It's just like 200 feet more, that's all.

333
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,220
- I can't!
- Yes, you can!

334
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,760
Just look up and only up.

335
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,600
You're doing great. You got this.

336
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,360
Okay. Okay.

337
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,910
Okay.

338
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,100
Yeah! You're killing it!

339
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,190
Whoo!

340
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,690
You're okay.

341
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,650
Remember, only look up.

342
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,410
What the hell are we doing?

343
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,500
Hey!

344
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,170
Stop overthinking.

345
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,960
- How?
- I don't know.

346
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,670
Concentrate on something else, like...

347
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,380
Sing a-a nursery rhyme or some shit.

348
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,930
Okay, okay.

349
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,350
Okay.

350
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,680
J“ ring around the roses j“

351
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,310
j“ pocket full of posies j“

352
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,230
j“ ashes, ashes, we all fall down j“

353
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,940
j" down! J”

354
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,150
I wouldn't have picked that one.

355
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,150
Wow.

356
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,660
Okay. Okay, becks,

357
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,910
this is gonna look
a little bit worse than it is.

358
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,830
Ah, what the hell, hunter?
Let's just go back down!

359
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,130
Becky, if I let you go back now,
fear wins.

360
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,970
And I'm not going to let that happen.

361
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,590
It's okay, becks.

362
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
It's okay.

363
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,170
I've got your weight.

364
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,760
Thanks. Okay.

365
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,030
- Reach up. Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

366
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,370
Okay.

367
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,210
Smooth as sailing to the top now.
You got this.

368
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,090
I actually really do hate you, hunter.

369
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,510
Hey, does this ladder feel loose to you?

370
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,020
Stop, you click, hunter!

371
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,810
Sorry.

372
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,030
What was that?

373
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,910
Come on, we're almost there.

374
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,200
- Come on.
- Okay.

375
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,730
Wow.

376
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,030
Becky, you're not gonna believe this.
You gotta come up here.

377
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
I'm coming.

378
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,160
- Okay.
- Whoo!

379
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,460
Okay.

380
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,380
Hunter.

381
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,970
Hey, trust me.

382
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:36,930
Okay, okay.

383
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,400
Fuck, Becky!

384
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,280
Oh, I'm here. Oh, my god.

385
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,080
Oh, my god.

386
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,670
We did it, becks!
I knew you could.

387
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,210
Whoo!

388
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,190
Whoo!

389
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,400
Here we go!

390
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,530
- On top of the goddamn world!
- Whoo!

391
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,330
Do you wanna try?

392
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,710
Shit! Hunter, stop!

393
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,380
Just focus on getting a good shot.
I didn't wear this stupid bra for nothing.

394
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,670
- No, hunter.
- Whoo!

395
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,010
Swoop it around!

396
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,390
Seize your day!

397
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,680
Okay. Oh, my god.

398
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,070
How'd it look?

399
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,780
Insane! Insane. Crazy.

400
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,910
Let's get this bad boy back.

401
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,370
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

402
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,340
Okay. Now the ultimate, becks.

403
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,050
Your turn.

404
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,640
What? No.

405
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,600
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

406
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,970
No. No, hunter.

407
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,100
The old Becky would have done it.

408
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,980
- Just saying...
- Dude.

409
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,610
Here. I'll hold your hand.

410
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,990
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah?

411
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,660
Shit.

412
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,790
Come on, come on!

413
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,410
You can do this.

414
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,420
- You can do it.
- Okay, okay, okay.

415
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,680
- I got you.
- Okay.

416
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,180
Okay. Whoa!

417
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,890
- You can trust me.
- Whoa, okay.

418
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,680
- I've got you, becks.
- Oh, my god.

419
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,560
Careful over the ledge.

420
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,100
Take it easy.

421
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,730
Okay, I've got you. I've got you.

422
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,860
Open your eyes.

423
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:43,290
Whoo-hoo!

424
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,460
Okay, just one more.

425
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,380
You're coming up right now.

426
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,600
My god, you did it.

427
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,680
You did it! You did it, you idiot.

428
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,650
Yes! Look.

429
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,270
- Look how amazing these are.
- Oh, my god. Whoa!

430
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,530
Next time you are ever afraid of anything,

431
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,450
I want you to look at these and know
that you have nothing to be afraid of.

432
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,660
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

433
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,120
I'm really proud of you.

434
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,880
Dan would be, too.

435
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,390
Okay.

436
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,140
Okay, it's time.

437
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,100
You and I were one, Dan.

438
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,650
And whenever I needed a laugh,

439
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,230
you told me one of your shit jokes.

440
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,490
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on, it was yours.

441
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,870
And now you're gone and I'm...

442
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
I don't feel whole anymore.

443
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,840
I miss you, um, just so much and I'm...

444
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,300
I love you.

445
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,680
Goodbye, Dan.

446
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,120
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

447
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,330
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

448
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,550
I've just been so far away for so long.

449
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,050
It just didn't really feel real
until then.

450
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,390
Come on.

451
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,680
Let's get back down on earth, okay?

452
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,450
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

453
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,560
I've needed to pee
since we passed the Eiffel Tower.

454
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,400
Okay?

455
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,280
- Okay, home time.
- Home time.

456
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,450
- Harnesses?
- Harnesses.

457
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,370
Think of the ice-cold
beers waiting for us.

458
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,080
Oh, stop.

459
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,960
- I've got you.
- Okay, slowly.

460
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,090
Okay.
Uh, I'm just getting a stitch here.

461
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,170
Okay, okay.

462
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,110
Okay.

463
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,590
Hunter!

464
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,650
Oh, my god! Oh, my god, holy shit.

465
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,610
- Don't let go.
- Yeah, I got you.

466
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,740
Hunter!

467
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,880
Oh, god, please don't drop me.

468
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,760
Don't drop me.

469
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,310
Becks?

470
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,990
I've got you, becks.

471
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
I can see the ladder.

472
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,960
I've got you.

473
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,890
I just died almost.

474
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,730
Oh, my god.

475
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,190
Did that really just happen?

476
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,480
- Oh, my...
- Jesus Christ!

477
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,530
I wish we'd filmed that.

478
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,650
Oh, you're here.

479
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,570
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

480
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,950
Okay, take two.

481
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,880
Oh, no.

482
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,800
The ladder. It's gone.

483
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,610
Hunter, how do we get down?

484
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,190
- Shit!
- Please tell me there's a way to go down.

485
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,520
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

486
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,320
- No.
- Oh, no.

487
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,660
No, no, no.

488
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,160
Um, there must be something.

489
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,960
No. Shit. I don't have a signal.

490
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
I don't get it, either.

491
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,650
I'm sure there's something,
I'm sure it's just really spotty up here.

492
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,930
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

493
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,010
We're gonna be okay.

494
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,970
Freaking out is not gonna help anything
right now, so just take a breath.

495
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,310
We're stuck on a pizza-sized platform
in the middle of nowhere, hunter.

496
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,770
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

497
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,020
It's not gonna help, okay?

498
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,650
It's okay.

499
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,530
- I'm sure we can...
- Wait, hunter. Hunter, hunter.

500
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,740
Look at this.

501
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,610
Oh, my god.

502
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,410
- Binoculars. Amazing.
- Okay.

503
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,660
We have a flare.

504
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,950
Okay.

505
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,000
Okay.

506
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,620
- This is great news.
- Okay. Great.

507
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:39,010
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

508
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,350
Oh, man, our water's in there.

509
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,270
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

510
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,980
- No. No.
- We don't have water.

511
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,250
- No, think about it...
- That's how you die when you're stranded.

512
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,650
The noise! The noise that this thing
made when it crashed,

513
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,980
there is no way nobody heard that. Okay?

514
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,030
I'm-I'm sure that there are, like,
multiple calls to 911 as we speak.

515
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,160
- Do you really think so?
- Yeah.

516
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,830
Yeah, the cavalry is coming, okay?
We just... we just have to wait.

517
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,790
Okay. Okay.

518
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,460
Holy...

519
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,770
- What? What?
- Becky, your leg.

520
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,760
My god.

521
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,510
What the hell?

522
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,130
I didn't even notice this.

523
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,430
Whoa!

524
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,550
- Um, whoa!
- Come here.

525
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,180
- Let's compress it.
- Ow!

526
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,580
- Are you okay? I know.
- It really hurts. Can you just like...

527
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,890
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay.
- Can you warn me?

528
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,690
- Count of three?
- Yeah. One...

529
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,690
Two... sorry. I'm really sorry.

530
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,070
- I know.
- Oh, man.

531
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,030
Are you okay?

532
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,110
Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like...

533
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,290
I really have to pee.

534
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,750
- Just go.

535
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:50,330
- Just pee.
- No, it's fine. I can hold it.

536
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,420
I just need to get comfortable.

537
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,640
Can you go any farther?
It's, like, spraying.

538
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,640
- Okay, careful over the ledge.
- I'm trying.

539
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,640
Stop looking at me.

540
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,560
Oh, god. That's a relief.

541
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,980
I'm just grateful you didn't need to shit.

542
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,570
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,

543
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,610
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

544
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:22,700
All right.

545
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,080
All right!

546
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,670
Do you really think someone's coming?

547
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,510
One million percent.

548
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,340
Hey, danger d, what's happening, guys?

549
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,220
I'll tell you what's happenin', Becky c.

550
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,020
We are stuck at the top
of a 2, 000-foot tower with no way down.

551
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,100
And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life.

552
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,480
And no way to upload it.

553
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,440
That's what worrying you
about the situation?

554
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,730
It's quite ironic.

555
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,440
Well, don't worry,
you'll still be famous if you fall,

556
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,530
as the girl who died taking a selfie.
Now, that is ironic.

557
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,160
I would like to be remembered for my life,
not my death, thank you very much.

558
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,910
Hashtag, life over death.

559
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,330
Hashtag, Becky's a dick hole.

560
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,500
Hashtag, hunter says she's doing
this YouTube thing for the money,

561
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,130
but really I think
she's just like a "like" whore.

562
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,340
- It's not like that.
- Okay, what is it like, then?

563
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,760
Come on, show us who you are.
Show us Shiloh hunter.

564
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,680
Tell us why you vlog.

565
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,060
Okay, firstly, you're an asshole.

566
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,110
Secondly,

567
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,530
um... ahem...

568
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,490
And this is gonna sound stupid...

569
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,540
But I do this because of Dan.

570
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,540
What happened, it...

571
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,040
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

572
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,640
And I want to spread that message,
that life is short, too short.

573
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,810
So, you gotta use every moment.

574
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:56,890
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

575
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,070
That was amazing.

576
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,240
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

577
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,750
That was really great.

578
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,670
- Should I kill danger d?
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,090
I'll help you Bury the body.

580
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,810
Oh, shit.

581
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,070
There's like an old rv thing down there.

582
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:48,150
- Can I see?
- Just past the gate, a little over.

583
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,660
Yeah. That looks abandoned.

584
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,500
It's been five hours. If anyone
called 911, they'd be here by now.

585
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:19,730
Oh, my god. Holy shit.

586
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,900
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

587
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,860
but we definitely did down there.
Remember I got all those likes?

588
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,900
Shit.

589
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,980
Okay.

590
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,200
Okay, so we don't know
at what point we lost service.

591
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,360
Maybe it was just up here
because of some, like,

592
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,450
- interference with the broadcast antenna.
- Yeah.

593
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,620
I think you're definitely
onto something, hunter.

594
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,370
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

595
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,120
We can try to fish for coverage.

596
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,460
I just need something to secure this with.

597
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,710
- My hair tie.
- Yeah, perfect.

598
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:46,790
Okay.

599
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,300
Okay. Can you message
emergency services?

600
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,130
I don't think so. But I have
over 60,000 followers.

601
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,340
- Okay.
- "Help us.

602
00:48:55,430 --> 00:49:01,350
Stuck on 8-67 tower. Call 911

603
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,890
it's ready to post.

604
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,150
We should hear it when it sends.

605
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,070
Come on, come on.

606
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,410
Okay. Okay.

607
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,120
Let me see if I can get lower.

608
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,000
Just be careful.

609
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,300
Got it, okay. Come on.

610
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,090
That's the end.

611
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,390
- I didn't hear anything.
- I didn't, either.

612
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,060
I don't think it posted.

613
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,190
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

614
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,730
What? What do you mean? Just...

615
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,150
I've got it. I've got an idea.

616
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,950
- Careful, hunter.
- Feels solid.

617
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

618
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,340
Okay.

619
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,300
- Oh, my god. Careful.
- Shit. Shit.

620
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,880
Oh, my god, hunter.

621
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,010
- Are you okay? Oh, my god.
- Yeah. Yeah.

622
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,600
Careful. Shit.

623
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,440
I don't hear anything. Nothing.

624
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,650
Okay, you need to come back up.

625
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,820
Shit.

626
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,790
I got it.

627
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,800
- Did it post?
- No.

628
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,640
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

629
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,520
Wait, hold on.

630
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,690
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

631
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,900
- Yeah.
- What if we just drop the phone?

632
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,460
Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

633
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,570
Not if we reinforce it somehow,
so it doesn't like the egg drop challenge.

634
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,410
Yeah. Okay, shit.

635
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,450
Um, we just need something to...
To put it in.

636
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,080
- Yeah.
- This.

637
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,420
It's welded on. My shoe's too flimsy.

638
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,380
- Your shoe?
- Yeah, perfect.

639
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,920
Okay, got it.

640
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,970
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

641
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,890
Yeah. Okay.

642
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,350
Okay.

643
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,270
We still need something more substantial.

644
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,610
Oh, hunter. Your push-up bra.

645
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,940
- That is more substantial.
- Yeah.

646
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,950
Dying to get this thing off, anyway.

647
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,660
Thank you, vs.

648
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,410
Okay.

649
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,580
Hope it's strong enough.

650
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,960
Shove it real good.

651
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,920
Okay.

652
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,720
Here goes nothing.

653
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,300
- Did it work?
- I don't know. I can't tell.

654
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,670
- Do you see anything?
- No, nothing.

655
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,960
Don't worry. They're coming.

656
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,020
Holy shit! There's a freaking guy!

657
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,390
- What?
- Oh, my god. Yes.

658
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,690
And a dog, too.

659
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,770
- Hey! Up here!
- Hey, help us!

660
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,610
Look, I sent you the check, man. Come on.

661
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,120
I need that...

662
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,030
- Hey!
- Hey, boy! Big boy!

663
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
Parker.

664
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:37,840
Come! Come on, boy.

665
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,290
No, no, no, no, no.

666
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,590
Shit!

667
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,430
Hey!

668
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,550
Let's go.

669
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,820
Goddamn it, they're getting away.

670
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,530
Parker.

671
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,660
He got the shoe.

672
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,500
- Hey! Up here!
- Look up here. Please!

673
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,210
- Hey!
- Hey!

674
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,300
- He's walking!
- Hey!

675
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,310
- No, no, no, turn around!
- Turn around!

676
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,560
Right here!

677
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:39,230
- Shit! Shit!
- Hey!

678
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,900
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
Do not fire the flare, he's not looking.

679
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,650
This might be our only chance.

680
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,740
No, no, no, he's not looking.

681
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,780
Wait.

682
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,410
Hold on. There's somebody by the rv.

683
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,790
- He's setting up a grill or some shit.
- Okay.

684
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:00,580
And we'll fire the flare when the sun goes
down in like... in like an hour.

685
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:01,950
We've only got one shot at this.

686
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,170
- Oh, damn.
- What?

687
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,800
- They're making ribs.
- Oh, no.

688
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,550
- And they have really cold beer.
- Don't.

689
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,110
These guys are definitely a couple.

690
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,370
Dirty weekend away.

691
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,450
I'm jealous.

692
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,470
Hey, hey, hey. They're finishing up.

693
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,310
It's now or never, fire the flare.

694
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,480
- Is it dark enough?
- Uh-huh.

695
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,810
Okay.

696
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,150
- Shit.
- Shit. What the hell?

697
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,810
- Why isn't it firing?
- I fired it.

698
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,540
I cocked it, maybe
there's a safety or something?

699
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,290
Shit. Okay, they're going in, they're
going in. You have to do the flare now.

700
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,710
- I'm trying. It's stuck.
- Get it to go.

701
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:10,860
Okay, I got it. I got it.

702
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,580
Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

703
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,830
- Okay, give me your phone.
- Okay.

704
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,800
Hey, sons of bitches, up here!

705
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,880
Holy shit! Check this out.

706
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,220
Up here! Hey!

707
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,780
Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.

708
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,800
- What?
- They can see us.

709
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,010
Oh, my god!

710
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,310
Holy shit! Oh, my god,

711
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,810
let me see, let me see, let me see.

712
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,430
Oh, my god, they're coming.

713
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:42,770
Hey!

714
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,650
Holy shit, they found the car.
They found our car, they found our car.

715
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,240
They have a... a crowbar.
They're probably gonna open the gate.

716
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,950
- Okay.
- Okay.

717
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,540
- Wait, what the hell?
- Wait, what's going on?

718
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,540
- They stopped.
- What?

719
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,920
Quit chatting, go open the freakin' gate.

720
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,750
No. No, no, no. What the hell?

721
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,010
- They're stealing my freakin' car!
- What?

722
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,260
- No, you sons of bitches!
- Hey!

723
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,380
You asshole! What the hell?

724
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,470
No! I need to see it!

725
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,100
- Oh, my god. No, no!
- Die, you freakin' assholes!

726
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,530
Okay. New rule.

727
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,120
If somebody falls off the tower,

728
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,950
they bring the cell phone with them,
and call for help on the way down.

729
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,500
And maybe post that video.

730
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,460
Kidding-ish.

731
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,720
Yeah, my leg. I could eat aspirin
like skittles right now.

732
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,560
It's looking a little funky.

733
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,430
Could use some washing, here.

734
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,530
I'm sorry.

735
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,040
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

736
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,550
What's wrong?

737
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,090
Dan could never say the words,
"I love you."

738
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,020
1-4-3.

739
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,310
1-4-3.

740
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,860
- Becky, I...
- How long?

741
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,410
Four months.

742
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,040
It was a huge mistake.

743
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,750
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

744
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,340
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

745
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,970
For falling in love with the same guy.

746
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,880
Who made the move?

747
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
- Both super drunk.
- Who?

748
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,260
He did.

749
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:47,260
But it was a huge, huge mistake, becks.

750
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,230
No.

751
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,060
A mistake is a kiss, a one-night stand.

752
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,780
You said you loved him, so...

753
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,530
It got out of hand.

754
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:08,870
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...

755
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,700
He listened to me, he was...

756
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,460
He was just different than every
other douchebag that I'd ever dated and...

757
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,670
And I'd never felt that way before.

758
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,480
And then you asked me to be
your maid of honor

759
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:26,680
and it all hit me like a ton of bricks,
how messed up this all was.

760
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,770
I loved him, but...

761
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:35,310
But I love you more, so I ended it.

762
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,030
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

763
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,410
And after Dan died, I...

764
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,740
I just didn't have the strength
to be there for you,

765
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:52,120
to be strong enough for you, so...

766
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,960
So, I ran away.

767
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,540
And now you hate me and I don't blame you,

768
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,170
and now we're stuck on this stupid,
freaking tower

769
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,880
in the middle of freaking nowhere.

770
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,880
And it's all my fault.

771
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:10,430
I am so, so sorry.

772
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:25,800
What's that?

773
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,630
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

774
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,850
It's been 24 hours.

775
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,310
I think it's time to accept that either
your 60,000 followers don't give a shit

776
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,810
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

777
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,280
Okay.

778
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,570
Well, we've got one more shot. Your phone.

779
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,530
Yeah, no padding this time, though.
Even less of a chance.

780
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,490
And if this fails
we really don't have any hope.

781
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,790
How long till we die of thirst?

782
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,550
It's just killing me that our water
is just right down there in that bag.

783
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,800
Yeah, with the drone.

784
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,380
We could've used that to get help.

785
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:15,310
We could have flown it back to our motel
with a good old fashioned note.

786
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,560
Wait, maybe I can get it.

787
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,860
What do you mean?
You said it was too smooth. No footholds.

788
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,700
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,

789
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,990
I think the rope
was long enough to reach it.

790
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,780
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

791
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,200
Yeah, I seriously think I can get it.

792
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,010
Hunter, I don't think this is a good idea.

793
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:52,800
Becky, I don't think we have a choice.

794
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,930
Every hour that passes, the weaker we get.

795
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,560
Besides...

796
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,560
Maybe you'll get lucky and I'll fall.

797
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:15,620
Hunter.

798
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:20,410
Be careful.

799
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:24,960
I'm sorry, becks.

800
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:27,420
I love you.

801
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,600
Okay.

802
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,780
Are you okay?

803
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,860
Yeah.

804
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,570
Yeah, all good.

805
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,120
Okay.

806
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,420
Okay.

807
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,430
Hunter, careful.

808
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,690
Shit.

809
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,900
I can't quite reach it.

810
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,900
- Come back up. We'll attach it lower.
- Come on.

811
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,900
Shit.

812
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:39,200
I think I can drop myself lower.

813
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,080
What?

814
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,580
What the hell are you doing, hunter?

815
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:45,960
Hunter!

816
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,920
Shit.

817
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,350
- I think I can swing to it.
- Hunter, no!

818
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:07,690
Hunter! Come back up!

819
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,020
Hunter, no!

820
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,480
Hunter!

821
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,150
Are you okay?

822
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,120
Yeah.

823
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,160
Is there a way down?

824
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,420
No. The ladder ripped all the way off.

825
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,190
- Oh, my god.
- Wait, hunter.

826
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:52,480
How are you gonna get back on the rope?

827
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:57,610
Uh.

828
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,820
Shit.

829
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,660
Can... can you reach it?

830
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,800
J“ humpty dumpty sat on the wall j“

831
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,050
oh, my god.

832
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,340
J“ humpty dumpty had a big fall... j“

833
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,860
Shit.

834
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,450
- You okay?
- Yeah.

835
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:44,240
I have an idea.

836
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:54,790
Okay.

837
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,590
I'm gonna try to hook it on with this,

838
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:00,340
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

839
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,760
- Okay?
- That's amazing.

840
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,390
That's some good MacGyver shit
right there.

841
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,670
Oh, come on. Please. Come on.

842
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,920
- You did it!
- Okay.

843
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,590
Okay. I'm gonna jump onto this.

844
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,760
I'm gonna need your help to pull me up.

845
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,180
- Okay.
- Get ready, becks.

846
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,260
- Okay.
- Okay.

847
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,140
Okay.

848
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:58,310
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

849
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:08,490
Shit.

850
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,910
Hunter, are you okay? You okay?

851
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:16,170
Okay. I'm okay.

852
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,210
Let's do this fast and quick, Becky.

853
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:19,750
Work together to pull me up.

854
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,170
- Okay.
- I climb, you pull.

855
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,300
Okay? Okay, now!

856
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:59,420
I can almost reach the ladder.

857
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,010
Almost there, becks.

858
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,390
Okay.

859
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,220
Becky! I landed on the bag!

860
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,340
Oh, my god... are you okay?

861
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:53,010
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

862
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,970
You're gonna have to pull me up, okay?

863
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,310
Okay. Okay.

864
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,350
I got you.

865
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:43,020
Oh, shit.

866
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,190
Oh, no. Are you okay?

867
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,820
Shit. I thought you died there.

868
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,530
I'm not going anywhere, becks.

869
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:52,150
Yeah, that was scary.

870
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,830
- We should ration it.
- Okay. You're right.

871
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:06,420
Is there any food in there?

872
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
No, it's just your cherry lip balm.

873
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:10,670
I don't think you can eat that.

874
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:14,760
Okay, it's getting dark.
I think it's now or never on that drone.

875
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:19,020
I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.

876
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,140
Okay, the receipt from the diner.

877
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:25,730
- A pen... do you have a pen?
- Eyeliner in here.

878
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:28,130
Aren't you glad I brought up makeup now?

879
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:31,740
"Help.

880
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:36,990
Stuck on top of 8-67 tower.
Call 911

881
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,240
yeah, perfect.

882
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,580
Okay. See that?

883
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:49,170
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

884
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,630
It leads to the motel.

885
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:53,720
Let's do this while we still have light.

886
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,680
Okay.

887
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,680
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.

888
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,770
- Let it drift down as it goes.
- Okay.

889
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,330
Okay.

890
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,330
Okay, we're almost past the gate.

891
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:24,850
Oh, my god.

892
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:26,520
- No, no, no. The battery.
- What?

893
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,540
- It's running out ofjuice.
- Oh, shit.

894
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,170
Hit retrieve. Or has it gone too far?

895
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,130
- Is it gonna make it?
- There's no chance!

896
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,930
- Are you sure?
- It's not even at the gate.

897
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,260
Shit. It's dropping.

898
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,610
- Hit retrieve, hit retrieve...
- Hunter.

899
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,680
- Hit retrieve.
- Okay.

900
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,570
- It's coming back.
- Fly it up.

901
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,200
Give it the best shot to get back to us.

902
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,230
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

903
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,810
- Just get it higher!
- I'm trying.

904
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,530
- We'll grab it when it gets close.
- Okay.

905
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,860
Okay. We've got this.

906
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,740
Get it, becks, get it.

907
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,120
Nice! Good job.

908
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,600
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

909
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,770
Maybe just turn it off and once it's
rested, it will have morejuice.

910
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:27,390
It's never gonna be enough. Hunter.

911
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,570
What are we gonna do?

912
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:40,990
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

913
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,490
We're gonna stay calm.

914
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,410
We're gonna figure it out, okay?
There's gotta be a way.

915
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:53,290
- Are we gonna die?
- No.

916
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,880
No, we're gonna be okay.

917
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,830
Hunter. Hunter...

918
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:29,410
Where are you? Hunter...

919
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,840
Hunter...

920
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,340
Hunter, where are you?

921
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,520
Hunter. Hunter!

922
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:51,700
Becky, it's okay.

923
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,670
You just had a bad dream.

924
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:59,960
You're nice and safe,
2,000 feet up in the middle of nowhere.

925
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,890
I have an idea.

926
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:12,520
How to charge the drone.

927
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,770
Your dumb life hack.

928
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:18,940
Becky, you freakin' genius.

929
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:28,620
I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

930
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:51,350
Okay, it's a standard bulb fitting,
but it's gonna be hot.

931
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:53,560
It's 30 feet
but it's gonna feel like 1,000.

932
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:59,480
- Is your leg okay?
- Yeah.

933
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,860
It smells, but it doesn't hurt
anymore. It's fine.

934
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,320
Okay.

935
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:12,160
You can do this.

936
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,960
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

937
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,590
Keep going, Becky.

938
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,140
You got this, Becky.

939
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:45,820
- I can't.
- It's okay, it's okay.

940
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,700
I can't.

941
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,150
You can do it, Becky.

942
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,780
You got it.

943
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:58,410
It's okay. It's just like pole dancing.

944
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,210
Um... okay, "cherry pie."

945
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:04,040
J“ she's my cherry pie j“

946
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:07,130
j“ my cold drink of water,
my sweet surprise j“

947
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:09,050
j“ she's my cherry pie j“

948
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:13,510
J“ making my cherry pie j“

949
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,180
whoo!

950
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,560
J“ she's my cherry pie j“

951
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,770
j“ my cold drink of water,
my sweet surprise j“

952
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:23,150
j“ she's my cherry pie j“

953
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,230
whoo!

954
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:26,530
J“ Becky's my cherry pie j“

955
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,280
yes!

956
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,620
You did it, my little cherry pie.

957
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:37,700
Good job!

958
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,250
- Okay.
- Yeah!

959
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:45,460
You did it, cherry pie!

960
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,920
All right. All right.

961
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,010
- Okay. Okay.
- Remember, it's hot.

962
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,550
Be careful.

963
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:15,570
Okay, just think back to the diner.

964
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,910
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

965
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:20,540
with the elements of the bulb socket.

966
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,710
I don't think it's long enough.

967
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,590
I think the back prong doesn't reach.

968
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:34,340
Okay, you're gonna need something small
and metal to carry the current, like a...

969
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:37,720
Like a screw or something
that you can jam in there.

970
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,350
- There isn't anything.
- Jesus. Um...

971
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:11,880
It's working! It's freaking working!

972
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,920
Holy shit, my hero!

973
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:16,590
Okay, we're gonna need a full charge.

974
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,260
I don't know. It just has four lights.

975
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:22,810
Okay, we have to charge it all the way.
Give ourselves the best shot.

976
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,730
You gonna be okay?

977
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:27,150
Yeah. I got this.

978
01:22:57,630 --> 01:22:59,930
You okay?

979
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:02,680
Hang in there, becks.

980
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,600
Past halfway.

981
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,630
Get off of me!

982
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:39,340
It's okay, it's okay, Becky.
You've got it.

983
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:41,600
Three lights.

984
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,730
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

985
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,690
Get the hell away from me!

986
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:04,870
You did it!

987
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,880
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

988
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,590
- Why didn't you catch the bag?
- Uh...

989
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:21,090
Babe, you okay?

990
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:31,190
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

991
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,310
Checkout, 10:00 am.

992
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,900
Just a couple of hours.

993
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:07,720
You know, he was right about Dan.
He was just trying to help me and...

994
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,940
And I was so horrible to him.

995
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:18,360
If there was anyone
I could text, it would be him.

996
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,150
Just to say...

997
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,820
I'm so sorry.

998
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,830
I love him.

999
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:36,210
I'm tapping out here.

1000
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:39,960
Stay with me.
Try to keep your mind occupied.

1001
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,680
Tell me something, something that...

1002
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,760
That you and your dad used to do together.

1003
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,350
We would watch wrestling.

1004
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,600
- Wwe.
- Yeah.

1005
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,690
I forgot you guys were into that.

1006
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:01,490
Yeah. It was our thing, you know?

1007
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:06,240
He was always said I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1008
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,120
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1009
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,630
Name some of your favorite wrestlers.

1010
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,420
Uh, "stone cold" Steve Austin.

1011
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,380
The rock.

1012
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:30,060
What was cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1013
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,350
Mankind.

1014
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,350
Mankind.

1015
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:38,230
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1016
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:39,980
I didn't.

1017
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:42,070
Keep going, you need to stay awake.

1018
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:45,900
Batista.

1019
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,620
Okay. It's checkout time.

1020
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,880
Okay, here it goes.

1021
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,260
Just keep that shit straight.
Follow the line of the road.

1022
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,020
Come on, you son of a...

1023
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:26,070
I'm past the point of no return,
so how's the battery?

1024
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,400
Should I retrieve?

1025
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,700
No, keep going.

1026
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,160
Come on, come on, just follow the road.

1027
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,960
Oh, shit.

1028
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:51,050
It's gonna work.

1029
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:01,060
Oh, god.

1030
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,440
No.

1031
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,990
Screw your truck.
Get the drone! Get it!

1032
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:19,790
No, no, no, no!

1033
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,750
Go back! Go back.

1034
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,300
No, no, no. Go back!

1035
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,590
Go back!

1036
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:34,430
Fuck, no!

1037
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,020
Is that a storm?

1038
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,190
It's kind of beautiful from up here.

1039
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:37,700
I can't survive another night.

1040
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,000
Becky, don't talk like that.

1041
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,500
I just...

1042
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:47,960
- I just wanna sleep.
- You can't sleep.

1043
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,550
The vultures, they can smell your leg.

1044
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:53,260
They're waiting for you
to give up so they can attack.

1045
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,680
Survival of the fittest.

1046
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,640
You need energy.

1047
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,640
We should eat something.

1048
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:09,150
What? We're 2,000 feet up
in the middle of the desert.

1049
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:12,650
- There's no food up here.
- There's always something.

1050
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:17,700
It's hopeless.

1051
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,040
Let's send another message.

1052
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,290
We can pad the cell better this time.

1053
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:28,630
- With what?
- Give me your shoe.

1054
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:31,420
- I can't.
- Why?

1055
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,130
- It's not up here, is it?
- What?

1056
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,220
It's down there.

1057
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,520
It's on your foot.

1058
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:47,770
I'm...

1059
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:51,730
Down there, remember?

1060
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,700
I fell.

1061
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,700
You can't have the shoe,

1062
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:06,870
because I didn't catch the bag.

1063
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,790
I bled out.

1064
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:30,900
You didn't really think your scrawny ass
could pull me up, did you?

1065
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:46,290
You pulled the bag up.

1066
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,130
I guess you were just too afraid

1067
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,630
to realize that you were up here...

1068
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,050
All alone.

1069
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:19,960
Hi, dad.

1070
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,090
I wanted you to know that I...

1071
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:27,140
I found my fight again.

1072
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,440
Please leave your message...

1073
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,560
I wanna live.

1074
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,690
I wanna go home...

1075
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,280
But I'm not gonna make it.

1076
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,120
You were right about everything and I...

1077
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:55,630
I'm sorry, dad.

1078
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:05,680
By the time you see this...

1079
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,890
I'll be gone.

1080
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:16,770
[Love you.

1081
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:55,620
That's it! Fuck!

1082
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,440
You need energy.

1083
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,980
You should eat something.

1084
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:30,110
Survival of the fittest.

1085
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:10,240
I can pad the cell better this time.

1086
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,820
Give me your shoe.

1087
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:31,730
Hunter.

1088
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:47,580
God, I love you.

1089
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,540
I'm sorry.

1090
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:26,160
I'm so sorry, but I really have
to make sure this gets through.

1091
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:28,080
God, god, I'm sorry.

1092
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,700
You can't park here.

1093
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:51,330
Becky! Becky!

1094
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:06,350
Dad?

1095
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,430
Dad?

1096
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:10,270
Dad!

1097
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,820
I thought that was you.

1098
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:22,740
Dad, I love you. I'm so sorry.

1099
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:25,410
It's okay.

1100
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:30,580
I just... I just want you to be okay.

1101
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,590
I am, you know? I'm gonna be okay.

1102
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,010
Really.

1103
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,150
Let's go home.

1104
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:02,030
Life is fleeting.

1105
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:04,360
Life is short.

1106
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:09,200
So, you gotta use every moment.

1107
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:12,460
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

1108
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,460
And that shit?

1109
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:18,750
That would spread that message
far and wide.
