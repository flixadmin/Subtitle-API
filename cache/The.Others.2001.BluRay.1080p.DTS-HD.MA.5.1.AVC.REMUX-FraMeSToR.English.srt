in just seven days.</i>

<i>All that long, long time ago,</i>

<i>Only God existed,</i>

10
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>and so only he could have
created them.</i>

11
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:04,834

Simpson.
What a character he was.

Wonder whatever
became of him.

Good morning, ma'am.

We've come about the...

Oh, yes, of course.

Come in.

29
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,334
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

30
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,959
Hmm. You are?

31
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,459
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

32
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,792
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

33
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,292
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

34
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,334
You must be the gardener.

35
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,334
Ah, that's right.
The gardener.

36
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:20,375
And this young lady
is called Lydia.

37
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,125
Have you had much experience
in service?

38
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:26,292
Oh, don't let that angel face
fool you, ma'am.

39
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,250
She's older than she looks.

40
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,167
Can you iron?

41
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,625
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

42
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,417
Uh, she can't talk, ma'am.

43
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,584
The poor little mite's a mute.

44
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,125
Oh.

45
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,959
Oh, but she's a good little worker.
I can promise you that.

46
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:48,542
All right. All right.

47
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,584
The other girl I had
spoke too much anyway.
Follow me.

48
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,959
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl,
you will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

49
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,959
And you, Mr...

50
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,292
Tuttle, ma'am.

51
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:04,375
Tuttle. Uh, you could sleep
in the shed around the back.

52
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:07,292
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

53
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,625
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

54
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,084
You mean they just vanished?

55
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,459
Into thin air.
No notice, nothing.

56
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:19,667
They didn't even collect their wages.
They... They just left us.

57
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,625
What a strange thing to do.

58
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:26,709
You'll soon find out there are
times when this house
is not exactly an ideal home.

59
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,542
Hence my advertisement
in the newspaper...

60
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,542
requesting honest,
hardworking people.

61
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,625
Well, there's nobody more honest
or hardworking than us.

62
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,292
Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?

63
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,292
Oh, aye. We're very honest.

64
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,084
And, um, very hardworking.

65
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,125
The kitchen.

66
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,959
I have breakfast at 8:00.
The children at 9:00.

67
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:55,125
Lunch will be served at 1:00
and dinner at half past 7:00.

68
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:56,792
And the master, ma'am?

69
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:04,334
The master went off to war...
a year and a half ago.

70
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,625
I've had no news
since the war ended.

71
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,209
Which of you does the cooking?

72
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:12,375
[Mrs. Mills]
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

73
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,375
Which of you does the cooking?

74
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,959
You'll notice what I'm doing.

75
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,709
In this house,

76
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:22,209
no door must be opened
without the previous one
being closed first.

77
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,750
It is vital that you remember this.

78
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,792
It is not as easy as it may seem.

79
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,917
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 50 doors...

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,542
depending on which area
of the house you're in at the time.

81
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,959
Mrs. Mills,
from tomorrow onwards,

82
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,459
I will be leaving a set of keys
in your charge.

83
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,125
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,125
The music room.

85
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,292
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

86
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,459
Please do not let the children
thump away on it.

87
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,459
It sets off my migraine.

88
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:54,209
Silence is something that we prize
very highly in this house.

89
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,709
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

90
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,167
or anything else
that makes a racket.

91
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,292
Oh. We don't have
electricity either.

92
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,292
During the war,
the Germans kept cutting it off,
so we just learned to live without it.

93
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,834
Let's continue.

94
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,250
Ma'am, there's really no need to show us
around the whole house. We...
Yes!

95
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,459
Yes, there is.

96
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,959
Because here most of the time
you can hardly see your way.

97
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:21,167
It's often difficult to make out
if there is a table, a chair,
a door, a sideboard...

98
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:26,125
or one of my children
playing hide-and-seek.

99
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,209
What do you mean, ma'am?

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,375
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

101
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,709
Mr. Tuttle, you can see
to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.

102
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,042
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,042
You two can start
closing the curtains.

104
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,334
All of them.

[Whispering]
I'll wake them. You wait here.

109
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,959

don't open the curtains.

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,292
Jesus to whom now I pray.

00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,875
Blessed be the Virgin pure,
whom I greet with faith so sure.

00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:18,750
Well, what do you say?

00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,292
How do you do?

How do you do, children?

My name is Mrs. Mills,
but you can call me Bertha if you like.

126
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:33,417
What are your names?

127
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,875
Anne.

00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,125
Anne and Nicholas.

129
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,542
What pretty names.

130
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,250
Are you going to be
our new nanny?

131
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,250
Mm-hmm.

132
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,709
Yes, my dears.
I'm your new nanny.

133
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,459
It's time for their breakfast.

134
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,042
Lydia, go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

135
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,209
[Sighs]

136
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,625
The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

137
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,209
For what?

138
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,542
Their condition.

139
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,667
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

140
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,542
They are photosensitive,
and they must never be exposed...

141
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,750
to any light
much stronger than this.

142
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,542
Otherwise,
in a matter of minutes,

143
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,792
they will break out
in sores and blisters and...

144
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,792
and begin to suffocate.

145
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,625
It would eventually be fatal.
Good heavens.

146
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:32,959
I don't like this toast.
Oh? Why not?

147
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,375
It tastes funny.

148
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,125
I liked it better before.

149
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:41,125
Well, that's because, before,
somebody else made it.

150
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,875
When are they
coming back?

151
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,459
They're not coming back, child.

152
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,792
Just like Daddy.

153
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:53,000
Daddy <i>is</i> coming back though.

154
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:57,125
Mrs. Mills, our father's
fighting in a war in France,
you know.

155
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,542
[Nicholas]
It's the World War.

156
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,459
I know, but he's in France.

157
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:04,042
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

158
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,209
Are you going
to leave us too?

159
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,292
Of course not.

160
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,667
Why should I leave you?

161

That's not what we agreed.

We didn't agree anything,

Today you're being punished,
and you'll do as I say.

479

You can't make me ask
the Virgin for forgiveness.

481
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,167
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness
for something I didn't do!

482
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,334
You told your brother that there was
someone else in the room!

- You're lying!

about Justus and Pastor?

Children who don't tell the truth
end up in limbo.

488
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:57,709
That's what you say,
but I read the other day...

489
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,625
that limbo's only for children
who haven't been baptized.

Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

499
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:50,875
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?

500
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,625
Oh, yes, ma'am.

501
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,875
I'd prefer to have her
where I can see her, but I can't
embroider in such poor light.

502

How long is this punishment
going to go on?
It's been three days now.

503
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:07,959
It's up to her.

504
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,709
She's got to learn
to swallow her pride
and ask for forgiveness.

505
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:16,334
Anyway, it's about time
she started to read the Bible.

506
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:17,584
Mm.

507
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:20,792
Well, the priest will be
very pleased to hear that, ma'am.

If he ever deigns
to pay us another visit.

He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

he'd be by as soon as possible.

backwards and forwards
as if there were three of her.

Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary...

523
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:07,292
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

that God made the world

of calling you.

Oh, dear.

Why should anyone want
to take all the curtains?

1122
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:40,834
To let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

to kill my children.

The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!

1129
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:03,625
Yes, but that was before.

1130
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:06,042
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

1131

If you never expose them
to daylight,

how do you know
they're not cured?

1133

My sister-in-law used to get
terrible attacks of rheumatism,

in her legs and back.

helping me hang them,
