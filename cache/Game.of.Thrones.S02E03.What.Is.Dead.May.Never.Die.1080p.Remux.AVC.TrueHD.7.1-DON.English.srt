I have 100,000 men at my command.

169
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,036
All the might of the Stormlands
and the Reach.

170
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,873
And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?

171
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,960
It's a game to you, isn't it?

172
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,462
- I pity them.
- Why?

173
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,297
Because it won't last.

174
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:03,093
Because they are the knights of summer
and winter is coming.

175
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,473
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.

176
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,602
- She's tired from her journey.
- BRIENNE: At once, Your Grace.

177
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,063
- Shall I return after?
- That won't be necessary.

178
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,649
I would pray awhile. Alone.

179
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,403
If you'll follow me, my lady.

180
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,117
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

181
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,494
I fought for my king.

182
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,497
Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.

183
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,458
Die for him if I must.

184
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,545
And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.

185
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,339
I'm no lady.

186
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,664
What are you doing here?

187
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,374
I live here.

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,586
Are you angry with me, brother?

189
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,046
You lying bitch.

190
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,757
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

191
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,843
Recognize you? How could I?

192
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,012
The last time I saw you...

193
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,933
you looked like a fat little boy.

194
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,311
You were a fat little boy, too,

195
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,522
but I recognized you.

196
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,357
Why didn't you tell me?

197
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,442
I wanted to see who you were first.

198
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,236
(LAUGHS) And I did.

199
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,658
The plans are made. It's time you heard them.

200
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,660
- Father.
- Father.

201
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,456
The wolf pup has gone south

202
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,626
with the entirety
of the Northern army at his back.

203
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,462
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

204
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,965
the North is ripe for the taking.

205
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,677
The ironborn will reave and pillage,
as it was in the old days,

206
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,054
all along the northern coast.

207
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,974
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

208
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,852
securing the Neck and everything above.

209
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,729
Every stronghold will yield to us,
one by one.

210
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,649
Winterfell may defy us for a year,
but what of it?

211
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,442
The rest shall be ours,

212
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,529
forest, field, and hall.

213
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,995
Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships

214
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,872
to attack Deepwood Motte.

215
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,124
I've always wanted a castle.

216
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,501
And what's my role in all this?

217
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,882
You'll take a ship to raid
the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

218
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,175
A ship?

219
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,719
You give her 30 and I get one?

220
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,097
The Sea Bitch.
We thought she'd be perfect for you.

221
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,059
I'm to fight fishermen?

222
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,187
Be careful of their nets.

223
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,360
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

224
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,697
- He won't give up the North so easily.
- They won't even know we're there

225
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,532
- until it's too late.
- What do you know of it, woman?

226
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:13,992
I'm a proven warrior.

227
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,412
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead

228
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,916
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

229
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,753
I'm not protecting anyone.

230
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,838
I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.

231
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,383
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

232
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,261
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

233
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,764
But if we pledge fealty to them,

234
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,682
they'll give us Casterly Rock.

235
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,517
What are our words?

236
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,604
Our words?

237
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,235
- We do not sow.
- We do not sow.

238
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,903
We are ironborn.

239
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,614
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.

240
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,742
We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.

241
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,827
We take what is ours.

242
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,165
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

243
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,713
You act as if I volunteered to go.

244
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,092
You gave me away, if you remember.

245
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,511
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

246
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,596
After he crushed you.

247
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,473
Did you take what was yours then?

248
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,104
You gave me away!

249
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,690
Your boy!

250
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,067
Your last boy!

251
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,697
You gave me away
like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.

252
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,908
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

253
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,463
You'd have our father
bow down to your other family?

254
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,882
I have no other family.

255
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,342
Don't you?

256
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,805
Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.

257
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,391
Our ships sail with or without you.

258
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,155
You won't let me leave this room.

259
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,074
- You won't let me...
- (SHUSHING) Keep your voice down.

260
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,747
Why? You think your father can hear me?

261
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,624
(SHOUTING) He's 300 miles away!

262
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,084
(SIGHS)

263
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,838
I don't intend for you to stay here.

264
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,216
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

265
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,719
Again, only temporary.

266
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,266
Every man who has tasted my cooking
has told me what a good whore I am.

267
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,310
But you wouldn't be a cook.

268
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,188
You'd pose as a scullion.

269
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,108
Scullion? What is a scullion?

270
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,778
Kitchen wench.

271
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,739
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but...

272
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,951
Cleaning pots?
Is that how my lion wants to see me?

273
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,579
Your lion wants to see you alive.

274
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,873
We've come to a dangerous place.

275
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,833
My sister wants to hurt me.

276
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,877
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

277
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,962
She can't know about you.

278
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,173
I'm the weakness?

279
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,758
It's a compliment, my lady.

280
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,053
How is being a weakness a compliment?

281
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,308
Language can be a bit tricky here.

282
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,518
Oh.

283
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,895
I'm too stupid to understand.

284
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,106
The stupid foreign girl.

285
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,820
I am not a kitchen wench.

286
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,681
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

287
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,933
Soon, darling, when the war is over.

288
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,811
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

289
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,855
and another for the feast.

290
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,358
But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.

291
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,948
The Princess just spoke to you.

292
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,616
Pardon, Your Grace.

293
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,830
I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.

294
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,083
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

295
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,712
and I can pledge
my love to the King in sight of the gods.

296
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,385
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

297
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,764
He might.

298
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,102
Would you like that?

299
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,856
No. I don't think so.

300
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,986
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.

301
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,990
Won't you, little dove?

302
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,883
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- (GASPS)

303
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,093
Come in.

304
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,015
Who are you?

305
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,809
I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.

306
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,480
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

307
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,192
- You're not from here.
- No.

308
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,408
What are you doing?

309
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,202
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

310
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,373
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
You should just do them.

311
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,542
What things?

312
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,211
Change my linens, wash my clothing,

313
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,548
scrub the floor,
empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

314
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,392
- No.
- You said to brush...

315
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,977
Not now.

316
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,148
Your chamber pot is empty.

317
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,818
Clean the table.

318
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,576
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

319
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,327
- Yes.
- For whom?

320
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,329
- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?

321
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,375
Lady Zuriff.

322
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,753
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

323
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,214
She wasn't in this city.

324
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,550
I don't know how they did things in that city,

325
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,386
but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,

326
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,013
not the other way around.

327
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,932
And I don't have time
to answer a thousand questions

328
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,351
and teach you how to do your job.

329
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,148
Do you want me to leave?

330
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,074
Just brush my hair.

331
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:25,632
TYRION: Oh!

332
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,383
Thank the gods.

333
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,636
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

334
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,639
I've encountered
this problem before, my lord.

335
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,433
The stresses of power often have this

336
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,353
insalubrious effect.

337
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,064
Two drops with water, daily.

338
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,358
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man

339
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,319
of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

340
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,905
- Please.
- Thank you, my lord.

341
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,912
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

342
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,705
Why, yes, of course, my lord.

343
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,999
These are perilous times.

344
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,085
And the crown must forge new alliances.

345
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:06,589
And these alliances
must often be sealed in matrimony.

346
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,592
Matrimony, huh?

347
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,427
Yes.

348
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:15,640
I'm trusting the council with these plans,
but the Queen mustn't know.

349
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,184
We can't have her meddling in affairs

350
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,104
that could determine the future of the realm.
There's too much at stake.

351
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,773
Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.

352
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,442
I shall be silent as the grave.

353
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,072
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

354
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:35,201
Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son
when she comes of age,

355
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,786
ensuring their loyalty

356
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,288
and their army, should we need it.

357
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,959
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?

358
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,005
But remember, the Queen mustn't know.

359
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,091
Ooh.

360
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,093
"The Queen mustn't know."

361
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,430
I love conversations that begin this way.

362
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,975
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off

363
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,685
to Theon Greyjoy.

364
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,855
Theon Greyjoy?

365
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,400
Forgive me, my lord, but how?

366
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,027
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.

367
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,947
- He fights for Robb Stark.
- Precisely.

368
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,994
Theon's father loathes the Starks
and will convince the boy to come to our side.

369
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,581
Greyjoy can destroy
the Northern army from within

370
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,041
and we can have his father's ships.

371
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,878
But remember, you must tell no one.

372
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,131
Tell no one what?

373
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:33,968
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella
to Robin Arryn of the Vale.

374
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,514
Lysa is not fond of me.

375
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:44,562
But perhaps the promise of a royal match
will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

376
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,900
She imprisoned you.
She tried to execute you.

377
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,402
And you offer her son a princess?

378
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,740
For men in our position,
holding grudges can be

379
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,533
an encumbrance, don't you think?

380
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,788
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

381
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,331
Who better?

382
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:11,714
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa,
if I cared to.

383
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,425
What's in it for me?

384
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:20,473
The gratitude of the people of Westeros
for helping to end this war,

385
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,811
the adoration of the King
for bringing the Vale back into the fold...

386
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:27,814
and Harrenhal.

387
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,066
Harrenhal is cursed.

388
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,735
Never took you for a superstitious man.

389
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,489
By all means, tear it down and rebuild.
You'll be able to afford it.

390
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,408
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

391
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,121
With a single stroke, you'd make me
one of the greatest lords in the realm.

392
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,333
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

393
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,461
So did Janos Slynt,
and he was given Harrenhal, too.

394
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,588
Until you snatched it away.

395
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,758
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.

396
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,885
I didn't need Janos Slynt.

397
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,682
It's settled, then?

398
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,102
Good.

399
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,147
Oh. And remember...

400
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,233
The Queen mustn't know.

401
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,122
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

402
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,899
That must hurt.

403
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,817
(GROANS)

404
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,744
What?

405
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,331
What is it?

406
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,124
(SCOFFS)

407
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,335
A member of the Kingsguard?

408
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,172
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

409
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:17,840
(SIGHS)

410
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,928
Brienne is a very capable warrior.

411
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,848
And she's devoted to me.

412
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,226
You're jealous.

413
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,355
Jealous?

414
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,398
Of Brienne the Beauty?

415
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,859
Don't make me laugh.

416
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,739
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.

417
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,033
Not tonight.

418
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,204
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

419
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:52,333
You didn't win my father's support
or his army on charm alone.

420
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:09,058
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

421
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,269
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

422
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,313
(SCOFFS) And Margaery's a virgin?

423
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,315
Officially.

424
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,986
Shall I bring her to you?

425
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,641
I should warn you,
I've had quite a bit of wine.

426
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,935
As is your right. You are a king.

427
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,356
You look very beautiful.

428
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,191
Thank you, Your Grace.

429
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,528
- It's a lovely gown.
- You think so?

430
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,823
I can't decide how I like it better.

431
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,158
This way,

432
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,619
or this way.

433
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,794
You certainly don't need it.

434
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:25,342
Although, some say the beauty most desired

435
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,386
is the beauty concealed.

436
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,197
Must be the wine.

437
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,115
Here, let me.

438
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,091
(SHUDDERS)

439
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,595
I'm sorry.

440
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,557
Do you want my brother to come in and help?

441
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,229
- What?
- He could get you started.

442
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,563
I know he wouldn't mind.

443
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,108
Or I can turn over
and you can pretend I'm him.

444
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,779
I don't know what you're talking about.

445
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,995
There's no need for us to play games.

446
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:38,624
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

447
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:02,148
Your enemies aren't happy about us.
They want to tear us apart.

448
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,483
And the best way to stop them

449
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,278
is to put your baby

450
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,072
in my belly.

451
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,786
We can try again later.

452
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:20,082
You decide how you want to do it,
with me, with me and Loras,

453
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,042
however else you like.

454
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,381
Whatever you need to do.

455
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,052
You are a king.

456
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,105
CERSEI: You monster.

457
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,025
Myrcella is my only daughter.

458
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,736
Do you really think
I'll let you sell her like a common whore?

459
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,947
Myrcella's a princess.
Some would say she was born for this.

460
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:55,784
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne
as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

461
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,037
Dorne is the safest place for her.

462
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,123
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.

463
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,001
That's why we need to seduce them.

464
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,588
We're going to need their support in the war
your son started.

465
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,965
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

466
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:13,135
You won't get away with this.

467
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,472
You think the piece of paper Father gave you
keeps you safe.

468
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,518
Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.

469
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,357
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

470
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,860
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

471
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:36,367
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is
if this city falls?

472
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,371
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

473
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,122
Make no mistake.

474
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,833
They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike
right beside yours.

475
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,835
Get out! Get out!

476
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,151
Theon of the House Greyjoy,

477
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:55,321
you would this day
consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?

478
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,123
- I would.
- Kneel.

479
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,003
Let Theon, your servant,

480
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,839
be born again from the sea as you were.

481
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,633
Bless him with salt.

482
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,347
Bless him with stone.

483
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,807
Bless him with steel.

484
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,273
What is dead may never die.

485
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,442
What is dead may never die.

486
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,238
But rises again harder and stronger.

487
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,741

00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:01,403
MAN: Come on, move, move!

651
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,196
(HORSE WHINNIES)

652
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,739
Gold cloaks!

653
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:08,910
(SHOUTING)

654
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,997
Everyone out!

655
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,790
(SHOUTING)

656
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:20,088
Hey, you! Open the damn cage!

657
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,468
Where's the bastard, crow?

658
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:28,013
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

659
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:31,182
Ser Amory Lorch,
sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.

660
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:34,644
These men from the capital
requested our assistance.

661
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,439
Drop your weapons in the name of the King.

662
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,357
Now, which king would that be?

663
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:41,443
This is your last chance.

664
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:46,239
In the name of King Joffrey,
drop your weapons.

665
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,578
I don't think I will.

666
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,288
So be it.

667
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:54,956
(GRUNTS)

668
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:00,128
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.

669
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,272
(GROANS)

670
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,197
(GURGLES)

671
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,376
JAQEN: Boy, come here. Boy!

672
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,880
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!

673
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,090
Help us, boy!

674
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:47,509
(SHOUTING)

675
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,554
A man can fight! Free us!

676
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,522
Quick, give it to me.

677
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,525
Give me the ax. Give me that.

678
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:14,953
MAN: Put them on the wagon!

679
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,330
There's more here. Come on.

680
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,498
(GRUNTS)

681
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,874
(PANTING)

682
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,376
(CHUCKLES)

683
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:24,671
What do we have here?

684
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:27,674
No!

685
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:30,385
That's a fine little blade.

686
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,638
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

687
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,390
I yield! I yield!

688
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,684
AMORY: Round up any survivors.

689
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,894
We'll take them back to Harrenhal.

690
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,605
You heard him. You're coming with us.

691
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,024
I yield!

692
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,070
(WHIMPERING)

693
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,781
Help!

694
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:53,283
Help me!

695
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,247
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

696
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,082
Look at it.

697
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,675
Can you walk?

698
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,969
No. You got to carry me.

699
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:15,847
All right.

700
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,190
(COUGHING)

701
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:32,322
"Carry him," he says. (LAUGHS)

702
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,625
We're looking for a bastard named Gendry.

703
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:45,919
Give him up

704
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:48,713
or I'll start taking eyeballs.

705
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:02,810
You want Gendry?

706
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:08,650
You already got him.

707
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:14,697
He loved that helmet.
