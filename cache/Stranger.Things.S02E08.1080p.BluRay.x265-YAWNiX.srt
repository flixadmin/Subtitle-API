1
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:33,697
Mother of God.

2
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,464
It's... it's polycarbonate.
It can't get through.

3
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,224
Mother Mary and Joseph.

4
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,900
You sure about that glass?

5
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,443
What the hell?

6
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,529
- We're too late.
- What?

7
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,783
We're too late!

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,286
What's going on?

9
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,617
We're under attack.

10
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,124
What's going on down there?
Does anybody copy?

11
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,080
Hurry!

12
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,720
Stairs! Stairs!

13
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,152
We need to make Will sleep.

14
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,575
- What?
- He's a spy. If he knows where we are,

15
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,341
- so does the shadow monster.
- He's lying!

16
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,200
He killed those soldiers.
He'll kill us, too!

17
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,580
He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!
He's lying! He's lying!

18
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,002
Shit!

19
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,462
Those are gunshots!

20
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,263
He's lying! He's lying!

21
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,843
Okay, Will, Will, listen, listen.
Do you know who I am?

22
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,645
Do you know who I am?

23
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,892
You're...

24
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,726
You're... You're Mom.

25
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,448
Hold him down.

26
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,492
No! No! Let go! No! No! Let me go! Let go!

27
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,194
- No, let me go!
- I'm sorry.

28
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,531
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Let me go! Let go! Let me go!

29
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,993
No! Let go! Let me go! Let me go!

30
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,057
We gotta go. We gotta go.

31
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,818
Come on!

32
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,531
Oh, my God.

33
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,795
Oh, my God.

34
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,644
Hey, guys, we're home.

35
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,781
Guys?

36
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,697
Hello?

37
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,784
Max?

38
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,068
Billy?

39
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,495
Yeah, I'm a little bit busy in here,
Susan.

40
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,120
Open the door. Right now.

41
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,254
What's wrong?

42
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,344
Why don't you tell us?

43
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,045
Because I don't know.

44
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,176
- We can't find Maxine.
- And her window's open.

45
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,176
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

46
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,931
You don't know?

47
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,390
Look, I'm sure she just, I don't know,
went to the arcade or something.

48
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,769
I'm sure she's fine.

49
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,647
You were supposed to watch her.

50
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,524
I know, Dad. I was.

51
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:50,405
It's just you guys were three hours late,
and, well, I have a date.

52
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,493
I'm sorry, okay?

53
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,787
That's why you've been
staring at yourself in the mirror

54
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,793
like some faggot
instead of watching your sister?

55
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,993
I have been looking after her
all week, Dad. Okay?

56
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,328
She wants to run off,
then that's her problem, all right?

57
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,340
She's 13 years old.
She shouldn't need a full-time babysitter.

58
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,588
And she's not my sister!

59
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,387
What did we talk about?

60
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,401
What did we... talk about?

61
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,524
Respect and responsibility.

62
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,071
That is right.

63
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,316
Now, apologize to Susan.

64
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,786
I'm sorry, Susan.

65
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,037
It's okay, Neil, really...

66
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,121
No, it's not okay.
Nothing about his behavior is okay.

67
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,545
But he's gonna make up for it.

68
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,884
He's gonna call whatever whore
he's seeing tonight

69
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,306
and cancel their date.

70
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,473
And then he's gonna go find his sister.

71
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:05,313
Like the good, kind, respecting brother
that he is.

72
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,810
Isn't that right, Billy?

73
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,730
Isn't that right?

74
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,653
Yes, sir.

75
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,949
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

76
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,370
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,456
Find Max.

78
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,536
You're positive that was Dart?

79
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,343
Yes. He had the same exact
yellow pattern on his butt.

80
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,896
- He was tiny two days ago.
- Well, he's molted three times already.

81
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,894
- Malted?
- Molted.

82
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,192
Shed his skin to make room for growth
like hornworms.

83
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,378
- When's he gonna molt again?
- It's gotta be soon.

84
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,111
When he does, he'll be fully grown,
or close to it.

85
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,236
And so will his friends.

86
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,326
Yeah, and he's gonna eat a lot more
than just cats.

87
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,412
Wait, a cat?

88
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,913
- Dart ate a cat?
- No, what? No.

89
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,662
What are you talking about?
He ate Mews.

90
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,744
Mews? Who's Mews?

91
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,998
- It's Dustin's cat.
- Steve!

92
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,420
I knew it! You kept him!

93
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,506
No!

94
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,086
No.

95
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,879
No, I... No, I...

96
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,510
He missed me. He wanted to come home.

97
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,884
- Bullshit!
- I didn't know he was a Demogorgon, okay?

98
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,432
- Oh, so now you admit it?
- Guys, who cares? We have to go.

99
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,137
I care! You put the party in jeopardy!
You broke the rule of law!

100
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,096
- So did you!
- What?

101
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,602
You told a stranger the truth!

102
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,149
A stranger?

103
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,521
You wanted to tell her, too!

104
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,757
But I didn't, Lucas, okay?

105
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,397
I didn't tell her!

106
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,575
We both broke the rule of law, okay?
So we're even. We're even.

107
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,073
No, no! We're not even.
Don't even try that.

108
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,576
Your stupid pet
could have ate us for dinner!

109
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,265
- That was not my fault!
- Guys?

110
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,292
He wasn't gonna eat us.

111
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,979
He was crawling
to come say hello?

112
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,289
Guys!

113
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,595
No, no, no. Hey, guys,
why are you headed towards the sound?

114
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,796
Hello?

115
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,927
Hello?

116
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,570
I don't see him.

117
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,167
It's the lab.

118
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,002
They were going back home.

119
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,300
Look, this is us,
and this is the nearest exit.

120
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,977
But even if we somehow make it there,
there's no way out.

121
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,146
- What do you mean?
- The locks are fail secure.

122
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,232
Fail secure?

123
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,608
If there's a power outage,
the building goes on lockdown.

124
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,060
Can it be unlocked remotely?

125
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,646
With a computer, sure,
but somebody's gotta reset the breakers.

126
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,979
- Where are the breakers?
- Breakers are in the basement,

127
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,194
three floors down.

128
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,825
Hey, where are you going?

129
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,277
To reset the breakers.

130
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,452
Okay, then what?

131
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,077
- Then we get out of here.
- No, then the power comes back on.

132
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,126
If you wanna unlock the doors,
you have to reboot the computer system,

133
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,794
and then override the security codes
with a manual input.

134
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,248
Fine, how do I do that?

135
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,924
You can't. Not unless you know BASIC.

136
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,377
I don't know what that means.

137
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,712
- It's a computer programming language.
- Teach it to me.

138
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,014
Shall I teach you French
while I'm at it, Jim?

139
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,181
How about a little German?

140
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,302
How about you, Doc? You speak BASIC?

141
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,849
No.

142
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,807
Okay, I got this.

143
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,277
I got this.

144
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,694
No. Bob.

145
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,696
It's okay.

146
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,664
It's gonna be okay.
Remember, Bob Newby, superhero.

147
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,759
Okay, grab his walkie.

148
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,469
All right, you know
how to use one of these?

149
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,475
No.

150
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:19,021
Safety on. Safety off. Point. Squeeze.

151
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,739
Point and squeeze. Okay. Easy-peasy.

152
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,819
If anything happens down there,
I want you to come right back up.

153
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,495
Right back here. Listen.

154
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,875
Don't wait for me.
As soon as I get those doors open...

155
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,827
- I'm gonna get them out.
- Yeah?

156
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,253
I promise.

157
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,415
Okay, well... I'll be in touch.

158
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,263
Why are the lights off?

159
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,190
Maybe it's closed?

160
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,858
Security took the night off?

161
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,480
I don't think so.

162
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,910
It's not working?

163
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,827
No! The power's off.

164
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,288
- Jonathan?
- What?

165
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,294
I think there's something in the woods.

166
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,337
Nancy, stay back.

167
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,713
Hello?

168
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,011
Who's there?

169
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,929
Who's there?

170
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,852
Steve?

171
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,520
- Nancy?
- Jonathan.

172
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,472
What are you doing here?

173
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,567
What are you doing here?

174
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,475
We're looking for Mike and Will.

175
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,187
- They're not in there, are they?
- We're not sure.

176
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,281
Why?

177
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,735
Keep it together, Bob.

178
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,282
Oh, God.

179
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,521
Okay, here we go.

180
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,695
He made it.

181
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,076
- We haven't seen Will...
- I haven't seen him since...

182
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,876
The power's back.

183
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,930
- Let me try.
- Hang on...

184
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,303
Let me try, Jonathan!

185
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,393
Son of a bitch! You know what...

186
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,768
Okay, Bob, can you hear us?

187
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,354
Loud and clear, Doc.
Can you hear me back?

188
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,564
<i>We hear you.</i>

189
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,444
All right, give me a minute.

190
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,416
Open sesame.

191
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,587
It's open.

192
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,086
Okay.

193
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,557
Hey! I got it!

194
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,269
I got it!

195
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,688
Easy-peasy.

196
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,890
Son of a bitch did it.

197
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,225
Right, I'll meet you outside.

198
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,019
Nice job.

199
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,446
- Hold on a second, Chief.
- What's wrong?

200
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,569
West stairwell's not clear anymore.

201
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,695
- What's going on?
- We've got some company.

202
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,075
- Where?
- The west stairwell.

203
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,452
I got an idea.

204
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,458
What the hell's he doing?

205
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,837
Okay. And splash.

206
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,097
Okay. Okay, that worked.

207
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,519
Now, get out of there.

208
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,096
<i>Go! Go!</i>

209
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,936
Wait a second, Chief?

210
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,237
- What?
- Take this.

211
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,653
- What are you doing?
- Any more surprises, I'll let you know.

212
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,531
Go. Go!

213
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,965
Come on, Bob. Come on.

214
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,975
<i>Hey, Bob?</i>

215
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,896
Yeah?

216
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,439
- I'm gonna guide you, okay?
- Is there a problem?

217
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,518
No, it's just... It's, uh, getting
a little crowded up here,

218
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,227
so we're gonna have to take this slow.

219
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,146
Okay.

220
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,947
All right, just start walking.

221
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,576
<i>Okay, good.</i>

222
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,874
<i>Okay, now, your next right.</i>

223
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,882
Now, keep going, keep going, keep going...

224
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,474
Stop!

225
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,603
What?

226
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,606
<i>What?</i>

227
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,807
Bob, there's a door on your left,
do you see that?

228
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:33,862
Yeah?

229
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,692
- That's a closet.
- Okay?

230
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,149
<i>- Yeah, I need you to get in it.</i>
- What?

231
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,907
Now! Right now. Get in the closet.

232
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,196
Jesus Christ.

233
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:23,912
Okay.

234
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,488
<i>How you holding up there, Bob?
You all right?</i>

235
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,412
Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,333
<i>You got a pretty clear shot
to the front door.</i>

237
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,876
Okay.

238
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,457
<i>You can do this, okay?</i>

239
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,302
You're almost home free, all right, Bob?

240
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,837
Run!

241
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:37,900
Bob!

242
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,523
Bob.

243
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,632
No!

244
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,764
No!

245
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,158
Go!

246
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,362
No!

247
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,788
Go!

248
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,115
Bob!

249
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,119
Bob!

250
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,796
No!

251
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,874
- What happened?
- No!

252
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,084
No!

253
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,171
He's gone! He's gone!

254
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,182
Come on! Get in!

255
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,029
Guys?

256
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,873
Let's go.

257
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,042
Come on!

258
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,252
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

259
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,419
I'm sorry, bud.

260
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,174
Sorry I wasn't there.
I should have been here.

261
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,753
- Sam Owens. Dr. Sam Owens.
<i>- How many people at the lab?</i>

262
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,588
I don't know how many people are there!

263
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,719
I don't know how many people
are left alive!

264
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,644
<i>- Have you contacted the police?</i>
- I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper!

265
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,517
<i>Is there a number I can reach you at?</i>

266
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,564
Yes, the number that I gave you, yes.

267
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,186
<i>- Okay, yes, I got it.</i>
- 6767...

268
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,894
- I will be here.
<i>- I'll have them contact you.</i>

269
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,815
They didn't believe you, did they?

270
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,442
We'll see.

271
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:36,200
"We'll see"? We can't just sit here
while those things are loose!

272
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,782
We stay here, and we wait for help.

273
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:40,806
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

274
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,464
Did you guys know that Bob was
the original founder of Hawkins AV?

275
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,722
Really?

276
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,715
He petitioned the school
to start it and everything.

277
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,596
Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment.

278
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,263
Mr. Clarke learned everything from him.

279
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,730
Pretty awesome, right?

280
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:27,898
Yeah.

281
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,688
We can't let him die in vain.

282
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,113
What do you want to do, Mike?

283
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,406
The Chief's right on this.

284
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,324
We can't stop those Demo-dogs on our own.

285
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,447
Demo-dogs?

286
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,452
Demogorgon dogs.

287
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:44,917
Demo-dogs.

288
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,288
It's like a compound.

289
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,119
It's like a play on words...

290
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,213
Okay.

291
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,502
- I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...
- But there's an army now.

292
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,507
- Precisely.
- His army.

293
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,306
What do you mean?

294
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,807
His army.

295
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,806
Maybe if we stop him,
we can stop his army, too.

296
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,129
- The shadow monster.
- It got Will that day on the field.

297
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,233
The doctor said it was like a virus,
it infected him.

298
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,068
And so this virus,
it's connecting him to the tunnels?

299
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,261
To the tunnels, monsters,
the Upside Down, everything.

300
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,151
Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.

301
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,362
Okay, so,
the shadow monster's inside everything.

302
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,290
And if the vines feel something like pain,
then so does Will.

303
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,833
- And so does Dart.
- Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us.

304
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,582
- The hive mind.
- Hive mind?

305
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,004
A collective consciousness.
It's a super-organism.

306
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,834
And this is the thing that
controls everything. It's the brain.

307
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,543
Like the mind flayer.

308
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,509
- The what?
- What?

309
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,724
The mind flayer.

310
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,018
What the hell is that?

311
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,744
It's a monster from an unknown dimension.

312
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,431
It's so ancient
that it doesn't even know its true home.

313
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,733
Okay, it enslaves races
of other dimensions

314
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,687
by taking over their brains using
its highly-developed psionic powers.

315
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,773
Oh, my God, none of this is real.
This is a kids' game.

316
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,279
No, it's a manual. And it's not for kids.

317
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,702
And unless you know something
that we don't,

318
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,074
this is the best metaphor...

319
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,245
Analogy.

320
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,540
Analogy? That's what you're worried about?

321
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,869
Fine. An analogy for understanding
whatever the hell this is.

322
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,000
Okay, so this mind flamer thing...

323
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,706
Flayer. Mind flayer.

324
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,881
What does it want?

325
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,334
To conquer us, basically.

326
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,168
It believes it's the master race.

327
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,595
Like the Germans?

328
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,422
Uh, the Nazis?

329
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,926
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.
- Uh...

330
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,386
If the Nazis were
from another dimension, totally.

331
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,692
Uh, it views other races, like us,
as inferior to itself.

332
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,643
It wants to spread,
take over other dimensions.

333
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,980
We are talking about the destruction
of our world as we know it.

334
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,612
That's great. That's great.
That's really great. Jesus!

335
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:47,573
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain
that's controlling everything,

336
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,373
then if we kill it...

337
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,075
We kill everything it controls.

338
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,253
- We win.
- Theoretically.

339
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,298
Great. So how do you kill this thing?
Shoot it with Fireballs or something?

340
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,173
No. No, no Fire... No Fireballs.

341
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,549
Uh, you summon an undead army,
uh, because...

342
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,802
...because zombies,
you know, they don't have brains,

343
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:08,511
and the mind flayer, it... it...
It likes brains.

344
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,207
- It's just a game. It's a game.
- What the hell are we doing here?

345
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,848
I thought we were waiting
for your military backup.

346
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,149
We are!

347
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,601
How are they gonna stop this?

348
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,135
You can't just shoot this with guns.

349
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,234
You don't know that!
We don't know anything!

350
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,486
We know it's already killed
everybody in that lab.

351
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,283
We know the monsters are gonna molt again.

352
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,783
We know that it's only a matter of time
before those tunnels reach this town.

353
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,739
They're right.

354
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,992
We have to kill it.

355
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,671
I want to kill it.

356
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,588
- Me, too.
- I...

357
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,131
Me, too, Joyce, okay?

358
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,299
But how do we do that?

359
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,672
We don't exactly know
what we're dealing with here.

360
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,675
No. But he does.

361
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,468
If anyone knows
how to destroy this thing, it's Will.

362
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,304
He's connected to it.
He'll know its weakness.

363
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,309
I thought
we couldn't trust him anymore.

364
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,892
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.

365
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,775
Yeah, but he can't spy
if he doesn't know where he is.

366
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,621
Yeah, this'll work.

367
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,354
Hey.

368
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,523
What you did, um, helping the kids...

369
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,395
that was... really cool.

370
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,990
Yeah.

371
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,571
Those little shits are real trouble,
you know?

372
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,115
Believe me, I know.

373
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,002
Hey.

374
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,759
I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all.

375
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,968
I guess I just thought
that he was my friend.

376
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,098
I was wrong.

377
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,056
I broke the rule of law,

378
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,941
so if you want your girlfriend to take
over my spot in the party, I understand.

379
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,067
She's not my girlfriend.

380
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,365
I saw you two
holding hands in the bus, Lucas.

381
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,283
She was just scared.

382
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,076
Maybe, but I could feel it.

383
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,370
Feel what?

384
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,122
The electricity.

385
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,516
I get why El was your mage now.

386
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:54,975
What?

387
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:58,100
Lucas. He told me all about her.

388
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,190
Well, he shouldn't have.

389
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,489
And just because you know the truth,
it doesn't mean you're in our party.

390
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,735
You do know that, right?

391
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,028
Yeah, I know.

392
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:12,361
I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer
in your party anyway?

393
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,034
I'm just saying, El?

394
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,579
She sounds like she was really awesome.

395
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,001
Yeah, she was.

396
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,380
Until that thing took her.

397
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,916
Just like it took Bob.

398
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,387
You sure this is gonna work?

399
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,218
He knew who I was.

400
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,020
He's still in there.

401
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,681
It's gonna work.

402
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,232
It has to.

403
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,284
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,326
If he finds out where we are...

405
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,579
will he send those dogs after us?

406
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,828
He won't find out.

407
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,792
Yeah, but, if he does...

408
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,960
Judgment day.

409
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,809
What? What? What is this?

410
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,072
What? What is this?

411
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,317
Why am I tied up?

412
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,987
Will, we just wanna talk to you.

413
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,367
We're not gonna hurt you.

414
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,573
Where am I?

415
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,666
You recognize this?

416
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,665
Do you recognize this?

417
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,462
Hey.

418
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,290
We wanna help you.

419
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,876
But to do that,
we have to understand how to kill it.

420
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,461
Why am I tied up?

421
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,512
Why am I tied up?

422
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,056
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

423
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,053
Hey.

424
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,351
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

425
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:29,023
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

426
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,190
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

427
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:42,530
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

428
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,161
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

429
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,833
Let me go...

430
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,956
Go...

431
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,544
Go...

432
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,937
Do you know what March 22nd is?

433
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,271
It's your birthday.

434
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,436
Your birthday.

435
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:24,078
When you turned eight,
I gave you that huge box of crayons.

436
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,700
Do you remember that?

437
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,157
It was 120 colors.

438
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,964
And all your friends,
they got you <i>Star Wars</i> toys,

439
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:40,761
but all you wanted to do was draw
with all your new colors.

440
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:47,552
And you drew this big spaceship,
but it wasn't from a movie.

441
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,683
It was your spaceship.

442
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,516
A rainbow ship is what you called it.

443
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:58,238
And you must have used
every color in the box.

444
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,865
I took that with me to Melvald's

445
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:10,746
and I put it up
and I told everyone who came in,

446
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,077
"My son drew this."

447
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,630
And you were so embarrassed.

448
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,795
But I was so proud.

449
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,844
I was so, so proud.

450
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,847
Do you remember the day Dad left?

451
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,318
We stayed up all night
building Castle Byers...

452
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,696
just the way you drew it.

453
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:49,702
And it took so long
because you were so bad at hammering.

454
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,667
You'd miss the nail every time.

455
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:59,962
And then it started raining,
but we stayed out there anyway.

456
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,590
We were both sick
for like a week after that.

457
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,423
But we just had to finish it, didn't we?

458
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,513
We just had to.

459
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,512
Do you remember
the first day that we met?

460
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,272
It was... It was
the first day of kindergarten.

461
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,856
I knew nobody.

462
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,156
I had no friends and...

463
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:31,949
I just felt so alone
and so scared, but...

464
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,713
I saw you on the swings
and you were alone, too.

465
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,540
You were just swinging by yourself.

466
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,216
And I just walked up to you and...

467
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,430
I asked.

468
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,718
I asked if you wanted to be my friend.

469
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,888
And you said yes.

470
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,977
You said yes.

471
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,063
It was the best thing I've ever done.

472
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,780
Will, baby...

473
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,000
if you're in there, just please...
please talk to us.

474
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,879
Please, honey, please,
can you do that for me?

475
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,678
Please. I love you so much.

476
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,477
Let me go.

477
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,532
What happened?

478
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:01,337
I think he's talking,
just not with words.

479
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,215
What is that?

480
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,166
Morse code.

481
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,048
H-E-R-E.

482
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,137
Here.

483
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,592
Will's still in there. He's talking to us.

484
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,777
Do you remember
the first time I played you this?

485
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,454
Mom and Dad were both arguing
in the next room.

486
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,140
So I played you the mix tape I made you.

487
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,543
And it was the first time
you got into music. Real music.

488
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,340
Dash, dot, dash, dot.

489
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,508
- Yeah, got it.
- C.

490
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,508
And then the party
escaped into the sewers,

491
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,888
and there were those big insect things,
and you guys were still on level one.

492
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,975
L.

493
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,024
O.

494
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,604
Then you cast Fog Cloud and you saved us.

495
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,401
You saved the whole party.

496
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,774
S.

497
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,653
You saw that little girl
and she was in the sandbox

498
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,824
and she was crying.

499
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,277
E.

500
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,827
You gave him your Tonka Truck

501
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,122
and I told you
we couldn't afford to buy another one.

502
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,744
G.

503
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,701
You said she should have it
because she's sad.

504
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,911
"She's sad, Mommy."

505
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,496
A.

506
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,377
- I love you so much.
- T.

507
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,504
So, so much.

508
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,005
E.

509
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,930
"Close gate."

510
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,387
Shit. Shit.

511
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,481
Do you think he heard that?

512
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,410
It's just a phone. It could be anywhere.
Right?

513
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,413
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

514
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,053
It knows. It knows where we are.

515
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,307
Oh, shit.

516
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,904
That's not good.

517
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,952
- They're coming!
- What?

518
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,100
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Come on.

519
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,081
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

520
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,126
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go.

521
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,222
Hey. Hey, get away from the windows!

522
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,522
- Do you know how to use this?
- What?

523
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,399
Can you use this?

524
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,980
I can.

525
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,043
Where are they?

526
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,766
What are they doing?

527
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,225
Holy shit.

528
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,188
Is it dead?

529
00:43:28,212 --> 00:43:36,212
