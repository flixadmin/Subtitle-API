1
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,954
Good morning, sir!

2
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,097
Dicky chow!

3
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,981
Just look at yourself.
You're covered in dirt.

4
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,358
- I just...
- Don't move!

5
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,111
And don't give me the usual routine.

6
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,030
Why are you always so untidy?

7
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,774
What's the matter, Mr. cao?

8
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,952
Explain yourself!

9
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,194
I et me talk to him.

10
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,200
Where did the dirt come from, dicky?

11
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,545
Well, on my way to school,
I slipped and fell over.

12
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,631
Don't your mom or dad
bring you to school?

13
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,877
Mom died a long time ago
and dad's very busy.

14
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,379
What does your dad do?

15
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,888
He's a coolie.

16
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,066
I'd like to meet him one day.
Would that be possible?

17
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,561
I don't think he has the time.

18
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,149
When he's available, then.
Will you let me know?

19
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,409
Go clean up before class starts.

20
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,410
Thanks, miss yuen.

21
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,248
I want to be a superstar.

22
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,038
Like who? Nicole Kidman.

23
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,421
She gets $20 million for a movie.

24
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,677
I wouldn't mind being her either.

25
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,217
I want to be an entrepreneur.

26
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,760
What kind of business?

27
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,268
Any kind, as long as it's really big.

28
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,724
Big business always pays out.

29
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,098
Why not?

30
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,359
I want to be a poor person.

31
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,623
Stop!

32
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,294
My dad says
if you have integrity...

33
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,627
Don't lie, don't fight,
and study really hard...

34
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,964
Then people will respect you
even if you're poor.

35
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,477
Don't

36
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,734
don't come over here!

37
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,235
Put it down!

38
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,826
Go back to your seat!

39
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:40,754
The name of this amazing dog is cj1.

40
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,918
It was developed jointly by U.S.,
French and German scientists.

41
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,678
Imagine! Jointly developed!

42
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,556
- Do you want a go?
- Yes, please.

43
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,591
Back off, loser!

44
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,230
There are only two in the world.

45
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,609
The U.S. president's daughter
has the other one.

46
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,691
- What are you doing?
- Eating noodles.

47
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,357
Stand up!

48
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:13,704
No matter how much you eat,
you are doomed to be a dwarf.

49
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,535
Now get lost!

50
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:20,419
The quality of the students
in this place gets worse every day.

51
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,798
What have we here, another alien?

52
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,793
- What are you doing?
- Eating rice.

53
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,134
You're just like a huge tub of lard.

54
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,640
Maybe you should
go see the doctor.

55
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,428
You eat so much. It's horrible!

56
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,975
Someone call the police
to shoot this monster!

57
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,985
Fat to death! Giant monster!

58
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,235
What are you doing?

59
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,368
Bullies! Heroes don't hit women.

60
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,373
Not you again!

61
00:06:59,377 --> 00:06:59,957
Not you again!

62
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,538
Ignore him.

63
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,835
Go away, poor boy.
We don't want you around.

64
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,208
Go away, poor boy.

65
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,191
Hi

66
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,693
Hi

67
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,860
You've been sent off the field too?”

68
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,941
Yes

69
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,657
did you forget your sneakers?

70
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,453
I brought them,
but I didn't wear them on purpose.

71
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,867
Why?

72
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,998
Because I wanted to be with you.

73
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,468
Are all your shoes like that?

74
00:07:55,684 --> 00:08:00,474
Yes, they are.
My dad gets them from the dump.

75
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,645
Your dad's so nice.

76
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,226
He is, actually.

77
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,727
But I so much want a new pair...

78
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,066
Because I really love sports.

79
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,441
I'd like you to keep the old ones.

80
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,859
Why?

81
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,204
Then we'd be punished together,
forever.

82
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,892
Get that panel up there.

83
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,219
Quickly!

84
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,096
You. Hurry up.

85
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,238
You're no longer needed. Go home.

86
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,240
Hey, boss?

87
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,961
With it being so hot right now,
my son can't sleep.

88
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,917
I need to buy an electric fan.

89
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,422
Can't you keep me on?

90
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,630
You should be
paying me back instead.

91
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,513
I paid all the bills
when your wife got sick and died.

92
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,345
Look at yourself.
You'll die before your debts are repaid.

93
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,511
You're starving yourself so your son
can go to that fancy school.

94
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,307
If my son can go to public school,
why can't yours?

95
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,477
Well, I want him
to have opportunities.

96
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,485
I don't want him to end up like me.

97
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,817
But you have to have capability.

98
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,357
He's highly capable.

99
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,991
I'm talking about you, not him.

100
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,821
All you have is a casual job
with no prospects.

101
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,330
How are you going to cope?

102
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,995
- I can manage.
- You can't manage!

103
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,295
I can. You can't!

104
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,714
I can manage.

105
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,385
Very well. Block b. Foundations.

106
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,012
Thanks.

107
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,341
If you want to die, I can't stop you.
Shame on you.

108
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,945
You're back.

109
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,902
Can we have dinner? I'm starving.

110
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,361
Just step back a bit.

111
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,872
What's going on? Turn round.

112
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,426
Come here.

113
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,591
What?

114
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,721
An electric fan!

115
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,305
That's so great! Is it real?

116
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,218
We finally have a fan!

117
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,264
- Now sit down and let me turn it.
- Quickly, dad!

118
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,155
Dad, did you find this
in the garbage?

119
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,066
No, I bought it.

120
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,117
It cost a lot of money.

121
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,619
You were ripped off!

122
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,747
No, it was fine when I bought it.

123
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,284
So how come it's not working now?

124
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,670
Dumbass.
Use your head next time.

125
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,831
"Dumbass"?
Where did you get that from?

126
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,294
A guy in my class.

127
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,425
Oh, really? Well, let me tell you...

128
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,095
We may be poor,
but we don't use bad language.

129
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,007
We don't steal we don't Rob.

130
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,473
We don't take things
that don't belong to us.

131
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,522
You must concentrate
on your studies.

132
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:21,025
I didn't study at all when I was young
and look where it's gotten me.

133
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,180
We're having an apple today?

134
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,557
Yes, we are.

135
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,184
But put it down now.

136
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,847
Finish your dinner first.

137
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,650
Hey, dad, my sneakers
are worn out again.

138
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,061
Will you buy me some more?

139
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,356
I need you to get me a better pair,
or I'll be sent off the field again.

140
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,358
Got it. Don't worry.

141
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,576
You're still eating!
Lay off the cockroach.

142
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,371
You can get it after you've finished.

143
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,585
Nice. You've improved.

144
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,671
Not bad.

145
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,122
There have been many sightings lately
of ufos, unidentified flying objects.

146
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,340
What happened to the cartoons?

147
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,797
They'll be back in a minute.

148
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,471
Could you please tell us
what happened?

149
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,178
I saw a flying object.

150
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,469
It flew from here to there
with a "whew" sound.

151
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,662
Can you describe the object
in more detail?

152
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,432
That object could really fly!

153
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,476
Though it wobbled a bit.

154
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,111
I suspect it had crashed before.

155
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,281
Crashed?

156
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,156
Yes, like a car crash.
It might have been broken.

157
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,192
I took a picture of ft.

158
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,127
What kind of camera did you use?

159
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,210
It was expensive,
but I can't possibly tell you the make.

160
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,875
Did this particular flying object
make a sound?

161
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,967
It made some "whew" sounds like I just
told you. "Whew." Do you hear me?

162
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,008
Unbelievable.

163
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,576
Don't run off like that.

164
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,742
Dad, this is called a cj1.

165
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,245
Everyone at school has one.
They're great!

166
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,423
Really?

167
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,749
Let's go home. Put it back.

168
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,226
What's the matter?

169
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,349
Why can't I have it?

170
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,609
We'll buy it
after I get paid next month.

171
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,939
Now, put it down.

172
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,075
Let go!

173
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,753
Didn't you hear me?
I have no money.

174
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:53,926
If you buy me this,
I'll never ask for anything ever again.

175
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,586
I beg you.

176
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,641
What about this one?
What features does it have?

177
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,600
Let go.

178
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,604
Let go!

179
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,822
Let go!

180
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,652
Let go!

181
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,614
Come back!

182
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,617
Sir? Do you wish to buy that?”

183
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,177
Come on, dicky. Don't cry.

184
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,311
Stop crying now.

185
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,972
Good boy, stop crying.

186
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,356
Dicky.

187
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,518
Are you Mr. chow?

188
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,358
I'm miss yuen, dicky's teacher.
Good to meet you.

189
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,989
Miss yuen. Good to meet you too.

190
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,658
Is dicky well-behaved at school?

191
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,945
Yes, he's quite good.

192
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,162
He's in a really bad mood right now.

193
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,949
I know.
Kids just want every toy they see.

194
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,128
True.

195
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,164
Just happens I didn't bring
any money today, so...

196
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,627
Dicky, go to your dad.

197
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,171
Come here.

198
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,379
- I'm sorry, Mr. chow.
- Don't worry. He's like that.

199
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,470
In fact, I'd like to do a home visit.

200
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,511
He did tell me,
but I'm very busy at work...

201
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,897
I believe that a good education
doesn't just rely on the teacher.

202
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,399
That's why I'd like to involve you.

203
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,185
It'll be good for him.

204
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,194
Ah, yes. I see.

205
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,568
Dicky, I need to go now.

206
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,741
Don't be so grumpy.
And listen to your dad, okay?

207
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,163
Okay?

208
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,079
- I must go.
- Okay.

209
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,869
- Bye, now.
- Bye, now.

210
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,201
Dicky.

211
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,907
I ook at me.

212
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,751
I have something
way better than cj1.

213
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,377
Do you want to see it?

214
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,383
Are you sure?

215
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:54,386
In that case, I'll throw it away
and get back to work.

216
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,101
Goodbye, sir.

217
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,391
Goodbye.

218
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,644
Fanny.

219
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:48,440
Where's this amazing toy, then?

220
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,948
I ook!

221
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,323
What's so great about that?

222
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,787
It's fun. Look!

223
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:04,126
It doesn't look that fun to me.

224
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,456
What do you think?

225
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,505
Actually, I agree. It's no fun.

226
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:13,010
Never mind. See you tomorrow.

227
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,852
What's that thing you're holding?

228
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,433
Nothing.

229
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,848
It looks like rubbish.

230
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,354
Says who?

231
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,987
This is way better than cj1.

232
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,444
So, what's it called?

233
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,453
It's called cj7_

234
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,701
Pathetic piece of crap.

235
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,539
Your dad found it in the garbage.

236
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,454
Don't talk about my dad like that!
I'm going to beat you up.

237
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,672
Oh, yeah?

238
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,356
Hello.

239
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,395
How many times
do I have to tell you?

240
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,603
We might be poor,
but we don't fight.

241
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,602
You really disappoint me.

242
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,068
Look at this.
Your uniform's all torn.

243
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,111
What was the fight about?

244
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,277
They were laughing at me.

245
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,953
What about?

246
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,044
Well?

247
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,593
Fine.

248
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,263
If you're not going to tell me...

249
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,811
Then I have no choice
in the matter.

250
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,957
I ast chancel

251
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,587
It's moving!

252
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,322
There are ghosts.

253
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,828
(Ghosts? Where?

254
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,906
There. In the ball

255
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,042
don't change the subject!

256
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:33,502
You think you can run rings around me,
but you're not as clever as you think.

257
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,668
Your uniform's a mess. What will
you wear for school tomorrow?

258
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,385
Do I have to
go hunt for another one?

259
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,807
I'll deal with you later.

260
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,489
There's a ghost!
Hanging over there!

261
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,743
Help! Ghost! It's horrible!

262
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,249
There's a red ghost hanging there!

263
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,712
Hanging! Too horrible!

264
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,247
Calm down!

265
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,841
It's a broken lamp. Can't you see?

266
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,848
Not again!

267
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,512
You're a ghost too.

268
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:35,355
Stop shouting! I'll send you outside
if you don't stop! Understand?

269
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,435
Are you on drugs or something?

270
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,615
What are you doing?

271
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,491
Please don't lock me inl!

272
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,779
There's a ghost.
You have to believe me.

273
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,118
I et me out!

274
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:36,629
Please let me out!

275
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,018
Help me, lord.

276
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,418
- Learned your lesson now?
- Yes, dad.

277
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,877
Will you behave yourself now?

278
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,758
I will. I really will.

279
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,420
I have to get back to work.

280
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,472
Okay! Off you go. Bye!

281
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,137
Are you from outer space?

282
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,931
Have you come to invade earth?

283
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:22,389
I think you might be
an alien toy dog.

284
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,545
My name is dicky.

285
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,923
Can I call you cj77?

286
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,839
If you wag your tail,
it means you like it!

287
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,712
Cj7!

288
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,320
The apples in our house
are always rotten.

289
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,276
So how come this one's not?

290
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,815
You know magic?

291
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,123
Wow! It's so sweet.
You really do know magic.

292
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,667
I'm going to be rich!

293
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,980
If you can beat
the most vicious dog on earth...

294
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,519
Then you really are
a superdog from space.

295
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,777
(50!

296
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,047
Oh, my god!

297
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,702
I have a test today and I've been
playing with you instead of studying.

298
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,209
But I really want to get 100.
Can you help me?

299
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,230
What's that you're making?

300
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,072
Dicky chow.

301
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,575
Why are you
wearing those glasses?

302
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,657
My eyes hurt.
Do you want to take a look?

303
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,994
No, I don't. Sit down.

304
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:16,087
Begin writing now!

305
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,784
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

306
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,918
A fly?

307
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,966
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

308
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,269
I now have the results
of today's test.

309
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,276
And for the first time,
dicky chow got 100.

310
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,992
- Thank you, sir!
- Hold on a minute.

311
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,989
I want to see those glasses.

312
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,644
Those super-glasses were fantastic!

313
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:39,398
It's p.E. Next,
so I'll need super-sneakers!

314
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,991
This is so exciting.

315
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,998
Excellence at the high jump...

316
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,832
Requires talent, hard work...

317
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,338
Training, a good night's sleep...

318
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,465
And finally,
respect for your teacher.

319
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,297
This is my personal record.

320
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,928
So far no one has bettered it

321
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:22,065
I have new sneakers today, sir.

322
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:27,487
Sir! He just broke your record.

323
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:40,083
Dicky, it doesn't ring true
that a kid can jump that high.

324
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,876
Be a good boy and do it again.

325
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,500
Dicky chow.
What are those shoes you're wearing?

326
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,084
It's none of your business!

327
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,668
This is too much.

328
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,708
You drove me to this.

329
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,922
Come down!

330
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,278
Dicky! Are you out of your mind?
I

331
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,992
over here. Catch him!

332
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,744
Come to your senses, dicky.

333
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:49,838
Miss yuen, bitterness, like the sea,
is boundless.

334
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,840
Dicky!

335
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,129
Dicky chow! How can you jump
so high? Come down this minute!

336
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,467
How on earth
can you sleep like that?

337
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,341
Wake up. It's nearly time for school.

338
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,427
What do I have to do
to get you up in the morning?

339
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,058
It was all a dream?

340
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,316
You're real.

341
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,817
I'm getting ready right now!

342
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,740
Dad, I'm going to get 100
on the exam today.

343
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,123
What?

344
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,701
I'm going to get 100!

345
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:07,956
Really?

346
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:12,370
Yes! All on my own! 100!

347
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,128
That's great.

348
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:32,520
If you can beat
the most vicious dog on earth...

349
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,982
Then you really are
a superdog from space.

350
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,191
(50!

351
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,796
Run!

352
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,620
So, what happened back there?

353
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,210
You're supposed to be
the superdog from space.

354
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,497
Don't tell me
you were just pretending.

355
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,417
Seriously.

356
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,177
I have to get 100 on the exam.

357
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:47,340
I need you
to work your magic for me.

358
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:51,557
Come on, now. Please!
I'm not joking.

359
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,557
You have to give me
magic weapons.

360
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,966
Time's up.

361
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,844
What? But I haven't started yet.

362
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,265
What's with the turd?

363
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,219
Turd? It's not that!

364
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,263
Shows how much you know!

365
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,154
You set me up!

366
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,536
I'm going to kill you!

367
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,005
Give me the magic weapons now!

368
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,930
Why, you...

369
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,100
You

370
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,124
Please, sir. Can I say something?

371
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,789
No, you can't.

372
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,000
You are a poor student.

373
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,841
You are always dirty,
and you are very wicked.

374
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,472
You discredit the school.

375
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,473
There's nothing more to say.

376
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,556
Now clean him up!

377
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,489
Cj77?

378
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,901
Please come out.

379
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,578
Why would I be mad at you?

380
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,032
We're good friends.

381
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,709
The turd wasn't important.

382
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,170
I've seen it all before.

383
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:09,926
Let's just forget it ever happened.
Okay?

384
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,513
In fact, I love you very much.
Do you know that?

385
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,761
Cj77 come here.

386
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,271
Closer!

387
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,867
I'm going to stab you to death!

388
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:46,545
Rubbish dog from space.
You're low-tech and boring.

389
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:50,628
I got blamed and laughed at.
And all because of you.

390
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:54,887
If you're just an animal, then say so!
Don't pretend you have magic powers!

391
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,300
But did it ever say that”

392
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,478
did I get it wrong?

393
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,392
Have I made a mistake?

394
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,687
I know I've made a mistake!

395
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,543
Wait!

396
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:30,047
Hey! Wait!

397
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,670
Wait!

398
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,639
Dicky! What's happened?

399
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,978
Cj7 has disappeared.

400
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,735
I ook.

401
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,332
Cj77?

402
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,166
I'm sorry. I missed you so much.

403
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,249
I thought I'd never see you again.

404
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,918
And you're not angry with me.

405
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,507
You two already met?

406
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,228
Is it a toy?

407
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,513
Yes, it is.

408
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,938
And it can walk and move its eyes?

409
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,443
Where did you get it?

410
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,275
Someone at school lent it to me.

411
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,900
Where's the cover?

412
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,240
Where do the batteries go?

413
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,121
It doesn't need them. It's high-tech.

414
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:49,077
I've never seen
anything like it before.

415
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,461
Did you see that?

416
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:56,636
Yes, I did.

417
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,795
It's all bendy.

418
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,635
Don't! I have to give it back soon.

419
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,094
It's fine.

420
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,806
- What are you doing, dad?”
- Nothing!

421
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:22,110
See, I told you it'd be fine.
It gets its shape back. Look!

422
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,660
This is fun.

423
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,119
No more squeezing it!
That's enough!

424
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,958
Everything is high-tech nowadays.

425
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:34,668
Basically there's no future
for uneducated people like us.

426
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:40,093
Dad, I don't want
to lie to you, so...

427
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,472
Cj7 came out of the ball
you gave me.

428
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,974
It came from outer space.

429
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,641
How many times
do I have to tell you?

430
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,603
We might be poor, but we don't lie...

431
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,517
We don't fight...

432
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,938
And we don't take things
that don't belong to us.

433
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,363
Study hard and be a useful person
in the future.

434
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,878
It's so hot.

435
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,166
Well, I'll be... the hottest night
and it starts to work. Lucky, or what?

436
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,371
I'm off to school now.

437
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,502
- Have you got your lunch box?
- Yes, I have.

438
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,130
Hey. How was the exam?

439
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,514
How come your head's gone red?

440
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,849
You don't look so good today.

441
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,511
Didn't you sleep last night?

442
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,521
Get inside and go to sleep.

443
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,353
You! Stop!

444
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,271
What's that thing inside your bag?

445
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,781
Nothing.

446
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,192
I need to check your schoolbag!

447
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,157
What for?

448
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,539
I don't have to tell you that.

449
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,208
Let go!

450
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,220
What's that?

451
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,049
I et me see.

452
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,183
Give it to me! Let me see first!

453
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,517
Give it to me! Don't pull!

454
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,517
(Get it!

455
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,045
What is this weird thing?

456
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:46,172
Don't touch it!
Give it back to me!

457
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,799
(Set the tool box!

458
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,588
Open it up and look inside.

459
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,846
Here

460
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,718
let him go!

461
00:55:58,564 --> 00:55:59,804
Can't do it.

462
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,472
Try this.

463
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,609
No! Don't do that!

464
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,110
It's not working.

465
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:09,692
How is that possible?

466
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,499
You won't do that to my thing!

467
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,084
So what”? Going to hit me?

468
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,545
You won't know what's hit you!

469
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,098
Let him go!

470
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:50,945
You let him go.

471
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,856
You let me go first.

472
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,369
I don't want a fight.

473
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,684
Don't force me to do this!

474
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,585
Are you okay?

475
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,168
I'm fine. Thank you.

476
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:33,791
You're welcome.

477
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,425
What's going on here?

478
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,179
Why were you fighting? Tell me!

479
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,388
You're going to stand here
until you tell me!

480
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,774
Cj7!

481
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,942
I knew you'd be okay!

482
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,652
Stop. Don't.

483
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:58,826
Good boy.

484
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,326
What is that thing”?

485
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,327
Look! Cj7, sit!

486
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,952
That's cool.

487
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,867
What else does it do?

488
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,456
Cj7, happy face!

489
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,670
Angry face!

490
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,633
Sad face!

491
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,672
Saw a pretty lady!

492
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,971
Your apartment's on fire.

493
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,304
But you just won the lottery!

494
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,178
Oops! The whole family is dead.

495
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,765
You've got 100 on the exam!

496
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,228
Wicked

497
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,486
I ook!

498
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,288
Wow, fireworks!

499
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,624
Where did you get it?

500
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,410
I want one too.

501
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,919
I can't tell you that.

502
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:56,298
But I want to thank you
for not telling Mr. cao about this.

503
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,503
Of course not!

504
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,134
We don't discuss
our business with adults.

505
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,825
- You have my word!
- You have my word!

506
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,685
Hey, you're amazing.
Do you want to be on our judo team?

507
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,810
They'd all make fun of me.

508
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,687
They wouldn't dare.

509
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,644
Would you make fun of her?

510
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,546
Look at this.
My son got 100 on his exam.

511
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:37,796
That's a great kid!

512
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,208
Yes!

513
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,215
- Look!
- Get away!

514
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,130
He got 100.

515
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,723
Boss.
My kid got 100 on his exam.

516
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,934
So he cheated.

517
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,234
What makes you say that?

518
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:01,317
My son's really smart, but even
he can't pass without cheating.

519
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,324
So how can your son get 1007?
Hard to believe, dickhead.

520
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,405
You're not serious.

521
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:13,371
Look at the ink. He got zero
and changed it to 100. He's a liar.

522
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:18,205
But he's not like that.
I know him better.

523
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,623
Your son cheated.

524
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,757
- I can't let you say that.
- He cheated!

525
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,714
I'll hit you if you say that again.

526
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:25,796
Your son cheated.

527
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:28,511
You hit me? Just you try!

528
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,521
Your son cheated! You hit me?

529
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,655
You're fired!

530
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,612
Your son cheated!

531
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,717
Quick!

532
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,430
(Set inside.

533
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,601
Tell the truth.
Did you cheat on your exam?

534
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:21,946
No, I didn't.

535
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:26,322
I think you got zero,
then altered it to 100. Is that right?

536
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,034
Yes

537
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:34,240
but that's not the same as cheating.
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

538
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,953
What's wrong with you?

539
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:39,085
It's so tough
to send you to that school.

540
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:41,792
I'm sorry, dad.

541
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,754
I'll say it again.
Even though we're poor...

542
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,338
Okay! I know!

543
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,630
You're so annoying.
Can you stop going on about it?

544
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,593
I changed it. So what?

545
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,871
If there's nothing else,
I'm leaving.

546
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,087
What are you doing?

547
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,668
Why are you taking my things?

548
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,801
If you can't work hard,
then you don't get to play.

549
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,711
- Give it back to me!
- No_

550
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,550
Why are you taking my stuff?

551
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:34,888
Why"? Because I'm your father!
And I can!

552
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,053
You're bullying me.
I don't have a dad like youl!

553
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,688
You always get zeros.
I don't have a son like you.

554
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,565
I eave me alone!

555
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:43,976
Say it again!

556
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,486
I eave me alone forever!

557
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,066
Okay!

558
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,568
If you can use your own brains
to get over 60...

559
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,452
Then I'll leave you alone forever!

560
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,203
- It's a deal!
- It's a deal!

561
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,123
I'm going to get that grade.
Just watch me!

562
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:02,582
We'll see about that, zero hero!

563
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:06,044
That's not fair! I'll show you!

564
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,629
Don't bother me anymore!

565
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,011
What are you looking at?

566
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,061
- Mr. chow.
- Miss yuen.

567
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,439
- Is something wrong? Please come in.
- I won't, thanks.

568
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,650
But dicky forgot his lunch box today.
Could you see that he gets it?

569
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,069
Sure. Let me ask someone
to open the gate.

570
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:40,286
No, please don't. If his classmates
see me, he'll never live it down.

571
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,460
How come?

572
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,209
I have to go. “Wait.

573
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,043
Dicky told me everything.

574
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,333
He was just being temperamental.

575
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,674
If you'd allow it, he could
come to my house after school.

576
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,758
We can talk about what happened.

577
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,970
And there's another exam tomorrow,
so I can help him to review.

578
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,350
What do you think?

579
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:00,973
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

580
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:04,139
- You're welcome. It's nothing at all.
- I appreciate this so much.

581
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,150
- It's just a small thing. Nothing, really.
- It's not nothing.

582
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,480
The thing is...

583
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:12,318
I can't give him very much myself,
and that makes me feel very guilty.

584
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:16,656
But if you were to help him study,
I could never repay you.

585
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,954
You really don't have to.
It's the least I can do.

586
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,578
Then I'll leave him in your hands.

587
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,833
Sure. You just leave dicky to me.

588
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,787
Thank you. You're welcome.

589
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,786
How's the boss feeling today?

590
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,371
You dare to come back?

591
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,036
I have to. I need to eat.

592
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,695
I know I have a big mouth,
but I think we understand each other.

593
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:34,900
What?

594
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:38,908
I shouldn't have said that
about your son. Let's forget it. Here.

595
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,444
Well

596
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,242
- but he really did cheat.
- Who doesn't, sometimes?

597
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,033
The kid is very smart.
I know he'll be successful

598
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,419
I pray to god that you're right.

599
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,545
So take it and buy him some candy.

600
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,047
Hey! This is far too much.

601
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:56,676
Use it for books, then. Or school fees.
But now get back to work.

602
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,763
Today must be my lucky day.

603
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,026
I thought you'd never pass.

604
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:40,657
(Ood.

605
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:42,441
Thanks, Mr. cao.

606
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,359
What's happening?

607
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,494
Where's your safety belt?

608
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,736
What's going on here?

609
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,737
Help!

610
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,077
Give me your hand!

611
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:33,207
Reach out! Give me your hand!

612
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,548
Why haven't these been moved?

613
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,293
What was that”? Hey! Be careful!

614
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,272
I'm so sorry.

615
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,981
Dicky, you have to come with me.

616
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,646
Is this your house, dicky?

617
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,567
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat?

618
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,662
Dicky, I'm going
to tell you something.

619
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:55,137
There was a terrible accident,
and your dad passed away.

620
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:21,459
There are some things
we can't control. Do you understand?

621
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,163
Don't talk anymore, miss.
I want to sleep.

622
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,081
Please leave me.

623
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,710
Dicky, open the door.

624
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,090
I'm sorry.

625
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,596
Miss yuen.

626
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,508
I'm very tired.

627
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:43,015
I need to sleep.

628
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,067
Dicky.

629
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,111
My dad won't leave me alone.

630
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:58,621
He'll be home when I wake up.

631
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,249
I need to sleep now.

632
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,333
Dicky.

633
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,644
Dad.

634
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,188
Why aren't you in your pajamas?

635
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,374
Hey. What's up?

636
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:39,251
Dad, don't ever leave me.

637
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,344
I'll listen to you...

638
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,433
I'll study hard...

639
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:49,844
Won't lie

640
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,512
I won't fight...

641
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,182
And one day
I'll be a really useful person.

642
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,060
That's good.

643
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,131
Cj7!

644
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,293
How are you?

645
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,721
What's that noise?

646
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,726
Yeah, what is it?

647
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,559
Why are you so tired, cj7?

648
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,490
What's happened to him, dad?

649
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,492
Maybe the batteries have run out.

650
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,622
It wouldn't look like that!

651
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,624
But it's very high-tech.

652
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,589
The new term starts soon..

653
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:16,474
And we have a picnic
before going back.

654
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,806
Everybody's very happy.

655
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,438
Storm dragon
doesn't fight anymore...

656
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,769
Because he's fallen in love.

657
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:24,897
Because he's fallen in love.

658
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,990
Maggie likes me best...

659
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,334
But my love is Fanny.

660
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,255
And she loves me very much too!

661
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,266
Johnny always takes what's mine.

662
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,600
Maybe he'll stop
when I tell the teacher about him.

663
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:06,934
Every pupil has his own true love.

664
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,103
And so has my dad.

665
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:27,295
It's just amazing. When we saw you in
the hospital you appeared to be quite...

666
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:31,630
Dead, yes. But now I'm right as rain.
Not even the doctors can explain it.

667
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,045
And how have you been since then?

668
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:36,054
Well, I do have a bit of a problem.

669
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,715
What kind of problem?

670
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,975
I'm far too handsome.

671
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:44,809
Very funny.

672
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,142
I mean it.

673
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,739
It's not easy to win a girl over...

674
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,070
Especially if you're not that funny.

675
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,860
But dad won't give up.
He's my hero.

676
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:02,577
You don't think I'm handsome,
miss yuen? You can't be serious.

677
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:10,335
I'm so lucky
that I still have you, cj7.

678
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,340
Every day, while you sleep...

679
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:15,173
I close my eyes
and count to three

680
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,931
hoping when I look again,
you'll wake.

681
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,093
I want you back so much.
Where are you, cj77?

682
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:29,896
One, two, three...
