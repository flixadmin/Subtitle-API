Are you okay?

Come on. It's dangerous.

Wanna kill him?

14
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,644
He's doing what he's told.

How do you know that?

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,058
[Kid] They're all gone because of you.

Won't be long
before the monsters are here.

32
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,915
Sound the alarm inside.

33
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,998
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,250
What about her?

35
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,377
Help her walk.

36
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,174
Quarantine her.

37
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,883

That was pretty loud.

49
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,482
A mine at the outer wall, I guess.

50
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,734
From the sound, sir?

51
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,569
I mean, what else could blow up like that?

Meaning?

113
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,517
We used up all our C4 today.

114
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,353
I mean, how are we gonna blow them up now?

115
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,522
We kept the stadium safe.

116

[Seok-chan] Yeah, but still.

117

It's not a bother.

About my son, Jun-il...

I'll find him, ma'am.

You should be able to see him soon.

Sir, I want to apologize.

127
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,594
[In-hwan] About what?

128
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,763
For acting on my own, I mean.

129
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,058
And even after the mine was disarmed.

130
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,184
Why did you do it?

131
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,939
You could've gotten yourself killed.

132
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,316
So I wouldn't have regrets.

133
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,527
That's my reason.

134
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,030
When you can't act,
then you're just stuck.

135
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,658
Powerless.

136
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,037
I know how that feels.
I know what it means.

137
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,586
Sir, I mean...

138
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,966
Was there anything else?

139
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,156
Ten hut!

140
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,785
Sir, what was the explosion I heard?

141
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,538
A woman tried to run
and triggered a mine earlier.

142
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,291
It exploded before we could
properly defuse it.

143
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,170
Which platoon member was overseeing them?

144
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,719
I was in charge, sir.

145
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,262
I'm Private Park.

146
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,682
It's behind us now.
We've prevented the worst.

147
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,767
And the runner?

148
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,727
Removed, I assume, huh?

149
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,522
Park Chan-yeong.

150
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,650
She was showing monster symptoms

151
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,652
so we isolated her.

152
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,236
Isolated?

153
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,864
I insisted we keep her here.

154
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,869

Kim Yeong-hu.

156
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,128
Remember what you swore?
You said that you'd take care of our men.

157
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,007
I really placed my faith in you
and look where it's gotten us now.

158
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,260
More than half of our men are gone
in less than a year!

159
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,472
[Yeong-hu exhales]

160
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,727
Stick to protecting the stadium, please.

161
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,479
I'll take care of our men now.

162
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,368
Good work out there.

163
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,452
Go on in.

164
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,036
Sir, a moment.

165
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,456
Has Sergeant Choi come back yet?

166
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,833
What are you talking about?

167
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,127
We had an incident during the mission.

168
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,504
And he hasn't returned it seems.

169
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,925
Also, the one who missed roll call,
I found him by the entrance.

00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,355
What's gotten into you, huh?

173
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,776
You're gonna get shot
barging in like that.

174
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,069
I'll chance it.

175
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,029
I think I'll enjoy heaven more.

176
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,448
Hell can't be that much worse
than here, either.

177
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,407
[Dr. Lim groans]

178
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,203
- What's this? Day drinking?
- [Dr. Lim chuckles]

179
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,121
What's there to drink?

180
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,790
That sure sounds nice, huh?

181
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,709
I got something
that would pair great with that.

182
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,793
And what's that?

183
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,462
A fun little story.

184
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,298
Oh, I'm good. I'm not interested.

185
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,633
Forget I asked.

186
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,346
I heard they were cleaning the house.

187
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,434
You know how they shot
that whole zone with missiles, yeah?

188
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,645
It wasn't a mistake. It was...

189
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,688
The powers that be
were cleaning the house.

190
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,652
I heard there was monsterization
getting out of control and all.

191
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,613
They thought it'd be better to, uh...

192
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,324
start with a clean slate.

193
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,661
Why does that matter now?

194
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,081
Hey. Oh, come on.
Still playing cool even now?

195
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,919
Oh, I'm not trying to get
under your skin, Doctor.

196
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,797
It's like I said, it's just a bit of fun.

197
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,549
I'm not amused.

198
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,968
'Cause you're still here.

199
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,140
They wanted to clean the house,
start fresh, well, they failed.

200
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
Isn't that why you're still alive
right now?

201
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,437
The same reason you're living
the good life here as well, Doctor.

202
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,189
No, that's not the reason I came here.

203
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,403
I mean, I have a really fun story.
Wanna hear it?

204
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,571
Are you kidding?

205
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,615
This, I've got to hear.

206
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,744
I'm not sure you could handle it.

207
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,871
Seriously?

208
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,040
What's with all the secrets?

209
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,334
I'm sure if you rack
that genius brain of yours,

210
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,919
you'll get there eventually.

211
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,880
Oh, come on.

212
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,215
Come on, Doctor.

213
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,844
Look, I'm not asking for free, okay?

214
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,055
I got these earlier today. Gambling.

215
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,974
Get out. I need to rest.

216
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,474
[Dr. Lim grunts]

217
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,436
Sleep well, Doctor.

218
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,979
[clanks]

219
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,612
This... Why is this place such a mess?

220
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,947
Someone's gonna slip and fall.

221
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,409
Mom.

222
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,662
Mom, where are you?

223
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,166
I have to go to her.

224
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,168
She said so.

225
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,587
[unsettling music]

226
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,672
[Jun-il] I have to go find my mom.

227
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,415
[somber music]

228
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,157
[grunts]
Let's see what we got.

229
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,535
Boss, shouldn't you be keeping watch?

230
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,496
Don't pocket anything.

231
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,763
[cocks]

232
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,892
What the hell?

233
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,976
Practice.

234
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,227
Bang!

235
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,108
Aren't you gonna go, "Bleh"?

236
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,153
What? Hey!

237
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,656
God, you're such a buzzkill, I swear.

238
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,120
Hmm?

239
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,623
[gasps]
Holy shit!

240
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,500
Oh, snacks.

241
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,043
Oh, my god. Spam?

242
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,337
Sausage.

243
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,424
Let's get going. Eat when we're back.

244
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,051
Wait, just one bite.

245
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,977
[Ha-ni] Shouldn't we take this too?

246
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,854
We're all out, you know.

247
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,363
[Dr. Lim] Is he still out of it?

248
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,698
Yes.

249
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,492
[Dr. Lim] Pry his eyes open.

250
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,499
Are his eyes out of focus?

251
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,669
- No.
- Check for any cuts or scars.

252
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,547
Look everywhere. Every nook and cranny.

253
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,217
If he's got any scrapes,
give him a shot of antibiotics.

254
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,644
[Chan-yeong] Hey.

255
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,021
[Jun-il grunts]

256
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,862
[Chan-yeong] What the?

257
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,408
Um, there's a scar here, but it's weird.

258
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,201
[annoyed sigh]
Jesus.

259
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,915
Jesus.

260
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,334
Your face is the real emergency here,
Private Park.

261
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,295
It looks worse than it feels.

262
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,636
What the hell?

263
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,140
It's not a burn and it's not a bruise.

264
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,120
- Does he have any chronic conditions?
- [Chan-yeong] I'm not...

265
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,145
I'm not sure. Sorry.

266
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,688
Does he have family here?

267
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,523
That's...

268
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Ah.

269
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,737
He's the son of the isolated infectee.

270
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,988
Should we step out?

271
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,781
What for? He's gonna find out.

272
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,909
Still, um...

273
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,512
[Dr. Lim] Whatever it is,
it doesn't seem to be fatal, at least.

274
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,413
- [mumbles] Oh, Mom.
- But just to be safe,

275
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,749
I wanna keep him here.

276
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,463
Well, don't wait up now.

277
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,340
Being here isn't gonna help him
heal faster.

278
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,887
Oh, Dr. Lim.

279
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,891
Can monsters choose to attack
certain humans?

280
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,435
If you're talking about Type Greens,

281
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,856
they're not responding
to a certain individual.

282
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,068
It only seems like that
'cause they're more passive.

283
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,831
[Chan-yeong] What if there were two people

284
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,614
and the monster chose to pick one
of them to attack?

285
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,076
[Dr. Lim] Did you see something or...

286
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,787
is this just a thought you have?

287
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,491
- What difference would that make?
- Monsterization...

288
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,877
affects your mind.

289
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,130
It's a mental disease in a sense.

290
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,217
I mean, if we're not splitting hairs.
You get it, though, yeah?

291
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,428
I think, personally,
it's a mental disease,

292
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,390
capable of capturing
the minds of individuals

293
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,350
and bending them to its own will,

294
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,602
going so far
as to make their bodies change.

295
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,186
You think...

296
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,942
these puppets have anything
resembling love left in them?

297
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,361
You're right, Doctor.

298
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,363
Private Park, whatever it was,

299
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,949
it was chance.

300
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,994
Yeah. Take good care of him, please.

301
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,331
Private Park.

302
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,628
This monster of yours, keep me posted.

303
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,463
If you happen to see it once more.

304
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,633
Could it really have been
trying to protect?

305
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,094
I'm talking about this monster
who picks whom to attack.

306
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,305
I'd love it if you can bring it in.

307
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,514
Who knows?

308
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,519
This oddball of yours
might end up being the key we need.

[unsettling music]

312
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,254
I think I'm losing it.

313
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,883
A monster that protects us?

314
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,596
[sobs] Aren't you gonna say
that you're sorry?

315
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,931
I'm still waiting for your apology!

316
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,558
What's this about, huh?

317
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,561
I told you to come back safe.

318
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,481
I told you that it's dangerous,

319
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,484
and I told you not to go. I told you.

320
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,278
And what the hell happened to your face?

321
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,572
Who was it? How did you get like this?

322
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,782
A monster?

323
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,367
I'm fine, really.

324
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,827
Do you see my hair?

325
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,580
I didn't get the dye out in time
'cause I was so worried about you,

326
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,831
and now it's a wreck.

327
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,334
Ugh! If you keep that up and something...

328
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,171
something happens,
what am I supposed to do then, huh?

329
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,381
- How...
- Hmm?

330
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,717
I don't really get
where you're going with this.

331
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,221
It's...

332
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,434
No, never mind.
[sniffles]

333
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:12,649
Hey. Once I get my hair looking perfect,
then I'll see you again.

334
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,069
And put ointment on those.

335
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,616
[breathes deeply]

336
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,055
[In-hwan] And what brings you here?

337
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,122
ELECTRICAL ROOM

338
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,460
The infectee.

339
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,004
Get rid of her immediately.

340
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,090
What's the rush?

341
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,469
I'm sure you have more important things
you need to deal with.

342
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,638
Just 'cause she's the first in a month,

343
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,141
and she's one patient out of 100,

344
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,684
do you really think it's all fine?

345
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,728
I'm telling you, it's not.

346
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,563
The others will fear the worst.

347
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,816
Monsterization isn't contagious?

348
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,652
Wrong. Monsterization sows panic

349
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,736
and fear.

350
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,030
It'll spread.

351
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,368
So then cut out the cyst.

352
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,121
Isn't that why you're here?

353
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,289
This cyst...

354
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,500
anyone in here could be that.

355
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,960
Including you and me, Chief.

356
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,712
Can you please get to your point?

357
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,216
This worst-case scenario in their heads,

358
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,344
are they worried they'll get attacked
by monsters,

359
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,181
or are they worried
they're going to turn into monsters?

360
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,225
Ever since we got here,

361
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,936
we haven't had a single death
due to a monster outbreak.

362
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,731
Though it seems
people are trying to leave here.

363
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,026
It's not about showing compassion
for infectees.

364
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,737
I think we could give hope
to the survivors here.

365
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,655
That you still have a choice,

366
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
even if you start turning
into one of them.

367
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,869
What use is something like that
in a world like ours?

368
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,578
[chuckles]

369
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,665
We all need that thing, you know.

370
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,042
[scoffs]

371
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,838
But I'm sure I'm not teaching you
anything new.

372
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:04,135
That silver lining
is what keeps you here, hmm?

373
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,597
If this turns into a problem...

374
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,894
Sergeant, I hope you'll take
full responsibility.

375
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,478
Of course.

376
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,443
[door slams]

377
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,079
[exhales heavily]

378
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,876
[breathing heavily]

379
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,402
Hey, sit down.

380
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,739
No visitors again. Whatever shall we do?

381
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,701
And whose fault is that?

382
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,289
Well, I heard smiling brings customers in,
wonder if frowning works.

383
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,665
Business was never that good.

384
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,083
[sighs]

385
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,337
I might've picked the wrong line of work.

386
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,844
Or maybe the wrong employee.

387
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,100
You have to start earning these, okay?

388
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,853
Don't act high and mighty.

389
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,229
This can't fix me.

390
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,148
You can't find these meds in here.

391
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,192
At least take
the antibiotics here, though.

392
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,361
Hiring someone new is a pain.

393
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,071
[Seung-wan] Father?

394
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,660
Uh, we have a testimony
meeting today, right?

395
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,870
- We do.
- [Gi-chun] Oh.

396
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,040
I heard confessing here
makes all of the symptoms go away.

397
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,417
- Right.
- She was the one who told us to come.

398
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,127
[Gi-chun] All right.

399
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,930
[Peter] Wow,
and you all came right on time.

400
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,441
[door opens, closes]

401
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,445
Oh, God! Hey! Have you gone crazy?

402
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,113
Let go! Damn it.

403
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,866
I was saving this
for when I was gonna ask him out.

404
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,995
Oh, seriously! Damn it.

405
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,126
Guess things aren't so bad.
You can spend your time

406
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,836
- drawing little doodles.
- Give it back.

407
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,634
- Isn't that Father Peter?
- It's not.

408
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,928
What do you mean it's not?

409
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,514
Long hair, all black,
except for the white thingy here.

410
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,890
That's totally him, isn't it?

411
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,392
No way.

412
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,978
For real?

413
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,687
Please.

414
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,858
Huh? Where are we going?

415
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,779
[Jin-ok] Even still, I should be grateful.

416
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,741
If it weren't for this place,
I probably would've died a long time ago.

417
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,661
Here, we have a floor to lay down on,

418
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,205
and there's a roof over our heads.

419
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,583
I even have my boy with me.

420
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,377
It's the best of a bad situation.

421
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,713
Right. Imagine
not being grateful for this.

422
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,256
- Brother.
- Jesus!

423
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,800
Give it here.

424
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,802
Hey.

425
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,762
You said we should be honest here.

426
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,806
Was that honest, or was it bullshit?

427
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,309
If you just keep bottling up everything,
you'll end up like...

428
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,562
just like Jun-il's mother
over there, you know?

429
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,023
Well, how about you start us off today?

430
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,859
Jesus.

431
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,738
You can't just hold it all in, right?

432
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,905
Let out that steam.

433
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,826
The people that are gathered here,
look what's happened.

434
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,828
Not a single monster.

435
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,205
You see what I mean?

436
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,499
Uh, I'd like to confess.

437
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,504
[clears throat]
Uh, I've kept this from everyone,

438
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,089
but I'm actually happy now.

439
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,092
[man] I wake up, I find something to eat.

440
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,636
Next thing you know, it's bedtime.

441
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,097
This rhythm suits me.
No one's better or worse off...

442
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,849
Why don't we call it for today here?

443
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,913
I want to confess. I think
I might be in love with you, Father.

444
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,313
That's not it.

445
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,733
I'm sure, actually.

446
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,089
[Ye-seul] I wasn't saying
you should just blurt it out like that.

447
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,758
[Gi-chun]
Hope things work out for you two.

448
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,658
Jesus tap-dancing Christ, sheesh.

449
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,868
[chuckles]

450
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,453
You all staying or what?

451
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,871
[man] Nothing more to hear here.

452
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,499
[Seung-wan] Well, it's not like
it's the Father's fault.

453
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,651
- [woman] Oh, my.
- [man] Oh, my...

454
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,423
Uh, Father?

455
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,592
May I ask a favor?

456
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,928
Yeah, of course, you can.

457
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,263
It's about Jun-il's mother.

458
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,141
I'm wondering if you could visit her.

459
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,478
Since you can leave the premises
with permission.

460
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,897
That's an expensive favor, actually.

461
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,566
Oh.

462
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,195
I'll just say it's pro bono.

463
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,489
[knocks on door]

464
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,241
Come in.

465
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,131
I'll go search for Sergeant Choi
as soon as light breaks.

466
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,394
Is that what you think
Yong-seok would want?

467
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,305
Let's hear it.
How are you liking soldiering here?

468
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,851
Are you suggesting that Yong-seok
abandoned his post?

469
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,520
We can't be certain he didn't.

470
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,662
That doesn't change a damn thing for me.

471
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,649
I'll find him, bring him back.

472
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,532
- [In-hwan] Request denied.
- Master Sergeant.

473
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,320
I can't in good conscience
put everyone else's lives at risk.

474
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,365
You went through all that trouble
for that infectee.

475
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,451
But you're quick to abandon
one of your own men.

476
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,535
[In-hwan] No.

477
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,955
I'm doing this for you guys.

478
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,166
I'm not so sure anymore.

479
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,129
[sighs]

480
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,923
What do you think of Crow Platoon, sir?

481
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,934
These men risk their lives
every day for this place.

482
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,730
Crow Platoon's honor and dignity?

483
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,651
So, what use is honor when you're buried?

484
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,111
That's what I'm trying to say.

485
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,781
You want to go find Yong-seok.

486
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,158
And everyone else?

487
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,495
Are the rest of the Crows
on board with this mission?

488
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,042
How many men have you lost

489
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,169
thanks to making bull-headed mistakes?

490
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,923
Don't be like me.

491
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,883
Look, Sergeant.

492
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,677
I want you to learn from my failures.

493
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,346
[scoffs]

494
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,018
You sure have become
a big coward, I must say.

495
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,360
[door closes]

496
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,922
Man, is this stuff even edible?

497
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,715
Take it or leave it, bud.

498
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,342
It's the best we got here.

499
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,427
This is what I risk my life for? Jesus.

500
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,222
And here I joined up 'cause I heard
soldiers get regular meals.

501
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,390
The hell is this?

502
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,394
Hey, Jin-ho.

503
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,062
Any signals yet?

504
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,856
[Jin-ho] No signals yet, sir.

505
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,609
[Seo-jin]
Think being underground is affecting it?

506
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,070
You think I should...
I should take it upstairs for a bit?

507
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,446
[Jin-ho] I installed a repeater,

508
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,532
so the signal
should come through just fine.

509
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,159
[sighs]

510
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,582
Taste good?

511
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,376
[gulps]

512
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,003
How can you eat right now?

513
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Man...

514
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,968
The way I see it, Yong-seok is a deserter.

515
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,181
Watch your fucking mouth.

516
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,435
A Marine has dignity.

517
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,812
Hey, I didn't say anything
about what Marines had.

518
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,273
You might've been too busy
pulling pranks or whatever,

519
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,025
but have you seen Yong-seok recently?

520
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,236
Like a dead man walking around,
with his awful face.

521
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,155
[Dong-jun]
The face of a deserter, for sure.

522
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,781
Even so, Yong-seok wouldn't...

523
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,493
I don't think he'd do that.

524
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,912
He knows better than anyone
how dangerous it is out there.

525
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,541
Oh, maybe he...

526
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,627
Maybe he's showing symptoms
and he wouldn't want others to...

527
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,711
[Dong-jun grunts]

528
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,340
[Seo-jin] God, you sure
love to talk, don't you?

529
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,063
I told you to watch your mouth, didn't I?

530
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,135
Did you fucking hit me?

531
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,428
Want to throw down?

532
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,430
- Huh?
- [Dong-jun scoffs]

533
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,367
- You're not gonna pull rank, are you? Huh?
- I think that's enough, guys.

534
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,894
[grunts]
Hey, back off, motherfucker.

535
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,103
[loud clatter]

536
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,397
[Yeong-hu] That's enough.

537
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,528
You'll stop right there.

538
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,164
[somber music]

[grunts]

543
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,475
That baseball you took was my brother's.

544
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,936
Why would I take his
when there's balls everywhere?

545
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,312
You see the tear on it?

546
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,940
Well, he wants that one, so give it back.

547
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,650
Hand it over now.

548
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,026
This one's mine.

549
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,736
They say nothing here belongs to you.

550
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,864
- Who said that?
- [boy 1] My dad did.

551
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,031
Hey.

552
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,827
Your sister's a bitch. She's evil.
Does that mean you're an evil bastard?

553
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,246
Yeah, that's why
you don't deserve anything.

554
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,747
[Yeong-su grunts]

555
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,835
[boy 2] He's a monster.

556
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,837
- A thieving little monster.
- [chuckles]

557
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,049
[grunts]

558
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,678
[boy 1 groaning]

559
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,804
[boy 2] Hey, stop it!

560
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,973
Don't! I said stop it!

561
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,142
- Get off him!
- [boy 1 moans]

562
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,603
- [Eun-yu] Come here.
- Let go!

563
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,686
Come here.

564
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,063
You two get out of here.

565
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,107
I mean it!

566
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,026
Hey, watch your back.

567
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,195
Hey!

568
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,116
[Eun-yu] What are you doing?

569
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,368
You're a bully?

570
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,662
Well, it's better than being
a doormat, isn't it?

571
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,540
- Kim Yeong-su.
- If someone takes from you,

572
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,334
and you let them, you're a punk, see?

573
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,628
And that's how things are here.

574
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,756
You should just kill them all too.

575
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,132
That's what I'm going to do.

576
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,092
- Kim Yeong-su.
- 'Cause that's how it is.

577
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,597
Hurting other people...

578
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,643
you'll always end up paying for it.

579
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,436
Oh, yeah? You mean it?

580
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,647
- Yeah.
- So why am I paying?

581
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,024
I was good. Did what my dad told me.

582
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,152
And I made sure to always listen
and do the right thing.

583
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,529
So why am I alone?

584
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,990
I'm done listening to grown-ups.

585
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,284
So you should just live
how you want to now.

586
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,662
'Cause I know I will.

587
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,839
[sighs]

588
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,274
Shit.

589
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,951
What the hell?

590
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,203
[exhales deeply]

591
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,165
Oh Jun-il.

592
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,587
What... What are you...

593
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,383
Where is he?

594
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,974
[Jin-guk] You're not lying, are you?

595
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,685
Are you deaf?

596
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,312
She just said it wasn't.

597
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,731
Are you crazy?

598
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,482
You realize how serious this is?

599
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,484
It's not a cut, it's a nosebleed.

600
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,236
- Yeah, listen, you little...
- [gasps]

601
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,196
Goodness. What have you done?

602
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,822
[sighs]

603
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,283
Are we good?

604
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,494
Look, look, look.
Does that settle it, huh?

605
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,413
[Jin-guk]
You didn't have to take it that far.

606
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,956
Freaky little bastards.

607
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,792
Sheesh.

608
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,377
Ma.

609
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,923
Ma. Ma, I'm... I'm home.

610
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,052
I... I got some stuff from outside. Uh...

611
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,561
Ma? My mom.

612
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,106
Yeong-su, hey.

613
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,359
Have you seen my mother?

614
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,611
Yeah, your mom turned into a monster.

615
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,694
Huh?

616
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,239
I said she turned into a monster!
Her nose bled.

617
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,867
Then she will die.

618
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,287
Die? She will.

619
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,290
'Cause humans will kill her now.

620
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,148
Oh, Father.
What brings you all the way here?

621
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,651
I thought I should
pull my weight for once.

622
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,653
If you wanna confess, please go ahead.

623
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,915
I thought when I saw you coming here

624
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,917
that this was the end
of the line for good.

625
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,670
I mean, if we're gonna split hairs, then,

626
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,380
it's gonna get even harder to die now.

627
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,674
Humans are much more fragile.

628
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,801
I understand.

629
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,762
But there's nothing to spill.

630
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,140
I've been meaning to ask you
something, though.

631
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,268
I've got no answers. I can only listen.

632
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,187
Do I deserve this fate here now?

633
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,189
It's not like anyone deserves it.

634
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,024
You just got dealt a crappy hand,
is all.

635
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,070
Why is God so cruel?
I never asked for anything.

636
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,990
But he's punishing me
like I had lived a simple life.

637
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,161
How can he... How can he just
take and take from me? How?

638
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,662
Please be sure to ask.

639
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,791
Ask why he lets it all
fall apart like this.

640
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,419
Please, I'd love to know.

641
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:01,175
That's why I made do
and asked the monster.

642
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,555
"Monster, say something, please.
Please, tell me."

643
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,639
What did it say?

644
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,643
I, uh, I didn't hear it say anything.

645
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,980
Now the monster didn't say anything.

646
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,191
Everyone else says they hear the monster,

647
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,943
so why am I the only one
who doesn't hear anything?

648
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,572
Whether monster or God,
in the end, it's all the same torment.

649
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,908
I believe the thing that torments us...

650
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,453
isn't monsters or God, it's actually...

651
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,414
It's actually always that one person.

652
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,624
And they're...

653
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,627
They're your god and your monster.

654
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,795

[meows]

826
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,051
Going out again?

827
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,138
You're a stalker now?

828
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,848
You get a kick out of it?

829
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,644
[Eun-yu] And what about you?

830
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,771
Looking like you got your ass kicked.

831
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,441
How can you say that with a straight face?

832
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,818
Mind your own business.

833
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,446
Don't act alone, okay?

834
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,075
You're putting the whole center at risk.

Did you know these guys
risked their lives to be here?

Even cats know that to get what you want,

837
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,250
you bet with your life.

838

I've seen it.

Enough with your curiosity

'cause you'll wind up dead.

842
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,066
Do Sang-jin and An Dong-gi,

843
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,109
is that why they're dead?

844
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,361
Wanna know what killed them?

845
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,029
It's that person, isn't it?

The one you're looking for.

847
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,784
Or is it a monster?

What the hell are you talking about?

That monster has protected you.

And now you're looking for it.

How do you know me?

Did he mention me to you?

This man, where is he?

[Dr. Lim] Data number 23.

869
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,993
The blood sample extracted from Oh Jun-il

870
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,871
was very similar to that of a monster.

871
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,958
However, Oh Jun-il hasn't developed
any symptoms yet.

872
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,637
Despite having the possibility
of monsterization,

873
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,597
he shows no symptoms.

874
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,772
He was exposed to something out there.

875
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,318
First, I must uncover what transpired
in that two-hour missing window of time.

As of right now,
