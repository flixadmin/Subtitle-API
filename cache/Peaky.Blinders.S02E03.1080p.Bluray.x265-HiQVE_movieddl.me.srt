1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,280
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs
have been at war in London.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,120
<i>The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.</i>

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,280
Tell us your plan.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,720
I can offer you 100 good men.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,320
(GRUNTING)

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,560
Get him out of there, get him back!

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,480
Arthur killed a boy.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,440
TOMMY: Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,800
Your daughter is dead.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,360
But, Pol, Michael is alive.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,320
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,080
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,680
I think she might be my mother.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,640
MOSS: <i>There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.</i>

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,440
He's head of some secret department,

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
the Irish Desk.

17
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,360
MOSS: He was murdered this morning
in a street show in the Patch.

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,680
He was Irish. Is he a person of interest
to your department, sir?

19
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,520
Do you read the papers?

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,280
Birmingham papers.

21
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,840
I recommend the <i>Daily Mail.</i>

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,800
It will broaden your mind.

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,560
Now, if you read the national press,
you would know

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,120
that the king has offered
the rebel Irish a treaty.

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,440
Now, some of the Fenians
want to accept it.

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,360
The IRA do not.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,120
Now, the IRA have a long
and glorious relationship

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,280
with the garrotte.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
Oh, dear.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
Are they fighting amongst
themselves, are they, sir?

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,600
-That will be all.
-Right, sir.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,640
Oh, Moss, I'm going to be up and down
from London quite a bit.

33
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,040
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,640
Well, you wouldn't want
to stay in the lodgings

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,040
you had last time then, sir, eh?

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,200
Too many bad memories, I suppose.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,000
You should understand, Moss,

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
I have no regrets about
my previous mission in this city.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
No, sir?

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,720
(CHUCKLING) I imagine you boys
have quite a laugh at my expense.

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,960
A laugh, sir?

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,080
You think it's funny
that I developed feelings?

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,120
No idea what you're talking about, sir.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,000
I have no regrets about what
happened with Miss Burgess.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,320
No "bad memories".

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
Right, sir.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,160
He's losing his bloody mind.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Next.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Next.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,920
ARTHUR: All right, then.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,840
Name?

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,280
The Digbeth Kid.

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
The Dig...

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,240
What are you? A boxer?

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,080
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,400
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Cowboy pictures? Tom Mix?

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah?

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
ARTHUR: What are you...

60
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,560
Wait, wait. It's not a real gun.

61
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,680
-Let's have a look then, eh?
-It's made of wood.

62
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,960
(CHUCKLING)

63
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,120
Bang. Bang.

64
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,960
Very nice.

65
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,640
Where did you get the gun belt?

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,000
My sister made it out of
an old blacksmith's apron.

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,200
My mum did most of the stitching.

68
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,920
She's not my real mum, but...

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She does what mothers do.

70
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
So she made you a gun belt.

71
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,920
All right then, mother's boy.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,920
There's the door. On you go.
We're looking for...

73
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
Have you ever been arrested?

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,280
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

75
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,160
-No.
-Good.

76
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,000
You're the first bloke we've had in
here today with no criminal record.

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,360
Arthur, we can stand him up.

78
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
Do you know what that means?

79
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,440
The new Home Secretary wants something
done about illegal gambling.

80
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,040
Damn right.

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,440
About bloody time.

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,440
So we help our coppers make their quota
of convictions by having men stood up

83
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
to be arrested.

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,520
First of fence, you'll get a week inside.

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,760
We'll give you five quid
for your trouble.

86
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,880
How does that sound, cowboy?

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,080
Good. Write your address down
for Finn on your way out.

89
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,280
I can't write.

90
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,680
That's all right, Finn can't read.

91
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Don't worry.

92
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,440
Just tell him your address
and we'll send someone round.

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,560
If the sheriff don't run you
out of town first.

94
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,280
(CHUCKLING)

95
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,840
Good man.

96
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,760
-Oh, I don't know, Tom. Kids these days.
-Hmm.

97
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,640
They didn't fight.

98
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,520
So they're different.

99
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,640
They stay kids.

100
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
How was it?

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,400
I was starving,
so I would have eaten anything.

102
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,880
But really it was super.

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,840
Super.

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,680
So, uh, are you a cook?

105
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,760
Not a cook. No.

106
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,720
The man who came to the house,

107
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,560
he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.

108
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,760
What does he do?

109
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,000
-He works with horses.
-Really?

110
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
I love horses.

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,120
-I've got a bay mare.
-No!

112
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,120
I ride it all the time.

113
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Then it's in the blood.

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
I've got about a million questions.

115
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,520
So do I.

116
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,560
I've had different pictures in my head.

117
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,560
Well, here I am.

118
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,400
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?

119
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,040
I don't have any choice.

120
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,600
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?

121
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,360
We don't choose.

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,280
And that's it.

123
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,520
Yeah, that's right.

124
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,760
God gave you to me.

125
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
People took you away.

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,200
And it is all right
that it's me, isn't it?

127
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,400
In a place like this.

128
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I thought it would be worse.

129
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
(CHUCKLING)

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,840
ARTHUR: Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!

131
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,160
Get out of town, kid,
or I will shoot your fucking head off!

132
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Time's up! (MIMICS GUNSHOT)

133
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,920
- You're dead, go down.
- John!

134
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
All right then, Polly.

135
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,280
Who's this?

136
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,480
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.

137
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,280
Polly's son, Michael.

138
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,160
Pleased to meet you.

139
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
John.

140
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,160
I'm Arthur. You've already met me.

141
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,320
I used to throw you out of the window,
so John could catch you.

142
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,200
I used to put you in a shoebox
and kick you down Watery Lane.

143
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,440
I bet you're glad to be back.

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,360
I don't remember any of it.

145
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
All I remember is the day
they took me away.

146
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,120
Well, you're here now, son.

147
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,160
Welcome to the Shelby family.

148
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,840
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Hmm. Yeah, we'll show you what's what.

150
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,360
Let's leave him be for now, eh?

151
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,360
Come on, boys.

152
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,480
-Nice suit.
-(POLLY CHUCKLING)

153
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,240
They seem nice.

154
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,040
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.

155
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,920
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.

156
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
How are you feeling?

157
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,520
I've just come out of bandages myself.

158
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,680
Ready for active service.

159
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,320
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.

160
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,480
It's all right, Bill.

161
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,680
You don't have to stand in line for us.

162
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,960
It's men like you
we're looking for, Billy.

163
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,920
But you have to pass the medical first.

164
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,040
Sheffield mob showed up
at Wincanton trotting track.

165
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
I took a bullet.

166
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,920
When do the bandages come off?

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,760
When I take 'em off.

168
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,120
One week. Not before.

169
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,840
You'll smell no rot.

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
There's no gangrene.

171
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,040
It's been a long time. Eh, Billy?

172
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,880
What did you do with your medals?

173
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,600
Threw them in the cut. Same as you.

174
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,040
It was never a hardship having you
Black Country boys on our left flank.

175
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,480
And you Brummies did all right
on our right.

176
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,920
Damn right.

177
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
I want you to be the head
of a brigade, Bill.

178
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,520
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.

179
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,320
You'll have 100 men under your command.

180
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,800
And now we've got a member of
the Kitchen family on the payroll,

181
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,040
maybe your cousins and brothers will let
our boats pass through the Black Country

182
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,840
without being held up and robbed.

183
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

184
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,320
Go home, Bill.

185
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,520
Round up any good men you can trust
and put the word out.

186
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,720
Black Country boys and Brummie boys
are on the same side again.

187
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,080
That'll be the bloody day.

188
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,360
Well, this is the bloody day.

189
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,400
London, man. There for the taking.

190
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.

191
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,080
Polly said you had one in the pub.

192
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,880
All right, be quick. I have business.

193
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Sir.

194
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,720
Polly said you own this place.

195
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
She said you own lots
of different businesses.

196
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
You call her Polly or Mum?

197
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,560
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.

198
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,400
(TOMMY SIGHING)

199
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,560
Who are you calling?

200
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,920
My mother. I mean...

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,800
I know what you mean.

202
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,480
And what are you going to tell her?

203
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,200
I'm going to tell her where I am.

204
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,040
And now you're going to tell her
you're going home.

205
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,160
Polly said I could stay for a few days.

206
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,080
-You want to stay?
-I've only just arrived.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,480
What age are you Michael?

208
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,640
Seventeen.

209
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,000
Seventeen. Which means
it's not up to you, right?

210
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,680
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.

211
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
You smoke?

212
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,880
No.

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Drink?

214
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
You're going to call your mother,

215
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,400
going to tell her you're getting
the next train home.

216
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,640
And when you get there,

217
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,600
you're going to write a letter to Polly
saying when you're 18,

218
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,160
you'll come back here
and sort things out.

219
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,840
I just told you.

220
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,120
I make up my own mind.

221
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,920
Do you know what we do, Michael?

222
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,840
We, Shelbys.

223
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,840
Yes. I think I know what you do.

224
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Yeah.

225
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,280
You've got smart eyes.

226
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,880
But you're young, so you think
what we do is all right.

227
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,400
It's not all right.

228
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,080
People get hurt.

229
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,680
Now, call your mother
and I will drive you to the station.

230
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
No.

231
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,560
In my village,

232
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,760
there's this little wishing well.

233
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,680
It's made of white bricks, right
in the middle of the village green.

234
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,880
Everybody says how pretty it is.

235
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,280
But I swear to God,

236
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,880
if I spend another day in that village,

237
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,920
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.

238
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Probably blow my hands off with it,
but it'd be worth it.

239
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,400
Just to see
all those pretty white bricks

240
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,080
spread over the pretty village green.

241
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,640
Hmm.

242
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,320
Yep. You're Polly's son, all right.

243
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,880
All right boys, let's go to work.

244
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,720
Let's be having it!

245
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,920
Don't wait!

246
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,320
Keep it moving.

247
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,160
Move!

248
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
Next lad!

249
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
Name?

250
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,920
Abbey Heath.

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,160
Abbey Heath. Profession?

252
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Baker.

253
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,720
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

254
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,800
Next lad!

255
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Name?

256
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,920
Buddy Halls.

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
Buddy Halls. Right. Profession?

258
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Baker.

259
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,480
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

260
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,400
Next lad!

261
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,040
-Name?
-Billy Kitchen.

262
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
Billy Kitchen. Occupation?

263
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,040
Head baker.

264
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,400
Fill it out.

265
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,400
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.

266
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,280
Never give power to the big man,
what did I tell you?

267
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,400
Hmm?

268
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,160
Never give power to the big man.

269
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Next lad!

270
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Name?

271
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,640
All right, boys, you've now
all been enrolled as bakers

272
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,440
in the Aerated Bread Company
of Camden Town.

273
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,760
If anyone asks, that's what you do.

274
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,320
You're bakers.

275
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,880
The coppers in Camden Town
are on our side,

276
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,880
but north or south,
you show them that piece of paper.

277
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,240
Tell them you've come down from
north to find work, to break strikes.

278
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,560
Tell them you're fascists,
if you have to.

279
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,720
We're finding lodgings for you, but
for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.

280
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
But don't touch any of the bread,
it'll most likely explode.

281
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,520
Any questions?

282
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Yes?

283
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,560
I haven't even seen any bread.

284
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,080
(EVERYONE LAUGHING)

285
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,720
(CLEARING THROAT)

286
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,400
He'll wake up.

287
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,520
Granted, he won't have any teeth left,
but he will be a wiser man for it.

288
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,680
And the last thing he will remember
is your funny little joke. Won't he?

289
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,160
Right!

290
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,600
There are fucking rules here.

291
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah, there are fucking rules
for a fucking reason.

292
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,680
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?

293
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,360
Rule number one.

294
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,480
The distinction between bread and rum,
yeah, is not discussed.

295
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,080
Rule number two.

296
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,680
Anything, right,
that your superior officer

297
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,840
says to you or any of your other fucking
superior officers say to you, yeah?

298
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,280
Not discussed!

299
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,080
Rule number three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, I don't care.

300
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,160
For the rest of your fucking
miserable measly lives, yeah?

301
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Because I, like you,

302
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,840
am also a complete fucking sodomite.

303
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,720
Jewish women.

304
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,880
You do not go anywhere near them

305
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,480
because Jewish women for you
are off the fucking menu.

306
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,040
I think that's fair.

307
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,640
Hmm.

308
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,600
Hmm.

309
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,760
All right, that's it, yeah.

310
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
Forgive me, I interrupted you.

311
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,320
Pick him up.

312
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,520
Get them out of here
and make this fucking work.

313
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,760
Don't fucking wait!

314
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,600
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!

315
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,720
You're a fucking disgrace!

316
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,240
Go!

317
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,360
(CHUCKLING)

318
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
You've got a key?

319
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,920
I kept a spare.

320
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Give it to me.

321
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,480
Could do with some paint, eh?

322
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,680
Yeah, when I decide.

323
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,840
What is it that you want, Tommy?

324
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,000
Just came by to say hello.

325
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Tommy Shelby never goes
anywhere for no reason.

326
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,360
(SIGHING) Fine.

327
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,880
I've got 800 pounds left
in the Shelby property fund,

328
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,760
and I need someone down here
to look for suitable properties.

329
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
To rent?

330
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Yes.

331
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,240
To poor people.

332
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,760
Ten to a room.

333
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,880
No repairs, no water.

334
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,800
And if they complain, you just send
Arthur and the boys round.

335
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,920
You know, I give advice
down at the library.

336
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,320
Families thrown on the street.

337
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,560
It's men like you we're fighting.

338
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,560
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.

339
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Tommy.

340
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,440
There are always men outside
watching the house.

341
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,080
Yeah. Gangsters of the worst kind.

342
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
But they're there to keep you safe.

343
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,480
No there are others.
They look like coppers.

344
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,280
Well, they're on your side as well.

345
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't have a fucking side.

346
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,120
Ada, yes, you do.

347
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,440
And, anyway, if I thought there
was no-one watching the house,

348
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,160
I couldn't sleep.

349
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,000
(SIGHING) Cheerio then.

350
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,000
POLLY: That was great. Well done.

351
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,680
Out we get then.

352
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,080
This house is mine.

353
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,080
I've taken on a maid.

354
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,040
She's made up the big room for you.

355
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,280
Come on, let's have a look.

356
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,240
I thought we could spend the week here.

357
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,760
You know, get to know each other again.

358
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,440
I've got ham. Do you like ham?

359
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,760
I like ham, yes.

360
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,720
-I've got a maid...
-Yes, you said.

361
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,080
She's upstairs.

362
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,360
She can give us some tea.

363
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Look, I ring this bell. Watch.

364
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,720
(BELL RINGING)

365
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Yes, madam?

366
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,440
I think we'd like some tea.

367
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,200
You get used to it.

368
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,240
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.

369
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm not a cleaner.

370
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,960
But I have come to clean away some dirt.

371
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,240
Why don't you put that away
before it goes off?

372
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,480
You killed my son!

373
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,160
You Peaky bastard!

374
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,280
You beat him

375
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,080
and beat him and beat him.

376
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,680
Your son was a boxer.

377
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,240
No!

378
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,200
He was a boy

379
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,720
who got into a ring with an animal.

380
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

381
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,280
I've come to stop you

382
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,200
because the coppers
and nobody else will.

383
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,760
If you're going to use it,

384
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,000
point that thing at my head.

385
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,280
That's where the trouble is.

386
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,040
Gut-shot soldiers take
half a day to die.

387
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,960
I've seen 'em.

388
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,520
Walking around with their guts
in their arms like dirty washing.

389
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,680
Hold that gun up and do it!

390
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,520
Fucking do it!

391
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,520
Do it!

392
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,160
I'm going to finish my drink.

393
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,520
You can finish it with me, if you like.

394
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,800
(GUNSHOT FIRING)

395
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,960
(CRYING)

396
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,000
Now, look. Look at me.

397
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,320
We've got a fund.

398
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,800
For you. You'll get paid weekly.

399
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,640
I know it won't bring back your son.

400
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,880
I know that.

401
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,480
You have other sons.

402
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,400
You do.

403
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
And we'll find them work.

404
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
And you won't have to work.

405
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,560
-You'll be...
-(SCREAMING)

406
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,920
(CRYING) Somebody has got
to stop you people.

407
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,720
Who broke the fucking mirror?

408
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,440
Seven years' bad luck, that is.

409
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,120
TOMMY: There'll be another
four boatloads tomorrow.

410
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,600
What's up, Charlie? Business is good.

411
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,440
This isn't business,
this is bloody work.

412
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,520
Cigarettes and booze is all right,
but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.

413
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,480
I'm not even sure it's stolen.

414
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,720
Some of it is legally purchased.

415
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,520
One day, all of it will be.

416
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,400
It's like having a fucking job.

417
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,040
Hey! Easy with them fan belts.

418
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,080
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.

419
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Done.

420
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,320
You don't even fight me any more.

421
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,760
And it's no sport getting through
the Black Country with this truce.

422
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,880
They just fucking wave
at you from the bank.

423
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,200
Well, just wave back, eh?

424
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,920
And all these fucking cars.

425
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,520
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?

426
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,720
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-Uh.

427
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,720
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.

428
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,240
Major Campbell.

429
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
Beg pardon?

430
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,360
It doesn't matter.

431
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,880
Are there any other Irishmen
lodging in this house?

432
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,000
No, Mr Campbell,
I keep a respectable house.

433
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,760
With your special exception,
I have no Irish here.

434
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,240
Well, let me know
if any come enquiring after rooms.

435
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,880
Even if you turn them away,
let me know, would you?

436
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,600
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.

437
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,800
They only said you was
a policeman of some sort.

438
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,600
No. I'm not expecting any trouble.

439
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,920
Is there a cafe nearby that
serves chops? Lamb or pork?

440
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,200
There is a chophouse two streets away.

441
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,000
But I myself serve sandwiches.

442
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,240
Egg and cress, or ham.

443
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,880
Or anything that pleases you.

444
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,160
No. No. No.

445
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,560
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.

446
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,000
Our scheduled meeting
is not until Sunday.

447
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,560
I decided to bring it forward.
(CLEARS THROAT)

448
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,840
You just wanted to show me that
you know where I live, isn't that it?

449
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,160
Am I supposed to be impressed?

450
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,520
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.

451
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,880
Yes, he was.

452
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,400
All my demands have been met.

453
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,200
Did he tell you?

454
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Yes.

455
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Yes. We had a meeting
and your letter was read aloud.

456
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
As a matter of fact, there was quite
a lot of hilarity at the meeting.

457
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,880
-The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
-(CHUCKLES)

458
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,480
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.

459
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,600
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the
gentlemen sometimes find you funny?

460
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,240
We will discuss our business on Sunday,

461
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,200
on the agreed day, at the allotted time,

462
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,480
and at the place that has
already been determined.

463
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,920
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.

464
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,200
(CLEARS THROAT) There was another reason
I came to see you tonight.

465
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,600
I just didn't want you
to be made a fool of, is all.

466
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,920
The lodgings chosen for you
by the police department,

467
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,720
how shall I put this?

468
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,640
Well, your landlady used to run the most
famous whorehouse in Stechford.

469
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,520
She's only semi-retired.

470
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,640
I bet the gentlemen
would find that funny, eh?

471
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,720
Told to you in the spirit
of friendship and co-operation.

472
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,120
See you Sunday!

473
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,760
-Name?
-Digbeth Kid.

474
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,920
Your real name.

475
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,600
Harold Hancox.

476
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,120
Profession?

477
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,320
Illegal bookmaker.

478
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,160
You don't admit that.

479
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
You say something like,
"Umbrella mender".

480
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,840
And then we decide you're lying
and then we arrest you.

481
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,760
Umbrella mender.

482
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,000
You were found
in possession of betting slips,

483
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,760
race cards and ticker tape.

484
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,080
Any explanation?

485
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
No.

486
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
No.

487
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,160
"No.

488
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,800
"I have no explanation

489
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,680
"for my possession
of those items, officer."

490
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.

491
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,240
Come on, son.

492
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,600
Bloody hellfire.

493
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,720
You've killed him, huh?

494
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,280
As I've explained,
he's not easy to get at.

495
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,440
He's got an army round him.

496
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,520
But when the time is right...

497
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,840
The time is right. It's right now.

498
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,680
When he's away from
his familiar territory, I will take him.

499
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,720
-So what do you want?
-We heard from a guard

500
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,720
at Winson Green prison that one of
their bookies has just been put inside.

501
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,040
Kid called Harold Hancox.

502
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,880
We could make a point.

503
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,000
How many bakers is there
in Camden Town now?

504
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,000
There are a lot of bakers
in Camden Town, Mr Sabini,

505
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,720
but, as I have said, we don't as yet
have a definite number.

506
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,760
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?

507
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,280
-Ragman.
-(DARBY SNIFFS)

508
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,200
-Where's my dry cleaning?
-It's been collected.

509
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,080
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?

510
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,240
-What? You don't know?
-I can find out.

511
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,960
No need. I know already.

512
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,920
You see, the favourites,
they're all winning.

513
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,760
And the second favourites
are being done.

514
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,400
He's bewitching them.

515
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,520
Bewitching?

516
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,120
Gypsy stuff. Herbs, potions.

517
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,120
And he's tipping off our big punters,
so they know who's going to win.

518
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,000
Regular customers
betraying us for profit.

519
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,960
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,

520
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,600
comes before race, creed, family.

521
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,040
Results look normal to me.

522
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,760
You see shit!

523
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Mr Sabini, if you think they're
planning to fix Northern races,

524
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,360
we'll take no more bets
on anything north of Towcester.

525
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,040
-I gave you a job already.
-And the job will be done.

526
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,440
-But meantime...
-Meantime, fuck!

527
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,080
Meantime, what do you want us
to do about the kid

528
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,480
in the cage in Birmingham?

529
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,920
Why would you want me
to say that out loud?

530
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,600
Is there somebody listening?

531
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,600
(HOARSELY) All right, I'll say it.

532
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,560
We'll kill the Hancox kid
to send a message.

533
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,760
Good, and then you deal
with Tommy fucking Shelby.

534
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,720
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

535
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,760
You wanted to see me?

536
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,600
Aye.

537
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,280
Take off your clothes.

538
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,200
I know what you are.

539
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,880
So, take off your clothes.

540
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,800
Not done in a very
gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.

541
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,760
Indeed not.

542
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,880
So it's true. Stop.

543
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,240
I only wanted proof. Not satisfaction.

544
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
Or indeed infection.

545
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,080
Are you in on the joke?

546
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,280
What joke?

547
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,120
I have unfinished business
in this filthy city.

548
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,280
And when the time comes,
I will finish that business.

549
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,160
And then my wrath will
come down on all of yo use.

550
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,480
-(GASPS)
-But now,

551
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,520
tell your friends in the police station

552
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,800
that I know.

553
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,040
And when my judgement comes,

554
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,640
I'll be the one that's laughing.

555
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Get out.

556
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,520
(LOUD THUDDING)

557
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,200
On the right. On the right.

558
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,000
We haven't got all night. Come on!

559
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,560
Let's be having you, Watkins,
in there on the right.

560
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,760
On the right! Come on, boys!

561
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,960
Harold Hancox?

562
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,400
(GRUNTING)

563
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,520
Tell everybody,

564
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,800
this is what happens to Blinders
who come into the Green from now on.

565
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,240
Orders of Sabini.

566
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,160
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder. I've been stood up.

567
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,440
I'm not real! I'm not real!

568
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,880
I'm not real!

569
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,960
This had better be good
to interrupt my holiday.

570
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,200
Where's the boy?

571
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
In the back room.

572
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,560
I only brought him because afterwards
we're going to the museum.

573
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,200
-He wanted to come in and say hello...
-Shut up, John.

574
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,880
There is nothing of interest
to Michael in this room.

575
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,000
Tommy, get on with it.

576
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,480
Last night, one of our men
had his throat cut in Winson Green.

577
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,120
This morning, I had a telegram
saying it was Sabini who ordered it.

578
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,040
And it says here that
Thomas Shelby's next.

579
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,080
If our men think we can't
look after them in prison,

580
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,240
they'll not work for us.

581
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,000
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.

582
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,400
Scudboat, you and one of the boys

583
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,000
break a couple of windows,
get yourselves arrested.

584
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,960
I'll have our coppers
get you into the Green

585
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,840
and you can find
the bastards who did it.

586
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,000
Instead of breaking a window,
can we pinch a car?

587
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,320
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.

588
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,000
-I'm still on a donkey.
-(CHUCKLING)

589
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,080
All right, just get yourselves
fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.

590
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,640
And before you all laugh,

591
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,600
a boy is dead.

592
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,920
He was just a kid.

593
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,520
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.

594
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,800
Agreed.

595
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,440
So is that it? Can I go now?

596
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,760
Well, as company treasurer,

597
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,840
I need your permission
to spend 1,000 guineas.

598
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
On what?

599
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,560
On a horse.

600
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,760
A thousand guineas on a horse?

601
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
That's right.

602
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,280
When was this decided?

603
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,440
You've been busy with Michael.

604
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,920
Oh, my God.

605
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,000
So, in the absence of common sense,
you boys have had an idea.

606
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,480
Polly, there's a thoroughbred,
quarter-Arab filly

607
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,480
up for auction
at the Doncaster Bloodstock.

608
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,440
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

609
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,560
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches,

610
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,400
any men we get into
the betting enclosure

611
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,440
will be lifted by Sabini's police.

612
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,200
A good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.

613
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,880
We'll be in there with all the toffs.

614
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,320
-Coppers won't know where to look.
-Hmm.

615
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,080
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.

616
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,800
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.

617
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
The Derby?

618
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,760
Did he say the Derby?

619
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,760
That's right. (CLEARS THROAT)

620
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,640
For the last 10 years,
Sabini's made it his race.

621
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,760
If we're going to take him down, might
as well make it there, as a symbol.

622
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,920
Did you come up with this idea
in a pub by any chance?

623
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,080
Pol.

624
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,720
A good racehorse is an investment,
like property.

625
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,280
We need to diversify the portfolio.

626
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,280
So when is this sale?

627
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,480
Tomorrow.

628
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,800
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll
have to go with him for protection.

629
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,640
POLLY: So, you're going to close up
the shop, go out on a piss-up

630
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,440
and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse
that's not even whole Arab.

631
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,160
CURLY: (LAUGHING)
Quarter-Arab is better!

632
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,200
-Quarter-Arab, it means...
-Curly, shut up.

633
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,760
I thought I told you to lock that door.

634
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,200
He did. I used the key on the nail.

635
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,600
Look, I've been listening.

636
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,840
-I want to go with them.
-You see?

637
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,720
I love horses. I could even help.

638
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,880
Over my dead body!

639
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,800
It'll be all right, Mum.

640
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,600
I've been to loads of horse auctions
before with my uncle.

641
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,800
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.

642
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,000
Yeah, and their posh wives!

643
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,360
And their mistresses.

644
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,440
ARTHUR: Let him come, Polly.

645
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,320
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.

646
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,880
I'll drop him back at the house
in Sutton before it gets dark.

647
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,920
No.

648
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,680
Fucking no!

649
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,760
All right, that's it. Back to work.

650
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,080
Come on!

651
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,360
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,

652
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,080
I'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.

653
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,120
If you want to scare
that kid away forever,

654
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,440
carry on how you're going.

655
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
If you want him to stay,

656
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,040
let him come.

657
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,480
MICHAEL: I can't believe it.

658
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,320
All John's old things fit me.

659
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,040
Christ, you look like your father.

660
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,680
Shrimp, ham.

661
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,720
What was he like? My dad?

662
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,440
How did he die?

663
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,280
Well, I won't lie to you.

664
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,680
He died drunk,
squeezed between a boat and a lock.

665
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,120
A real river gypsy's death.

666
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,600
But he could sing,

667
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,320
play the piano...

668
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,680
His smile would break your heart.

669
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,040
You've got his same beautiful eyes.

670
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,360
When he was sober,
he was kind and gentle.

671
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,280
His trouble was,

672
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,440
he fell in with the wrong crowd
when he was a boy.

673
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,280
(CAR HORN HONKING)

674
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,680
I have told them not to blow that horn.

675
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,120

fucking neighbourhood!

-(HISSING)
-(ENGINE DYING)

677
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,720
-She's heating up, Curly. Take a look.
-Yeah.

678
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,800
Let me out for a piss.

679
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,440
She made loads. Do you want one?

680
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,680
What the bloody hell's that?

681
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,360
Sandwiches. Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.

682
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,880
There's tea, but we'll have to
take turns 'cause there's only one cup.

683
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,640
What?

684
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,280
Sandwiches?

685
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,240
-Yeah.
-Polly made bloody sandwiches?

686
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,920
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?

687
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,400
(CLEARS THROAT) All right. We will drink
the tea and we will eat the sandwiches

688
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,480
and then we will drive on. All right?

689
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,120
No crumbs, Charlie.

690
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,000
-Hand them over.
-Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.

691
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,080
-Fuck off.
-John, come on!

692
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,960
TOMMY: All right, lads,
this is a respectable event

693
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,440
and we will all behave accordingly.

694
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,880
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.

695
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,560
When the horse comes up,
I will do the bidding.

696
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,440
I've already registered my interest
with the auctioneer.

697
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,800
So he knows to expect my bids.

698
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,080
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?

699
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,760
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.

700
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,120
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.

701
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,080
It's all right, Curly. You're just
in an unfamiliar place, we all are.

702
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,640
-I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
-It's all right, Curly. It's all right.

703
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,560
ARTHUR: Shut up, Curly.

Why do people come late to these things?

709
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,520
Hmm?

710
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,280
People come late
'cause they know what they want.

711
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,520
It's only you who needs
to see every horse.

Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud,
by Tetrarch out of Lady Josephine.

716
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,080
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.

717
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,720
All right, Tommy, this is her.

718
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,840
Do I hear 800 guineas?

719
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
850?

720
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,280
850. Do I hear nine?

721
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,160
Do I hear nine? Nine, am I bid?

722
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,840
Bid for this one.

723
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,400
The grey? Why?

724
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,120
-He's beautiful.
-It's a filly.

725
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,440
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.

726
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,320
1,000. Do I hear 1,050?

727
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,280

728

250.

731
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,160
I'll go halves with you
from the spring fund. Go, go.

00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,320
Do I hear seven?

738
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,720
1,700. Thank you.

739
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,160
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.

740
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,360
You don't have it in your belt.

741
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,760
Yes, I do. I'm having the horse.

742
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,080
CURLY: She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.

-I feel something bad!
-Shut up, Curly!

745
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,000

-2,050...
-Enough!

747
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,560
Billy could use one of my geldings.

748

750
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,440

-What kind of premises?
-Boat yard.

758
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,080
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?

759
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,680
Import, export.

760
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,240
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.

761

You beat us to it.

Did I?

763
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,960
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.

00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,000
-Sorry.
-Thomas Shelby from where?

765
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,560
From Birmingham.

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,160
No, not much.

May Car let on.
I breed racehorses and train them.

770
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,400

We've got to go!

Well, before you go, if you ever
decide to put that filly out,

773
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,200
-I'd be interested in having her.
-I plan to race her.

00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,400
-Do you have a trainer?
-I know people.

-I know people, too.

She will have 'em!

We know different people, I would guess.

-Trained three Ascot winners.
-Oh, so that was your father?

Yes.

when my husband was killed.

I will consider you.

00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,360
-Tommy!
-(GUNSHOT)

806
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,280
-Tommy! Down!
-(GUNSHOT)

807
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,920
Tommy Shelby?

808
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,560
How about fucking Arthur?

809
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,440
Fucking good to meet you.

810
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,040
Get him off him!

811
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,440
Arthur! Arthur!

812
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,280
Get him off him!

813
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,080
Come on. Stop it, Arthur.

814
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,280
Get him off.

815
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,200
Arthur, that's enough.

816
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,400
Arthur, come on!

817
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,280
Come on, Arthur, come on.

818
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,000
That's it. It's over.

819
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,880
Arthur!

820
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,600
Come on, shut up.

821
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,720
Come on, come on.

822
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
He's still breathing.

823
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,040
Don't get blood on the kid!

824
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,360
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?

825
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,360
Give me the keys.

826
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,000
Michael, give me the keys.

827
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm all right to drive.

828
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,760
All right. Go on. Go on, go on!

829
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,800
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!

830
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,840
-Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
-Come on!

831
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,520
(DOOR OPENING)

832
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,720
(DOOR CLOSING)

833
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,680
So?

834
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,080
How'd it go?

835
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,440
Well, it was cold in the van,

836
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,520
but it was super. Really.

837
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,920
Let me smell your breath.

838
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,280
(EXHALES)

839
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,880
Did they behave themselves?

840
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,040
They were amazing, Mum.

841
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,840
They were really amazing.
