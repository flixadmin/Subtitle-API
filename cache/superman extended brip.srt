00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,070
In the decade of the 1930s
even the great city of Metropolis...

5
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,240
...was not spared the ravages
of the worldwide depression.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,450
In the times of fear and confusion...

7
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,450
...the job of informing the public
was the responsibility...

8
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,950
...of the Daily Planet.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,290
A great metropolitan newspaper...

10
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,500
...whose reputation for clarity and truth
had become a symbol of hope...

11
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,840
...for the city of Metropolis.

12
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,300
This is no fantasy.

13
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,550
No careless product of wild imagination.

14
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,220
No, my good friends...

15
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,980
...these indictments...

16
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,650
...I've brought you today...

17
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,690
...specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

18
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,530
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.

19
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,830
These...

20
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,830
...are matters of undeniable fact.

21
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,340
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

22
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,170
...on those accused.

23
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,140
On this...

24
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,940
...this mindless aberration...

25
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,230
...whose only means of expression
are wanton violence and destruction.

26
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,990
On the woman, Ursa...

27
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,820
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

28
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,410
...have threatened even the children
of the Planet Krypton.

29
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,300
Finally, General Zod.

30
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,760
Once trusted by this Council...

31
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,680
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the Planet Krypton itself.

32
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,270
Chief Architect of this intended revolution
and author of this insidious plot...

33
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,600
...to establish a new order amongst us...

34
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,980
...with himself as absolute ruler.

35
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,200
You have heard the evidence.

36
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,120
The decision of the Council
will now be heard.

37
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Guilty!

38
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,250
Guilty!

39
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,830
Guilty!

40
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,130
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

41
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,470
It has therefore now become your decision.

42
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,050
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

43
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,970
...and you alone will be held responsible
by me!

44
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
Join us!

45
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,070
You have been known to disagree
with the Council before.

46
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,950
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order, second only to my own!

47
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,240
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!

48
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,620
Take it! Join us!

49
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,710
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

50
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,300
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!

51
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,380
You will bow down before me!

52
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,140
Both you and then one day...

53
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,550
...your heirs!

54
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Forgive me, forgive me...

55
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,340
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-El.

56
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,510
They have received the fate they deserved.

57
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,550
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...

58
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,760
...an eternal living death.

59
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,930
A chance for life, nonetheless.

60
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,480
As opposed to us.

61
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,020
It's suicide.

62
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,360
No, it's worse, it's genocide.

63
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,400
Be warned, Jor-El.

64
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,860
The Council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

65
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,580
My friends, you know me
to be neither rash nor impulsive.

66
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,790
I am not given
to wild unsupported statements...

67
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,170
...and I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

68
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,470
Jor-El, you are one
of Krypton's greatest scientists.

69
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,510
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

70
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,390
I don't question your data.

71
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,560
The facts are undeniable.

72
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,860
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

73
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,910
This planet will explode within 30 days.

74
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
If not sooner.

75
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,490
I tell you Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

76
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,370
Jor-El...

77
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,250
...be reasonable.

78
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,710
My friend...

79
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,630
...I have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.

80
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,680
This discussion is terminated.

81
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,800
The decision of the Council is final.

82
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,620
Any attempt by you to create...

83
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,460
...a climate of fear and panic
among the populace...

84
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,290
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

85
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,090
You would accuse me of insurrection?

86
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,840
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?

87
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,100
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

88
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,140
...in the Phantom Zone:

89
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,020
The eternal void...

90
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,190
...which you, yourself discovered.

91
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,690
Will you abide by the Council's decision?

92
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,780
I will remain silent.

93
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,660
Neither I, nor my wife...

94
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,290
...will leave Krypton.

95
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,550
Have you finished?

96
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,890
Nearly.

97
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,230
It's the only answer, Lara.

98
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,150
If he remains here with us...

99
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,650
...he will die as surely as we will.

100
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,240
But why Earth, Jor-El?

101
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,950
They're primitives,
thousands of years behind us.

102
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,660
He will need that advantage to survive.

103
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,750
Their atmosphere will...

104
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,540
...sustain him.

105
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,590
He will defy their gravity.

106
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,720
He will look like one of them.

107
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,600
He won't be one of them.

108
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,270
No.

109
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,190
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

110
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,440
He'll be odd. Different.

111
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,740
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

112
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,040
Isolated. Alone.

113
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,750
He will not be alone.

114
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,670
He will never be alone.

115
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,400
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters
is now in excess.

116
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,820
Our data indicates the loss
is due to a misuse of energy.

117
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,860
Investigate.

118
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,990
And if the investigation proves correct?

119
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,990
He knew the penalty he faced.

120
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,540
He even is a member of this Council.

121
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,880
The law will be upheld.

122
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,250
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

123
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,300
But we will never leave you.

124
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
Even in the face of our death...

125
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,890
...the richness of our lives...

126
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,230
...shall be yours.

127
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,940
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

128
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,070
...all this and more, I...

129
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,150
...I bequeath you, my son.

130
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,790
You will carry me inside you...

131
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,080
...all the days of your life.

132
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,960
You will make my strength your own...

133
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,340
...see my life through your eyes...

134
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,420
...as your life will be seen through mine.

135
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,140
The son becomes the father,
and the father...

136
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,560
...the son.

137
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,730
This is all I...

138
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,440
...all I can send you, Kal-El.

139
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,330
...which Einstein called his theory
of relativity.

140
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,210
Embedded in the crystals before you...

141
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,590
...is the total
accumulation of all

142
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,800
literature and scientific
fact from dozens...

143
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,090
...of other worlds...

144
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,510
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.

145
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Early Chinese writings point out
the complex relationship...

146
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,830
By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son...

147
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,550
Chief among these powers
will be your sight...

148
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,590
...your strength, your hearing...

149
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,300
...your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.

150
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,310
The early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.

151
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,600
Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...

152
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,690
...contain their own individual law
of space and time.

153
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,030
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

154
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,850
- What!
- What was that?

155
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,210
Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you...

156
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,220
Oh, Pa!

157
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
Oh, my.

158
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,800
All these years, as happy as we've been...

159
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,560
...how I've prayed the good Lord
would see fit to give us a child.

160
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,310
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.

161
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,190
You take things easy now.

162
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,150
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

163
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,200
Now the first thing we've got to do
when we get home is find out...

164
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,750
...who that boy's proper family is.

165
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,500
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

166
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,380
Are you thinking
what I think you are thinking?

167
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,260
We could say he's the child of my cousin
in North Dakota...

168
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,560
...and just now orphaned.

169
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,350
Jonathan, he's only a baby.

170
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,110
Martha, now you saw how we found him.

171
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,280
Martha Clark Kent,
are you listening to what I'm saying?

172
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,730
Come on, gang.

173
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,530
That was a great game.

174
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,820
All right.

175
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,200
Come on, hustle, let's go.
Stack your helmets neatly.

176
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,120
Remember about the uniforms,
cleaned and washed...

177
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,750
...by tomorrow,
and looking like a football team.

178
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,460
Let's have those clothes washed and ready
for tomorrow's game.

179
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,000
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.

180
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,050
Can you give me a lift?

181
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Lana?

182
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,680
Don't bother with these.
I'll take them in with the other equipment.

183
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,230
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

184
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,270
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up
to Mary Ellen's.

185
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,860
Play some records.
Would you like to come?

186
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,780
Sure.

187
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,910
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

188
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,790
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

189
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,040
What are you talking about?
I've just finished stacking...

190
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,210
All that?

191
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,380
Oh, Brad!

192
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,920
Hey, come on, Lana.

193
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,550
Come on, let's go.

194
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,260
- He has to clean up.
- 'Bye, Clark.

195
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,390
- 'Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

196
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,220
'Bye, Clark.

197
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,560
'Bye, Clark.

198
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,230
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

199
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,930
Golly! I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

200
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,480
Faster, even!

201
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,850
Lois Lane,
you have a writer's gift for invention.

202
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,940
- I'll say that for you.
- But...

203
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,400
Lois, please read your book.

204
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,860
No one ever believes me.

205
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,810
Hey, look, there's Clark!

206
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Clark?

207
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,530
How did you get here so fast?

208
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,650
I ran.

209
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,070
Ran, huh?

210
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,240
Told you he was an oddball,
let's get out of here.

211
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,500
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?

212
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,220
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

213
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,690
It's just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

214
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Yeah, I know.

215
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,240
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.

216
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,160
Yeah, I know you can do
all these amazing things...

217
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,990
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

218
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,040
...unless you can tell people about it.

219
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,410
- Yeah.
- That's right.

220
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,460
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.

221
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,380
- That's for sure.
- Every time.

222
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,250
Is it showing off when somebody's doing
the things he's capable of doing?

223
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,340
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

224
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,130
No, now, you listen to me.

225
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,840
When you came to us, we thought...

226
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,890
...people would take you away...

227
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,720
...when they found out
the things that you do.

228
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,770
It worried us a lot.

229
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,270
Then when a man gets older
and he thinks very differently.

230
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,570
And things get very clear.

231
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,650
And there's one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

232
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,030
I don't know whose reason,
or whatever the reason is...

233
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,700
...maybe it's because...

234
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,960
I don't know.

235
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,750
But I do know one thing.
It's not to score touchdowns.

236
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,510
Thanks, Dad.

237
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,890
I'll race you to it. Yeah.

238
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,140
You will?

239
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,390
Run. Come on, come on. Move, move.

240
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,440
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.

241
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,340
Jonathan!

242
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Dad.

243
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,200
All those things I can do...

244
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,910
...all those powers...

245
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,120
...and I couldn't even save him.

246
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,090
Clark, get up.

247
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,350
Good morning, Smiley.

248
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,770
Clark, breakfast.

249
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,780
Are you going to sleep all day?

250
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,910
Clark, come on. Get up.

251
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,180
I have to leave.

252
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,640
I knew this time would come.

253
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,600
We both knew it
from the day we found you.

254
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,580
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

255
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,750
He said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

256
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,050
Mother!

257
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,640
I know, Son.

258
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,220
I know.

259
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,400
Do you know where you're headed?

260
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,030
North.

261
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,200
Remember us, Son.

262
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,040
Always remember us.

263
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,130
My son...

264
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,220
...you do not remember me.

265
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,930
I am Jor-El.

266
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,020
I am your father.

267
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,190
By now you will have reached
your eighteenth year...

268
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,610
...as it is measured on Earth.

269
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,200
By that reckoning...

270
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,320
...I will have been dead
for many thousands of your years.

271
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,120
The knowledge...

272
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,580
...that I have of matters,
physical and historical...

273
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,290
...I have given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.

274
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,670
These are important matters to be sure...

275
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,760
...but still matters of mere fact.

276
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,300
There are questions to be asked...

277
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,060
...and it is time for you to do so.

278
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,230
Here, in this...

279
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,230
...this fortress of solitude...

280
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,400
...we shall try to find
the answers together.

281
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,490
So, my son...

282
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:27,950
...speak.

283
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,790
Who am I?

284
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,290
Your name is Kal-El.

285
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,040
You are the only survivor
of the Planet Krypton.

286
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,010
Even though you were raised
as a human, you are not one of them.

287
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,010
You have great powers,
only some of which you have...

288
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,020
...as yet discovered.

289
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,600
Come with me now, my son...

290
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,610
...as we break through the bars
of your earthly confinement.

291
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,860
Traveling through time and space.

292
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,160
Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.

293
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,030
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

294
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,330
Rather let your leadership stir others to.

295
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,170
In the next year,
we shall examine the human heart.

296
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,380
It is more fragile than your own.

297
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,550
As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...

298
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,800
...we will enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...

299
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,220
...source of your strength
and nourishment...

300
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,810
...and cause of our eventual destruction.

301
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,770
The Planet Krypton, my son...

302
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,860
...your home as it was.

303
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,740
This year we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...

304
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,160
...and their basis in actual fact.

305
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:55,460
The total accumulation of all knowledge
spanning the 28 known galaxies...

306
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,130
...is embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.

307
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,170
Study them well, my son.

308
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,880
By the time you return to the confines
of your galaxy...

309
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,550
...twelve of your years will have passed.

310
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,930
For this reason, among others...

311
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,060
...I have chosen Earth for you.

312
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,100
It is now time for you to rejoin
your new world...

313
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,270
...and to serve its collective humanity.

314
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,780
Live as one of them, Kal-El...

315
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,740
...and discover where your strength
and your power are needed.

316
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:34,700
But always hold in your heart the pride
of your special heritage.

317
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,790
They can be a great people, Kal-El,
they wish to be.

318
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,130
They only lack the light to show the way.

319
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,260
For this reason, above all,
their capacity for good...

320
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,260
...I have sent them you...

321
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,680
...my only son.

322
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,680
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.

323
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:37,020
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?

324
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,810
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.

325
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,220
Smile.

326
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,390
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?

327
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,510
Two.

328
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,270
What are you writing?

329
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,730
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?

330
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,110
M- a-s-s-a-c-r-e.

331
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,780
Thanks.

332
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,580
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

333
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,830
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.

334
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,330
A good reporter makes them great.

335
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,500
Chief, here's that story
on the murder case.

336
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,920
The way I see it, it's a headline
on the front page with my picture...

337
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,590
There's only one "P" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

338
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,510
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...

339
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:00,060
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

340
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,020
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.

341
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,150
It's got everything:
Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.

342
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,820
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

343
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,030
- Kent, can you open this?
- Sure, Mr. White.

344
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,360
This could be the basis
for a series of articles:

345
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,240
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings"
by Lois Lane.

346
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,160
We get psychologists,
sociologists, interviews...

347
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,700
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

348
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
The Daily Planet has a tradition...

349
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,620
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

350
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,630
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to shake it up like that.

351
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,420
Of course not, Lois.

352
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:35,180
Why would any one want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

353
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,430
I'll take that.

354
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,390
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

355
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:44,020
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

356
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,600
- Go get Mr... a towel.
- Kent.

357
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,190
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, Chief.

358
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,310
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, Chief.

359
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,860
And don't call me sugar.

360
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,940
Right... Sugar.

361
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,820
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

362
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,330
Lois, why don't you take Kent out
to meet everybody, huh?

363
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,370
Just introduce him around.
He's starting on the paper today.

364
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,120
I'm giving him the City beat.

365
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:07,870
Chief!

366
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,880
That's my beat!

367
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,920
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like
just a mild-mannered reporter...

368
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,260
...but not only does he know how to treat
his Chief with the proper respect...

369
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,970
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

370
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,850
...but he is, in my
40 years in this

371
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,060
business, the fastest
typist I've ever seen.

372
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,140
That's great.

373
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,650
Here, you forgot my article.

374
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,610
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...

375
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,110
...if you could arrange
for half my salary...

376
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,740
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

377
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,030
Your bookie, right?

378
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:41,870
My what?

379
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,990
Don't tell me!

380
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:46,000
He sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

381
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,790
Actually, she's silver-haired.

382
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,500
I'll see what I can do.

383
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:54,050
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

384
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,510
Well?

385
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,680
Any more at home like you?

386
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,600
Not really, no.

387
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,060
I didn't think so.

388
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,940
Well, get yourself a desk over here.

389
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,730
Over here?

390
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,570
Here, there's some paper
and a file right there.

391
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,740
Sorry.

392
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,340
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.

393
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,760
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.

394
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:44,760
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.

395
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,890
- What?
- Kent.

396
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,850
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.

397
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,070
- I met this really great guy, you know.
- Hey, fabulous.

398
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,570
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.

399
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,280
I haven't been since I was seven.

400
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,200
- I got to mail these letters.
- Good luck tonight.

401
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,790
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

402
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,290
How did you like your first day on the job?

403
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,580
The hours were sort of longer
than I expected...

404
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:16,920
...but on the whole, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...

405
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,170
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.

406
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,630
- "Swell"?
- Yup.

407
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,720
You know, Clark...

408
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,510
...there are very few people left
in the world...

409
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,640
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

410
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,980
- What word?
- Swell.

411
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,600
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

412
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,520
- Sorry.
- Clark.

413
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,820
- Sorry, Lois.
- Hi, Rex.

414
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,240
- Did you see anything good today?
- Not until you came along.

415
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,450
Rex, this is...

416
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,330
- Clark Kent. How do...
- See you...

417
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,790
Lois?

418
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,000
Hey, where you going?

419
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,460
Can I help you with your coat?

420
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,340
- Thanks, can you get that?
- Sure.

421
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,800
Did you like Mr. White?

422
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,170
He was a nice guy
and Jimmy was fantastic.

423
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,760
Come here. Come on.

424
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,430
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.

425
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,850
We'd better get out of here.

426
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,720
We'd better do what he says, Lois.

427
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,520
Come on, get in here, quick.

428
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,520
Don't, don't do anything.
It's all right, I'm coming.

429
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,850
We're coming.

430
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,060
Excuse me.

431
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,520
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

432
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:21,690
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.

433
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,530
Okay, okay. Hold it there.

434
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,780
Just a minute.

435
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:27,280
Now I realize that...

436
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:30,660
...times are tough for some these days,
but this isn't the answer.

437
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,120
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

438
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,880
You know, buddy, you're right.

439
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,710
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
- Good for you. That's the spirit.

440
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,880
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.

441
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,880
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.

442
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:46,970
Of course!

443
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,970
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

444
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,260
Lois, I think you'd better...

445
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,350
Lois! What are you doing?

446
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,120
Are you all right?

447
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,250
What happened?

448
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,380
- Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
- Fainted?

449
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,260
- You fainted!
- I'm sorry.

450
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,690
Really, Lois,
supposing that man had shot you?

451
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,820
Is it worth risking your life over $10...

452
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,320
...two credit cards,
a hairbrush and a lipstick?

453
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,910
- How did you know that?
- Know what?

454
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,990
You described the exact contents
of my purse.

455
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:59,370
Wild guess.

456
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,210
Taxi!

457
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,300
- Hey!
- Hi, Otis.

458
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,400
So, what's happening, partner?

459
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,820
Look what we got.

460
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,440
Let's take him.

461
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,070
Wait a minute.

462
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,450
Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself.

463
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,820
Lex Luthor?

464
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,450
You got it, Aramus.

465
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,490
We'll make Captain by midnight.

466
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,330
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.

467
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,710
Hey, what do you read?

468
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,800
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Otis.

469
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,800
Just getting a Daily Planet here.

470
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,260
Okay. All right.

471
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:59,100
See, I'm paying him,
and I got a pretzel, too.

472
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,310
Thanks, Otis.

473
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,440
How many bags, Shutzy?

474
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,150
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.

475
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
Let's go.

476
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,500
Your attention, please.

477
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,870
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready
for departure...

478
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:24,880
...on the upper level. Track 6.

479
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,920
He's going down on a train platform.
I'm going after him.

480
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:32,630
Okay, I'll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?

481
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,390
All right, Aramus. All right.

482
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,720
Now boarding on the lower level...

483
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:44,020
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie...

484
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,900
Board now. All aboard.

485
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:49,730
Metropolis Transportation
to Buffalo, Syracuse...

486
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,320
Smoking cars are forward,
move along now.

487
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,200
Luggage at the top.

488
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,700
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.

489
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,020
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.

490
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,740
I've seen him and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

491
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,110
So that's it!

492
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:31,170
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

493
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,170
Harry...

494
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:18,720
Harry, where are you? Harry?

495
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:40,110
Sick!

496
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,710
Sick, you're really sick!

497
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,130
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?

498
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,300
Sick when we're days
from executing the crime of the century?

499
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,510
No. Step away from that, please.

500
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,430
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

501
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,680
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?

502
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,810
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.

503
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,060
Charismatic?

504
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,940
Fiendishly gifted?

505
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,610
Try twisted!

506
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,490
Get away from that, get away!

507
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,080
Tell me, Lex.

508
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,250
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

509
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,620
Why? You ask why?

510
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:35,250
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

511
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:39,880
Why is the most brilliantly
diabolical leader of our time...

512
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,880
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

513
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,260
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

514
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,930
I was just talking about you.

515
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,430
You were followed again.

516
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,810
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.

517
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,610
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

518
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,490
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

519
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,240
Yes.

520
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,750
Then why am I not reading it?

521
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,670
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

522
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,960
Right.

523
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,300
At last it's official.

524
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,470
Thanks to the help of the US Government...

525
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:30,430
...we are about to be involved in the
greatest real-estate swindle of all time.

526
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,020
Lex, what is this...

527
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:35,400
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."

528
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,360
When I was 6 years old,
my father said to me...

529
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,520
"Get out!"

530
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,780
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...

531
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,700
"... utilities and transportation systems
may collapse...

532
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,870
"... people are no damn good,
but they'll always need land...

533
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:53,290
"... they'll pay through
the nose to get it."

534
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,580
- "Remember," my father said...
- "Land."

535
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,250
It's a pity that he didn't see...

536
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:04,260
...from such humble beginnings
how I've created this empire.

537
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,630
An empire. This?

538
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:11,560
How many girls do you know
have a Park Avenue address like this?

539
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,390
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?

540
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:18,440
Do you realize
what people are shelling out up there...

541
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,230
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator.

542
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,740
What more could anyone ask?

543
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,830
Get this Loch Ness update
right into composing.

544
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,380
Yeah, no that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed, right.

545
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,590
Why are you standing here for?

546
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,670
I'm not.

547
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,050
- I wasn't going to say it.
- Go.

548
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:51,050
The sex maniac profile.

549
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,520
Right. Nine to five it's
a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?

550
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,310
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."

551
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:58,730
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.

552
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,440
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

553
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:06,530
Hi, Clark. Good night.

554
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,410
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Thanks a lot.

555
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,570
Lois, have you got a minute?

556
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,280
Excuse me, please.

557
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,830
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

558
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,960
I was wondering
if you'd have dinner with me?

559
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,960
I'm sorry, I'm booked.

560
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:27,510
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...

561
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:30,640
...you-know-who answers the questions
he would rather duck.

562
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,100
Don't you ever let up?

563
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,220
What for? I mean I've seen
how the other half lives.

564
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:39,140
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

565
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,560
I would go bananas in a week.

566
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:44,480
- Can I take you to the airport?
- Not unless you can fly.

567
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,530
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.

568
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,820
Maybe we could...

569
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,330
- Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
- Sure.

570
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,590
Good night.

571
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,590
Going down, please, going down.

572
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:15,970
Going down?

573
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:17,180
Going up. Up, up.

574
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:20,440
Good night.

575
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,700
Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground.

576
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,160
Planet One, go ahead.

577
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:40,790
Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport
to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight.

578
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:45,210
We're on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.

579
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:50,340
Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.

580
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,010
Roger, Over and out.

581
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,860
A malfunction, can't get lift off.

582
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:57,410
- You've hooked a cable.
- What's happening?

583
01:08:58,950 --> 01:08:59,990
Set it down.

584
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,870
My God, we've lost motor control.

585
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:03,040
I can't hold it.

586
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,590
I can't hold it.

587
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,300
He's lost it.

588
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,980
Wake up.

589
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:33,690
Help!

590
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,630
Step back, folks.

591
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,010
Get back. Move over
to the other side of the street.

592
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:02,720
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.

593
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,560
There's a helicopter up there.

594
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:11,980
Help me.

595
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,200
All right, folks. Let's move back.

596
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,830
Let these firemen get in here.

597
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,620
Help me!

598
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:36,970
Hold it. Get back.

599
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:43,050
Get off the street, folks.

600
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,860
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.

601
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,740
Hold these crowds back. Move.

602
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,250
Help!

603
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,720
Say, Jim...

604
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:28,180
Excuse me.

605
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:29,730
That's a bad outfit.

606
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,900
Okay, move these people.

607
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,240
My God! Look up there.

608
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,540
What the hell's that?

609
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,120
Easy, miss. I've got you.

610
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,210
You've got me? Who's got you?

611
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,960
I can't believe it, I just
cannot believe it. He got her.

612
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,800
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

613
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,810
I hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

614
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,020
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

615
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,190
Right.

616
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,030
Wait!

617
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:06,870
Who are you?

618
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,780
A friend.

619
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,080
'Bye.

620
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,450
Something wrong with the elevator?

621
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:38,910
Going down?

622
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,640
Officer.

623
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,270
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

624
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:01,190
They say confession is good for the soul.

625
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:05,980
I'd listen to this man. Take him away.

626
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:53,740
Come on, let's get out of here.

627
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,710
Move your ass! Come on!

628
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:08,170
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

629
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,680
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.

630
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,550
Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here.

631
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,720
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

632
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:18,350
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.

633
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,680
- Don't shoot!
- Keep your cool. You got us.

634
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:46,420
Bad vibrations?

635
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:50,260
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear it, flying.

636
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:53,260
With a big red cape
and bright red boots as well.

637
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,890
Quick as a wink he was gone.
He flew up in

638
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,180
the air again, he did,
like a big blue bird.

639
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,220
- A big blue bird?
- You don't believe me!

640
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:01,730
With bright red boots?

641
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:03,140
Take the night off.

642
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:05,940
Go back to Murphy's bar
and continue what you started.

643
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,070
I'll be off in a few minutes
and I'll meet you there.

644
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,620
The first bottle's on me.
Let me get my hat.

645
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,970
Frisky, will you come down from there.

646
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:39,720
Hi. I'll get him.

647
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:46,350
Come on, it's all right.

648
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:50,820
- Here you go, miss.
- Gee, thanks, mister.

649
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,490
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.

650
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,160
'Bye.

651
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,120
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

652
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:09,130
Then this man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

653
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,170
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies.

654
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:21,220
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?

655
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:25,270
Metropolis currently ceiling 500,
overcast 700 broken...

656
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,600
...visibility one half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.

657
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:30,810
Roger.

658
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:34,110
Doesn't look good. What do you think?

659
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:39,030
- What the hell was that?
- You've lost power in number one.

660
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,320
Lost power? We've lost the whole engine.

661
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,790
- Pressure's going.
- Shut down number one.

662
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:44,950
Bring up two and three.

663
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,330
We haven't got enough pressure
to keep going.

664
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:52,210
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

665
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,460
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

666
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:58,550
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?

667
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,840
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.

668
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,470
Notify them the President's on board.

669
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:06,430
Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles
southwest of Metropolis Airport.

670
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,940
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.

671
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:31,960
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

672
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,250
What the hell's going on out there?

673
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:37,590
Fly, don't look, just fly.

674
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,510
We got something.

675
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,510
I'm not saying what it is, just trust me.

676
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,860
You enjoyed it.

677
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,490
I don't know what to say, Father.

678
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,620
I'm afraid I just got carried away.

679
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,450
- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.

680
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:12,330
You couldn't have imagined...

681
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,000
How good it felt?

682
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,460
You are revealed to the world.

683
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:22,630
Very well.

684
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:24,470
So be it.

685
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,260
But you still must keep
your secret identity.

686
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:29,930
Why?

687
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,850
The reasons are two.

688
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:35,730
First: You cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.

689
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,860
24.

690
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,740
As it is, in earth time.

691
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:46,120
Your help will be called for endlessly.

692
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,620
Even for those tasks that human beings
can solve themselves.

693
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:53,710
It's their habit to abuse their resources
in such a way.

694
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,290
And secondly?

695
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,380
Secondly:

696
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:58,420
Your enemies will discover...

697
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:01,340
...their only way to hurt you...

698
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,760
...by hurting the people you care for.

699
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,550
Thank you, Father.

700
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,720
Lastly:

701
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:13,100
Do not punish yourself
with your feelings of vanity.

702
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:15,350
Simply learn to control them.

703
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:18,690
It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.

704
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:23,030
Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity of some...

705
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:25,610
...who considered us indestructible.

706
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,070
Were it not for vanity...

707
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:31,580
...at this very moment...

708
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:38,000
...I could embrace you in my arms...

709
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:43,670
...my son.

710
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:18,080
Reports are coming in
of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...

711
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,920
...from almost certain destruction...

712
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:25,470
...rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter
from the Daily Planet, with one hand...

713
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,510
...and a crashed helicopter with the other.

714
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,350
That'll be the day.

715
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,190
That'll be the day when a guy could fly.

716
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,500
I don't know. You would be surprised.

717
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:44,360
...some sort of fantastic hoax.

718
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,700
Your guess is as good as anybody's.
True or false?

719
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:49,860
Miracle or fraud? The answer...

720
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:51,660
- Miss Teschmacher!
- Man or myth?

721
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:53,450
Turn it off.

722
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,630
What's the story on this guy?
Do you think it's the genuine article?

723
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,630
If he is, he's not from this world.

724
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,340
Why?

725
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,470
If any human being was gonna perpetrate
such a hoax, it would have been me!

726
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,740
My robe.

727
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,320
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

728
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:35,290
It all fits somehow,
this coming here to Metropolis...

729
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:38,500
...and at this particular time.

730
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,790
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.

731
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:49,420
To commit the crime of the century, a man
wants to face the challenge of the century.

732
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:56,810
Listen, maybe this guy that flies
is just sort of passing through.

733
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,350
Passing through?

734
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:00,690
Not on your life, Otis...

735
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,560
...which I would gladly sacrifice
by the way...

736
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:07,610
...for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

737
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:13,870
And, Otis, by the way, next time
put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.

738
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,200
Now look.

739
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:18,750
The Post, "It Flies."

740
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,040
The News, "Look, Ma, No Wires."

741
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,380
The Times,
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."

742
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:27,300
The Planet. We're sitting on top
of the story of the century here.

743
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,920
I want the name
of this flying whatchamacallit...

744
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:32,130
...to go with the Daily Planet
like bacon and eggs...

745
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:35,300
...franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

746
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:36,760
I don't think that he'd...

747
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:39,640
...lend himself
to any cheap promotion schemes.

748
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:41,560
Exactly how would you know that?

749
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,980
Just first impression.

750
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,730
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him a partner if I have to.

751
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,110
- Right?
- Right, Chief.

752
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,700
I want the real story.

753
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,780
I want the inside dope on this guy.

754
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:59,950
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?

755
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,170
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?

756
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,840
What's he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?

757
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:15,760
Why did he show up last night?

758
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:17,760
Where does he come from?

759
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,600
Does he have a girlfriend?

760
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,350
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?

761
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,060
Now listen to me, I tell you,
boys and girls...

762
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:28,570
...whichever one of you
gets it out of him...

763
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:32,190
...is going to wind up with the single,
most important interview since...

764
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,700
...God talked to Moses!

765
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:41,160
What are you standing around about for?
Move!

766
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,250
Get on that story.

767
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,140
"8:00," he said. Some friend!

768
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,520
That's the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust!"

769
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:23,830
Good evening, Miss Lane.

770
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:30,210
Did you have plans this evening?

771
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,960
This old thing? No.

772
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:35,420
- I could come back later.
- No!

773
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:36,630
Don't move.

774
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,600
Sure you can move.

775
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,430
Just don't fly away, all right?

776
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,480
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
but I've been thinking.

777
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:52,270
There must be some questions
people'd like to know the answers to.

778
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,360
Yes.

779
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,950
You really shouldn't smoke.

780
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,660
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

781
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,250
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

782
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,420
Would you like a glass of wine?

783
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,510
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

784
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:19,130
Nice place.

785
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:20,760
Thank you.

786
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:22,390
Thank you.

787
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:25,180
Shall we get started with the interview?

788
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,860
Let's start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?

789
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,530
No, I'm not.

790
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:40,030
Do you have a girlfriend?

791
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:41,410
No, I don't. But...

792
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,530
If I did, you'd be the
first to know about it.

793
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:51,830
How old are you?

794
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:53,330
Over 21.

795
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,170
I get it. You don't want anyone to know.

796
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,260
And how big are you? How tall are you?

797
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:00,680
About 6' 4".

798
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:04,010
6' 4". And how much do you weigh?

799
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,010
Around 225.

800
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:08,680
225?

801
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:17,440
I assume then that...

802
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:22,610
...the rest of your bodily functions
are normal?

803
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,870
I beg your pardon?

804
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:27,870
Well, putting it delicately...

805
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,540
...do you...

806
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:37,670
...eat?

807
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,260
Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.

808
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:44,640
You do. Of course, you do.

809
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:47,970
Well, then is it true...

810
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,730
...that you can see through anything?

811
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,730
Yes, I can, pretty much.

812
01:28:55,690 --> 01:28:59,110
And that you're totally impervious to pain?

813
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,490
Well, so far.

814
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,110
What color underwear am I wearing?

815
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,000
Did I embarrass you?

816
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,540
- No.
- I did.

817
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,620
No, it's just that
this planter must be made of lead.

818
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,920
Yes, it is. So?

819
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,590
I sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

820
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:22,550
That's interesting.

821
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,680
Problems with lead.

822
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:29,180
- Do you have a first name?
- Like Ralph, or something?

823
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:30,720
- No, I mean like...
- Pink.

824
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,270
Pink!

825
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:38,310
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.

826
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,360
You didn't embarrass me.

827
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:45,740
What's your background?
Where are you from?

828
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,200
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.

829
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:52,580
You see, I'm from...
Well, from pretty far away.

830
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,880
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.

831
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,040
Krypton.

832
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:03,760
Cripton! With a C-r-i...

833
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:08,300
No, actually it's Krypton,
with a K-r-y-p-t-o-n.

834
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,810
Do you like pink?

835
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,520
I like pink very much.

836
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:26,150
Why are you?

837
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,740
Sorry?

838
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:31,830
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.

839
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,620
Yes, I'm here to fight for truth
and justice and the American way.

840
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,790
You'll end up fighting every official
in this country.

841
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:42,130
You don't really mean that.

842
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,010
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?

843
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:46,260
I never lie.

844
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,350
How fast do you fly, by the way?

845
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:01,400
I don't know. I've never actually bothered
to time myself.

846
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,440
Say?

847
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,190
Why don't we find out?

848
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,660
And how do you propose we do that?

849
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,530
- Take a ride with me.
- You mean I could fly?

850
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:15,120
I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay.

851
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,420
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

852
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,630
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

853
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:22,670
Don't you want to go?

854
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,630
You won't need these.

855
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,340
- I need a sweater. It must be kind of...
- No, you'll be warm enough.

856
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:36,890
Ready?

857
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:41,690
Clark said that you were just a figment
of somebody's imagination.

858
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:43,980
Like Peter Pan.

859
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:47,110
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?

860
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,860
- Clark? No, he's nothing.
- Peter Pan?

861
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:56,750
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

862
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:15,110
Can you read my mind?

863
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,990
Do you know what it is that you do to me?

864
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:27,870
I don't know who you are.

865
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,010
Just a friend from another star.

866
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:42,640
Here I am, like a kid out of school.

867
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,220
Holding hands with a god.

868
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:49,270
I'm a fool.

869
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,650
Will you look at me?

870
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:54,270
Quivering.

871
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,150
Like a little girl shivering.

872
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,450
You can see right through me.

873
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,290
Can you read my mind?

874
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,420
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?

875
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:20,090
Wondering why you are...

876
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:24,600
...all the wonderful things you are.

877
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,730
You can fly.

878
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:31,850
You belong in the sky.

879
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:35,150
You and I...

880
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:38,780
...could belong to each other.

881
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,700
If you need a friend...

882
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:49,250
...I'm the one to fly to.

883
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:55,630
If you need to be loved...

884
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:58,630
...here I am.

885
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,720
Read my mind.

886
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,700
We forgot to time ourselves.

887
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,450
Maybe next time.

888
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,090
You okay?

889
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:45,010
Good night.

890
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,340
Good night.

891
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:54,140
What a super man!

892
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:02,030
Superman!

893
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:08,490
Anybody home?

894
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,380
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.

895
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,340
For goodness' sake,
didn't you hear me knocking?

896
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:28,090
We did have a date tonight, remember?

897
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:33,020
You haven't been...?

898
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:38,770
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?

899
01:38:39,650 --> 01:38:42,230
I'd better get a coat.
It might be cold out.

900
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:46,740
I mean, I need a purse,
and I have to fix my hair...

901
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,070
...put some blush on.

902
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,300
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...

903
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,270
I was at first really
nervous about tonight.

904
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:22,650
But then I decided, darn it, I was going
to show you the time of your life.

905
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:24,070
That's Clark nice.

906
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,820
We could go for a hamburger
or whatever you want to do.

907
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:37,960
Now then...

908
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:42,750
...given the exact location
of the galaxy that he mentions...

909
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:46,380
...and the proximity
to our own solar system...

910
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:51,800
It's amazing. Amazing!

911
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:54,060
Too good to be true.

912
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:57,390
It's too good to be true.
6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...

913
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,850
...doesn't drink or smoke
and tells the truth.

914
01:40:00,230 --> 01:40:02,770
Some people can read War and Peace...

915
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,480
...and think it was an adventure story.

916
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:08,950
Others can read the ingredients
on a gum wrapper...

917
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:11,200
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

918
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,330
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

919
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:20,960
Right, Miss Teschmacher.

920
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:26,090
"N."

921
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,340
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

922
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:32,590
So there you go, "M."

923
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,850
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.

924
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:37,060
It's "N" as in "Neanderthal"...

925
01:40:37,390 --> 01:40:40,100
..."nincompoop," "nitwit,"
and "L" as in "ladder."

926
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:41,980
Here's a ladder, coming right up.

927
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:44,020
I didn't see...

928
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:46,230
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

929
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:51,150
In the interview he says
that the Planet Krypton...

930
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:54,910
...exploded in 1948.

931
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:57,450
That ridiculous little freak...

932
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:00,370
...took three years in a rocket
to get to earth.

933
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:02,750
- Ergo...
- Ergo.

934
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,630
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.

935
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:07,960
He's 6' 4", you know that?

936
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:13,050
Do you know why the number 200 is
so vitally descriptive to both you and me?

937
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:15,100
It's your weight and my I.Q.

938
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,550
Think, people, think.

939
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:21,140
Deductive reasoning.
That's the name of the game.

940
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,020
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...

941
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,650
...exploded and went into outer space.

942
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:29,610
It is reasonable to assume...

943
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:32,740
...that some of those particles of debris
drifted to Earth.

944
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:36,660
Meteorites!

945
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,160
Jawohl.

946
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:40,950
Voilà!

947
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,040
Voilà!

948
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:54,590
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

949
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:58,390
I know I'll get rapped
in the mouth for this, but...

950
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:59,640
...so what?

951
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:02,930
So what? You mean to us
they're just meteorites.

952
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:04,850
Fair enough.

953
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:08,270
But the level of specific radioactivity...

954
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:11,030
...is so high to anyone
from the Planet Krypton...

955
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,030
...this substance is lethal.

956
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,160
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

957
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:18,200
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...

958
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:19,780
...but this stuff here...

959
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:22,040
...will kill him.

960
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:27,500
Doesn't it give you a kind of...

961
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:31,300
...a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

962
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:35,840
Not like the shudder you'll get
when you lay that rock on him.

963
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:39,220
He can see you coming for miles
with those super peepers of his.

964
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:42,810
O Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see...

965
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:45,640
...nor can Superman, through lead.

966
01:42:47,690 --> 01:42:50,070
He can't see through lead?

967
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,440
And Kryptonite will destroy him.

968
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:57,450
Any questions, class?

969
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:01,120
I wonder what they're wearing
in Addis Ababa?

970
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:03,240
Looks like a burnoose.

971
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,540
It's just a wraparound.

972
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:08,380
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?

973
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:11,500
Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.

974
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:14,210
Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.

975
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:18,390
Everything looks good,
see you at the base. Over and out.

976
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:21,260
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.

977
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,640
Look at this!

978
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:07,560
Looks pretty bad.

979
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,520
Take her pulse.

980
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:25,660
Get an ambulance down here.

981
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:29,040
I don't want to hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

982
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,580
She's having trouble breathing.
What do you think?

983
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:34,670
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.

984
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:37,260
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

985
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,340
Yes, sir!

986
01:44:39,970 --> 01:44:43,300
I won't have my men do anything
I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.

987
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:44,720
Get an ambulance.

988
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:46,100
Gather around.

989
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:49,020
Turn around!

990
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:18,210
Hi.

991
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:19,960
Somebody hurt?

992
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:39,030
I did it, Mr. Luthor.

993
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:41,360
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.

994
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:44,820
- Just like you told me.
- All right, Otis.

995
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:47,080
It isn't that I don't trust you, but...

996
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,540
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?

997
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:55,330
I set the first directional vector...

998
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:57,250
...to 38.

999
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:01,380
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 117.

1000
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:03,220
What about the fourth one?

1001
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:04,800
What fourth one?

1002
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:08,350
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?

1003
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:12,180
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis!

1004
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:16,350
The third one was supposed to be 11,
and the fourth one, 7.

1005
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,650
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.

1006
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:23,650
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.

1007
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:25,860
Would you like to see a long arm?

1008
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,660
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very, long arm?

1009
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:30,950
No, Mr. Luthor.

1010
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:48,470
- All right. Get it right.
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.

1011
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:54,020
I thought you told me
this road would be blocked off?

1012
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:57,350
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you...
- I didn't ask him, I asked you.

1013
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:00,400
All right. Follow me, men.

1014
01:47:02,110 --> 01:47:05,360
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.

1015
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:18,170
You'll have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.

1016
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:19,920
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?

1017
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:30,260
- Route 12? That's back there.
- No, sir, it's up there.

1018
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:36,940
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
- I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.

1019
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:47,740
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.

1020
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:56,080
This man is a diabetic, you see.

1021
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:11,010
As you know, the Daily Planet
is very interested in that dam...

1022
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:13,140
...but what I don't understand...

1023
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:16,220
...is why you'd sell out to a
faceless person you've never met?

1024
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:17,680
You don't know his name.

1025
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,860
At the stupid high price he offered...

1026
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:26,360
...for this worthless piece of desert...

1027
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,320
...I hope it's Custer!

1028
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:32,660
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.

1029
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:36,700
Reporting live from the launch site,
ground zero.

1030
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:41,330
Today marks a historic occasion since...

1031
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:45,750
...two XK-101 rockets will be
launched simultaneously.

1032
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:49,420
One by the Army, and one by the Navy.

1033
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:51,890
Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?

1034
01:48:51,970 --> 01:48:54,180
No, but the Chief wants to see you.

1035
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:56,100
You're blocking the set, Clark.

1036
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:59,520
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?

1037
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,600
Good.

1038
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:02,650
Excuse me, Mr. White.

1039
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:05,690
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?

1040
01:49:06,610 --> 01:49:08,940
She's out West,
looking into a land-fraud deal.

1041
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,910
I sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

1042
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:15,280
Some unidentified clown
is buying thousands of acres...

1043
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:17,580
...of worthless desert
at incredible prices.

1044
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:19,410
That doesn't seem to make sense.

1045
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,250
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that.

1046
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:24,790
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.

1047
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:29,130
People break into a museum at night,
kill two people, and what do they take?

1048
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:32,010
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?

1049
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,600
I've never been able
to understand violence.

1050
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:37,560
I know that about you.

1051
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,640
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1052
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:43,520
I've been in this news game
40 years man and boy...

1053
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:47,400
...and I got where I am
with guts, compassion...

1054
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:50,860
...elbow grease and something
you're sadly lacking in, son.

1055
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:52,820
Humility?

1056
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:55,530
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.

1057
01:49:56,030 --> 01:49:58,240
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.

1058
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:00,700
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.

1059
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:10,880
This is Lex Luthor.

1060
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:15,010
Only one thing alive with less than
four legs can hear this frequency.

1061
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:16,090
That's you.

1062
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:21,310
In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet
containing propane lithium compound...

1063
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:24,940
...will be released through thousands
of air ducts in this city...

1064
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:28,440
...effectively annihilating
half the population of Metropolis.

1065
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:31,650
I was a reporter before most of my friends
were copy boys.

1066
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:34,780
I want you to get Lois
to introduce you to Superman.

1067
01:50:35,070 --> 01:50:38,240
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?

1068
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:41,120
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?

1069
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:43,540
I know it all seems a bit much...

1070
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:46,080
...but how else was I going to meet you,
Superman?

1071
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:49,460
I knew you'd never accept
an invitation to tea.

1072
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:55,010
But a disaster, with people in danger,
people who need help...

1073
01:50:56,590 --> 01:51:00,720
I just knew you couldn't resist
that chance to sort of pitch in.

1074
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:02,850
You know what I mean?

1075
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:39,430
There's a strong streak of good in you,
Superman.

1076
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:42,260
But then nobody's perfect.

1077
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:47,100
Almost nobody.

1078
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:57,700
- Oh, Superman!
- Gee!

1079
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:01,030
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.

1080
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:08,830
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!

1081
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:25,310
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.

1082
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,600
Tell me what you see?

1083
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,350
Cuteness, dimples.

1084
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:32,360
You like cuteness?

1085
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:34,480
Dimples.

1086
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:36,610
I'll give you dimples.

1087
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:13,360
The pressure is still on you.

1088
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:16,360
You know they say:
If you can't stand the heat...

1089
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:17,940
...get out of the tunnel.

1090
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:43,180
It's your last chance, Superman.

1091
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:46,600
Why don't you do yourself a flavor
and freeze.

1092
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:49,990
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.

1093
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:02,960
He's definitely coming.

1094
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,850
It's open, come in.

1095
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:21,940
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

1096
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:23,820
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

1097
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:31,450
I don't think he wants me to.

1098
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:32,950
Where's the gas pellet?

1099
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,620
Somewhere.

1100
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:38,750
It's in the back of my mind, actually.

1101
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:41,750
It's a little idea I was toying with.

1102
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:44,550
Is that how a warped brain like yours
gets its kicks?

1103
01:55:44,630 --> 01:55:46,840
By planning the death of innocent people?

1104
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,680
By causing the death of innocent people.

1105
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:50,850
Fire!

1106
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:56,140
Navy Bird, we have a good launch.

1107
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:58,190
Navy missile...

1108
01:56:07,450 --> 01:56:09,950
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...

1109
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:12,620
...very heavy into real estate.

1110
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:17,500
To make money, you have to buy
for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1111
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:18,870
Right.

1112
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:21,880
So, the problem?

1113
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:26,260
How to make the land more valuable
between the time you buy it...

1114
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,920
...and the time you sell it?

1115
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,720
Now this is California.

1116
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:33,640
The richest, most populous state
in the Union.

1117
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:35,890
I don't need a geography lesson from you.

1118
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:40,480
Of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?

1119
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:42,150
Where was I?

1120
01:56:42,690 --> 01:56:44,320
- California.
- California, right.

1121
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:47,030
The San Andreas Fault,
maybe you've heard of it?

1122
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,530
Yes. It's the joining together
of two land masses.

1123
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:53,330
The fault line is shifting, which is why
you get earthquakes in California.

1124
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:56,370
Wonderful!
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1125
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:59,460
Everything west of this
line is the richest,

1126
01:56:59,470 --> 01:57:01,500
most expensive real
estate in the world.

1127
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:04,210
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1128
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:06,210
Everything on this side of the line...

1129
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:09,340
...is just hundreds of miles
of worthless desert land...

1130
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:11,680
...which just happens to be owned by...

1131
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,930
Lex Luthor Incorporated.

1132
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:18,680
Now, call me foolish,
call me irresponsible.

1133
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:22,730
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...

1134
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:25,520
...planted at just the
proper point would...

1135
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:28,070
Would destroy most of California.

1136
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:33,280
Millions of people would be killed
and the West Coast as we know it would...

1137
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:36,620
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1138
01:57:37,790 --> 01:57:40,370
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

1139
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,710
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.

1140
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:47,000
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.

1141
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:51,090
"Otisburg"?

1142
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,590
Miss Teschmacher,
she's got her own place.

1143
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:54,680
"Otisburg"?

1144
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:56,390
It's a little bitty place.

1145
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:57,560
Otisburg?

1146
01:57:58,890 --> 01:58:01,180
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.

1147
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:03,020
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.

1148
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:06,110
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn't possibly work.

1149
01:58:06,730 --> 01:58:08,820
I'll admit there were a few problems.

1150
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,900
Adjusting the precise trajectory
of the missile.

1151
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:15,490
Finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself...

1152
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:19,740
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...

1153
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:21,410
...here.

1154
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,110
That's impossible!

1155
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:52,780
What's happening, Lieutenant?

1156
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:54,450
Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1157
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:57,740
Abort.

1158
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:00,080
All counter control units...

1159
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,290
...remove vacuum pressure to maximum.

1160
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:06,000
Function negative, sir.

1161
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,420
Can't you knock them down?

1162
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:11,840
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have
the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.

1163
01:59:12,210 --> 01:59:13,670
Get me the Pentagon.

1164
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:23,310
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?

1165
01:59:23,810 --> 01:59:25,940
Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.

1166
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:28,310
Would you go to the viewing room, please?

1167
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:31,980
But as for the rest,
it's nothing but a sick fantasy.

1168
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:33,150
Fantasy?

1169
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,360
No.

1170
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:37,700
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

1171
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:40,160
Miss Teschmacher!

1172
01:59:44,910 --> 01:59:46,160
Yes, Lex?

1173
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:47,960
Where's the rocket now?

1174
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:51,840
It's going like a bat over the
Grand Canyon, so is the other one.

1175
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,000
The other one?

1176
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:54,670
There are two of them?

1177
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:00,010
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.

1178
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:03,720
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn't stop both of them.

1179
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:06,940
While I, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

1180
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:09,190
All right, Luthor, where is it?

1181
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:11,310
Where's the detonator?

1182
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:26,330
Diseased maniac!

1183
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:29,960
Do you think you could hide it from me
by encasing it in lead?

1184
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,300
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.

1185
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:35,550
Don't touch that.

1186
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:43,430
I told you.

1187
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,430
It's Kryptonite.

1188
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:47,810
A little souvenir from your hometown.

1189
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:50,560
I've spared no expense
to make you feel at home.

1190
02:00:58,240 --> 02:00:59,780
You were great in your day.

1191
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:02,570
But it just stands to reason...

1192
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:05,160
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

1193
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:10,120
...this old diseased maniac
would be your banker.

1194
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:15,710
Mind over muscle.

1195
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:28,480
You don't even care
where the other missile's headed, do you?

1196
02:01:28,930 --> 02:01:30,100
Certainly I do.

1197
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,480
I know exactly where it's headed.

1198
02:01:33,610 --> 02:01:35,070
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1199
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:45,280
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.

1200
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:47,540
Mine's in California.

1201
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:05,260
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

1202
02:03:11,870 --> 02:03:13,660
Please, you can't...

1203
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:15,920
...you can't just stand there.

1204
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:24,010
You can't just stand
and let millions of innocent people die.

1205
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:25,880
Maybe.

1206
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:30,220
Please, help me to save them.

1207
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:34,770
Would you promise
to save my mother first?

1208
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:37,850
But, Lois, and Jimmy...

1209
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:39,610
But my mother comes first.

1210
02:03:39,690 --> 02:03:43,150
If you promise, I'll believe you
because you always tell the truth.

1211
02:03:45,570 --> 02:03:47,200
I promise, I promise.

1212
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:44,090
Why did you kiss me first?

1213
02:04:47,050 --> 02:04:49,300
I didn't think you'd let me later.

1214
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:52,180
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1215
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:55,770
Why is it I can't get it on
with the good guys?

1216
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:04,440
Stand aside now.
I wouldn't stay here, either.

1217
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:25,000
Army Bird still heading due east.

1218
02:05:25,090 --> 02:05:26,960
Navy Bird still heading due west.

1219
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:28,510
Losing radar contact.

1220
02:05:29,090 --> 02:05:31,180
Next radar contact after three seconds.

1221
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:54,280
Army Bird still headed east, sir.

1222
02:06:49,130 --> 02:06:50,840
Army Bird gaining altitude.

1223
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:52,420
Miss Teschmacher!

1224
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:54,510
Radar contact strong.

1225
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:56,850
Miss Teschmacher!

1226
02:06:57,180 --> 02:06:59,430
Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.

1227
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:05,100
Navy Bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.

1228
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:07,020
15 seconds and counting.

1229
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:09,330
A military missile has exploded
in the Southern California desert.

1230
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:12,710
The force of the explosion has activated
the San Andreas fault.

1231
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:15,050
California is suffering a major earthquake.

1232
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,720
What's going on?

1233
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:05,850
It's a quake! Look!

1234
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:16,250
Okay, kids, it's all right now.

1235
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:18,590
Hey, it's Superman!

1236
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:28,810
Holy mackerel!

1237
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:31,520
We're going off the tracks.

1238
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:09,180
All personnel evacuate dam.

1239
02:11:21,570 --> 02:11:22,740
Watch that cable!

1240
02:11:30,450 --> 02:11:32,160
Someone try and pull the main.

1241
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,370
It's impossible. It's red hot!

1242
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,300
Is that man all right?

1243
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:45,420
Yeah.

1244
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:10,280
Hang on, Jim.

1245
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:22,340
The dam broke.

1246
02:12:30,430 --> 02:12:31,760
You're safe here, son.

1247
02:12:33,430 --> 02:12:36,100
That's okay. Miss Lane
will be driving by any minute.

1248
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,070
- Come on!
- Make it to the hill.

1249
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:57,620
There has been major quake damage
to Southern California.

1250
02:12:57,870 --> 02:13:00,420
The San Andreas fault has miraculously
sealed itself.

1251
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:04,500
Yet Southern California is suffering
an aftershock of a major earthquake.

1252
02:13:05,050 --> 02:13:07,340
The population is still warned
to be aware...

1253
02:13:09,430 --> 02:13:10,970
Please, come on, turn over.

1254
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:13,100
Come on!

1255
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:43,080
Help me. Help me, please.

1256
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:58,110
It is forbidden for you to interfere...

1257
02:18:58,650 --> 02:19:02,650
There's one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

1258
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:05,320
It is forbidden.

1259
02:19:05,410 --> 02:19:08,240
All those things I can do.
All those powers...

1260
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:11,040
...but I couldn't even save him.

1261
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:16,710
It is forbidden.

1262
02:20:42,130 --> 02:20:43,130
Hi.

1263
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:46,420
Don't bother, it's dead.

1264
02:20:48,590 --> 02:20:49,590
Sure it's dead.

1265
02:20:51,550 --> 02:20:54,980
The problem with men of steel is
they're never around when you want one.

1266
02:20:55,060 --> 02:20:57,770
Do you know what happened
while you were off flying around?

1267
02:20:57,850 --> 02:21:01,650
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.

1268
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:05,610
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.

1269
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:08,780
To top the whole thing off,
this stupid car runs out of gas.

1270
02:21:09,030 --> 02:21:10,530
I'm sorry about that, Lois.

1271
02:21:10,990 --> 02:21:13,030
But I've been kind of busy for a while.

1272
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:17,960
I'm sorry, that's all right.

1273
02:21:30,050 --> 02:21:31,470
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1274
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:34,220
Put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

1275
02:21:34,310 --> 02:21:38,020
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.

1276
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:43,270
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

1277
02:21:46,070 --> 02:21:47,570
He can't stay still for a second.

1278
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:54,240
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.

1279
02:21:54,330 --> 02:21:57,080
Yeah, poor Clark.
He's never around when...

1280
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:00,580
Clark... Wait a minute.

1281
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,960
What?

1282
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:05,300
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.

1283
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:09,300
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.

1284
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:12,140
- Clark? Of course, he does.
- No, not Clark.

1285
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:18,100
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.

1286
02:22:19,270 --> 02:22:22,690
But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...

1287
02:22:36,030 --> 02:22:37,540
You're messing up my suit!

1288
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,420
Otis! Watch the ground, you...

1289
02:22:45,290 --> 02:22:46,710
Good evening, Warden.

1290
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:49,970
These two men should be safe here
'til they can get a fair trial.

1291
02:22:50,050 --> 02:22:51,300
Who is it, Superman?

1292
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:54,680
Lex Luthor.

1293
02:22:55,180 --> 02:22:57,810
- The greatest criminal mind of our time.
- Of our time.

1294
02:22:57,890 --> 02:23:00,180
- I hereby serve notice...
- He's serving notice to you.

1295
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:01,890
...that these walls...

1296
02:23:02,230 --> 02:23:04,230
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!

1297
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:05,610
You, you nitwit!

1298
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:07,020
Nincompoop!

1299
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:08,650
This country...

1300
02:23:08,730 --> 02:23:11,360
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.

1301
02:23:11,860 --> 02:23:12,610
No, sir.

1302
02:23:12,700 --> 02:23:14,030
Don't thank me, Warden.

1303
02:23:14,490 --> 02:23:16,280
We're all part of the same team.

1304
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:17,700
Good night.
