1
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,640
Yes?

2
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,920
What?

3
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,600
Hold on!

4
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm fine.

5
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,040
You guys can get back to work.
I'll be on my way.

6
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,880
- Get the car!
- Mr. Dhillon?

7
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,560
Do you want me to get the name tattooed?
Get the car!

8
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,480
Let's go.

9
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,200
To the hotel, sir?

10
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,880
Yes, via Vasant Vihar.

11
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
Let's hurry up, dude!

12
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,840
Hello, Farhan.

13
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,560
Get ready.
I'll pick you up in five minutes.

14
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,680
What's wrong?

15
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,720
Chatur called me.

16
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,440
The "Silencer"?

17
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
Yes.

18
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,880
He knows where Rancho is.

19
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,880
Really?

20
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,680
He asked us to meet him near the tank
inside our college campus.

21
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Hurry!

22
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,360
Okay.

23
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,440
Honey, I'll be back soon.
My shoes!

24
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,280
We found our buddy.

25
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
What?

26
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,960
I'll see you later.

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,320
You forgot your pants!

28
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
To the hotel now?

29
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Yes, but via
Imperial College of Engineering.

30
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,880
I forgot my socks.

31
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,440
You forgot to wear your pants as well.

32
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Oh, no!

33
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,520
Go and get my brother from the airport
and drop him at the hotel.

34
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,400
This is Mr. Dhillon.
Where the hell is my cab?

35
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,680
- Rancho!
- Chatur, where's Rancho?

36
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Rancho?

37
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Where's Rancho?

38
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
Some rum for you?

39
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,960
The same rum you guys used to have
back in those days.

40
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
Where is Rancho?

41
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,960
Have patience.

42
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
Look at this.

43
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Check out the mansion
behind my wife, you idiots.

44
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,280
Why are you showing this to us?

45
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,960
Don't you remember?

46
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Look at this.

47
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,160
5th September. That's today's date.

48
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,800
I challenge you.

49
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
We'll meet again after ten years.

50
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,520
Same day! Same place!

51
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,680
We'll see who's more successful.

52
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,240
Do you accept my challenge?

53
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,800
Do you?

54
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,000
Remember?
I had challenged that idiot, right here!

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,320
- Jackass!
- Hold on.

56
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,000
I got off the flight
and he forgot his pants

57
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,360
so that we could meet Rancho.

58
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,120
We searched for him for five years
and we have no clue where he is.

59
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,720
You think he'll show up
for your silly challenge?

60
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I know he won't show up.

61
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,000
- I'm going to beat him up...
- Hold on, Farhan!

62
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,400
Why did you call us here?

63
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,040
I wanted to show you the huge difference
between my success and Rancho's failure.

64
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,560
Do you know where Rancho is?

65
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,000
Where is he?

66
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,040
<i>Rancho.</i>

67
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,480
<i>Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad.</i>

68
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,240
<i>He was as unique as his name.</i>

69
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,680
<i>We were always told that life is a race.</i>

70
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,000
<i>Run fast, or you'll be trampled upon.</i>

71
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,320
<i>Even to be born, one had to race
300 million sperms.</i>

72
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,960
<i>1978. I was born at 5:15 p.m.</i>

73
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,040
<i>At 5:16 p.m. my father announced.</i>

74
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,120
<i>My son will grow up to be an engineer.</i>

75
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,480
<i>No one asked me what my aspirations were.</i>

76
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,840
<i>I lived all my life</i>

77
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,200
<i>As if it were the life of another</i>

78
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
<i>For just one moment</i>

79
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,800
<i>Let me live as I am</i>

80
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,440
<i>I lived all my life...</i>

81
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,360
Raju Rastogi.
Ranchoddas Chanchad.

82
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,120
What's your room number?

83
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,240
Come on.

84
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm Man Mohan. MM.

85
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,040
The students here call me Millimeter.

86
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,560
I deliver eggs, bread and milk to them.
I also do the laundry

87
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
and help them with their
journals and assignments.

88
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm the helper.
I charge a fixed rate, no bargaining.

89
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,080
Hold on, hold on!

90
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Meet Kilobyte, Megabyte
and their mother Gigabyte.

91
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,000
- I see.
- You can click a picture.

92
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
They don't bite.

93
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,320
Check him out!
Another God-fearing soul.

94
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,040
I'm Raju Rastogi.

95
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
Don't worry.

96
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,560
A few days here and
he'll lose faith in God.

97
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,520
Then, there will be pictures
of naked babes on the wall.

98
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,360
He'll be praying to God
for a girlfriend like them.

99
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,480
Get out of here.

100
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,160
You owe me four rupees.
Two rupees per bag.

101
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,960
Here's five. Keep the change.

102
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Thank you.

103
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,240
Here's a suggestion.

104
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,240
Wear your... best underwear tonight.

105
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,520
Why?

106
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,000
Your Majesty, thou art great.

107
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,040
Accept this humble offering.

108
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,480
It looks like He-Man's ass!

109
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Here.

110
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,200
Pretty buttocks!

111
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
That's cute!

112
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
<i>A campus tradition on day one.</i>

113
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
<i>Freshmen must pay their
respects to the seniors...</i>

114
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
<i>in their underwear.</i>

115
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,440
<i>This is when we first saw Rancho.</i>

116
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,800
Spiderman.

117
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Batman.

118
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,160
Fresh meat!

119
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,720
Greetings.
Drop your pants, get stamped.

120
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
- What's his name?
- Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad.

121
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,360
What a mouthful!
It needs serious cramming.

122
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,200
Come on, take off your pants.

123
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,320
Don't be stubborn.

124
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,800
It's not good to wear wet pants.
Take them off.

125
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,120
What's that?

126
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
What did he say?

127
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
Please make him understand.

128
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,680
Hey, James Bond.

129
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,120
Make him understand.

130
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,160
Stop speaking in English!
Speak in Hindi.

131
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,440
Explain it to him slowly.
There's no hurry.

132
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,720
Feeling cold?

133
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,400
Please take your pants off.

134
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,120
Or else... he'll have a
urine related explosion all over you.

135
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,040
"Urine related explosion!"

136
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,880
A true linguist
in the land of engineers!

137
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,480
Spiderman.

138
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,880
Batman.

139
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,800
Hey, come out of there.

140
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,360
Come out!

141
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
Come out, or else...

142
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll have a urine related explosion
all over your door.

143
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
By the count of ten...

144
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,280
if you aren't out...

145
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,120
I'll... urinate over your door
all through the coming semester.

146
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
One.

147
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,040
Two!

148
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Three!

149
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,600
Four!

150
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,040
Come on!

151
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,600
Five!

152
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,000
Six!

153
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,200
Seven...

154
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,440
Eight!

155
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,840
Nine!

156
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,880
Ten!

157
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,240
<i>We had studied about it.
He applied it, practically.</i>

158
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,920
<i>Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE.</i>

159
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,640
<i>Students called him "Virus."</i>

160
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,360
<i>"Computer Virus" to be precise.</i>

161
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,080
Virus is on the way, with eggs!

162
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,760
The freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly!

163
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,520
<i>Virus was the most competitive man
we had ever seen.</i>

164
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,680
<i>He couldn't bear to see anyone
becoming more successful than him.</i>

165
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,440
<i>To save time, his shirts had Velcro.</i>

166
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,040
<i>And his ties had hooks.</i>

167
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,360
<i>He had trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously.</i>

168
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,760
<i>Every day at 2:00 p.m. he took
a seven and a half minute power nap</i>

169
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,360
<i>with an opera as his lullaby.</i>

170
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,840
<i>Govind, his valet, had instructions</i>

171
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,880
<i>to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving and manicuring</i>

172
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,840
<i>during his nap time.</i>

173
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,120
What is this?

174
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,960
- Whose?
- A koel bird's nest.

175
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,800
A koel never makes her own nest.

176
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,200
She lays her eggs in other nests.

177
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,880
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

178
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,720
They push the other eggs...

179
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,160
out of the nest.

180
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,160
And these are the eggs you smashed
to get into ICE.

181
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,400
- ICE gets 4,00,000 applications a year.
- "ICE gets 4,00,000 applications a year."

182
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,680
- And only 200 are selected.
- "And only 200 are selected."

183
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,240
And these?

184
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,240
My son tried for three years.

185
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,360
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled upon.

186
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,240
This is an astronaut pen.

187
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,000
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space.

188
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,880
So scientists spent millions
to invent this pen.

189
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,360
It can write at any angle,
in any temperature and at zero gravity.

190
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,760
I got scared.

191
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,840
When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself...

192
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,040
pass it onto him.

193
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,240
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student.

194
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,360
Anyone here,
who'll strive to win this pen?

195
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Shall I post it on the notice board?

196
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,400
I have a question, sir.

197
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,160
Sir, if fountain pens and ballpoint pens
didn't work in outer space

198
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,200
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

199
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,080
They could have saved millions.

200
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,440
He zaps a senior's privates
and questions the director.

201
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,240
We should avoid that boy.

202
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,400
I'm glad you questioned Virus.

203
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering.

204
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,600
Hey! Buzz off!

205
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,880
Go to school.

206
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,600
Who will pay for it? Your father?

207
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,880
- No wisecracks about my father!
- Relax.

208
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,640
You don't need money to go to school.
All you need is a uniform.

209
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,800
Listen!

210
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Pick a school

211
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,400
buy the uniform

212
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,160
and slip into the class.

213
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice you.

214
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,720
- What if I get caught?
- A new uniform, a new school!

215
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,880
- See that?
<i>- He was different.</i>

216
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,400
<i>He challenged conventions at every stage.</i>

217
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,600
<i>A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest.</i>

218
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,240
<i>We were like robots, blindly following
our professors' commands.</i>

219
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,320
<i>He was the only one who
was not like a machine.</i>

220
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,560
Why are you smiling?

221
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,800
Sir, studying Engineering
was my childhood dream.

222
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,720
I'm very happy to be here.

223
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,000
There's no need to be happy.
Define a machine.

224
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,800
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine.

225
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,720
On a warm day, press a button
and get a blast of fresh air!

226
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,240
The fan is a machine.

227
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,440
Speak to a friend who lives miles away.

228
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,840
The telephone is a machine.

229
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,520
Compute millions in seconds.

230
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,960
The calculator is a machine.

231
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,560
We are surrounded by machines!

232
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,480
From a pen's nib to a pant's zip,
everything is a machine.

233
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,040
Up and down, in a second...

234
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,320
What is the definition?

235
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,520
I just gave it to you, sir.

236
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,520
"Up and down, in a second."
Is that what you'll write in your exam?

237
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,960
Wonderful!

238
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,400
But I said the same thing
in a simple manner.

239
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,200
If you prefer a simple manner,
join an Arts and Commerce college.

240
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
But it's important that one must
understand the meaning as well.

241
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,800
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition?

242
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,600
You think you're smarter than the book?

243
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,640
Mention the textbook definition,
if you want to pass the examinations.

244
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,240
But there are other books...

245
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,880
In simple terms, "Go away!"

246
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,160
Why are you back?

247
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,160
I forgot something.

248
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,600
What?

249
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,480
What do you mean?

250
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,840
Books, sir.

251
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,080
I forgot my books.
May I take them?

252
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,760
Couldn't you say that
in a simple manner?

253
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,080
I tried that earlier.
It simply didn't work.

254
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,000
<i>Most of the times, the professors
kept Rancho out of their class.</i>

255
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,120
<i>When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another.</i>

256
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,400
<i>He believed that knowledge was
everywhere and we needed to grab it.</i>

257
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,120
<i>He was unlike any of us.</i>

258
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,800
<i>We fought for a shower
every morning.</i>

259
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,280
<i>He'd bathe wherever
he found water.</i>

260
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,920
<i>He loved working on machines.</i>

261
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,280
<i>Whenever he spotted a machine,
he opened it with a handy screwdriver.</i>

262
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,720
<i>Some, he could reassemble.</i>

263
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,880
<i>Some, he couldn't.</i>

264
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,120
<i>There was another boy, just like him.</i>

265
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,000
Joy Lobo.

266
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,160
Mr. Joy Lobo!

267
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,600
Sir, I need to know the dates
for the convocation.

268
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,240
- Why?
- Dad wants to make train reservations.

269
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,240
I'll be the first engineer
from my village.

270
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,200
All my relatives want
to attend the function.

271
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,000
In that case, please call your dad.

272
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,680
The director wants to speak to you.

273
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Joy!

274
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,320
Mr. Lobo, your son
won't graduate this year.

275
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,640
Why?

276
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,800
Mr. Lobo, I told you...
it's an unrealistic project.

277
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,360
I suggest you not to
book your train tickets.

278
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Sir, please see it properly.

279
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,800
Submit it, and we'll consider it.

280
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,840
Sir, a small extension...

281
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,080
After dad had a stroke,
I couldn't focus on it for two months.

282
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,760
Did you stop eating for two months?

283
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,080
- No.
- Right.

284
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,680
- Stopped bathing?
- No.

285
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,000
Then why did you stop studying?

286
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,640
Take a look at it, please!

287
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
Mr. Lobo!

288
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died.

289
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,520
Monday morning, I was here for my lecture.

290
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,320
I can give you sympathy.
Not an extension, I'm sorry.

291
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,360
<i>I lived all my life</i>

292
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,720
<i>As if it were the life of another</i>

293
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,240
<i>For just one moment</i>

294
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,880
<i>Let me live as I am</i>

295
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,840
<i>I lived all my life</i>

296
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,360
<i>As if it were the life of another</i>

297
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,560
<i>For just one moment</i>

298
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,280
<i>Let me live as I am</i>

299
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
This is an amazing design.

300
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,760
A wireless camera atop a helicopter!

301
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
This can be used for traffic updates
and security.

302
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,240
But Virus said that this is an
impractical design, it won't work.

303
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,440
We will make it work.

304
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,760
Don't tell Joy.
It will be a surprise for him.

305
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,680
We'll capture his reaction
through the window.

306
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,280
If we work on his project,
who will work on ours?

307
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,720
There are 42 exams per semester
including tests, oral exams and quizzes.

308
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,480
Don't be scared.

309
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,880
Place your hand over your heart
and say, "All is well."

310
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,880
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchoddas.

311
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,240
We had an old watchman
in our village.

312
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,080
He used to say this
during his night patrol.

313
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,320
And we slept peacefully.

314
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,040
Once, there was a theft

315
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night!

316
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,800
He used to yell, "All is well"
and we felt secure.

317
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,000
That day I understood that humans
tend to get scared very easily.

318
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,720
You need to trick your mind.

319
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,040
No matter what the problem,
always tell yourself that all is well.

320
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,000
That solves the problem?

321
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,040
No. But you gain courage to face it.

322
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,720
Remember it, bro.
We are going to really need it here.

323
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,080
<i>When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll</i>

324
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,800
<i>Let your lips roll
And whistle away</i>

325
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,160
<i>When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll</i>

326
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,960
<i>Just let your lips roll
And whistle away</i>

327
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,880
<i>All is well</i>

328
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,040
<i>The chicken is clueless
About the egg's fate</i>

329
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,880
<i>Will it hatch or become an omelet?</i>

330
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,720
<i>No one knows
What the future holds</i>

331
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,240
<i>So let your lips roll
And whistle away</i>

332
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,560
<i>- Whistle away...
- All is well</i>

333
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,480
<i>Bro, all is well</i>

334
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,680
<i>Buddy, all is well</i>

335
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,520
<i>Bro, all is well</i>

336
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,000
<i>Confusion and more confusion
No sign of any solution</i>

337
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,920
<i>Ah, finally a solution!
But wait, what was the question?</i>

338
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,040
<i>If the timid heart with fear
Is about to die</i>

339
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,960
<i>Then con it with this simple lie</i>

340
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,720
<i>The heart is an idiot
It will fall under that spell</i>

341
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,320
<i>Let your lips roll
And whistle away</i>

342
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,480
<i>- Whistle away...
- All is well</i>

343
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,600
<i>Bro, all is well</i>

344
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,520
<i>Buddy, all is well</i>

345
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,200
<i>Bro, all is well</i>

346
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,120
<i>Blew the scholarship on booze
But that did not dispel my blues</i>

347
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,920
<i>Holy incense lit up my plight
And yet God is nowhere in sight</i>

348
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,120
<i>The lamb is clueless
About its destination</i>

349
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,920
<i>Will it be served on skewers
Or simply minced</i>

350
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,880
<i>No one knows what the future holds</i>

351
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,320
<i>So, let your lips roll
And whistle away</i>

352
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,720
<i>- Whistle away...
- All is Well</i>

353
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,440
<i>Bro, all is well</i>

354
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,120
<i>Buddy, all is well</i>

355
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,240
<i>Bro, all is well</i>

356
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,480
<i>When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll</i>

357
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,320
<i>Just let your lips roll
And whistle away</i>

358
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,080
<i>All is well</i>

359
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,840
<i>The chicken is clueless
About the egg's fate</i>

360
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,960
<i>That's right</i>

361
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,200
<i>Will it hatch or become an omelet?</i>

362
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,680
<i>No one knows
What the future holds</i>

363
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,560
<i>So, let your lips roll
And whistle away</i>

364
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,120
<i>Whistle away!</i>

365
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,160
Eureka! Eureka!

366
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,960
<i>All is well...</i>

367
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,000
<i>Bro, all is well</i>

368
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,720
<i>Buddy, all is well</i>

369
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,280
<i>Bro, all is well</i>

370
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,440
Fly it up to Joy's window!

371
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,120
- Joy!
- Take it higher.

372
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,680
Look at that silly moron!

373
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,720
Such a jerk!

374
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,280
Joy, come out.

375
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,320
Joy!

376
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,640
Come to the window.

377
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,280
Joy, look outside!

378
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,640
Joy!

379
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,480
The police and Joy's father
have no clue.

380
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,200
Everyone thinks this is a suicide.

381
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,360
The postmortem report
mentions the cause of death.

382
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,400
All of them think that the pressure
on the jugular killed him.

383
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,040
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

384
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,840
That's missing in the report.

385
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,240
Engineers are a clever bunch.

386
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,720
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure.

387
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,680
If they had, everyone would know that...

388
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,800
this isn't suicide, it's a murder.

389
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,680
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

390
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,240
If a student can't handle
pressure, is it my fault?

391
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,160
Life is full of difficulties.
Will you always blame others?

392
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,200
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system.

393
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,640
Look at these statistics.
India ranks number one in suicide cases.

394
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,280
As per statistics,
the suicide rates among students

395
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,560
has increased.

396
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,800
More students die of suicide,
than of diseases.

397
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,440
Something is terribly wrong.

398
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
I can't speak for the rest.

399
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,800
I've run this place for 32 years!

400
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,440
We were ranked 28th.
Now, we are number one!

401
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,120
What's the point, sir?

402
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,920
Here, they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions.

403
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,640
They discuss grades.

404
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,360
All of them want a job in the States.

405
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,400
You teach them how to get good scores,
not how to learn efficiently.

406
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,600
How dare you lecture me!

407
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,800
Here is a self-proclaimed professor.

408
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,760
He thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers.

409
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,520
Professor Ranchoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering.

410
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,720
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms.

411
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,080
You may refer to your books.

412
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,600
Raise your hand
if you get the answer.

413
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,080
Let's see who comes up
with an answer first.

414
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,800
No one got the answer?

415
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,440
Now, rewind your life by a minute.

416
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,400
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

417
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,120
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

418
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,720
No. All of you got into a frantic race.

419
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,520
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first in such a race?

420
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,200
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure!

421
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,640
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker.

422
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,000
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip.

423
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,280
But you call such a lion
well trained, not well educated.

424
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,280
Just explain those two words.

425
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,120
Sir, these words don't exist.

426
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,600
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju.

427
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,040
Is this how you'll teach Engineering?

428
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Sir, I wasn't teaching Engineering.

429
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,120
You're an expert at that.

430
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,880
I was teaching you how to teach.

431
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
And I'm sure one day, you'll learn...

432
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,200
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students.

433
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,880
<i>I regret to inform you
that your respective sons</i>

434
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,080
<i>Farhan and Raju</i>

435
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,440
<i>have fallen into bad company.</i>

436
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,680
<i>Please look into the matter,
otherwise their future will be ruined.</i>

437
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,880
<i>Virus's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs.</i>

438
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,400
<i>Just like Hiroshima and Nagasaki
our homes plunged into a gloom.</i>

439
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,400
<i>Our parents invited us
for a dressing down.</i>

440
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,680
Come in...

441
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,880
Come in.

442
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,160
Do you see that?

443
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,040
We could afford only one air-conditioner.

444
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,200
We placed it in Farhan's room,
so that he could study comfortably.

445
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,600
I didn't buy a car.

446
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,200
I manage with a scooter.

447
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,920
I invested all my money
in Farhan's education.

448
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,240
We sacrificed our comforts for
Farhan's future. Do you get it?

449
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,320
And now after all this, I receive
a warning letter from the director.

450
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,200
Have you clicked these pictures, Farhan?

451
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,600
- Shut up.
- For a while, that was his passion.

452
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,120
He went around clicking
pictures of animals.

453
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,880
He wanted to become
a wildlife photographer.

454
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,360
Son, what was your score that year?

455
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,960
Did you hear that? A sudden drop
from 94 to 91 percent!

456
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,960
Do you find it funny?

457
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,120
No, I'm sorry.
I'm just amazed at the photos.

458
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,880
He should become a wildlife photographer,
not an engineer.

459
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,160
- He will...
- Shut up!

460
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,440
This is a humble request to you!
Don't ruin my son's future.

461
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,240
The food is on the table. Let's eat.

462
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,360
Let's go.

463
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,480
You should join us for a meal
the next time you visit us.

464
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,520
<i>Dad denied us a meal.</i>

465
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,600
<i>But we were hungry,</i>

466
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,960
<i>so we went over to Raju's place.</i>

467
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,760
<i>Raju's house was straight out of
a 50s black and white movie.</i>

468
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,440
<i>A small, dingy room.</i>

469
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,040
<i>A paralyzed father.</i>

470
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,960
<i>An ailing mother.</i>

471
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,760
<i>And an unwed sister.</i>

472
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,360
<i>A torn up sofa with sprouting springs.</i>

473
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,760
<i>And a 24-hour water supply
from the leaking roof.</i>

474
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,920
<i>His mother was a retired school teacher
and a tireless complainer.</i>

475
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,640
<i>His father was once a postmaster.</i>

476
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,360
<i>He was bedridden due to paralysis...</i>

477
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,040
<i>and lost his job.</i>

478
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,120
<i>And Raju's sister...</i>

479
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,840
Kammo has turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry.

480
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,960
You need to study and earn well,
so that we can get her married.

481
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,040
- Some okra?
- Yes, thank you.

482
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,000
Okra and cauliflower have
become very expensive.

483
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,680
They are looting us!

484
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,880
And to make things worse,
I got a warning letter from your college!

485
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,000
Mom!

486
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,800
- Cottage cheese?
- Yes.

487
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,280
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches.

488
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,640
- Cottage cheese?
- No, thanks.

489
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,400
Mom, please!

490
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,960
Alright, I'll shut up.

491
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,880
I earn for the family,
I slave like a maid

492
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,280
and then, I'm asked to keep my mouth shut.

493
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,560
I can't even share my
problems with my son.

494
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Raju.

495
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,720
<i>We were in a huge dilemma.</i>

496
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,360
<i>Were we supposed to comfort our friend,
or console his mother?</i>

497
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,360
<i>Anyway, we thought of focusing
on the cottage cheese.</i>

498
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,520
<i>Even his eczema cream costs 55 rupees!</i>

499
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,360
<i>Another roti?</i>

500
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,520
- No, thank you.
- We've had enough.

501
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,280
"Okra and cauliflower..."

502
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,160
"They have become very expensive."

503
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,160
At least you were offered a meal.

504
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,360
Unlike your sadistic father.
Hitler Qureshi!

505
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,440
And your mother was feeding us
eczema induced rotis!

506
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,120
- Don't poke fun at my mom!
- Enough, you guys.

507
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,680
I'm famished. Let's eat out.

508
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,160
It's the end of the month.
We have no money to eat out.

509
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,160
To eat out, you don't need money.
All you need is a uniform.

510
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,160
Look!

511
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,840
- Come on.
- Let's go.

512
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,320
- Good evening.
- Hello, good evening.

513
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
- Hello, good evening.
- Good evening.

514
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,560
- Good evening.
- Good evening...

515
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,520
- Three large vodkas.
- Half soda, half water.

516
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,960
I'm afraid, we'll get caught.

517
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,640
- What's for starters?
- Get double portions of everything.

518
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,840
- Give it to me.
- Yes.

519
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,800
And play some peppy music.

520
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,200
Why are you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

521
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,520
People will have a bad impression
about you, my fiancé.

522
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,600
You're going to be a doctor.
You shouldn't be wearing a cheap watch!

523
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,920
- May I hold your glass?
- Why?

524
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,600
So that you don't hit me with it.

525
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,560
Why would I do that?

526
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,000
For the free advice I'll now impart.

527
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,960
What?

528
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,800
Don't marry that ass of a man.

529
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,680
He's less of a human being,
and more of a price tag.

530
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,840
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices.

531
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,440
He'll ruin your life.

532
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,160
Want a demonstration?

533
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,760
Shall I find out the price of his shoes?

534
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,840
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself.

535
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,280
What the hell!
Mint sauce on my 300 dollar shoes!

536
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,480
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it.

537
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,600
Dad, are they your guests?

538
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,960
My students! Why are they here?

539
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,080
Hold on, Dad.

540
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,520
These beans smell great.

541
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,880
- There's no room for the roti.
- Just pile it on.

542
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,920
Okay.

543
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,200
That was an eye-opener.

544
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,120
It was my moral responsibility.

545
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,800
Dad won't let me break up with him.

546
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,560
Could you please speak to my father?
You are good at it!

547
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,560
Certainly!
Raju, the mint sauce please.

548
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,400
- Where is your dad?
- Right behind you.

549
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,960
Run for your life! It's free advice.

550
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,800
Take it or leave it.

551
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,560
What are you doing here?

552
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,440
We'll hand these gift cheques
to the couple.

553
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,680
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding!

554
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,880
Sister?

555
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,000
Sir, what's the total number
of daughters you have?

556
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,480
Empty! No gift cheques.

557
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,360
Forgot the cheques, Raju? Farhan?

558
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,680
We didn't invite you.
I'm sure the groom's family invited you.

559
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,960
No, sir. We are here as
the emissaries of science.

560
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,880
Really?

561
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,960
He explains things very well.
I'm sure he will.

562
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,400
Won't you?

563
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,200
Well, Delhi has plenty of power cuts...

564
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,880
that disrupt wedding celebrations
in the city.

565
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,280
So I thought of making
an inverter that

566
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,560
draws power from guests' cars.

567
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,760
I see!

568
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,560
Where's the inverter?

569
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,880
Sir, the design is ready.

570
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,240
Where's the design, Farhan?

571
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,400
- I gave you the design.
- I gave it to Raju.

572
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,280
Never mind the design.
I'll show you the inverter!

573
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,120
You can only invent stories...
not an inverter.

574
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,560
No, sir. I'll make one.

575
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,240
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented

576
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,320
at your daughter's wedding.

577
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,840
Farhan.

578
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,120
Raju!

579
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,720
I'll see you in my office tomorrow.

580
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,720
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse it to you...

581
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,640
in installments.

582
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,120
- We'll never crash a wedding again.
- Not even my own.

583
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,400
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he.

584
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,000
That's right. I won't get married.

585
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,720
Your parents shouldn't
have married either.

586
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,760
There would have been
two less idiots in the world.

587
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,480
This is Ranchoddas's father's
monthly income.

588
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,120
Two and a half crore rupees.

589
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,680
Couple of zeroes less...

590
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,320
and it is still a sizable income.

591
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,080
But erase another zero...

592
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,280
Isn't that your father's
monthly income, Farhan?

593
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,120
Now, take away another zero!

594
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,600
And that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi.

595
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,760
Take my advice.

596
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,440
And shift into Chatur Ramalingam's room.

597
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,680
The exams are near.
Stay with Rancho and you're sure to fail.

598
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,080
- Want a shave?
- No, sir.

599
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,800
Raju, don't worry.
This is Virus's move to split us.

600
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
- Don't worry...
- I have to worry!

601
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,360
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job.

602
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,160
Unlike you, I don't have a rich father.

603
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,080
Shut up, Raju!

604
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,680
Must we follow all his hogwash?

605
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,040
I won't follow him blindly, like you do.

606
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,760
- You're crossing the line.
- No, I'm drawing one!

607
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,880
I have a family to support!

608
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,160
Mom spends her entire salary
on Dad's medicines.

609
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,240
My sister is not getting married
because the boy demands a car in dowry.

610
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,120
Mom hasn't bought a single saree...
in five years.

611
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,920
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate.

612
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,800
How many sarees can you afford, per year?

613
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,160
No wisecracks about Mom!

614
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,080
We'll study diligently.
But not just for good grades.

615
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,760
Here's quoting a wise one.
"Study to be accomplished, not affluent."

616
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,800
Follow excellence.
And success will follow you!

617
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
Who said that?

618
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,960
His Holiness Guru Ranchoddas?

619
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,400
Go, rot in the bogs!

620
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,920
Raju, don't stress. We'll excel!

621
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,800
Shove this back into the tube.

622
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,520
<i>Raju shifted to another room.</i>

623
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,760
<i>His new roommate was Chatur.</i>

624
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,840
<i>Chatur was called "Silencer."</i>

625
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,720
<i>To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack.</i>

626
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,240
<i>And then, he used to let off
silent but lethal farts.</i>

627
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,560
Raju?

628
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,400
<i>He always blamed others for it.</i>

629
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,880
<i>Silencer studied 18 hours a day.</i>

630
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,240
On the eve of the exam,
he used to distract others.

631
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,880
<i>He believed that there are only two ways
to excel in the examinations.</i>

632
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,360
<i>Elevate your own grades,
or try to lower your opponents' grades.</i>

633
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,320
<i>Rancho decided to subdue Silencer
and rescue Raju</i>

634
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,880
<i>with a master plan.</i>

635
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,320
Our director...

636
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,840
has unceasingly served...

637
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,520
The meaning of served is...

638
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,280
I don't care what the meaning is.
I'll just memorize it.

639
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,720
Such a moron!

640
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,320
<i>Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teacher's Day function.</i>

641
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,400
<i>To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian</i>

642
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,520
<i>in highbrow Hindi.</i>

643
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,520
Hold on.
Chatur, there's a call for you.

644
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,440
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back.

645
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,840
Oh, the things I have to do!

646
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,000
Mr. Dubey, the director wants to meet you.

647
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,800
- Really?
- Yes. Right now.

648
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,400
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur.

649
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,160
Mr. Ramalingam?

650
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,120
I'm calling from the
Rajpat Nagar police station.

651
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,880
Are you from Uganda?

652
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,000
Your life is in danger!

653
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,400
Listen to me carefully.

654
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,240
Or else, you'll get killed as soon as
you step out of the college gate.

655
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,960
Why? What happened?

656
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,720
<i>While Chatur was kept engaged,</i>

657
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,960
<i>Rancho altered a few words
in his speech. For example...</i>

658
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,600
<i>Served became screwed.</i>

659
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,480
Yes, sir?

660
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,440
- Who are you?
- I'm Dubey, the librarian.

661
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,320
I'm a permanent staff member, sir.

662
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,760
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line.

663
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,360
Yes... So, where was I?

664
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,760
You said that I may die
outside the gate.

665
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,720
Right!

666
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,920
As soon as you get out of the gate,

667
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,200
you'll see a traffic signal.

668
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,880
When it turns red,
all the vehicles will halt.

669
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,680
- Then?
- Then cross the road with great caution.

670
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,440
There's a possibility that you might die
by being hit by a vehicle.

671
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,640
You're safe, my boy. Well done!

672
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,080
Silencer, this is for you
from the librarian.

673
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,960
Chanchad!

674
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,600
The director said that
he didn't call for me.

675
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,520
Well, I suppose he must have forgotten.

676
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,080
Forgotten?
You rascals!

677
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,960
Distinguished guests,
respected chairperson.

678
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,280
Our chief guest,
the Honorable Minister of Education.

679
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,560
Respected teachers and friends.

680
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,880
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere!

681
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,640
The credit goes solely to...

682
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,320
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.

683
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,480
Sir, I have written the speech.

684
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,080
For 32 years, he has...

685
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,280
unceasingly screwed the students
of this college.

686
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,520
He means, "served" the students.

687
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,040
I'm sure his endeavors will continue.

688
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,640
We are astounded at how a man,
in his lifetime

689
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,360
can screw so many people, so well.

690
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,560
With rigorous training,
he has built up his stamina.

691
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,080
He has spent every living minute

692
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,480
just screwing people around.

693
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,640
Let's replicate his methods.

694
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,480
Let him continue.

695
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,840
In the future, the students of ICE
will venture across the globe.

696
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,040
Wherever we go, we promise to screw
everyone and spread his legacy.

697
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,400
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world.

698
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,360
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw

699
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,600
cannot be matched by any student

700
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,000
anywhere on the planet!

701
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,840
Cannot be matched by any student.

702
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,560
Good evening, sir.

703
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,720
You have given this institution

704
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,160
what it sorely needs!

705
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,600
- Boodle...
- Bosom!

706
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,160
It's "Boodle!"

707
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,320
Not "Bosom!"

708
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,440
Utter nonsense! That's insulting.

709
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,400
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed.

710
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,440
No one offers it so readily.

711
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,680
That's ridiculous!

712
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,320
You have generously offered
your bosom

713
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,560
to this relentless screwer.

714
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,720
Now see how he makes it grow.

715
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,040
Is this what you teach here?

716
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,720
This is an insult to my stature!
Disgusting!

717
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,360
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse.

718
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,720
Listen to the might of his fart
in a Sanskrit verse.

719
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,480
A good loud fart is honorable...

720
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,960
"Fart?" Go, Silencer!

721
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,680
A medium fart is tolerable.

722
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,080
"Tolerable?"

723
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,360
The softer windbreaks are terrible.

724
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,160
"Softer windbreaks..."

725
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,840
And the silent ones... are unbearable!

726
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,600
That's what mindless cramming
does to you!

727
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,120
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

728
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,040
but it will screw you
for the next 40 years.

729
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,720
He still doesn't get it.

730
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,320
"The medium fart is tolerable..."

731
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,160
You're a poet, Rancho!

732
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,280
That was fun!
He didn't know what hit him.

733
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,840
What did I ever do to you?

734
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,640
Sorry, man.
Don't take it personally.

735
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,080
I will!

736
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,400
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult.

737
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:40,160
Sorry, man. We just wanted Raju to
know that he shouldn't cram blindly.

738
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,480
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science!

739
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,920
I'm not here to enjoy Science!

740
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,840
You're here to screw Science?

741
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,520
Go ahead!
Laugh at my methods.

742
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,720
But one day these methods
will bring me a lot of success!

743
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,920
One day, I'll be successful
and you will be a failure!

744
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,360
You're wrong, buddy.
Don't chase success.

745
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,320
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you.

746
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,480
You do it your way,
and I'll follow my methods.

747
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,520
Ten years from now, we'll meet right here.

748
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,120
Same day! Same place!
We'll see who's more successful.

749
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,720
You... or me?

750
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,600
Do you have the courage
to accept my challenge?

751
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,240
It's a challenge!

752
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,360
Watch it!

753
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,240
What's wrong with him?

754
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,600
What's he writing?

755
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,120
Don't forget this date.

756
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,560
I'm not used to such
expensive gifts, Suhas.

757
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,080
Get used to them, Pia.

758
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,160
- You edited the speech?
- What?

759
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,080
Don't lie!

760
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,560
Yes.

761
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,080
- Do you have a problem with my father?
- No way.

762
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,520
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look!

763
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,920
Oh, no!

764
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,840
Why are you harassing him?

765
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,040
He runs a factory, not a college.

766
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,840
Churning out asses!
Like that one.

767
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,040
She destroyed it, man.

768
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,240
How dare you call him an ass?

769
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,560
He is one!
He is an engineer, he studied MBA

770
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,400
and then he becomes
a banker in the States.

771
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,680
Because it rakes in more money?

772
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,360
Life for him is just
a profit and loss statement.

773
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,520
He sees profit in you,
that's why he is with you.

774
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,360
You are the director's daughter
and you'll be a doctor very soon.

775
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,880
He doesn't love you.

776
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,520
Who do you think you are?

777
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,480
How dare you say that he doesn't love me?

778
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,960
New watch? One moment, please.

779
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,120
You always need a demonstration.

780
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,160
Suhas!

781
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,800
Where were you?

782
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,520
She's looking for her watch.

783
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,760
Never mind. Get another one.

784
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,280
It is worth 4,00,000 rupees!

785
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,160
4,00,000!

786
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,120
Mine's a cheap one,
but it's just the same.

787
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,960
Now wear your ancient piece of junk
at dinner.

788
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,760
What are you staring at?

789
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,480
Here come the tears!

790
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,640
Stop crying and look for it.

791
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,360
Go and get yourself
another fiancé, you ass!

792
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,280
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face!

793
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,280
- It's too noisy here.
- Yes.

794
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,320
She was trying to thank me,
but I heard something else.

795
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,120
- I said, "Get lost."
- Don't get angry.

796
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,960
Actually, you never really loved him.

797
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:54,320
When you see him,
do the winds whisper a melody?

798
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,280
Does your scarf sway in the wind?

799
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,000
Does the moon appear gigantic?

800
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,840
That happens in movies, not in life.

801
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,160
It happens in real life too
if you love a person,

802
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,360
not an ass.

803
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,400
What?

804
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,400
Okay, I'm on my way. Bye!

805
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,320
You're a medical student!
I need your help.

806
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,720
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take?

807
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,440
You'll never deny help to a patient.
Remember the Hippocratic oath?

808
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,760
Please help me, it's an emergency!

809
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,160
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement,

810
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,760
my dad is popping BP pills
because of you...

811
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,520
and here I am, helping you!

812
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,840
I'm doing this only because
of the Hippocratic oath.

813
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,320
- Where's Raju?
- He's gone to get a cab.

814
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,120
I called the ambulance two hours ago.

815
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,880
In this country,
pizza gets delivered in 30 minutes

816
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,960
but an ambulance...

817
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,200
He needs urgent hospitalization.

818
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,160
Stop!

819
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,960
Move away!

820
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,840
Move away...

821
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,480
Move away!

822
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,840
Keep this.

823
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,320
Raju is here.

824
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,280
What the hell!
You brought Dad on the scooter?

825
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,640
I should have sent him by post?

826
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,560
No wisecracks about Dad's profession!
Where is he?

827
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,080
Go, ask the doctor.

828
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,800
We would have lost him
if there was any delay.

829
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,960
I'm glad you brought him here
on the scooter.

830
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,800
Call me if there's any problem.

831
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,040
Rancho!

832
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,920
Thanking your buddies!
Is Silencer teaching you good manners?

833
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,680
Didn't he teach you anything
about friendship?

834
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,320
Go on, now.
You have an exam tomorrow.

835
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,000
That's okay.
His father's health is more important.

836
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,600
We won't budge from here
without your father.

837
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,320
Don't worry!

838
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,080
Rancho, forgive me. I was scared.

839
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,360
It's okay. Calm down.

840
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,800
Please forgive me.

841
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,960
Calm down.

842
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,080
It's okay, calm down.
Go, see your dad.

843
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,160
Don't go in there
with that weepy face.

844
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,240
Go.

845
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,760
Get going.

846
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,960
<i>He was our dearest friend</i>

847
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,360
Thank God for your scooter,
it saved his father's life.

848
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,840
It's a good one.
How much does it cost?

849
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,160
I'll tell you when you pour
some mint sauce over it.

850
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,400
It's not the 15th of August.

851
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,760
For you, it is! You are free
to wear your mom's watch.

852
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,000
No ass can say that it's
an ancient piece of junk.

853
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,920
How did you know that
it was my mom's watch?

854
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,880
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes.

855
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,720
Only the watch was old.

856
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,560
What could that mean?

857
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,520
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

858
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,480
Yes.

859
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,080
Your mom must have been really beautiful.

860
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,200
Yes. How do you know that?

861
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,640
Your dad is ugly.

862
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,960
<i>The winds</i>

863
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,360
<i>Whisper a melody</i>

864
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:45,960

01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:52,960

01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,560

01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,320
<i>Leaves sing on their branches
Bees jam with flowers</i>

873
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,240
<i>Crazy sunbeams dance off petals
As birds yodel in the skies</i>

874
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,520
<i>Flowers, bold and brazen
Snuggle and cuddle</i>

880
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,400
<i>Let's learn how to make some mint sauce.</i>

881
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,760
<i>The all-powerful sauce that
exposes phony people.</i>

882
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,080
<i>- The mint...
- You have a bright future.</i>

883
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,640
<i>Shunning an ass,
you'll fall for a human.</i>

884
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,760
<i>The time is ripe for love.</i>

885
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,240
<i>The temperature in New Delhi
remains stable.</i>

886
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,520
<i>Clear skies.
But if in love, expect rain.</i>

887
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,360
<i>Pitter-patter go the raindrops
Whish-whoosh whistles the wind</i>

Hello, wake up!

907
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,040
- Is he dead?
- What!

908
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:47,960
No!

909
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,280
It's 8:30 a.m.
Your exam starts at 9:00 a.m.

910
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,160
But we can't leave him alone.

911
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,080
I'm here!
It's just a matter of three hours.

912
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:57,960
Take my scooter.

913
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,960
The watch looks really old.

914
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,520
- Sorry, we are late.
- It was an emergency!

915
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,080
Five minutes more, please.
We started half an hour late.

916
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,720
<i>He glared at us like we had
asked for both his kidneys.</i>

<i>But we continued writing.</i>

918
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,840
<i>He continued arranging
the answer sheets.</i>

919
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,120
I'm done!

920
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,360
You are late, I can't accept these.

921
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,040
Sir, do you know who we are?

922
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,280
Even if you are the minister's son,
I don't care.

923
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,840
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

924
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,240
No.

925
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,920
Who are you?

926
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,920
He doesn't know us! Run!

927
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,720
Hey, what's your roll number?

928
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,600
Where the hell... are their papers?

929
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,600
O Lord, have mercy.

930
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:59,240
<i>The results were going to be out.
It was time to pray to God.</i>

01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,560
Help me excel in Electronics,
I'll offer You a coconut!

932
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,880
God, help me excel in Physics,
I promise You a pint of milk per day.

933
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,480
God, help me excel in all the subjects.

934
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,000
God, I will stop behaving like a creep!

935
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,600
Watch over my results!

936
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,920
God, I'll offer hundred rupees
every month!

937
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,160
<i>Hundred rupees is not good enough
to bribe a traffic cop,</i>

938
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,680
<i>let alone the Almighty.</i>

939
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,840
Check from the bottom.

940
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,840
Your name appears at the end of the list.

941
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,600
What about you?

942
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,280
Rancho?

943
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,760
I can't see his name here.

944
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,880
<i>We were sad.</i>

945
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,680
<i>Not because our ranks were low,
but because our friend had failed.</i>

946
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,160
What is Silencer howling about?

947
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,840
- He got the second rank.
- Damn!

948
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,120
Who's first?

949
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,360
Rancho.

950
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,120
Rancho?

951
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,240
What the hell! Move aside.

952
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,920
<i>We learnt a lesson
about human behavior.</i>

953
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,400
If your friend fails, you feel bad.

954
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,840
But if your friend succeeds
exceedingly well, you feel worse.

955
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,600
We were sad. But two other
people were heartbroken.

956
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,000
Ranchoddas Chanchad.

957
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,040
Uday Sinha.

958
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,160
Alok Mittal.

959
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,200
Sahili Rao.

960
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,280
Sir, is it necessary to sit
according to your ranks?

961
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,640
Any problem with that?

962
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,680
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system.

963
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,360
The A graders are treated like masters.
And the C graders are treated like slaves.

964
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,600
Are you suggesting a change?

965
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,160
Yes. The results should not be
displayed at all.

966
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,520
Why publicize someone's flaws?

967
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,400
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe a tonic

968
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,160
or air your report on TV?

969
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,640
I should go to each student's room...

970
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,720
and whisper it in their ears.

971
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,840
"You haven't done well."

972
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,440
"Oh, I'm so sorry, you have failed."

973
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,840
No, sir. That's not what I meant.

974
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,800
I'm sitting next to you
because I scored high.

975
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,280
My friends didn't score well,
so they are sitting out there.

976
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,600
At least, they are here!

977
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,200
If they spend more time with you,
they'll fail.

978
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,720
They won't pass their examinations
and they won't find a job.

979
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,480
They'll find a job, sir.

980
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,960
There are companies that prefer
hiring humans, not machines.

981
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,520
They'll be hired, for sure.

982
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,880
- Govind.
- Yes, sir?

983
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,440
Even if one of them gets a job
through the campus interviews...

984
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,360
shave off my mustache.

985
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:30,120
Okay, sir!

986
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,840
Jackass! You just farted, didn't you?

987
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,640
It smells like a septic tank!

988
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,960
Popping those pills again?

989
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,600
- Raju?
- Raju...

990
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,520
This is a familiar stink.

991
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,440
His farts have caused global warming.

992
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,280
Give me your wallet.
I'll buy a pair of pants.

993
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,280
Take Chatur's suit instead.

994
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,600
Rancho will recognize you
even in your underwear.

995
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,800
- Help us with this address, please.
- I wish I could read.

996
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,360
- He can't read.
- But he can speak.

997
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,520
Sir, do you know a man named
Ranchoddas Chanchad?

998
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,280
Yes, he lives up there.

999
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:46,080
<i>He was free as the wind</i>

1000
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,400
Let's go!

1001
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,640
CHANCHAD HOUSE.

1002
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:54,160
<i>Free like a soaring kite</i>

1003
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,320
<i>Where did he go?
Let's find him</i>

1004
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,840
- Chatur, your pills.
- Thanks. Where were they?

1005
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,800
In the pocket.

1006
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,320
We are friends, we must share our things...

1007
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,600
- Take them off!
- Stop it!

1008
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,280
People will misinterpret it, you moron!
Let me go.

1009
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,120
What happened?

1010
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,560
{\an8}MR. SHAMALDAS CHANCHAD.

1011
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,320
Excuse me, where is Ranchoddas?

1012
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,120
There he is.

1013
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,760
Rancho.

1014
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,840
We are looking for Ranchoddas.

1015
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,080
That's me.

1016
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:17,160
No, I mean...
Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad.

1017
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,240
Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad.
That's me.

1018
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,680
Ranchoddas, take care of yourself.

1019
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,240
Ranchoddas Chanchad.

1020
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,120
Raju.

1021
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,080
I drove from Delhi to Shimla
without wearing any pants.

1022
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,280
That too, for the wrong guy!

1023
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,680
The same name, the same degree,
the same photo, but a different guy.

1024
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,640
What's going on?

1025
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,880
How did Silencer get Rancho's address?

1026
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:36,840
Good question!

1027
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,400
Chatur, come here.

1028
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,640
Phunsukh Bangdu? Who's that?

1029
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:11,040
It took me a year to get
an appointment with him.

1030
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,960
Forget Wangdu.
How did you get Rancho's address?

1031
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,880
He led me to Rancho, see this.

1032
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,160
My secretary was here to get
an appointment with Mr. Wangdu.

1033
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:37,360
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho.

1034
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:42,680
I checked the Shimla city directory
and found Rancho's name.

1035
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,640
What happened to his face?

1036
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,240
Did he undergo a plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1037
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,200
Only one man has the answer.

1038
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,240
I couldn't fulfill your last wish.

1039
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,120
You kept asking me to
take you on a pilgrimage.

1040
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,480
But I waited for the initiation
of the highway tender.

1041
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:12,160
You died as soon as the
tender was released.

1042
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,960
No way!

1043
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,120
You are an engineer.
You flaunt your degrees on the wall!

1044
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,640
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested.

1045
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,960
You are the one who will be arrested.
We know the truth.

1046
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:40,200
You use the degree to
clinch high-end contracts.

1047
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,200
That's our friend's degree.

1048
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,200
How did you get it?

1049
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,080
This is a 150 acre estate.

1050
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,480
If I kill you and bury your body,
no one would even notice.

1051
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,360
I'm taking my father's ashes
to the sacred river.

1052
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,360
Should I take yours as well?

1053
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,040
Grab that!

1054
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,920
Here, here!

1055
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,880
Give it to me!

1056
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,400
Tell us the truth, or your father's ashes
will be flushed down the drain!

1057
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,320
- Hand it over to me!
- Down the sewer, I say!

1058
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,440
Get it away from there.

1059
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,120
If you pull the trigger,
I'll flush this down.

1060
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,560
I'll count to three.

1061
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:51,240
We are not scared of you!
Raju, scatter the ashes.

1062
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,760
One.

1063
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:59,480
Take us down, and your father's ashes
go down the drain as well.

1064
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,960
- Two!
- You'll have to get the ashes out

1065
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,000
of the gutter.

1066
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:04,960
What is it, Raju?

1067
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,720
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty!

1068
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,440
Empty?

1069
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,080
- Empty?
- We'll empty it out!

1070
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,040
No, no!

1071
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,880
We'll empty it out!

1072
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,080
No!

1073
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,480
Tell us!

1074
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,440
Who are you?

1075
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:27,680
I am Ranchoddas.

1076
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,280
Trust me, it's true!

1077
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,200
I am Ranchoddas!
That was Chhote.

1078
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,080
Chhote?

1079
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,080
He was our gardener's son.

1080
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,200
People called him Chhote.

1081
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,800
He stayed with us
after he was orphaned.

1082
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,280
He did odd jobs around the house.

1083
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,360
Running the usual errands and
taking care of household chores.

1084
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,040
He had a passion for learning.

1085
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,720
<i>He used to wear my old uniform
and slip into school.</i>

1086
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,480
<i>And he used to attend any class he liked.</i>

1087
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,360
<i>I made him do my homework,
and appear for the examinations</i>

1088
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,240
<i>on my behalf.</i>

1089
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,440
<i>It was going well, until one day...</i>

1090
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,440
<i>our teacher saw a sixth grader
solving a tenth grade math question.</i>

1091
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,960
Which grade are you in, son?

1092
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,320
What's your name?

1093
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,120
<i>We got caught.</i>

1094
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,600
My father was a powerful man,

1095
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:35,040
so our teacher alerted him
before speaking to the principal.

1096
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,320
You started it, and you will finish it.

1097
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,600
People pretend to respect me.

1098
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,400
But in my absence...

1099
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,320
they make fun of me
because I am an illiterate.

1100
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,800
I won't let that happen to my son.

1101
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:58,000
This boy wants to study.
I want him to earn a degree for my son.

1102
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,400
Let this continue.

1103
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,000
Make sure he goes on to study Engineering.

1104
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,280
And I'll have a degree in my son's name,
placed on that wall.

1105
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,440
I went to London for four years,
and he went to college on my behalf.

1106
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,480
He had promised Dad...

1107
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,960
that he won't keep in touch with anyone
after he graduates.

1108
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,400
But he always said to me...

1109
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,640
"Two idiots will come looking for me.

1110
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,960
That's for sure."

1111
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,280
He misses the both of you.

1112
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,800
I'll give you his address.

1113
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,400
Go, meet him.

1114
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,960
But please keep my secret.

1115
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,880
- Trust us.
- Yes.

1116
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:09,040
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Your father's ashes are in here.

1117
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,600
Who was that guy?

1118
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,920
It's a complicated story,
you won't get it.

1119
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,320
- Ignore it.
- Where are we going?

1120
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,440
Ladakh.

1121
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,320
Ladakh!

1122
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,440
To meet Rancho.

1123
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,360
What is he doing... in Ladakh?

1124
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,960
I don't know.
But I have the address of a school.

1125
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,480
And look at him.

1126
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,480
Next week I'll sign a multimillion
dollar deal with Phunsukh Wangdu.

1127
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,360
And look at him.

1128
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,600
<i>Now, I respect Rancho even more.</i>

1129
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,720
<i>Most of us went to college
just for a degree.</i>

1130
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:04,320
<i>No degree meant no job,
no marriage</i>

1131
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,160
<i>no credit card and no social status.</i>

1132
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,480
<i>None of this mattered to him.</i>

1133
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,520
<i>He was in college
for the joy of learning.</i>

1134
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,880
<i>He was not obsessed about success,
nor afraid of failure.</i>

1135
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,800
Who was the first man on the Moon?

1136
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,720
Who was the second?

1137
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,920
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers.

1138
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:39,680
You'll have a job
even before your final exam.

1139
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,760
Get ready!

1140
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:59,320
Sir, if a student gets a job

1141
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,160
but... he fails the final exam
by a tiny margin,

1142
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,760
will he still have the job?

1143
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,800
Anyone else with the same question?

1144
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,600
Hurry up.

1145
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,880
For the last four years

1146
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,560
they've been our most
consistent students.

1147
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,160
Consistently last in every exam!

1148
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:50,120
Their brains will fetch a handsome price
if they were to be sold in the bazaar.

1149
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,720
Because they are unused.

1150
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,960
The exams won't affect their jobs.

1151
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,440
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1152
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,560
They are very unique and their names
will be written in gold.

1153
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,720
"Farhanitrate" and "Prerajulization."

1154
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:26,840
He screwed us! Such an insult!

1155
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,840
In front of everyone.

1156
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,680
God, I'll give up on meat!
I'll light a 1000 incense sticks!

1157
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,640
Do me just one favor!

1158
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,080
I want You to kill Virus!

1159
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,840
Let him burn in the fires of hell!

1160
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,560
Make sure that he suffers!

1161
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,040
You think God is a contract killer?

1162
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,880
Shut up!

1163
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,320
You're sitting next to Virus
in every yearbook photo.

1164
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,280
We are always at the back.

1165
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,120
This year I think we won't even
be a part of the photograph.

1166
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,320
- Want to know the secret to my success?
- Yes.

1167
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,240
I love machines.

1168
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,800
Engineering is my passion.

1169
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,080
What's your passion?

1170
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,440
- That's my bag.
- Shut up.

1171
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,640
What are you up to?

1172
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,520
Damn it!

1173
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,040
This is your passion!

1174
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,600
You need to mail this letter.

1175
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,240
What letter?

1176
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,960
Five years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer.

1177
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,000
- Andre...
- Istvan.

1178
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,400
Yes! Istvan.

1179
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,760
He wanted to go to Hungary
and be his student.

1180
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:46,840
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
he never mailed the letter.

1181
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,920
Quit Engineering and pursue photography.

1182
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,760
Follow your heart, your talent.

1183
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,640
If Michael Jackson's father
had forced him to become a boxer...

1184
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,800
If Mohammad Ali's father
had pushed him to become a singer...

1185
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:07,760
Imagine the disaster!

1186
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,160
Do you get it?

1187
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,760
He loves photography,
but he wants to get into Engineering.

1188
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,560
Your Holiness Guru Ranchoddas!

1189
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:29,800
Engineering is my passion
as well as my ambition.

1190
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,480
- But I still fail. Why?
- Explain!

1191
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,960
Because you are a coward,
you are scared of the future.

1192
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:42,920
Look at this!
I see more holy rings than fingers.

1193
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,520
One ring per fear.
Exam, sister's dowry and the job.

1194
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,560
With such fear for the future,
how will you enjoy the present?

1195
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,000
That is why you can't
focus on your studies.

1196
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,080
Strange friends! One lives in fear,
the other in pretense.

1197
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:04,320
You live in fear as well as pretense.

1198
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,160
- No way.
- You're scared to tell Pia you love her,

1199
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,240
so you pretend you don't.

1200
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,760
That's rubbish!

1201
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:19,160
It's easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it!

1202
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,480
If you have the courage,
go and talk to Pia.

1203
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,640
- There's no connection here...
- There's a deep connection, Your Holiness!

1204
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:32,000
Listen, if you tell Pia how you feel...

1205
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,640
I'll tell Dad that I don't
want to be an engineer,

1206
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,640
I want to be a photographer.

1207
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:41,320
And I'll throw my rings away
before the job interview.

1208
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:42,680
Deal?

1209
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,080
Do you have the courage to do so?

1210
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,800
His Holiness is speechless.

1211
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,440
Let's go.

1212
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,000
- Follow me.
- Where?

1213
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:01,960
Where to?

1214
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,440
- Let's go.
- Where?

1215
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,840
Hey, Virus! I'm antivirus!

1216
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,360
Is there a dog in here?

1217
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,720
Cowards! Let's go in.

1218
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:19,320
If there's any danger,
I'll let you guys know.

1219
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:30,920
Come on.

1220
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,760
We hate you, Virus!

1221
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,600
Do you need a background score?

1222
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:54,760
- Pia.
- Who is it?

1223
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:01,040
Don't yell!
It's me, Ranchoddas Chanchad.

1224
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,080
I have something to tell you.
I'll leave once I do.

1225
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,760
<i>'Cause I can't help
Falling in love with you...</i>

1226
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,040
-Pia
-Yes?

1227
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,280
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter...

1228
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,480
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life.

1229
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:29,760
I could spend an eternity...
with you on the scooter.

1230
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,680
<i>Falling in love with you...</i>

1231
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:39,600
Every night you ride into my dreams...

1232
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,960
on your scooter, dressed as a bride.

1233
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,320
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet.

1234
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,480
And you come closer to kiss me.

1235
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,640
But we don't kiss each other.

1236
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,320
Why?

1237
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,640
Because our noses collide,
and I wake up.

1238
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,320
The noses never collide, stupid!

1239
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,200
I thought you were Pia.

1240
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,640
I wish I was!

1241
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,680
Mona! Why did you interrupt?

1242
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,880
It took him four years to say this.

1243
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,920
Pia, let him know that noses don't
collide when you kiss someone.

1244
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,920
You have my permission, kiss him!

1245
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:29,360
- Who is this?
- My sister.

1246
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,280
Who are you?

1247
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,400
When you were talking...

1248
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,880
He? How do you know
it's a "he" or a "she"?

1249
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:52,040
Dad asked the astrologer if we'd
be having an engineer or a doctor.

1250
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:53,680
Why?

1251
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:56,760
The boy grows up to be an engineer,
and the girl, a doctor.

1252
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:02,800
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here, there's a circus.

1253
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:07,400
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip.

1254
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:09,000
Run for your life!

1255
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,800
He would want you to become an engineer.

1256
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:18,600
But you should follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1257
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:22,440
put your hand on your heart
and say, "All is well."

1258
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:27,160
Say it again.

1259
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,680
He kicked again!

1260
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:33,720
Pia!

1261
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:34,840
Say it again.

1262
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,600
Who is it?

1263
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:53,640
You sent a "hate-mail" to Dad,
here's a "pee-mail" for you!

1264
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:57,960
<i>A "pee-mail" for you!</i>

1265
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,160
No...

1266
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,280
Who is it?

1267
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:02,920
Who...

1268
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,200
- Who is it?
- Your future son-in-law!

1269
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,600
And the wedding party.

1270
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,560
Rastogi!

1271
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,640
Guard, follow them.

1272
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:15,880
Where is Raju Rastogi?

1273
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,000
Where were you last night?

1274
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,680
- He was studying all night.
- Studying?

1275
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:38,400
He hasn't slept well,
that's why he looks scruffy.

1276
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,360
Really?

1277
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,520
What did you study?

1278
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,440
The whole chapter.

1279
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:46,600
Whole chapter?

1280
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,800
Raju!

1281
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,360
Mr. Rastogi!

1282
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,960
Can you type?

1283
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:33,120
Yes, sir.

1284
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,720
Will you type a letter for me?

1285
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:56,520
Please delete that.

1286
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,800
This will kill my dad!

1287
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:30,800
He lives just to see me
become an engineer.

1288
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,040
You should have thought about that
before peeing on my door.

1289
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:38,040
Sir, please give me one chance.

1290
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:45,560
Okay.

1291
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,040
Instead of your name...

1292
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:51,400
mention Ranchoddas Chanchad's name.

1293
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:54,880
I know he was with you last night.

1294
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:59,400
Be my witness... and I'll spare you.

1295
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:06,880
You can think about it
until I'm done shaving.

1296
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:56,840
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1297
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:03,480
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1298
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,600
<i>The heavens may beckon you</i>

1299
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,760
<i>But we'll take up arms against God</i>

1300
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:17,640
<i>And it's not a fight we intend to lose</i>

1301
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:21,200
<i>You may try your best to escape</i>

1302
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,360
<i>Try with all your might</i>

1303
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:27,000
<i>But there is no way we'll let you go</i>

1304
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:30,720
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1305
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:37,280
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1306
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:42,720
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1307
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:48,160
Rancho, watch that monitor.

1308
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:49,720
Raju.

1309
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,960
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert.

1310
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:58,600
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him.

1311
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:04,520
Speak to him normally, motivate him,
crack a joke, be happy.

1312
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:10,040
Good news, Raju!
Your dad has recovered.

1313
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,560
The new medicine worked.

1314
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:14,680
Is this your family tradition?

1315
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,520
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1316
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:20,320
Come on, wake up.

1317
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,480
Your dad wants Pia's scooter.

1318
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,880
Should I give it to him?
I hope he knows how to ride it.

1319
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:36,200
Raju, Farhan is live on the webcam.

1320
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:41,080
<i>Look! Virus has cancelled
your suspension order.</i>

1321
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,640
Wake up, now.

1322
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,480
Everything is okay!
You hear that?

1323
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:49,560
Rise and shine, buddy.

1324
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:54,160
<i>In this journey of few strides</i>

1325
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:57,240
<i>On the path called life</i>

1326
01:48:57,320 --> 01:49:03,000
<i>Don't quit
Just celebrate the ride</i>

1327
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,800
<i>Please listen to those who love you</i>

1328
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,840
<i>Every dark night is followed by sunrise</i>

1329
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:15,000
<i>Don't shut out those who love you</i>

1330
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:21,200
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1331
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:27,320
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1332
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:33,640
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1333
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:39,600
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1334
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,760
Look! Your mother bought a new saree!

1335
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,720
It costs 2,000 rupees. Look!

1336
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:52,240
Wake up, now!

1337
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,200
She bought ten sarees!

1338
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:56,560
Look!

1339
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,480
Hey, Raju!

1340
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:02,440
Raju! How do I look?

1341
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,480
<i>Remember the letters mom would write</i>

1342
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,680
<i>She always blessed you with eternal life</i>

1343
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,720
<i>Don't let her be disappointed</i>

1344
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,200
<i>Look at us now, don't turn away</i>

1345
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,280
<i>Smile once to show you care</i>

1346
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:26,720
<i>Wake up, don't torment us anymore</i>

1347
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:38,600
Did you hear about your sister?

1348
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,040
She's getting married.

1349
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,280
Without offering any dowry!

1350
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:49,760
The bridegroom wants nothing at all.

1351
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,200
He just wants to marry Kammo.

1352
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:57,720
- You know who the bridegroom is?
- Yes...

1353
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,640
Guess!

1354
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,640
- You know him very well.
- Yes.

1355
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,320
- He loves animals.
- What?

1356
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,040
Yes! He's going to be a
wildlife photographer.

1357
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,640
Quiet!

1358
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,800
Didn't get it? It's Farhan!

1359
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:14,720
Farhan will never take any dowry.

1360
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:19,280
Farhan will marry your sister.

1361
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,280
For free!

1362
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,520
- Raju!
- Raju!

1363
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:32,720
Raju!

1364
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:37,280
<i>He would've woken up even if we
were to offer vegetables for free.</i>

1365
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,240
<i>Why put my life at stake?</i>

1366
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,560
It's decided!
Farhan will marry your sister.

1367
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,800
Rancho!

1368
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,480
Rascals! Stop lying.

1369
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:56,600
Lucky escape!

1370
01:51:56,680 --> 01:52:02,600
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1371
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:08,960
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1372
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:15,280
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1373
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:21,400
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1374
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:27,360
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1375
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,680
OKRA COSTS TWELVE RUPEES.

1376
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,720
<i>We won't let you die</i>

1377
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,920
- Did you call for a taxi?
- I did.

1378
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:43,800
Why?

1379
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,160
I'm going for a job interview.

1380
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,600
You're coming with me?

1381
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:51,400
No. You're going home.
I'm going for the interview.

1382
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:52,840
Why would I go home?

1383
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:57,440
Remember... the promise?

1384
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,800
Give me your tie.

1385
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,120
Why?

1386
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:09,080
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this.

1387
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:10,840
What's that?

1388
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:13,760
- A letter.
- For you, from Hungary.

1389
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,680
From a photographer called Andre Istvan.

1390
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,000
You mailed my letter!

1391
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,720
He loved your pictures.

1392
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,720
He wants you to assist him.

1393
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,960
You get to work in the
Brazilian rain forest, for a year.

1394
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,800
He will pay you as well.

1395
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,520
Dad will never agree.

1396
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:58,320
Go, speak to him.

1397
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,040
For once, dump your fears.

1398
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:07,480
Otherwise you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

1399
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:10,320
The letter is in your hand,
and the taxi is at the gate.

1400
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:14,200
With a little bit of courage,
you can turn your life around.

1401
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,360
Do you think he'll like it?

1402
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,200
It's such an expensive gift.

1403
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,640
Our son is getting his first job today.

1404
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:33,920
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment!

1405
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:36,440
Farhan?

1406
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:43,520
Don't you have a job interview today?

1407
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:46,200
I didn't go there.

1408
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,240
I don't want to be an engineer, Dad.

1409
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:55,080
What happened?

1410
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:04,520
I jumped down...
from the third floor of that building.

1411
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,800
Because I was rusticated from college.

1412
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:14,560
Why?

1413
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:19,680
I was drunk and I urinated
outside the director's door.

1414
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:25,400
Rancho is messing with your mind!

1415
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:29,320
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd be a terrible engineer.

1416
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:35,600
Rancho has a simple belief. He says,
"Make your passion your profession."

1417
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,480
Then work will become play.

1418
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:39,560
What will you earn in that jungle?

1419
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,360
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot.

1420
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,840
Five years from now...

1421
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:49,960
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself.

1422
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:53,880
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then, I'll curse you.

1423
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,360
I'd rather curse myself, Dad.

1424
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,000
People will laugh at you!

1425
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:02,480
They will call you a loser
for quitting in the final year.

1426
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,520
Mr. Kapoor says that you are
fortunate to be studying at ICE.

1427
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:08,400
What do I tell him now?

1428
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,640
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner.

1429
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,840
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well.

1430
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:20,440
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders.

1431
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,600
You did all that, Dad.

1432
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:32,120
How you feel, matters to me.
I don't care about Mr. Kapoor.

1433
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:35,040
I don't even know his first name.

1434
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:37,960
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1435
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,760
Enough, he's upset.

1436
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:44,320
God forbid, what if he does
something crazy like Raju did?

1437
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,040
So, the discussion is over.

1438
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,960
Don't say a word,
or they will try to kill themselves.

1439
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:57,200
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise.

1440
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:03,120
My friend Rancho, whom you detest...

1441
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:07,200
forced me to place this picture
in my wallet.

1442
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,440
He told me to look at it...

1443
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,880
if a suicidal thought crosses my mind...

1444
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:17,400
and imagine your pain
if you were to see me dead.

1445
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:26,400
I want to convince you, Dad.

1446
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,160
But not with a suicide threat.

1447
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:37,440
Dad, what will happen
if I become a photographer?

1448
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,920
I'll earn a little less.

1449
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:41,440
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car.

1450
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,880
But I'll be happy.

1451
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:51,040
Whatever I do for you,
will be out of genuine love.

1452
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,120
I've always obeyed you.

1453
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:57,440
For once, let me listen to my heart.

1454
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,400
Dad.

1455
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,760
Please don't walk away.

1456
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,880
Return this.

1457
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:22,640
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1458
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:25,520
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1459
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,800
If you need more money, just ask for it.

1460
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:39,400
Go, follow your dreams, my son.

1461
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,960
Why are your grades consistently poor?

1462
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:47,680
Fear.

1463
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:50,000
I was a good student since childhood.

1464
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:52,680
My parents hoped
that I would end their poverty.

1465
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:55,440
That scared me.

1466
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:00,240
Here, everyone is very competitive.
You don't count if you're not first.

1467
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:02,880
My fear grew.

1468
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:09,120
I slipped on holy rings over my fingers
and prayed frantically.

1469
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:14,040
It was almost as if I was
asking God for favors.

1470
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect.

1471
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:21,920
Finally, some sense dawned on me.

1472
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:28,120
Today, I didn't ask for anything.
I just thanked God for this life.

1473
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:34,320
If you reject me, I'll have no regrets.

1474
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:38,600
Because I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life.

1475
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:44,120
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm.

1476
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:48,800
We need someone who is diplomatic
to handle clients.

1477
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,160
You're extremely straightforward.

1478
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:57,160
If you assure us

1479
01:59:57,240 --> 02:00:01,040
that you'll have some control
over your attitude

1480
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:04,160
then... we may consider you.

1481
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,320
It took me two broken legs
to build up this self-confidence.

1482
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:13,880
It wasn't easy to get this attitude.

1483
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:15,760
I can't change myself, sir.

1484
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:21,200
You can keep your job...

1485
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:23,920
I'll keep my attitude.

1486
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:30,440
Wait.

1487
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:36,160
I've interviewed countless candidates
for 25 years.

1488
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,160
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job.

1489
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:40,800
You are unique!

1490
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,200
Shall we discuss the salary?

1491
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:29,600
Your Majesty, thou art great!

1492
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:33,040
Accept this humble offering.

1493
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:39,040
<i>He was our dearest friend</i>

1494
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:47,200
<i>He who touched our hearts and vanished</i>

1495
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:55,280
<i>Where did he go?
Let's find him</i>

1496
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:11,480
Govind!

1497
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:16,840
You had asked me to shave it off
when they get a job!

1498
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:24,720
What have you done?

1499
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:31,400
I feel naked without my mustache.

1500
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:35,480
I've lost my dignity.

1501
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:39,840
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi.

1502
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:44,960
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam.

1503
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:49,760
I'll make sure that the questions
are extremely tough to answer.

1504
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:07,840
Rastogi, you're dead meat!

1505
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:16,400
Why are you here?

1506
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:20,360
Be careful.

1507
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:29,000
- You've been drinking?
- Yes, I'm a little drunk.

1508
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,680
Little? I think you're quite drunk.

1509
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,680
- I needed courage.
- For what?

1510
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:36,960
- For stealing this.
- What's this?

1511
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:42,000
The duplicate key to Virus's office.

1512
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:46,480
The question papers are
inside a red envelope.

1513
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:51,000
Dad wants to make sure that
Raju fails in the examinations.

1514
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:52,520
Go, get the papers!

1515
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:56,160
That's cheating!

1516
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:05,600
Tell me something.

1517
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,320
Do you think that the noses collide
while two people kiss?

1518
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:24,120
Wait a minute. Have some <i>Dhokla.</i>

1519
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:29,240
You Gujaratis are very cute.

1520
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:32,920
But why do your food items
have such dangerous names?

1521
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:39,320
<i>Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra!</i>

1522
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:42,240
The names sound like missiles.

1523
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:43,280
Let's go.

1524
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:45,840
"Today, Bush bombarded Iraq
with two <i>Dhoklas!</i>

1525
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,120
400 dead, 200 injured!"

1526
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:50,440
Let's go.

1527
02:04:55,920 --> 02:05:00,320
I can deal with the weird food names.
But not your last name.

1528
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:03,280
Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad.

1529
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:08,240
I won't change my last name
after we get married.

1530
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:12,680
Pia, I can't marry you.

1531
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:16,960
Why?

1532
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,160
Is there someone else?

1533
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:22,400
No.

1534
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:24,360
- Are you gay?
- No.

1535
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:28,120
Then why don't you propose to me?

1536
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:33,320
Are you impotent?

1537
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:41,040
Stop, stop!

1538
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:43,480
- What happened?
- We didn't inform Pia.

1539
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:47,920
Are you in touch with her?

1540
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,200
- No! But I have her phone number.
- Call her up, I'll stop the car.

1541
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:52,200
Yes.

1542
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,280
There aren't enough washrooms
in this country.

1543
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,640
- Is Pia there?
- No.

1544
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,760
Is she at the hospital?

1545
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,480
Why would she be there?

1546
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,680
She's getting married in Manali.

1547
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,560
Too late! She's married.

1548
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:22,720
Not yet. It's a six hour drive.

1549
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,040
If we rush, we'll reach before the vows.

1550
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,440
What do you say?

1551
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:30,560
It's a no-brainier. Let's go.

1552
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,600
We'll meet Rancho and return.

1553
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:38,160
I have a meeting with Phunsukh Wangdu
this Friday.

1554
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:39,680
Get into the car.

1555
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,720
Do you know what will happen if I miss it?

1556
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:26,280
Virus will have a heart attack.

1557
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:30,000
We always crash his daughters' wedding.

1558
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:34,560
Listen, I'll handle Pia.
Please deal with Suhas.

1559
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:52,920
- Farhan!
- We found Rancho.

1560
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:01,640
Is that for room number 107?

1561
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,880
You are late!

1562
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:06,640
Get lost.

1563
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:28,160
We found Rancho!
I don't think you should marry that ass.

1564
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,440
You still love Rancho.

1565
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,400
You're still eating his favorite food.

1566
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:57,040
He's incorrigible.
He is not the right man for you.

1567
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,280
He doesn't speak about
brands and prices anymore.

1568
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:05,280
My coat that costs 1,50,000 rupees!

1569
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,560
How dare you do that?

1570
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:10,000
- I'll sort it out, sir.
- How?

1571
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:12,400
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits.

1572
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:14,600
I'll clean it in a jiffy.
Give me a minute!

1573
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:18,720
- I'll clean it for you...
- How dare you!

1574
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:24,320
Pia.

1575
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:27,040
Let's go, Pia. We are getting late.

1576
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,240
Pia, it's me, Raju.
Please don't react, they'll kill me.

1577
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:46,880
Where is Suhas?

1578
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:49,840
The housekeeping staff took my coat away!

1579
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:51,880
Send Suhas here.

1580
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:55,160
It's rude to leave the ceremony.

1581
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,600
- Yes, Farhan?
- The car is ready.

1582
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:10,440
Grab her hand and run!
Don't move.

1583
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:13,240
- Sir!
- My coat?

1584
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:14,600
- You're here!
- Yes!

1585
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:16,320
- Who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1586
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:20,920
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married.

1587
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,280
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go.

1588
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:26,880
It's too late...
People will laugh at me.

1589
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,720
How does that matter?

1590
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:30,280
Rastogi!

1591
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:33,080
People will gossip for a few days.
Then, they'll forget about it.

1592
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:35,400
But if you get married
to the wrong person,

1593
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:36,600
you'll regret if for life.

1594
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:39,360
The car is at the gate,
we are about to meet Rancho.

1595
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:42,720
You don't have to marry that ass
fearing people's judgments.

1596
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:27,080
Pia, there's a minor issue.

1597
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,240
What?

1598
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:30,600
We're not sure if Rancho
is married or single.

1599
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:33,760
- I'm sure he is single.
- What if he's married?

1600
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,880
Then we'll drop you back.

1601
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:38,760
Relax! Have some biscuits.

1602
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:44,960
What's he doing here?

1603
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:49,080
- Ignore him.
- The biscuits are very good.

1604
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:51,960
<i>I was a law-abiding citizen.</i>

1605
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:56,160
<i>But in the last 24 hours,
I had grounded an aircraft...</i>

1606
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:59,080
<i>laid a dead man's ashes on
the edge of a toilet seat...</i>

1607
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:02,040
<i>and made a bride elope
from her own wedding!</i>

1608
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:04,120
<i>All for the sake of Rancho.</i>

1609
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:07,200
<i>But he had done a lot for us as well.</i>

1610
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:10,600
<i>Like stealing the question paper
from the lion's den.</i>

1611
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,600
Envelope with the red seal. Come on.

1612
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:17,640
<i>He feared that if Raju failed, he might
try to commit suicide once again.</i>

1613
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:25,800
<i>We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju.</i>

1614
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,920
<i>We were not even going to look at it.</i>

1615
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:31,080
Where is it?

1616
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:34,720
We'll grow old searching for it!
Rancho, ask Pia.

1617
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:39,640
Where were you?

1618
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:41,720
- You need to answer my calls.
- Pia, your phone...

1619
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:46,000
Brother-in-law, if you say "All is well,"
the baby kicks.

1620
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,400
He kicked.

1621
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:50,760
- Heard that?
- Pia, your phone...

1622
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:57,760
I found it, Rancho.

1623
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:03,080
I was expecting your call.

1624
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:19,800
Quick, photocopy this.

1625
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:41,080
Where was it?

1626
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:42,120
Put it back.

1627
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:43,840
Be careful.

1628
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:06,560
- We are safe!
- Where were you?

1629
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:12,520
- Here.
- What is this?

1630
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:13,720
A gift.

1631
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,240
Question paper.

1632
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:18,560
Virus wants you to fail the examinations.

1633
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:27,240
That's strange!

1634
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:30,360
You taught me how to live without fear.

1635
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:33,400
And now you are leading me
towards the path of shame.

1636
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:35,760
No way!

1637
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:39,200
If I succeed, it will be on my own terms.

1638
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:43,560
If I don't, that's okay.

1639
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:00,600
My buddy!

1640
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:02,040
<i>I was so happy at that moment.</i>

1641
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:07,040
<i>I wanted to get a little more personal,
but I controlled my emotions.</i>

1642
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,360
To hell with you!

1643
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:28,520
To hell with you!

1644
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:33,600
Wanted to change the education system?

1645
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:39,600
- How dare you pee at my door!
- Sir, please stop it...

1646
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:40,760
Scoundrel!

1647
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:48,720
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I will call the police.

1648
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:01,400
How did he get my office key?

1649
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:04,000
I gave it to him, Dad.

1650
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:08,800
I wish I had given this key to my brother.
He'd be alive today.

1651
02:16:10,840 --> 02:16:13,640
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1652
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,320
You wanted him to be an engineer.

1653
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,680
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to pursue?

1654
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:21,960
You put a lot of pressure on him.

1655
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:24,520
He chose death
over the entrance exam.

1656
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:29,680
I don't understand...

1657
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:32,680
Dad, go to your room.

1658
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:40,280
What is wrong with you?

1659
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:44,840
He wanted to study Literature,
he wanted to be a writer.

1660
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:49,200
But all he wrote was
this suicide note.

1661
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:50,640
Put that away, please!

1662
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:52,400
No more cover-ups!

1663
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:58,720
Just once...

1664
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:02,360
you should have asked him
to quit Engineering!

1665
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:04,880
You should have let him
follow his passion.

1666
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:07,600
He would have been alive!

1667
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,200
He didn't commit suicide.

1668
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:21,520
It wasn't a suicide.

1669
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:24,920
It was a murder.

1670
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:42,800
<i>Many city roads are completely submerged.</i>

1671
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:44,920
<i>The traffic has come to a standstill.</i>

1672
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:03,920
Mona!

1673
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:10,320
Please don't follow us.

1674
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:12,920
I can do whatever I want to.

1675
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:17,520
I need an ambulance!

1676
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:20,320
Get it from another hospital!

1677
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:24,320
The entire city is flooded, sir!
We are helpless.

1678
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:27,600
No, Pia...

1679
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:28,920
Mona, are you okay?

1680
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:30,560
It's Pia on the line.

1681
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:36,400
Rancho, it's impossible for you
to get here. So, do as I say.

1682
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:37,760
Try to understand!

1683
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:41,400
You don't get it...

1684
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:43,640
They disconnected the call!

1685
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:45,160
Mona...

1686
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:50,640
Mona!

1687
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:53,200
Be careful!

1688
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:56,800
- Turn on the lights!
- Where to?

1689
02:18:56,880 --> 02:19:00,680
- To the table tennis table.
- Pia, we are in the common room.

1690
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:06,240
Raju, turn the web camera on.

1691
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:07,240
Sure...

1692
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,720
<i>- Hi, Piya.</i>
- Raju! Where's Mona?

1693
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:14,240
Yes.

1694
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:18,640
Here, Pia.

1695
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:21,720
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you.

1696
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,640
Rancho, even when there
were no hospitals and doctors,

1697
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:27,120
babies were successfully delivered.

1698
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:29,920
You guys will help Mona
deliver this baby.

1699
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:37,000
What are you doing!

1700
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:38,080
Dad, stay out of this.

1701
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,040
Farhan, get some towels and scissors.

1702
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:44,600
Millimeter, get some clips
and a lot of hot water.

1703
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:47,160
- Rancho, place a cloth over her.
- Yes...

1704
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:54,920
Mona, try pushing.

1705
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:57,560
- Push with all your might!
- Push harder!

1706
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:59,160
- Push harder!
- Push...

1707
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:01,600
I can't do it!

1708
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:03,760
Please check if there's
any crowning happening.

1709
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:05,760
Crowning?

1710
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:07,680
Get that diagram.

1711
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:12,960
It's a process whereby the baby's head
starts to emerge.

1712
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:16,560
Be quick!

1713
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:20,520
Go, Rancho! Be quick!

1714
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:30,160
There's no crowning.

1715
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:32,040
Mona, please push harder.

1716
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:35,480
Mona!

1717
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:37,280
Mona!

1718
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:39,440
She's tired, Pia.

1719
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:41,040
Wake her up!

1720
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:43,400
She needs to push harder!

1721
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:47,360
- They need a vacuum cup.
- Where will they get one from?

1722
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:50,280
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1723
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:58,640
<i>If the mother is too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on the baby's head.</i>

1724
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:02,560
<i>Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...</i>

1725
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:05,040
<i>and the baby is pulled out.</i>

1726
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:06,440
I can make this!

1727
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:07,800
How?

1728
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:09,560
- With a vacuum cleaner!
- Vacuum cleaner?

1729
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:12,880
That would mean a lot of pressure.

1730
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:15,160
- I'll control the pressure!
- Do you have a vacuum cleaner?

1731
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:16,520
Yes, in my office.

1732
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:19,240
- Farhan, hurry up and get it.
- Here's the key!

1733
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:30,600
What happened?

1734
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:32,200
What's wrong?

1735
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:37,040
Hello, Pia!

1736
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,080
- What happened?
- There's a power cut!

1737
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:41,400
How will the vacuum cleaner work?

1738
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:42,320
- Farhan.
- Yes?

1739
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:43,880
Get the vacuum cleaner.
I'll switch the inverter on.

1740
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:44,920
How?

1741
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:47,640
Millimeter, take Virus out.
Be quick!

1742
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:50,880
- Come on!
- No way...

1743
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:54,440
Not him! I want you to get my
inverter which is named after him.

1744
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:56,520
- Get that, quickly.
- Okay.

1745
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:57,520
- Raju.
- Yes?

1746
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:01,800
Ask the other students to help you with
car batteries, wires, and a vacuum gauge.

1747
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:07,120
Emergency in the common room!

1748
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:37,400
Where's Rancho?

1749
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:41,800
Keep the batteries and the wires here.

1750
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:46,800
Raju, switch everything off and
connect the inverter to the mains.

1751
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:56,400
Farhan, get your lens cleaner.

1752
02:22:57,080 --> 02:22:58,040
Yes, get it.

1753
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:01,520
Rancho, here's the blower.

1754
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:04,000
Fix this to the gauge.

1755
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:30,240
Rancho, I'm done.

1756
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:33,960
- Are all the switches off?
- Yes.

1757
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:36,640
Switch on the bulb and the computer.

1758
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:37,560
Okay.

1759
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:50,640
Raju, turn the computer on.

1760
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:52,720
Connect it here!

1761
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:56,680
Pia, come here quickly.

1762
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:02,880
- Farhan, turn it on.
- Okay!

1763
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:11,000
Pia, what's the rate of the suction?

1764
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:12,720
Not more than 0.5!

1765
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:15,120
- Cover it!
- Yes.

1766
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:23,600
A vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries!

1767
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:26,280
- Farhan, switch it off.
- Okay.

1768
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:37,080
Push the baby down, like this.

1769
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:38,080
Okay.

1770
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:40,080
- Farhan, switch it on.
- Yes!

1771
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:45,720
Come on, push!

1772
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:56,680
Do it for Champ!

1773
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:02,760
The baby is coming out!

1774
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:17,360
Farhan, turn it off.

1775
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:18,440
Okay!

1776
02:25:37,880 --> 02:25:39,560
Cut the umbilical cord using two clips.

1777
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:41,840
Farhan, get me two clips!

1778
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:44,640
- Get the scissors.
- Be careful!

1779
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:48,000
Cut it and get me a towel.

1780
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:52,920
Pia, the baby is not crying.

1781
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:03,440
Rancho, rub the baby's back.

1782
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:11,360
He is not responding.

1783
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:12,920
Blow air into his mouth!

1784
02:26:25,800 --> 02:26:26,840
He is not responding.

1785
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,160
Calm down, Mona.

1786
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:53,360
Tell yourself that "All is well."

1787
02:26:58,400 --> 02:26:59,600
He kicked.

1788
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:01,520
What?

1789
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:03,600
He kicked.

1790
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:09,680
Tell yourself that "All is well!"

1791
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:49,560
<i>He wandered lonesome as a cloud</i>

1792
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:55,680
<i>Yet he was our dearest friend</i>

1793
02:27:56,040 --> 02:28:01,160
<i>I was afraid he would ask the baby
to grow up and become an engineer.</i>

1794
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:04,680
<i>But when he finally spoke,
we were stunned.</i>

1795
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:08,080
What a kick!
Do you want to be a footballer?

1796
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,920
Follow your heart!
Follow your passion!

1797
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:30,160
Wait! Where are you going?

1798
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:36,240
You had asked me a question
on the first day of college.

1799
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:38,880
"Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?"

1800
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:41,880
If the tip of a pencil breaks,

1801
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:43,640
it will float around in zero gravity

1802
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:47,640
and get into someone's eyes, or nose,
or inside the instrument panels.

1803
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:02,360
This was an important invention!

1804
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:10,440
My director told me...

1805
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:13,560
that when...

1806
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:17,960
an extraordinary student...

1807
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:39,640
Excel in your exams and leave!

1808
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:52,800
Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad!

1809
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:31,080
<i>I wanted to capture all these memories.</i>

1810
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:38,240
<i>That day, we hugged, we rejoiced, we cried
and promised to keep in touch.</i>

1811
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:40,400
<i>We vowed to meet each other
at least once a year.</i>

1812
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:44,040
<i>No one knew that we were seeing Rancho
for the last time.</i>

1813
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:17,520
Untie him.

1814
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:37,280
Raju.

1815
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:57,440
Only Rancho can establish
a school like this!

1816
02:31:57,840 --> 02:31:59,000
Where is he?

1817
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:04,480
Don't pee out here!

1818
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:07,360
Get lost.

1819
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:10,400
- Don't pee out here.
- I'll smack you!

1820
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:29,680
Bingo! That means he is somewhere around!

1821
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:42,560
Excuse me, where is Ranchoddas?

1822
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:44,800
- He's not Ranchoddas!
- Rancho...

1823
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:46,920
Chhote... Dammit, what's his name?

1824
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,480
Calm down.

1825
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:50,200
Come with me.

1826
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:54,200
- Where is he?
- Rancho!

1827
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:55,800
Rancho!

1828
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:05,280
Farhan, he has read all your books.
Look!

1829
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:11,600
Raju, he reads your blog every day.

1830
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:14,920
He shares it with the kids
with great pride.

1831
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:21,640
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen.

1832
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:26,560
Who are you?
How do you know us?

1833
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:28,800
- Didn't you recognize me?
- No.

1834
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:33,520
Well, I'm Millimeter.
I'm all grown up now.

1835
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:42,680
Oh my God!
Look at you, handsome!

1836
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:44,280
How did you get here?

1837
02:33:44,360 --> 02:33:47,640
I got a letter with a
train ticket attached.

1838
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:51,480
It was an invitation for me to study here.

1839
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:54,000
Rancho is unbelievable!

1840
02:33:58,080 --> 02:33:59,040
Where is that idiot?

1841
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:11,600
Dorje, try it yourself.

1842
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:17,360
<i>Pum pum paara
Pum pum paara pum</i>

1843
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:23,640
<i>Pum pum paara goes my silly heart</i>

1844
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:31,240
<i>Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride.</i>

1845
02:34:32,040 --> 02:34:34,240
<i>Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet.</i>

1846
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:37,440
<i>And you come closer to kiss me.</i>

1847
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,560
Why did you leave without informing me?

1848
02:34:44,360 --> 02:34:45,240
No.

1849
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:49,000
Are you married?

1850
02:34:49,560 --> 02:34:51,360
What?

1851
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,200
No...

1852
02:34:54,680 --> 02:34:55,480
What about you?

1853
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:05,200
So?

1854
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:07,560
So what?

1855
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:09,320
Do you love someone?

1856
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:44,200
<i>Zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum</i>

1857
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:50,840
See, the noses don't collide, you stupid!

1858
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:54,120
Rancho, you jerk!

1859
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:58,920
Screw you!

1860
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:03,560
- Listen to me...
- No, you listen to me!

1861
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:05,920
- I can explain everything.
- You asshole!

1862
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:09,280
- Moron!
- Scoundrel!

1863
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:20,560
Hit him hard!

1864
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:27,280
Let him go.

1865
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:30,120
On your feet, you scoundrel.

1866
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:45,160
Hey, buddy!

1867
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:07,720
Ranchoddas Chanchad!
How do you do, Teacher?

1868
02:37:08,080 --> 02:37:11,920
Wow, you're a teacher in a village!

1869
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:21,120
We studied at the same college.
But you failed miserably.

1870
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:24,160
Instead of becoming an engineer,
you became a teacher.

1871
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:29,320
What's your salary, Chanchad?
Five thousand rupees?

1872
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:35,080
My son's pocket money
is more than your salary.

1873
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:37,920
- Cut the crap.
- Crap is what he gave us!

1874
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,600
He wanted to change the education system.

1875
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:42,960
He wanted to change the world.

1876
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:45,800
Finally, what does he change?
Kids' diapers?

1877
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:47,520
I am going to beat him up!

1878
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:48,480
Just relax.

1879
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:50,360
Remember what I had said?

1880
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,880
One day, I'll be successful
and you will be a failure!

1881
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:57,960
I need your signature.

1882
02:37:58,600 --> 02:38:03,200
Accept your defeat and
acknowledge my success!

1883
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:08,520
- Chatur!
- He's a crazy guy.

1884
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:14,400
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
Where did you get it from?

1885
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:16,160
Forget it, man.

1886
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:26,680
Here's what you can do when your
school needs help or donations.

1887
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:36,960
- He hasn't changed at all!
- Ignore him.

1888
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:38,720
- He is crazy.
- Yes.

1889
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:43,200
The good news is that your name
is not Ranchoddas Chanchad.

1890
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:46,600
I can't imagine myself being called
Pia Chanchad!

1891
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:49,520
What is your real name?

1892
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:51,200
Phunsukh Wangdu.

1893
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:52,840
- Wangdu?
- Wangdu?

1894
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:54,200
- Pia Wangdu!
- Yes...

1895
02:38:54,360 --> 02:38:55,960
You mean, you're a scientist?

1896
02:38:56,080 --> 02:38:57,600
- The one with 400 patents?
- Yes.

1897
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,520
I won't change my name
after we get married.

1898
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:01,160
- You're the man Chatur kept mentioning?
- Yes!

1899
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:03,160
The Japanese are looking for you?

1900
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:06,960
Are you a scientist,
or a teacher?

1901
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:09,200
I'm a scientist,
but I also teach children.

1902
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,200
You're the man, Phunsukh Wangdu!

1903
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:12,360
Yes, I am!

1904
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:16,440
- Silencer!
- Chatur, come back.

1905
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:17,520
Wait a minute!

1906
02:39:20,240 --> 02:39:22,440
Wait, I'll have to call him up.

1907
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,560
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you.

1908
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:37,440
I can't sign the deal
with your company.

1909
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:39,920
Why, sir?

1910
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:43,040
I can't sign it because
you took my pen away!

1911
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:50,920
- The one in your hand! Virus's pen!
- Virus's pen?

1912
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:57,040
- Mr. Wangdu?
- Yes, Chatur?

1913
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:00,000
He's doomed!

1914
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:04,120
He is screwed.

1915
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:21,880
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal.

1916
02:40:21,960 --> 02:40:25,040
Chatur! Take that!

1917
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:31,720
I always knew that
you would be successful!

1918
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:34,240
You're lying.

1919
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:36,520
I mean it!

1920
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:47,720
Your Majesty, thou art great!
Accept this humble offering.

1921
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:50,080
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu.
Run for your life!

1922
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:53,080
- Let's go.
- Run!

1923
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:57,640
Rancho, I'll lose my job.
I have kids to look after.

1924
02:40:58,480 --> 02:41:00,920
<i>His Holiness Guru Ranchoddas
had correctly stated.</i>

1925
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:06,000
<i>Follow excellence and
success will chase you!</i>
