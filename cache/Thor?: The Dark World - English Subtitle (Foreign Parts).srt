1
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,662
Asgard's forces are upon us.

2
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,687
Send in the Kursed!

3
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,644
Their deaths will mean our survival.

4
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,098
This war is far from over.

5
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,799
The Aether awakens us.

6
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,135
The Convergence returns.

7
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,527
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

8
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,732
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

9
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,156
Our survival will be your legacy.

10
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,287
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

11
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,618
I will reclaim the Aether.

12
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,953
I will restore our world.

13
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,054
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

14
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,964
The worlds are nearly aligned.

15
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,137
You will be the last of the Kursed.

16
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,932
Let my life be sacrificed.

17
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,010
It is no less than our people did,

18
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,341
or you have done.

19
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,205
You will become darkness,

20
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:57,127
cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

21
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,254
Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

22
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,143
I will tear down their defenses...

22
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:16,143
...and ensure your return 
to a universe reborn.

23
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,015
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.

24
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:10,303
And when you wake,
we will kill them all.

23
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,095
We must strike now.

24
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,231
No.

25
01:08:22,457 --> 01:08:28,689
Asgard is meaningless.

26
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,823
The Aether has found its way home.

27
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,949
He is an enemy of Asgard.

28
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:05,585
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.
