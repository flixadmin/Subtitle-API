00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:11,071
[Todd] I mean, I'm sorry,
but I had to do it.

7
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:16,633
Obviously, I guess
you see it different.

8
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,668
Some of you. But I didn't see
any other choice.

9
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,170
I've been thinking
about this all day,

10
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:22,038
going over and over
it in my head,

11
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:23,723
and it was the only way.
[Scoffs]

12
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,144
Well, it's not like
I wanted to.

13
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,546
The kid was on a dirt bike.
I mean, he could've just--

14
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,015
He could've just gunned it
and been gone

15
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,883
before we even
had a chance to blink.

16
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,101
We never would've been able
to catch him.

17
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,237
I was thinking on my feet.
I saw a threat,

18
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,322
and I took care of it
the only way that I could.

19
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:40,907
A threat?

20
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:43,410
The kid was waving at us.

21
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:45,745
He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.

22
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,113
Yeah, but you don't know that.

23
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,581
Yeah, I do.

24
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:49,916
He didn't know what he'd seen.

25
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,167
Well, I didn't want
to take that chance.

26
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,703
I-- The whole point
of this thing was that no one

27
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:55,789
was supposed know that we
were even there, right?

28
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,625
People weren't ever supposed to
know that anything got robbed.

29
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:00,794
How could we have let
the kid go?

30
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,545
He made us. If I hadn't
done what I did,

31
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,080
the whole mission
would've failed.

32
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:06,082
I'm-- I'm real sorry.

33
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:11,354
I really am, but I--
But did I make a mistake?

34
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,556
Mr. White? 'Cause to me,

35
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,141
you know, respectfully,

36
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,142
I was looking out for the team.

37
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:17,694
I didn't want to kill him.

38
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:20,196
You gotta believe that.

39
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:24,234
At the end of the day, it was
him or us, and I chose us.

40
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:26,653
And I would do it again.

41
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:30,290
Okay, look. Uh...

42
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:34,961
Todd, why don't you step
outside for a few minutes

43
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:36,713
so we can talk this through?

44
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,715
Of course.
Yeah, you guys talk.

45
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,166
But I just want to make sure

46
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,419
that you know that my priority
is this business.

47
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:44,787
Okay. That's-- that's fine,
Todd. Thank you.

48
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,140
I want to be
a real part of this.

49
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:49,225
All right? If you could
just see that. I'm motivated.

50
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,810
And I've got connections.

51
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:53,396
Yeah. My uncle's got
his hookups in prison

52
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:55,765
who I think could be
a real help to us if--

53
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:08,644
Okay. That dude?
Whack-job.

54
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,280
Let's just stick
to the facts here.

55
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:12,282
Facts? Oh, okay. Uh...

56
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:14,701
How about the fact
that he shot a kid?

57
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:16,703
A kid that he
didn't need to shoot.

58
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:18,588
The boy had seen us.

59
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:23,259
And, no, it didn't look like
he knew what he was seeing.

60
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:26,713
But what if he told somebody?

61
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:29,799
What if he just mentioned it
in passing?

62
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,851
We can't know what someone--

63
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:35,671
Exactly. We can't know, because
Ricky Hitler there shot him.

64
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,509
We, us three, should've had
a discussion about it.

65
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:40,894
We would've figured it out.

66
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:44,364
But that dickhead just went ahead
and made the choice for us.

67
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:46,015
Is that how we do business now?

68
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,350
Look, I understand
you're upset.

69
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,202
And what was that crap
about his uncle

70
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:50,987
with the-- with the prison
connections?

71
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:54,023
It's just some bullshit
intimidation move.

72
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,858
- Come on.
- It's true, though.

73
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,411
He does have some connections.

74
00:06:58,462 --> 00:06:59,496
Is this a problem?

75
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:02,165
No. It's nothing
to be concerned about.

76
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,700
It came up in the background
I did on him.

77
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:07,537
Didn't worry me then.
He's just flexing.

78

[Sighs]

79
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:13,059
All right.

80
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,211
It seems to me that we have
three options here,

81
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,430
and none of which are ideal.

82
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:20,567
One, we fire Todd.

83
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,103
- Yeah.
- I'm not a fan of this option,

84
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:27,390
seeing that he knows way too much
about this business at this point.

85
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:31,494
And we'd most likely have
to pay him to keep quiet.

86
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:34,948
And God only knows we've got
enough of that going on.

87
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,419
Two...

88
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:41,037
We dispose of him.

89
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:51,080
Which leaves us option three.

90
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:53,082
We keep him on payroll.

91
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,803
Put him back on tenting houses,
setting up the lab and so forth.

92
00:07:56,854 --> 00:08:00,440
We keep him close.
Under our control.

93
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:05,562
Now, option three
would be my choice.

94
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:07,564
Shall we vote?

95
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:13,102
[Mike] I vote three, kid.

up your ass sideways.

- What?
- A dead drop.

after four days with no leads.

00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:44,346
You're what?

319
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:48,851
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

320
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,070
So, um...

321
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,823
I'm retiring, I guess.

322
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:57,877
That methylamine that we stole, that we
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal,

323
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:03,549
that methylamine, when cooked,
is worth nearly $300 million.

324
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:06,969
And you're telling me that you're
willing to walk away from that?

325
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:09,038
We're walking away
from the meth.

326
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,590
Not the methylamine.

327
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,593
Jesse and I will be taking our
two-thirds and we're selling it.

328
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,480
I've got a connection, a guy I
knew from my time with Fring.

329
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:21,267
This guy has the capital,
and he's motivated. Highly.

330
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,437
Mike's thinking we'll clear,
like, five million. Each.

331
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,940
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

332
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,392
And those legacy costs
that you're so fond of,

333
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,411
you won't have
to worry about anymore.

334
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:35,231
And then I will be
going on my way.

335
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,582
Jesse too.

336
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,336
It's a solid plan.

337
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,739
You can come in on this
with us.

338
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,408
That'd be cool.

339
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:50,379
'Course, you know, you are
free to hold onto your third

340
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:54,016
and keep cooking.

341
00:23:57,387 --> 00:23:59,939
You'll be selling
to my competitors.

342
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:02,809
This guy and his crew
are way out in Phoenix.

343
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,278
It's a big country, Walter.

344
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:08,030
Whole lot of meth-heads.

345
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:10,616
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

346
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:13,269
And that's what you're gonna
sell out for?

347
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,289
Pennies? Why?

348
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:19,325
Five million isn't pennies.

349
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,244
It's more money
than I've ever seen.

350
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,247
And when it comes down to it,

351
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:26,833
are we in the meth business?

352
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,085
Or the money business?

353
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:40,063
[Sighs]

354
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,835
Relax, kid.
There's no one there.

355
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:47,004
You sure?

356
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:49,006
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

357
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,338
Glad to see
you could make it out.

358
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:23,574
I was surprised
to get your call.

359
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:26,677
Good surprise, I hope.

360
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:29,079
There's one gallon,
as discussed.

361
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:31,715
You take that back home
to your people, test it.

362
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:35,452
If you're satisfied,
I can get the other 665.

363
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,004
All right.
That's fair enough.

364
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:39,590
Shall we talk money?

365
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,258
That one's free.

366
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:44,261
The price for the rest
is 15,000 per...

367
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:49,149
665 gallons, that's 9,975,000.

368
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:52,436
Although I would prefer
you round it up to ten.

369
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,073
Makes it easier
for my partner and I to split.

370
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,107
Steep.

371
00:25:57,141 --> 00:26:00,977
Mm. We good?

372
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,980
Yeah. I'll talk to my guys,
but I should be able

373
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:05,315
to put together
that cash, yeah.

374
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,533
Good.

375
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,252
I gotta tell you,
this is worth it

376
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:10,587
just to get that blue stuff
of yours off the market.

377
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,962
The blue stuff will be
off the market, right?

378
00:26:22,383 --> 00:26:27,304
Now, this whole time,
I was thinking 666,

379
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:30,340
that seems like an odd number.

380
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:32,142
Two-thirds
of an even thousand, though.

381
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:36,730
When I look at it that way,
it starts to make sense to me.

382
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:39,366
That's not all
the methylamine, is it?

383
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:44,738
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

384
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:48,909
This other party wouldn't be
a problem for you.

385
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,827
His territory
won't impact yours.

386
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,212
You see, that doesn't
work for me.

387
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:53,830
I'm not just buying this
for the supply.

388
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,132
I'm buying this for the demand.

389
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,034
I'm looking to increase
my market share here, Mike.

390
00:26:58,052 --> 00:27:00,220
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

391
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:02,589
I want you to tell me
that Fring's blue

392
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,374
will be off the streets.

393
00:27:08,513 --> 00:27:13,266
All right. Here's
a new deal for you then.

394
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:18,438
I'll pay you 15k a gallon
for the full thousand gallons.

395
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:22,392
Not a drop less.

396
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,195
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

397
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,365
Well then, no deal, Mike.

398
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,206
[Phone buzzes]

399
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:39,960
[Phone buzzes]

400
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,797
[Phone buzzes]

401
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:49,019
[Phone buzzes]

402
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:54,424
Yes?

403
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:57,527
Yes. I guess.

404
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:01,815
I don't know.

405
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:04,651
Why don't you come over here?

406
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:08,488
To my house.

407
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,774
Yes, seriously.

408
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:19,249
Hey.

409
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:27,791
Yo, you sure this is okay?

410
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,509
She's not here.
Nobody's here.

411
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,849
All right.
So, uh...

412
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,184
Something's come up.

413
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,469
Mike wanted to come here
to give you the hard sell,

414
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:42,773
but I figured it'd be better
coming from me.

415
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:47,077
Mike's connection won't buy
mine and Mike's shares

416
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:49,996
of the methylamine unless he
gets your share, too.

417
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:53,483
He wants the entire
thousand gallons.

418
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,985
Absolutely not.

419
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,705
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

420
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:00,874
But I've been thinking
about it,

421
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:04,461
and it really makes sense.

422
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:06,996
- Kinda.
- It does, does it?

423
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:10,834
Look, when you, uh,
when you started this thing,

424
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:13,336
did you ever dream
of having $5 million?

425
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:15,505
I know for a fact
that you didn't.

426
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:19,810
I know for a fact all you
needed was was 737,000,

427
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:23,029
'cause you worked it all out,
like, mathematically.

428
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:27,651
Look, if selling the methylamine now
means that no one else ever gets killed,

429
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:30,520
then I vote for that, man.
Hands down.

430
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,405
And we could have it tomorrow.

431
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:34,074
We would be out.

432
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,542
You could spend time
with your family.

433
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:37,160
No more worrying
about them getting hurt

434
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,045
or finding out
about everything.

435
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,697
Isn't this what you've
been working for?

436
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:43,250
I have not been working
this hard just to sell out.

437
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:47,053
It's not selling out.
Yes, it is, Jesse.

438
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:51,675
I ha-- We have suffered and bled,
literally, for this business.

439
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:55,345
And I will not
throw it away for nothing.

440
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:59,232
I don't know how else
to say it, Mr. White.

441
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:02,853
$5 million isn't nothing.

442
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:09,326
Jesse, have you heard of a
company called "Gray Matter"?

443
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,496
- No.
- Well, I co-founded it

444
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,948
in grad school with a couple
of friends of mine.

445
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,734
Actually, I was
the one who named it.

446
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:20,453
And back then, it was just--
Oh, it was just small-time.

447
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:22,873
We had a couple
patents pending.

448
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:25,408
But nothing earth-shattering.

449
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:29,179
'Course, we all knew
the potential.

450
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:31,965
Yeah. We were gonna take
the world by storm.

451
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:37,137
And then...

452
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:40,774
This, uh-- Well, something
happened between the three of us.

453
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,894
And I'm not gonna go
into detail.

454
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:46,730
But for personal reasons,

455
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:48,481
I decided to leave the company.

456
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:51,785
And I sold my share
to my two partners.

457
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,821
I took a buyout for $5,000.

458
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:59,125
Now, at the time, that was
a lot of money for me.

459
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:03,496
Care to guess what that
company is worth now?

460
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:06,800
Millions?

461
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:10,470
Billions, with a "B."

462
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:14,057
2.16 billion
as of last Friday.

463
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:16,643
I look it up every week.

464
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:19,346
And I sold my share,

465
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:21,815
my potential,

466
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:25,769
for $5,000.

467
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:29,940
I sold my kids' birthright
for a few months' rent.

468
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:32,609
This isn't the same thing.

469
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:38,081
Jesse, you asked me

470
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:42,168
if I was in the meth business
or the money business.

471
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:44,921
Neither.

472
00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:47,323
I'm in the empire business.

473
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:54,631
I don't know.

474

632
00:45:19,915 --> 00:45:21,549
<i>I don't see what they're</i>
<i>playing at here,</i>

633
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:24,085
<i>but if Ehrmantraut</i>
<i>wants a fight,</i>

634
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,554
<i>he's gonna get one.</i>

635
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:28,056
That was a hell of a gamble.

636
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,107
Worked.

637
00:45:29,141 --> 00:45:32,227
Yeah, well, not for long.

638
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:35,697
He's right about that TRO.
It's gonna get tossed toute suite.

639
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:39,200
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

640
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:40,902
So have fun with that.

641
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,788
How much time I got?

642
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:46,541
Maybe 24 hours.

643
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:48,043
It's enough.

644
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:50,161
It better be.
Whatever you got planned,

645
00:45:50,212 --> 00:45:52,881
you best pull the ripcord
while you still have a chance.

646

[Garage door opens]

647
00:46:06,812 --> 00:46:08,313
- Where is it?
- Mike--

648
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:09,898
- Mike!
- Get out of my way.

649
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:11,683
You, sit down.

650
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:13,468
Mike! Mike!
Hold on, okay?

651
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:15,654
- I am gonna count to three.
- Mr. White's got an idea.

652
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:16,821
- Mike, I'm serious.
- One.

653
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:17,822
- Two.
- It's a great idea.

654
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:19,524
Look, you get
your five million,

655
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:21,809
we both do, and he gets
his methylamine, all right?

656
00:46:21,827 --> 00:46:24,696
Just hear him out.

657
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:30,785
Is that true, Walter?

658
00:46:34,823 --> 00:46:38,009
Everybody wins.
