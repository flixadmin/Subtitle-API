1
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,233
- No way.
- Yeah.

2
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,303
This is the Cuban spirit.

3
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,608
Dom! Dom!

4
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,091
Raldo, you said I...

5
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,695
You know I can't make a living
without my car.

6
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,797
It's not my problem, bro.

7
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,299
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.

8
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,268
Welcome to my island.

9
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,370
Why you hooking up my cousin's car?

10
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,673
Cousin's car.
Not anymore.

11
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,041
He needed money.
I gave it to him.

12
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,277
He can't pay.
I take the car.

13
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,945
I-I just need a few more days.

14
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,681
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.

15
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,015
Come on.

16
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,184
You make a deal,
you gotta live up to it.

17
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,754
You make a deal...
you going to live up to it.

18
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,156
"Going to live up to it"?

19
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,827
Oh, so you one of those types.

20
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,195
You take everyone's ride

21
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,097
and then ship it back to the States?

22
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,734
You know what I respect?

23
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,368
Money.

24
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,273
You watch your mouth.

25
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,977
Now you got a problem.

26
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,049
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.

27
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,856
- You want a car, get it the right way.
- How?

28
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,324
Race for it.

29
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,727
I already own it, bro.

30
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,362
Not that car.

31
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,065
Mine.

32
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,000
Dom...

33
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:30,070
His-his car is the fastest car
on the island.

34
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,939
Do you know what he has under that hood?

35
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,207
He knows it doesn't matter
what's under a hood.

36
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:38,178
The only thing that matters
is who's behind the wheel.

37
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,346
You think so?

38
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,948
I know so.

39
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,383
Then race his car.

40
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,888
And we ain't racing
no quarter-mile here.

41
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,322
We race the Cuban mile.

42
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,959
Done.

43
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,479
Listen, I-I appreciate what
you're trying to do, but...

44
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,248
my car is the slowest car on the island.

45
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,386
Was.

46
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,955
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery.

47
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,959
If it ain't the motor, take it off.

48
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,127
Laughing gas?

49
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,296
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.

50
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,731
You guys are crazy.

51
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,769
- What are you doing?
- Poor man's turbo.

52
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,838
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.

53
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,140
Old trick the Buster used to play,

54
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,909
in case of emergencies.

55
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,111
You know that's way too much boost

56
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,279
- for that engine.
- It's gonna be fast.

57
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,514
It's gonna be a bomb.

58
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,550
Only needs to go a mile.

59
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,972
That car belongs in the trash, bro.

60
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,174
Where are they going?

61
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,575
I don't know. Let's go.

62
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,164
Ghost him.

63
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,966
Sí.

64
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,723
Adios, Toretto.

65
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,395
Okay, Buster.

66
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,231
Let's see if this works.

67
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,540
That's impossible.

68
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,859
Look out!

69
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,246
Hold on. Hold on.

70
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,456
A deal's a deal.

71
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,226
You won my car.

72
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,129
And you earned my respect.

73
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,913
Keep your car.

74
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,216
Your respect is good enough for me.

75
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,722
Yo, cousin.

76
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,758
Sorry about your car.

77
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,932
Yours was too slow for a Toretto anyway.

78
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,434
Your Impala?

79
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,269
Are you serious?

80
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,452
Look at that smile.

81
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,588
I love it when you smile.

82
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,423
You make me happy.

83
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,326
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.

84
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,497
It's like it speaks to you.

85
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:57,404
You remember that guy...
the racer and his dad?

86
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,364
The one with the boat engine
under the hood?

87
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,006
Yeah.

88
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,508
- Yeah.
- Of course.

89
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,743
I was... I was looking at them,

90
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:07,314
and I... and I couldn't help
but to imagine

91
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,317
what you'd be like if you were a dad.

92
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,854
No, no, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.

93
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,393
Is that what you want?

94
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:23,763
It's not about what I want
or what you want.

95
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,600
It's about why we haven't
asked the question.

96
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:32,639
And do you have enough faith
in the world?

97
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,408
I'll always ride for us.

98
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,944
Yeah, but would you ride for the world?

99
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,519
You hungry?

100
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,687
Mm-hmm.

101
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,356
- Same thing?
- Mm-hmm.

102
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,926
Two minutes.

103
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:14,881
What?

104
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,015
You need a hand?

105
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,951
Yeah, I think I do.

106
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,787
Thank you.

107
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,489
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.

108
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,792
- Yeah?
- Probably the shutoff solenoid.

109
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,594
Let's see if we can get
some power to it.

110
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,664
What brings you to Cuba?

111
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,102
Same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.

112
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,138
Culture, people, beauty.

113
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,408
What brings you to Cuba?

114
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,642
Work.

115
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,611
Must be casual Friday.

116
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,480
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?

117
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,455
Your fuel relay is missing.

118
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,124
I know.

119
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,899
I love to play games...
beaten the best of 'em...

120
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,501
but I'm kind of in a rush,

121
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,403
so if you've got something
to say to me...

122
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,771
Oh, this is a very different game.

123
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,640
That I can assure you.

124
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,174
This...

125
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,578
There is something
much greater at work here.

126
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,846
This is fate.

127
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,114
I choose to make my own fate.

128
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,683
Not today.

129
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,685
Is this the road you take

130
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,119
to your apartment every morning?

131
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,788
What else is different, Dom?

132
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,690
Was Santiago's closed?
Did you have to

133
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,925
cross two blocks
to go get your Cuban coffees?

134
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,563
What is it, black, no sugar?

135
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,030
Yeah.

136
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,733
I put a lot of work
into getting you here today.

137
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,102
Well, now that I'm here,
what do you want?

138
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,071
I want you to work for me.

139
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,874
Work for you?

140
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,610
Oh, I could have saved you
a lot of time, then.

141
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,579
See, I don't work for anyone.

142
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,581
You can't walk away from this, Dom.

143
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,015
We're gonna have this conversation,

144
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,184
one way or the other.

145
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,188
You see, that's the funny thing
about fate.

146
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,756
It's cunning.

147
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,625
It can bring you beautiful things,

148
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,960
and it can also bring you
moments like this.

149
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,977
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.

150
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,879
You're gonna betray your brothers,

151
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,115
abandon your code
and shatter your family.

152
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,184
You see, your team
is about to go up against

153
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,887
the only thing they can't handle.

154
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,455
And what's that?

155
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,760
You.

156
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,261
Oh, and, Dom,

157
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,097
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

158
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,775
They are gonna be hitting us

159
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,877
with everything they got.

160
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,712
So we want to engage with maximum speed.

161
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,080
Neutralize their shooters,

162
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,149
and then move on to our objective.

163
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,284
There's two things
I want you to keep in mind.

164
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:09,021
Number one... I chose you
for this squad because you are

165
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,891
the most fearsome warriors
on the planet.

166
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,226
And number two... You go out there,

167
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,863
you do your job, and you take 'em down.

168
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,932
Everyone... and I mean everyone...

169
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,302
manis and pedis at the mall
later on today.

170
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,873
Huh?

171
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,074
One, two three!

172
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,108
Monarchs!

173
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,052
Yah!

174
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,627
What?

175
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,365
I don't want to play anymore.

176
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,068
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

177
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:29,869
Final two minutes.

178
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,203
Quite the cheering section.

179
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,743
Oh, yeah.

180
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,612
Yeah, yeah, it's the moms,
they come out to support the kids.

181
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,849
Except there seem to be
more moms than kids.

182
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,151
Way more moms.

183
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,622
Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.

184
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,357
Let's go, girls!

185
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,359
So, your intel was spot-on.

186
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,995
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the Gulf...

187
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,664
arms dealers from the Liberation Front

188
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,999
- have it in Berlin.
- Shit.

189
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,168
This thing can wipe out
an entire electrical grid

190
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,703
in a major city.

191
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,005
No lights, no power...
instant Stone Age.

192
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,908
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her
run by you like that.

193
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,142
- Let's go, let's go! Cross!
- Agent Hobbs,

194
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,111
this is a Class 4 WMD.
Do you have any idea

195
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,946
- what's at stake here?
- That's it. Go, go, go, go!

196
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,282
Yes, I know exactly
what is at stake here, okay?

197
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,918
If the Pink Butterflies
beat my Red Dragons, that means

198
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,021
we lose the championship...
which means I have

199
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,390
20 little girls who are crying,
and that's not a good thing.

200
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,925
Which then means I have to spend

201
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,894
a lot of time in ice cream shops

202
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,129
and spend a lot of time
at Tay Tay concerts.

203
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,764
Tay Tay?

204
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,432
Come... Taylor Swift.

205
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,834
Gotta be shittin' me.

206
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,168
Get it together, okay?

207
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,203
- Let's go, girls.
- Go, go, go!

208
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,304
We need you to do this.

209
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,972
It's a lot of lives at stake.

210
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,709
- All right, but I need to be clear here.
- Ah, ah!

211
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,910
The U.S. government cannot

212
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,745
sanction this operation in any way.

213
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,013
- You're on your own.
- Hey...

214
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,681
This thing goes sideways,

215
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,917
you don't just get burned,
you go to prison.

216
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,219
And there's nothing
we can do to get you out.

217
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,022
Let me tell you something.

218
00:20:56,055 --> 00:21:00,359
The only thing that I love more
than saving lives

219
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,294
is my daughter.

220
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,830
So, if you don't shut up

221
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,397
with this government bullshit right now

222
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,834
and start showing some team spirit

223
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,737
and respect for the Red Dragons,

224
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,438
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up

225
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,273
and kick you right in the tay-tay.

226
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,778
Go, Dragons.

227
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,780
Say it again.

228
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,715
- Go, Dragons!
- Attaboy.

229
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,852
Go, Dragons. Go, Dragons.

230
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,186
Go. She's open!

231
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,255
Go, go! Yes!

232
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,125
That is my daughter right there. Yes.

233
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,762
Yes, come here.

234
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,364
- How did I do?
- Awesome.

235
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,398
Nice job, kid.

236
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,004
Daddy's gotta go to work?

237
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,138
Uh, yeah.

238
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,374
Daddy's gotta go to work.

239
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,209
Now, you're gonna need
to get a team you can trust.

240
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,012
Oh, I already got one.

241
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,802
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.

242
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,204
I got a job in Berlin,
and I need a favor, brother.

243
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,542
No problem. I'll grab the team
and meet you in Berlin.

244
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,945
Thanks, man.
I'll see you soon.

245
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,373
You were only supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

246
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,175
That was a diversion!

247
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,010
How many of the damn explosives
did you use?

248
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,112
I don't know, Tej.
All of it?

249
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:03,149
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus Christ.

250
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,817
You got more of your fan club ahead.

251
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,360
They're still on us.

252
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,128
These guys are taking this personal.

253
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,997
Roman, we just blew up their facility

254
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,298
and stole their EMP.

255
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,367
Other than your doctor's cold finger,

256
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,169
I'd say it's about
as personal as it can get.

257
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,904
Phase two.

258
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,606
Phase two? So, you just
gonna keep that to yourself?

259
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,142
What happened to phase one?
What about that part?

260
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,144
Yeah. Remember the airplane?

261
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,880
Everyone drove their cars out but you?

262
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,148
I told you my engine seized up.

263
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,917
It's your balls that seized up.

264
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,285
Just follow my lead, okay?

265
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,020
And, Roman, whatever you do...

266
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,221
don't think.

267
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,856
What?

268
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,424
Tej, drop it.

269
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,293
Bombs away.

270
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,196
Split now.

271
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,002
Holy...!

272
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,085
Great plan, Tej.

273
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,254
But just so you know, you missed some.

274
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,123
Oh, just wait for it.

275
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,170
Oh, shit!

276
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,406
I hate you, Tej!

277
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,576
Got your ass.

278
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,884
You good?

279
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:50,489
I'll see you when it's done.

280
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,195
All right, great job, team.
Let's break off,

281
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,496
and meet me at the safe house.

282
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,248
A hell of a job, brother.

283
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:18,550
When we get back to the base,
beer's on me.

284
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,576
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?

285
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:50,349
Toretto, you put hands on
that thing, you're gonna have

286
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,718
the whole world gunning
for you, including me.

287
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,358
I don't know what you're doing,

288
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,461
but you better think
about this, Toretto.

289
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,363
It ain't too late to stop this.

290
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,445
It is now.

291
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,750
That sumbitch just crossed us.

292
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,785
- What?
- Wait a second.

293
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,120
What are you talking about?

294
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,288
Dom took the EMP.

295
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,456
Bullshit.

296
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,091
Where are you?

297
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,160
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.

298
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,627
He wrecked my truck and he took it.

299
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,196
I saw that look in his eye,

300
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:40,032
and I've seen that look before.

301
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,301
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.

302
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,677
All right, I got
his phone records, y'all.

303
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,812
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

304
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,648
Burner phones, right?

305
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,150
Nah. Scrambler.

306
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,851
Same number, but they got some sort

307
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,519
of micro-router to bury the signal path,

308
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,321
which means Dom is clearly communicating

309
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,690
with somebody
that's above our pay grade.

310
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,859
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you,

311
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,628
but if we just look at the facts...

312
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:19,665
Dom's been having
highly encrypted conversations

313
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,833
with some mysterious person.

314
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,903
He took out Hobbs.

315
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,738
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.

316
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,240
So, what are you saying?

317
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,741
Maybe we should consider

318
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,843
the fact that Hobbs is right.

319
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,679
Dom did go rogue.

320
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,248
Letty.

321
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,150
We're all in this

322
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,318
trying to figure it out, okay?

323
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,419
We're on the side.

324
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,887
You sure about that, Roman?

325
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,791
Before you judge the man,

326
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,293
remember, you're breathing right now

327
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,395
because he saved your life.

328
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,340
You just gonna let her
bump your shoulder like that?

329
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:05,143
I'm-I'm just saying, that...
that was a little aggressive.

330
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,315
What you gonna do, e-mail her?

331
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,552
Check.

332
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:26,832
Moment, will you, fellas?

333
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,202
Thank you.

334
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,970
Well, this is an exciting new look.

335
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,306
It's a little tight
in the crotch, as always.

336
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,377
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?

337
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,912
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.

338
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,448
- All yours.
- Agent Hobbs,

339
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,949
Mr. Nobody and I have
been given the authority

340
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,784
to get you out of this.

341
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,954
All you have to do is agree
to the terms, and you're free.

342
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,957
What's Training Wheels
talking about? What terms?

343
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,426
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.

344
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,662
Treason, international espionage,

345
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,664
massive destruction of civic property.

346
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,632
You do that, we close the case.

347
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,235
- And?
- And the DSS blacklists you.

348
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,970
- Germany loves that.
- Officially,

349
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,239
- you will be a criminal.
- Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

350
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,241
You need to work
on your delivery, all right?

351
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,543
Unofficially...

352
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,312
you're off the books.

353
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,713
You come work with me.

354
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,383
I'm not a criminal.

355
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,950
Luke, come on. Labels.

356
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,852
There is no confession.

357
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,988
There are no backroom deals.

358
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,924
Got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

359
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,694
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him.

360
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,662
Well, there you have it.

361
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,698
Good luck in the courts, man.

362
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,335
What about your daughter?

363
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,939
You know, if you're not
gonna do it for your country,

364
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,574
at least do it for your kid.

365
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,010
Big mistake, kid.

366
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,780
Hold on. Look, Luke.

367
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,616
He's still working from the manual.

368
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,385
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

369
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,521
Now, come on, give him a break.

370
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,356
Give me a break.

371
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,358
Luke.

372
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,061
Appreciate it.

373
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:05,764
It's good to see you, Nobody.

374
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,366
You, too.

375
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,304
Rule number one...

376
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,606
Know your audience.

377
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,608
I gave you your shot.
You shit the bed.

378
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:19,645
Now I'm gonna show you
how to get this done.

379
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,780
You're mine now, copper!

380
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,783
Yeah, that badge don't go far in here!

381
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,821
You're dead, cop. Dead!

382
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:33,525
I'm gonna slice
some bacon off your back, pig!

383
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,694
Well, well, well.

384
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,763
Luke Hobbs behind bars.

385
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,765
Would you look at that.

386
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:42,801
The bent cop got his day.

387
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,782
You know, that color looks good on you.

388
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,016
Yeah, it'd look a whole hell

389
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,885
of a lot better with your blood on it.

390
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,920
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.

391
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,890
Lawman gone bad, huh?

392
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,693
Such a cliché.

393
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,128
Oh, well, welcome to the club.

394
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,763
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.

395
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,766
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.

396
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,735
And unlike you,
I ain't gonna be here long.

397
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,437
So why don't you get
your candy-ass back out there

398
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,005
and toss some more salads, boy.

399
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,573
What, you bring a shovel, did you?

400
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,810
Because it's 38 feet
of steel and concrete.

401
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,812
Or so I've been told.

402
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,016
Better get to digging.

403
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,684
You wanker.

404
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,822
Yeah.

405
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,873
Move.

406
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,575
Say that again.

407
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,745
If I say it again,

408
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,414
it'll be to a corpse.

409
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,852
I'm going to enjoy this.

410
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,454
Welcome back, Dom.

411
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:10,989
Nice job out there.

412
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,493
You excited about tonight?

413
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:16,662
You're going on this?

414
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,670
You're with me, Dom.

415
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,141
I am impressed.

416
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,912
That job went down
exactly like we planned.

417
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,581
It is something to watch somebody

418
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,949
at the top of their game.

419
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,952
It must've been a real thrill
from 30,000 feet.

420
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,988
Oh, come on, there has to be
a small part in you

421
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,790
that enjoyed what you just did
back there.

422
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,792
No? Hmm?

423
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:01,206
Showing me your shoe collection?

424
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,974
Yep.

425
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,946
A pair for every occasion.

426
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,082
You have enough guns in here
to outfit a small army, huh?

427
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:14,653
This? Oh, this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

428
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,758
You know what I like about you, Dom?

429
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,693
You're a genuine outlaw.

430
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,129
I mean, you're a man
who lives by his own rules.

431
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,732
Which is surprising because,
when I saw you in Cuba,

432
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,534
I heard about a guy

433
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,837
who almost killed you with a motorcycle,

434
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,840
and you let him keep his car?

435
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,075
Oh, that confused you?

436
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,243
Hmm.

437
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,279
Of course I could have taken his car.

438
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,049
Of course I could have beaten him down.

439
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,618
But it's about something bigger.

440
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,820
This way...

441
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,056
I changed him.

442
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,259
That's not your responsibility.

443
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,927
But it's who I am.

444
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,697
Let me ask you something, Dom.

445
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,699
What's the best thing in your life?

446
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,201
Family.

447
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,169
No, it's not.

448
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,906
Not if you're being honest.

449
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,810
It's the ten seconds
between start and finish

450
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,879
when you're not thinking about anything.

451
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,146
No family.

452
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,648
No obligations.

453
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:17,916
Just you...

454
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,818
that engine...

455
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,253
that open road...

456
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,289
being free.

457
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,897
I gotta tell you,
this whole saving-the-world,

458
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,767
Robin Hood nonsense
you've been doing recently...

459
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,002
it's bullshit.

460
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,136
It's not you.

461
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,243
Be who you are.

462
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,013
Why live only a quarter mile at a time

463
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:51,549
when you can live
your whole life that way?

464
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,162
Is that it?

465
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,032
Is that all those bloated-out
muscles will give you?

466
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,969
All show and no go.

467
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,852
Oh, I got plenty of go.

468
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,254
Yeah?

469
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,657
You must have misplaced that

470
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,192
when I kicked your arse up
and down that office of yours.

471
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,728
Yeah.

472
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,330
Just like you Brits...
rewriting history, huh?

473
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,999
All I know is it wasn't me

474
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,768
that was thrown out
of a four-story window.

475
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,102
Jumped.

476
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,671
I jumped out of a four-story window

477
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,072
saving my partner's life.

478
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,174
'Cause where I'm from,

479
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,209
we don't settle fights
by throwing bombs.

480
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,844
Well, that's funny,
because where I'm from,

481
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,146
we don't need women
to run to our rescue.

482
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,382
I mean, do you really believe

483
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,018
you can stand in front of me

484
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,021
and beat me in a straight-up,
old-fashioned fistfight?

485
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,790
Let me tell you something.

486
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:08,927
Me and you, one on one,
no one else around...

487
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,231
I will beat your ass
like a Cherokee drum.

488
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,036
Maybe one day we'll find out.

489
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,805
Oh, you better hope
that day never comes.

490
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,683
I said no, Mr. Nobody.

491
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,418
I'm not leaving this cell.

492
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,020
I'll get out my way.

493
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,322

Relax.
It's just a malfunction.

- Get back!

522
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,329
- Two questions.
- Yeah.

523
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,364
- My daughter?
- With your sister.

524
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:34,933
Toretto?

525
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,501
It's interesting you ask.

526
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,470
This is my new base.

527
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,306
Welcome to nowhere.

528
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,141
It's a little sterile for you.

529
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,509
Listen, there's something

530
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,177
I want to talk to you about after.

531
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,113
Hey, listen, guys, thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

532
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,614
Handcuffs? What is this?

533
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,582
It's called abuse of power.

534
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,152
You told me to round them up.

535
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,320
I didn't tell you to hand...

536
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,455
Cut 'em loose. Oh, man.

537
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,124
This is embarrassing.

538
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,992
I'm sorry, guys. Really, I...

539
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:03,094
So, this is how you treat old friends?

540
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,596
Friends?
We don't even really know

541
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,966
- who the hell this guy is.
- Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.

542
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,668
- I'm, like, nobody, okay?
- Nobody. So, then, who is he?

543
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,237
Him? He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.

544
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,905
Tej, trust me, brother,

545
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,606
that's a maze you don't want
to get lost in.

546
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,409
Clearly, we're getting nowhere
with nobody.

547
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,345
I've been in here for four hours,

548
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,347
and my ribs are showing.

549
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,216
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.

550
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,086
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?

551
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,355
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job,

552
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,958
you all made Interpol's
top ten most wanted list.

553
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,525
- Top ten.
- Mm-hmm.

554
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,527
That's all right.

555
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,396
Yeah. Well, uh... not you, Roman.

556
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,065
- What do you mean?
- You just missed the cut.

557
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,632
You're number 11, so...

558
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,702
- I... I missed? What are you...
- Yeah.

559
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,272
That's impossible.

560
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,506
What number did they come in at?

561
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,543
Six, eight, nine,

562
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,279
ten.

563
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,513
- She's ten?
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,182
She just got here. That's impossible.

565
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,483
There's no way she's a ten.

566
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,484
Oh, she's definitely a ten.

567
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,252
What?

568
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:03,254
How about we focus on someone

569
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:04,589
who we're not gonna find
on anybody's list.

570
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,458
We're awaiting hard confirmation,

571
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,095
but I believe that's the cyber terrorist

572
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,529
known as Cipher.

573
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,231
Wait, no.

574
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,533
Cipher's an organization,
not... not a person.

575
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,235
Not according to our sources.

576
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,337
- What does she want?
- No one knows.

577
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,040
Cipher is like a digital act of God.

578
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,342
They...
well, she can manipulate

579
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,578
world systems from the shadows...
governments, global markets.

580
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:29,714
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

581
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,183
And here's the kicker...
you'll never find her linked

582
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,518
to any of it.

583
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,020
Her digital identity is scrubbed

584
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,988
every few seconds worldwide.

585
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:39,157
Six years of
the intelligence community's

586
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,559
coordinated efforts
have turned up nothing

587
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,361
but this single photo.

588
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,562
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.

589
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,164
Damn, she's...

590
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:48,033
one of the hottest bogeymans
I've ever seen.

591
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,236
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

592
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,705
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...

593
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,374
Let's just say,

594
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,210
people are scared
of the hacker group Anonymous.

595
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,112
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.

596
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:03,748
What the hell does any of this
have to do with us?

597
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,783
Probably nothing, Letty,
but I do find it interesting

598
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,053
that, apparently, for some reason,

599
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,455
she's now working with this guy.

600
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,043
Do you know why?

601
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:34,445
Gee, no, Letty, I don't.

602
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,681
He's already delivered

603
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,650
a fully operational EMP into her hands.

604
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,652
Detonate that, they can turn

605
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:43,588
any city in the world into a war zone.

606
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,257
So, then, what is it
you're suggesting we do?

607
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,792
Maybe we find Dom, huh?

608
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,294
Well, first, let's catch him

609
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,496
and then figure out why he's turned.

610
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,464
And we put a stop to whatever
bullshit they got planned.

611
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,067
So, y'all want us to track Dom.

612
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:59,204
Yeah, I know, Roman,
it's kind of a big job.

613
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:01,172
It's impossible.

614
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:04,742
Which is why I'm bringing in
an extra pair of hands.

615
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,185
Ah, my day just got
a whole hell of a lot better.

616
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,520
Mr. Nobody, you want to tell me

617
00:44:15,553 --> 00:44:17,522
why you just put me in a room with this

618
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:20,325
tea and crumpets eating,
criminal sumbitch?

619
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,193
What a big mouth on a small head,

620
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:24,695
coming from prisoner 6753.

621
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,797
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

622
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,234
We are not teaming up with this guy.

623
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:31,669
Let's get one thing clear...
I ain't on your team.

624
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,204
I don't care about you,

625
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:35,540
your crew or your little family.

626
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,508
- I'm here for Cipher.
- What are you gonna do,

627
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,177
apply for a job?
Head asshole?

628
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,611
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's

629
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:42,213
cutting off the circulation
to your brain.

630
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:44,449
You should get a bigger size.

631
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,251
Cipher came to me first.

632
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:47,752
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

633
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,554
When I said no,
she went after my brother.

634
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:50,888
Ah, yes, brother Owen.

635
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,191
Who could forget him, huh?

636
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:55,426
Former hell-raiser and current guest

637
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,363
at a nasty little black-site prison.

638
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,830
Cipher corrupted him
and left him for dead.

639
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,699
So, if I get a shot to take her down,

640
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,301
believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.

641
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:04,702
You're taking my boot right up your ass

642
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,404
- is what you're taking.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.

643
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,239
The fastest way to find Cipher
is through Toretto.

644
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:09,740
Now, aside from myself, there's only

645
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:11,576
two men in the world
that have ever managed

646
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,211
to actually track him down
with any success.

647
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:14,579
And guess what... they're both

648
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:16,247
standing in front of me right now.

649
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:20,185
So, like it or not, you two
are gonna work together.

650
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,352
You got that?

651
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:26,824
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

652
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:29,160
Am I the only one seeing this?

653
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,428
Oh, this ought to be good.

654
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,366
Use God's Eye.

655
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,403
We put our lives on the line,
running around the world

656
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,171
trying to figure this thing out.

657
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:41,839
It can find anybody, right?

658
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,242
Let's use it to find Dom.

659
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:45,510
It's that easy. Done.

660
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:48,946
Roman, that is a great idea.

661
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:52,183
Did you hear that?
"Great idea"?

662
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:55,286
No, no, no, no, no, don't
tune it out, huh? Uh-huh. Huh.

663
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,855
See, you and this guy, right here.

664
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,457
Stay out of my lane, dude.

665
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,493
It's all me right here,
you know what I mean?

666
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:03,828
It's crazy.

667
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,563
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?

668
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,643
Got him. He's in London.

669
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,812
Yeah.

670
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:27,952
Wait. We've got
a second match in Hong Kong.

671
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,221
Beijing and Seoul.

672
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,223
And Tokyo.

673
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,626
And just about every other major city

674
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,862
- on the planet.
- And so...

675
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,764
God's Eye was where we started.

676
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,932
But Cipher's already created

677
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,868
an evasion that masks their location

678
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,504
by pinging random spots
all over the globe,

679
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,374
but it was a good thought, Roman.

680
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,309
So, she's made my program obsolete.

681
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,911
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.

682
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,781
See, simple solutions aren't
gonna cut it here, slick.

683
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,251
Why you look at me when you say that?

684
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:01,686
Wait a second.

685
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,255
Wait, wait. Simple solutions
might just cut it.

686
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:05,623
You see, in order for God's Eye

687
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,425
to give off all these false pings,

688
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,660
means they have to be
using a FLEA relay.

689
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:11,262
Watch these two.

690
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:12,930
Which means it has a decaying
sync randomizer.

691
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,532
Which we can reverse...

692
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,267
And track it back
to the originating source

693
00:47:16,301 --> 00:47:18,569
and find Dom's true location.

694
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:20,004
I'm telling you,

695
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:21,706
they got skills.

696
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,974
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.

697
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,543
- Remember in there?
- All right.

698
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:26,544
Let's try this.

699
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:37,988
It's working.

700
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,557
Time you want to check your manual

701
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,492
and start organizing a force response.

702
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:45,430
Let's get a hold
of our international assets...

703
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:46,797
He's still green.

704
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:48,966
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.

705
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:52,670
Soon as we have Toretto's
location, I want to mobilize.

706
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,441
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.

707
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,343
Uh, no one respects you, uh...

708
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,744
- Cover.
- Get away from me.

709
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:01,011
No problem. Bad breath.

710
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,881
Mm...

711
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,683
All right, they're not in China.

712
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,353
Or Russia.

713
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,955
Europe's clear.

714
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,593
But this one's not going away.

715
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,861
This is interesting.

716
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,364
Why?

717
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,334
Because that's here.

718
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:25,536
Pull up all security monitors
on this building, now.

719
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:28,773
Surprise.

720
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:13,518
Did you all enjoy that?

721
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:16,687
Next-generation concussion grenade.

722
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,989
It scrambles your senses.

723
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:22,693
Don't worry,
it will wear off in an hour.

724
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,629
Probably.

725
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,130
Hello, Deckard.

726
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,932
Nice to see you again.

727
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,770
Look at this.
Body's not even cold, Dom.

728
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,372
Your family's already replacing you.

729
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,943
You chose the losing team.

730
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,980
I guess your brother
is smarter than you.

731
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,986
Smart move embedding God's Eye
into the mainframe.

732
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,521
Irritating to make me have to

733
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,723
come all the way
down here to get it, but...

734
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,495
Let's go.

735
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:37,902
Dom!

736
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:49,146
You gonna turn your back on family?

737
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,848
Just like that?

738
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:33,023
Let's go.

739
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,092
You okay?

740
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:12,129
That wasn't him.

741
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,269
I don't know what she's got on him,

742
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,205
but that wasn't Dom.

743
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,074
Brian would know what to do.

744
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:25,576
No!

745
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:31,749
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.

746
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,751
We agreed on that.

747
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,655
I know.

748
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,695
You saved me.

749
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,833
I'm... I'm not really sure
how to thank you.

750
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:51,001
No need.

751
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:54,739
You got a computer I can use?

752
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:57,007
That I do.

753
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,695
Psst, yo.

754
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,932
What, man?

755
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,300
You see this?

756
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,703
Like, they really
going at it over there.

757
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:26,871
Must be the accent.

758
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,274
Bro...

759
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,042
he ain't got no accent to her.

760
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:33,711
They're from the same place.

761
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,780
- Uh, yeah, I was... I was just joking.
- Yeah, okay.

762
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:38,315
I got the accent. Exotic.

763
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,650
Exotic?

764
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:41,285
Barstow?

765
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,753
Ghetto?

766
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,822
Barstow is exotic to her.

767
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,931
Back there, was that for her,

768
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,134
for me or you?

769
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,671
And was it even necessary?

770
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:02,406
Necessary?

771
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,341
Nothing is necessary.

772
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:07,011
Everything is a choice.

773
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:10,147
And I simply made one, but so did you.

774
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,217
You could have stopped me,
but you chose not to.

775
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,785
Wonder what Letty thought about that.

776
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,191
The problem with putting
your foot on a tiger's neck

777
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,793
is you can never let it up.

778
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,962
I think I need to remind you

779
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,331
why you chose to be here.

780
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,835
Elena.

781
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,011
Dom.

782
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,889
I'm sorry.

783
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,226
You shouldn't have come.

784
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:34,899
Nothing could have kept me away.

785
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:36,433
Now she has the three of us.

786
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,674
Do you want to see him?

787
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,848
See Papa?

788
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:52,416
Yeah. Yeah.

789
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,318
Come and see Papa.

790
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,157
Papa.

791
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,836
When I realized I was pregnant,

792
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,904
you had just found out Letty was alive.

793
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:16,974
So I decided, when Letty and you

794
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:19,009
got back from your honeymoon,

795
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,011
I was going to tell you.

796
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,816
And then she took us
before I had the chance.

797
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:32,422
His name?

798
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,096
I call him Marcos.

799
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:44,501
But that's his middle name.

800
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:48,238
I thought his father
should give him his first name.

801
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,885
I'm sorry, Dom.

802
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,154
There's nothing to be sorry for.

803
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:08,158
Whatever happens...

804
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:11,929
...just save our son.

805
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,467
Your son.

806
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,427
Good visit?

807
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,135
I know.
I know what you're thinking.

808
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,271
I just let the guards go,

809
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,941
so there's only two opponents
in the room.

810
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,244
Rhodes has the gun,
so you'll take him out first.

811
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:01,445
I know you.

812
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,581
You have the will
so you'll find the way.

813
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:08,085
Once you've got it, you'll take him out.

814
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,154
Maybe even me.

815
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:11,922
And then you're thinking...

816
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:14,091
Elena's a cop.

817
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:17,227
Maybe the two of you
can fight your way out of here.

818
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,930
It's so much to think about.

819
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,437
Let me make it easier for you.

820
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,581
Do with it as you wish.

821
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,527
Have you heard of choice theory, Dom?

822
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,529
There is a bunch of axioms,

823
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,099
but only two you really need
to concern yourself with.

824
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:59,469
One... The only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

825
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:02,239
And two... The only thing we can truly

826
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:05,009
give another person is information.

827
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,511
So let me give you some.

828
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,346
You see these cameras in here?

829
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:14,151
The moment you make a move,
highly paid men with weapons

830
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:16,186
will make their way into this room

831
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,655
with one very specific instruction.

832
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,327
It's not to save me.

833
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,696
It's to kill your son.

834
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,467
Now, that's a lot of bullets,

835
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,637
and it only takes one
for you to lose everything.

836
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,273
So I have to ask you because...

837
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:40,144
I know family is so important to you.

838
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,084
Is that really a choice
you want to make?

839
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,556
Because I'm ready if you are.

840
00:59:56,326 --> 01:00:00,530
If I pull this trigger...
and God knows I want to...

841
01:00:00,564 --> 01:00:03,533
if I killed everyone on this plane,

842
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:06,603
I still couldn't get in there.

843
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:11,175
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.

844
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,510
Since I'm alone!

845
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,082
I got no choice!

846
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,360
I didn't think so.

847
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:07,631
You want to see the old Dom?

848
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,800
Watch.

849
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:21,845
Bitch.

850
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:25,549
- Don't... don't...
- Sweet dreams.

851
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:27,117
Please!

852
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:33,690
Damn it.

853
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,159
She wiped it all.

854
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,726
Took God's Eye.

855
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,663
That was the one thing
we could use to find them.

856
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,131
We lost everything.

857
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,603
What you got, princess?

858
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,638
Finding Toretto.

859
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:50,774
But I got a couple of minutes to spare,

860
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:53,877
if you want me to send you
to the hospital... again.

861
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,346
Yo, Rules.

862
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,516
- First off, that's not my name.
- Little Nobody.

863
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,551
- Don't call me that.
- Oh, that's definitely sticking.

864
01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:03,553
Great. Do me a favor and tell
Your Majesty over there

865
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:04,721
that we're gonna find Toretto.

866
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,790
We find Toretto together as a team.

867
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,725
And when all this is said and
done, I'll be happy to slap

868
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:10,394
that dick garage right off his face.

869
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:11,761
Wait a minute, guys.

870
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:13,630
I think Deckard's
actually onto something.

871
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,199
How do you think Dom and Cipher

872
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,367
got into the country without us knowing?

873
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,469
Ghost flights.

874
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:21,271
I thought untraceable aircraft was all

875
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:23,573
- Internet conspiracy stuff.
- It's not.

876
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:27,477
Satellites and radar grids
all across the globe

877
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:29,779
shift like an ocean.

878
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,948
And they've got channels
that open and close.

879
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,683
And theoretically,
if you know the right people

880
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:35,252
who know the right patterns...

881
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:36,920
You can fly
right through the blind spots

882
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,655
completely undetected.

883
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,258
So, you know where Dom is headed?

884
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,629
Yeah. New York.

885
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,933
You see there, Luke?
What did I tell you?

886
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,636
You guys are gonna get along just great.

887
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:56,673
Which proves rule number two...
you never lose everything.

888
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,974
Fire up the chopper.

889
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:01,311
Well, guys, have a ball
in the Big Apple.

890
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,253

891
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,987
♪ And we 'bout to go up ♪

892

01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,695

♪ We stay down... ♪

897
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,270
And why are we
traveling like this again?

898
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,004
Because Dom took God's Eye.

899
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,307
So we need to stay off the grid.

900
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,509
But like this?

901
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:39,015
Look here, man.
Before I throw up in my mouth,

902
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:41,285
let me ask you...
what are we doing here?

903
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,620
That's a good question, Roman.

904
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,355
Let me show you.

905
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,529
Welcome to our new base of operations.

906
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:55,632
No, seriously, what is this place?

907
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,301
This...

908
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,469
is heaven.

909
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:06,276
It's the agency garage.

910
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,511
They call it the Toy Shop.

911
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,455
This is where we house every vehicle

912
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:21,291
seized from drug dealers
on the East Coast.

913
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:22,859
Now, Mr. Nobody said,

914
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,329
"If we're gonna have a chance
at catching Dom...

915
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:28,898
...we're gonna have to be damn fast."

916
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,568
Figured this would help.

917
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,473
You got anything American?

918
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:38,041
What's the matter with you, huh?

919
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:39,576
Miss America.

920
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,044
What, are you allergic to quality?

921
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:44,814
This is the most durable
British vehicle ever built.

922
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:51,821
Oops.

923
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:53,923
I peed in your tea.

924
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:56,526
You're gonna fix that.

925
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,530
We got a tank.

926
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:02,599
750-horsepower,

927
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:06,870
6.6-liter V-8 Duramax engine

928
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,738
with an M153 CROWS

929
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:11,508
remotely operated
weapons station on top.

930
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,076
You didn't get this from drug dealers.

931
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,479
No. No, that, uh...

932
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:17,781
that, the United States Army lent me.

933
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:20,417
It's a Ripsaw unmanned combat vehicle.

934
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,087
Did you hear something?

935
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,556
See, the Army's developing
machines like this

936
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,358
that soldiers can drive from a mile away

937
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,927
so they can stay safe and alive.

938
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,697
But luckily,
there's a backup driver's seat

939
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:37,567
for those of us that like
to get more... hands-on.

940
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,002
I'm sitting there wondering
this whole time...

941
01:05:39,003 --> 01:05:39,469
Oh, whoa.

942
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:40,737
...will this thing feel like valet

943
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,472
- at Cheesecake Factory.
- Whoa.

944
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:44,974
No one is getting hands-on.

945
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:46,976
She doesn't go on city streets.

946
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,615
Wow.

947
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,717
I'm in love.

948
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:57,587
Again...

949
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:58,722
no, no.

950
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:00,490
That's a million-dollar show car.

951
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:02,659
The point is to not draw attention.

952
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,428
It's reverse psychology.

953
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,162
Dom will never see it coming.

954
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:07,831
It's neon orange.

955
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:10,967
The International Space Station
would see it coming.

956
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,102
Go choose anything less conspicuous.

957
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,439
No, no, no. Calipers are my...
This is ridiculous.

958
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,706
- Not happening.
- Hey, my man,

959
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,074
you can put that down right there.

960
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,510
This is a gift, a real gift.

961
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:21,978
I know what you're doing.

962
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:24,414
I like your beard.

963
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:25,982
You're Blanta.
Black Santa?

964
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:28,852
No, I'm serious.

965
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:30,520
Put it down right there.

966
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:00,850
What are you doing?

967
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:02,051
Engine's misfiring.

968
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,687
I gotta check it out.

969
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,154
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.

970
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,890
Clearly.

971
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:09,526
But unless you want the engine
to seize on the job...

972
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:11,895
You have five minutes.

973
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,509
I want another visual.

974
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,752
I got an ATM.

975
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,164
I don't like this.

976
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:03,647
I want to see Toretto.

977
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,715
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something.

978
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,150
Punch in on something reflective.

979
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,685
A car mirror, anything.

980
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,697
Do you know who I am?

981
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,732
It's why I'm here.

982
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,968
Do you know what I'm capable of?

983
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:29,138
It's why I'm here.

984
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:31,941
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.

985
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:33,877
And I'm fucking thirsty.

986
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,645
I've got limited time,

987
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,081
so I won't take up too much of yours.

988
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,783
Oh, no.

989
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,317
No, you've already taken

990
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,753
everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.

991
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:46,756
What more could you possibly want?

992
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,257
To give you something back.

993
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:58,935
Talk to me.

994
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:04,107
Something is not right here.

995
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:07,911
First time I saw my son

996
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:10,213
was behind a bulletproof glass.

997
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:13,116
When he heard my voice...

998
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,854
...I could see in his eyes
he knew I was his father.

999
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:20,757
When he reached for me,

1000
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:22,859
I couldn't hold him.

1001
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:29,365
It's the worst pain I ever felt.

1002
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:32,869
I know you know exactly how that feels.

1003
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:41,110
Maybe we could change that.

1004
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:44,781
And, now, why do I think
you're about to suggest

1005
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:48,184
something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?

1006
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:56,059
It's why I'm here.

1007
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:58,027
Jesus, punch in on something.

1008
01:09:58,061 --> 01:10:00,163
I'm not liking this.
Something's not right.

1009
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,398
Rhodes, you close?

1010
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:03,767
Yeah.

1011
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,034
Go.

1012
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:07,203
The delivery truck's moving.

1013
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,807
"Captain Deckard Shaw.

1014
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,743
"Distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry

1015
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:50,046
"at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

1016
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,115
"His bold actions saved the lives

1017
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:54,317
"of hostages and his teammates.

1018
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,754
Recommendation... the Victoria Cross."

1019
01:10:57,787 --> 01:11:01,825
The highest honor the British
government has ever given...

1020
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,793
to a traitor.

1021
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:06,963
Something about
this whole thing that just

1022
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:08,031
doesn't add up to me.

1023
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:10,166
Well, that would be
the same kind of funny math

1024
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,736
that says a DSS agent
who has a Silver Star for valor

1025
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,838
stole an EMP.

1026
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,773
Sound familiar, huh?

1027
01:11:23,246 --> 01:11:24,914
You want to give me a hand?

1028
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,285
- On three?
- Yeah.

1029
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,354
One, two, three.

1030
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:36,025
You know what, Twinkle Toes?

1031
01:11:36,059 --> 01:11:37,260
In another life, I bet me and you

1032
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,361
could have done some serious damage.

1033
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,164
- Yeah, we could've.
- Yeah.

1034
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:44,333
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head

1035
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:46,169
off the fender when this is all over.

1036
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:50,740
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain,

1037
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:52,976
when this whole thing is over,
we're gonna find a location,

1038
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:55,211
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat,

1039
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:58,047
you're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up your ass to brush 'em.

1040
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:06,155
Get me God's Eye.

1041
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:08,324
God's Eye active.

1042
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,159
Good.

1043
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:12,495
Let's find us a Russian.

1044
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:15,131
I spy with my little eye

1045
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,801
a Minister of Defense.

1046
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:47,063
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.

1047
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,798
Copy that.

1048
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:14,824
He's in the third car.

1049
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:17,126
It's a Guard Class limousine.

1050
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,544
Where's my team?

1051
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,847
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of them yet.

1052
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:39,282
They're off the grid.

1053
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:41,050
They're probably just
bunkered down somewhere.

1054
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,585
I'm closing in on 'em.

1055
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,922
You guys ready?

1056
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:47,290
One thing I can guarantee, Dom...

1057
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:50,026
no one's ready for this.

1058
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:52,161
I want every chip
with a zero-day exploit

1059
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:55,598
in a two-mile radius
around that motorcade now.

1060
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,100
There's over a thousand of them.

1061
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:58,367
Hack 'em all.

1062
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,420
It's zombie time.

1063
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,430
I'd buckle up if I were you.

1064
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:05,368
Safety sensors overridden.

1065
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:06,669
Thank you.

1066
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,476
Whoa, whoa!

1067
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,960
Hey!

1068
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:41,370
Target the motorcade.

1069
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:53,983
And here they come.

1070
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:03,026
Ouch.

1071
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,037
Police escort down.

1072
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,205
Take out the lead and follow cars.

1073
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:44,400
Two more down.

1074
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,534
They're still under warranty.

1075
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:13,296
We got an army of cars

1076
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,797
driving themselves!
Send backup! Send SWAT!

1077
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,166
I don't care if you send
the goddamn Boy Scouts!

1078
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,601
Just send them some help!

1079
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,802
Now, that's Dom.

1080
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,099
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.

1081
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:51,834
Perfect. Make it rain.

1082
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:51,460
Target immobilized.

1083
01:18:52,695 --> 01:18:54,129
You're up, Dom.

1084
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:43,612
Give me the case.

1085
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:43,339
Good work, Dom.

1086
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,840
Meet you at the pickup.

1087
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,985
I think I know where my team's at.

1088
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,020
Where?

1089
01:20:58,053 --> 01:20:59,655
Right in front of me.

1090
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,402
This is on you.

1091
01:21:13,436 --> 01:21:15,671
Get out of there, Dom.

1092
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,441
Guys, I know why Dom's here.

1093
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:21,377
Police scanners are saying
he stole a nuclear football.

1094
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,349
It's over, Toretto.

1095
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,384
Get your ass out of the car now.

1096
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:37,025
So, that's how you want to play this?

1097
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:39,362
Let's play.

1098
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:46,769
Don't do this, Dom.

1099
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:51,807
He's going for it.

1100
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,075
- What are you doing?
- It's a trap.

1101
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:56,879
Damn it!

1102
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,436
Now I know what it feels like

1103
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:21,870
to be every cop ever chasing us.

1104
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:23,539
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna pit him.

1105
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:25,674
Oh, so you just gonna pit Dom?

1106
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:28,677
Little Nobody has clearly lost
his little mind.

1107
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,157
I'm on him.

1108
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,759
Easy. Work together.

1109
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,637
- Look out!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1110
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,373
Oh, sh...

1111
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:05,614
I'll take the shortcut.

1112
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,929
Look out! Watch those people!

1113
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,099
Big Sexy coming through!

1114
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:58,767
Not this time, Dom.

1115
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,868
Watch the drag, or the line will snap!

1116
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,801
Stretch him out. Hold him.

1117
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:36,732
He's gotta have about
2,000 horsepower in that thing.

1118
01:25:36,765 --> 01:25:37,800
Try 3,000.

1119
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,038
Try five.

1120
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,348
Get out of there.

1121
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,983
I'm working on it.

1122
01:25:55,017 --> 01:25:56,685
Stop working on it, and do it.

1123
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,966
No, no, no, no.
This is my Bentley!

1124
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,912
No! No!

1125
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,742
Get that case and run.

1126
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:07,790
Move.

1127
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:15,163
They thought this was
gonna be a street fight.

1128
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:16,699
What are you waiting for, Toretto?

1129
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:20,703
No!

1130
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,170
Let's get out of here!

1131
01:27:34,717 --> 01:27:35,684
Letty, stop!

1132
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:42,090
What are you gonna do?

1133
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:57,773
I don't know why you're doing this,

1134
01:27:57,806 --> 01:28:00,308
but I know one thing...

1135
01:28:00,342 --> 01:28:01,877
You love me.

1136
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,416
And you are not gonna shoot me.

1137
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:22,430
You should have given him the case,

1138
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,431
'cause I won't chase you.

1139
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,435
Okay.

1140
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,504
I will just take it from a dead girl.

1141
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:33,942
You willing to die for it?

1142
01:28:50,993 --> 01:28:53,195
Let's go, then.

1143
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:15,417
Anything?

1144
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:18,186
They're gone.

1145
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:21,289
And DOD confirmed
it was a nuclear football.

1146
01:29:21,323 --> 01:29:23,992
He's got an EMP
and nuclear launch codes.

1147
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:25,794
I don't know what it is,

1148
01:29:25,828 --> 01:29:28,530
but... but they're building
towards something.

1149
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:29,898
Deckard?

1150
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:33,902
He didn't make it.

1151
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,928
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

1152
01:29:59,962 --> 01:30:01,864
When push came to shove,

1153
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,466
you were gonna let Letty
just walk away with the codes.

1154
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:07,870
- You got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.

1155
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:10,805
You made the choice to let her go.

1156
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,809
And now I have to make one of my own.

1157
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:32,027
They are adorable
little things, aren't they?

1158
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:35,197
God, I hope I don't hurt him.

1159
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:37,933
They're just designed to be so cute.

1160
01:30:43,405 --> 01:30:47,042
Look, psychotic, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

1161
01:30:47,075 --> 01:30:49,244
Don't do this.

1162
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,146
This is your doing.

1163
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:52,180
My doing?!

1164
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:58,553
Da-da-da.

1165
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:01,589
Dada. Dada.

1166
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,360
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.

1167
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:08,230
I don't want you to beg.

1168
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:12,100
I want you to learn.

1169
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:14,136
Learn what?!

1170
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:18,907
Everyone knows family
is the most important thing

1171
01:31:18,941 --> 01:31:20,909
in your life, so...

1172
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:26,081
...I understand
why you did what you did.

1173
01:31:26,114 --> 01:31:28,250
I really do.

1174
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:31,653
Dada.

1175
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:36,391
But it was the wrong choice.

1176
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:40,028
This is the consequence of that.

1177
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:45,968
No. No! No!

1178
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,135
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
W-Wait.

1179
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:50,472
- Save your son!
- No!

1180
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,041
No!

1181
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:17,065
Shh...

1182
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,743
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

1183
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,578
Traffic cams.

1184
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:31,546
I got you.

1185
01:32:36,318 --> 01:32:37,452
I knew it.

1186
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,287
I recognize that guy.

1187
01:32:39,321 --> 01:32:42,324
That's Connor Rhodes.

1188
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:45,627
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

1189
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,496
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

1190
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:51,666
He must've been working
with that bitch the whole time.

1191
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:54,236
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked

1192
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:57,005
to somebody I'd quite like to forget.

1193
01:32:57,039 --> 01:32:59,407
Mose Jakande.

1194
01:32:59,441 --> 01:33:02,044
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.

1195
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,345
Which means that's twice that Dom

1196
01:33:03,378 --> 01:33:04,446
has messed up Cipher's business.

1197
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:23,631
Everything you're feeling right now...

1198
01:33:23,665 --> 01:33:27,635
this rage, this sense of loss...
it's not real.

1199
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:31,206
It's an adaptive, evolutionary response.

1200
01:33:31,239 --> 01:33:32,774
It's a survival instinct

1201
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:35,777
wired deep into our brains to ensure

1202
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:38,413
continuation of the species.

1203
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:45,287
When early man
would visit a watering hole,

1204
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,622
if they didn't watch their child

1205
01:33:47,655 --> 01:33:49,691
and it got snatched by a crocodile...

1206
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,796
...our brains would create a painful

1207
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:58,700
but instructional memory

1208
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:02,070
so it would never happen again.

1209
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:09,211
This idea of family
that is so core with you,

1210
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:12,214
that rules your world,

1211
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:14,516
it's a biological lie.

1212
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,722
You don't have to accept it.

1213
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:23,725
I don't.

1214
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:30,132
Did you really think you could destroy

1215
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:33,635
two of my teams
without any repercussions?

1216
01:34:35,137 --> 01:34:37,472
I wouldn't have even looked your way

1217
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,174
if you hadn't done that.

1218
01:34:39,207 --> 01:34:42,144
You didn't even know you had a kid.

1219
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:43,845
You can thank me for that

1220
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:46,781
and start doing the job
I'm asking you to do.

1221
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,484
Help you start a war.

1222
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,686
Is that what you think I want?

1223
01:34:54,389 --> 01:34:55,790
That's so limited.

1224
01:34:57,492 --> 01:34:59,494
I didn't take that football
to start a war

1225
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:03,231
any more than I took your son
to start a family.

1226
01:35:04,499 --> 01:35:06,901
Taking your son got me the codes.

1227
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:08,803
The codes will get me the nukes,

1228
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:11,839
and the nukes will get me what I want

1229
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:15,577
today, tomorrow
and every day after that.

1230
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:17,245
And what's that?

1231
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:21,649
Accountability.

1232
01:35:23,685 --> 01:35:26,254
The second I fire off
one of those nukes,

1233
01:35:26,288 --> 01:35:28,623
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice

1234
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:32,927
that when they cross the line,

1235
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,764
I'm gonna be there
to hold them responsible.

1236
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:40,235
Because the truth is, Dom,

1237
01:35:40,268 --> 01:35:42,537
to the world out there...

1238
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:47,575
...I am the crocodile
at the watering hole.

1239
01:35:53,815 --> 01:35:55,883
We've got one last job to do.

1240
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,920
I have known one thing
about you, Cipher.

1241
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:03,191
Behind those contacts,
your eyes are brown.

1242
01:36:03,225 --> 01:36:07,195
Beneath that dye, your hair is black.

1243
01:36:07,229 --> 01:36:09,264
There was probably beauty
inside you once,

1244
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:11,599
but somehow you let it all die away.

1245
01:36:11,633 --> 01:36:14,336
You're so wrapped up in being a mystery,

1246
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:17,239
you don't know who
the hell you are anymore.

1247
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:19,641
You're lost...

1248
01:36:19,674 --> 01:36:22,477
you're alone...

1249
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,612
and you're scared.

1250
01:36:34,856 --> 01:36:36,758
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.

1251
01:36:39,661 --> 01:36:42,497
Because, whether you value it or not,

1252
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:44,666
all of this...

1253
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:48,836
your plane, your security and you...

1254
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:51,473
are still on this Earth because of him.

1255
01:36:56,678 --> 01:36:58,413
The problem we've had

1256
01:36:58,446 --> 01:37:00,582
with tracking Cipher
is there's nothing to trace.

1257
01:37:00,615 --> 01:37:02,250
But now we have Rhodes' information.

1258
01:37:02,284 --> 01:37:03,785
And we're getting snapshots of his data

1259
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,453
before it's scrubbed off the Net.

1260
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,821
That look like somebody's bank account,

1261
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:08,423
so why don't we just go ahead...

1262
01:37:08,456 --> 01:37:09,791
It's a longitude.

1263
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:12,294
Given the fact that Dom
hit a Russian motorcade,

1264
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:13,461
safe to say it's Russia.

1265
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:15,697
Go ahead and bring up the map.

1266
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:18,633
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

1267
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:21,769
Yalta, Poltava...

1268
01:37:21,803 --> 01:37:23,538
It's like they just
threw letters together.

1269
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:26,641
- Kronyurt...
- It's Vladovin.

1270
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,376
What are you doing here?

1271
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:29,711
What?
Told you I was gonna

1272
01:37:29,744 --> 01:37:30,978
check in on you from time to time

1273
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,380
to see how you were doing.

1274
01:37:32,414 --> 01:37:34,048
By the way, not so hot.

1275
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:35,883
But there's nothing in Vladovin.

1276
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,819
- It's just ice.
- That's funny.

1277
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,422
Could've sworn there was
a secret Russian naval base

1278
01:37:40,455 --> 01:37:42,890
where they retrofitted
Cold War submarines.

1279
01:37:42,924 --> 01:37:45,327
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

1280
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,495
Base was taken over by a terror group

1281
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:49,030
of military separatists
about a month ago,

1282
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:50,097
and the Russians
haven't taken it back yet,

1283
01:37:50,131 --> 01:37:53,435
so there is a little window
of opportunity here.

1284
01:37:53,468 --> 01:37:55,337
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.

1285
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:56,838
It sounds like, everything we do,

1286
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:59,006
our legs gonna be blown off.

1287
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,443
It sounds like you still
number 11 on the list.

1288
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:05,480
It sounds like you've changed
since your little

1289
01:38:05,513 --> 01:38:07,682
punk-ass facial hairs done came in.

1290
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,517
Like a fake-ass Barry White looking...

1291
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:10,652
Guys, guys.

1292
01:38:10,685 --> 01:38:12,620
Hey, we gotta call this in.

1293
01:38:12,654 --> 01:38:14,422
All the way up the chain.

1294
01:38:14,456 --> 01:38:16,658
That's good thinking, champ,
except, unfortunately,

1295
01:38:16,691 --> 01:38:19,494
the Russian Minister of Defense
got himself involved

1296
01:38:19,527 --> 01:38:21,696
in a little incident
on U.S. territory and...

1297
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:23,731
two governments aren't talking
to each other for a while.

1298
01:38:23,765 --> 01:38:25,500
By the time they do, it'll be too late.

1299
01:38:25,533 --> 01:38:27,068
So, any other suggestions?

1300
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:28,069
Yeah.

1301
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:29,737
I got one.

1302
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,008
How about we just stop 'em ourselves?

1303
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:36,110
You're talking about
a Russian military base.

1304
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:38,580
- Separatist.
- Whatever. It's suicide.

1305
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:39,881
It's stopping World War Three.

1306
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:43,050
What's it gonna be, rook?

1307
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,687
You gonna close your eyes
on this one, too?

1308
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,522
Pray that the apocalypse
doesn't come knocking

1309
01:38:47,555 --> 01:38:48,856
on your mama's front door?

1310
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:52,026
Or you gonna saddle up, be a man

1311
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:54,996
and save the entire goddamn world?

1312
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:03,104
You know, I think I figured it out.

1313
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:04,539
What's that?

1314
01:39:04,572 --> 01:39:05,640
Rule number three.

1315
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:06,674
Which is?

1316
01:39:08,009 --> 01:39:10,378
There are no rules.

1317
01:39:10,412 --> 01:39:12,714
What'd I tell you, Luke?

1318
01:39:12,747 --> 01:39:15,450
I knew he'd get it in three.

1319
01:39:15,483 --> 01:39:17,051
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.

1320
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:18,486
Take whatever vehicle you want.

1321
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,687
All bets are off.

1322
01:39:19,721 --> 01:39:21,055
- All bets are off?
- Bets are off?

1323
01:39:49,617 --> 01:39:52,053
Letty, I don't like
telling you this one bit,

1324
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:54,188
but the game's changed.

1325
01:39:54,221 --> 01:39:56,724
Before, we were just trying
to catch Dom,

1326
01:39:56,758 --> 01:39:58,159
but now, after all this,

1327
01:39:58,192 --> 01:40:01,028
I want you to know, if I have to,

1328
01:40:01,062 --> 01:40:02,864
I'm gonna put him down.

1329
01:40:05,232 --> 01:40:07,602
Then you might have
to take us both down.

1330
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,938
I'm freezing, man.

1331
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:12,640
This ain't for me.

1332
01:40:12,674 --> 01:40:15,843
I come from a different kind
of lifestyle, brah.

1333
01:40:17,645 --> 01:40:19,113
Ladies know me.

1334
01:40:19,146 --> 01:40:22,116
They know where I'm at with it.

1335
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:24,519
I tried to take a piss...

1336
01:40:24,552 --> 01:40:26,788
I didn't even recognize myself.

1337
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:28,222
Man, that's entirely
too much information.

1338
01:40:28,255 --> 01:40:30,024
I'm just saying.

1339
01:40:30,057 --> 01:40:32,460
Well, one thing's for sure.

1340
01:40:32,494 --> 01:40:34,896
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a trade,

1341
01:40:34,929 --> 01:40:36,531
because no one would be this insane

1342
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:39,834
to hit this place without a damn army.

1343
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,936
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1344
01:40:44,506 --> 01:40:46,674
Speak of the devil.

1345
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:55,850
All right, Dom, you're one step closer

1346
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,051
to that family reunion.

1347
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:59,086
400 meters to base.

1348
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,656
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.

1349
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,829
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.

1350
01:41:57,745 --> 01:41:59,013
EMP is recharging.

1351
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:01,649
- How long?
- 60 seconds.

1352
01:42:01,683 --> 01:42:05,219
All right, Dom, you have
one pulse left in that EMP.

1353
01:42:05,252 --> 01:42:07,589
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need

1354
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:09,691
to be right underneath it
for this thing to work.

1355
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:34,816
Come on.

1356
01:42:52,634 --> 01:42:53,935
Yes!

1357
01:42:53,968 --> 01:42:55,269
Two birds with one stone.

1358
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:56,871
We've got control of the sub.

1359
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:58,239
Dom, we are good.

1360
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:00,875
Head over to the rendezvous.
Okay, Matty...

1361
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:02,944
let's take this baby for a spin.

1362
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:09,651
Damn.

1363
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:11,218
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub

1364
01:43:11,252 --> 01:43:12,920
to slave its command system.

1365
01:43:12,954 --> 01:43:14,622
What the hell is he talking about?

1366
01:43:14,656 --> 01:43:18,025
In layman's terms,
she just carjacked a submarine.

1367
01:43:20,394 --> 01:43:22,830
We can't let it get away.

1368
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:24,331
There's the control room.

1369
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:26,100
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,

1370
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:28,703
I can tap the network
and counter-hack Cipher.

1371
01:43:28,736 --> 01:43:30,237
Keep it from lowering into the water.

1372
01:43:30,271 --> 01:43:32,840
No, what we need to do
is get me on that sub.

1373
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,909
I find the weapons room,
and I can pull the launch chip

1374
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:36,744
before she can fire any of those nukes.

1375
01:43:36,778 --> 01:43:39,346
- That is too crazy.
- What you're saying is too dangerous.

1376
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,848
We'll do both.

1377
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:06,307
Knock, knock.

1378
01:44:11,312 --> 01:44:13,681
Five vehicles just breached the base.

1379
01:44:13,715 --> 01:44:15,683
They just don't give up, do they?

1380
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,127
All right, let's haul ass, team.

1381
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,194
Double time, double time.

1382
01:44:36,503 --> 01:44:38,205
Letty, let's roll.

1383
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,710
Go! Go, go, go!

1384
01:45:19,113 --> 01:45:20,982
Change of plans, Dom.

1385
01:45:21,015 --> 01:45:21,983
I'm sending you new coordinates.

1386
01:45:22,016 --> 01:45:23,484
Head there immediately.

1387
01:45:23,517 --> 01:45:25,787
I'm done. I want my son.

1388
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,988
I'll tell you when you're done.

1389
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:29,256
Your team is in play.

1390
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:31,458
Now, meet Rhodes
and follow my instruction.

1391
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:39,033
I got you covered! Go!

1392
01:45:41,803 --> 01:45:42,837
Move, move!

1393
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:45,272
Get out of here! Go, go, go!

1394
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:52,780
Okay.

1395
01:45:52,814 --> 01:45:54,515
How do you like this?

1396
01:45:57,118 --> 01:45:58,886
Remote link has been severed.

1397
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,487
I'll take care of this.

1398
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:05,860
Hi, Ramsey.

1399
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:10,331
She's regained control.

1400
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:12,333
Damn it, she's good.

1401
01:47:12,059 --> 01:47:13,260
They're entering the weapons room.

1402
01:47:13,294 --> 01:47:14,929
Oh, that's cute.

1403
01:47:20,567 --> 01:47:23,270
Yo! Pull, pull!

1404
01:47:23,304 --> 01:47:24,939
Roman, Roman, we gotta find the chip.

1405
01:47:24,972 --> 01:47:26,240
Go!

1406
01:47:37,084 --> 01:47:38,352
Oh, she's slick.

1407
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:40,021
You're gonna have to do better
than that, though.

1408
01:47:42,123 --> 01:47:44,625
Okay, now you're starting
to piss me off.

1409
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,542
Ramsey, how much time we talking here?

1410
01:48:01,575 --> 01:48:03,110
You're smart...

1411
01:48:03,144 --> 01:48:04,979
but not smart enough.

1412
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:09,250
She's locked me out.

1413
01:48:13,187 --> 01:48:14,388
Tej, I can't stop her.

1414
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:15,689
You're gonna have to pull that chip.

1415
01:48:15,722 --> 01:48:18,125
I can't. This thing's gone
into attack mode.

1416
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,461
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip.

1417
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:22,163
Tej, we got no idea

1418
01:48:22,196 --> 01:48:24,165
what the hell we're looking for.

1419
01:48:25,366 --> 01:48:26,333
I got it.

1420
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:32,039
What in the hell are you guys doing?

1421
01:48:32,073 --> 01:48:34,641
It wasn't me.
It-it wasn't me, okay?

1422
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:36,610
It'll be labeled "guidance go."

1423
01:48:36,643 --> 01:48:37,611
Guidance go, guidance...

1424
01:48:37,644 --> 01:48:38,612
Okay, I got something.

1425
01:48:38,645 --> 01:48:40,047
- What?
- It says...

1426
01:48:40,081 --> 01:48:41,515
H-Hakslak...

1427
01:48:41,548 --> 01:48:43,184
s-slak-lak...

1428
01:48:43,217 --> 01:48:46,253
smok... belzak... marak...

1429
01:48:46,287 --> 01:48:47,588
Do you understand that?

1430
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:14,181
Wow, nasty.

1431
01:49:30,764 --> 01:49:32,566
Hmm.

1432
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:34,301
Quite a show.

1433
01:49:37,271 --> 01:49:39,073
We're arming the nuke.

1434
01:49:44,278 --> 01:49:46,313
Nuke's going hot. She's
trying to fire this thing.

1435
01:49:46,347 --> 01:49:47,781
Roger that.
We're moving out.

1436
01:49:47,814 --> 01:49:49,350
- Disable that chip, now!
- Roman, what are you seeing?

1437
01:49:49,383 --> 01:49:50,651
Come on, talk to me.

1438
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:52,486
I don't see shit.
I'm holding on.

1439
01:49:53,654 --> 01:49:55,556
And we have a countdown.

1440
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:00,561
What the hell is going on, man?

1441
01:50:00,594 --> 01:50:03,030
We're about to launch a nuclear missile

1442
01:50:03,064 --> 01:50:05,266
is what the hell is going on.
Pull the damn chip!

1443
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:09,470
Countdown. Countdown!

1444
01:50:09,503 --> 01:50:11,805
- Look for a countdown!
- What countdown?

1445
01:50:11,838 --> 01:50:14,275
The missiles need to activate to launch.

1446
01:50:14,308 --> 01:50:15,609
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.

1447
01:50:15,642 --> 01:50:17,144
The countdown...

1448
01:50:17,178 --> 01:50:19,480
Let's show the world what we've got.

1449
01:50:21,182 --> 01:50:23,384
No, no, no, don't press that!

1450
01:50:24,685 --> 01:50:26,019
I got it.

1451
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:30,023
Something's wrong.
It won't launch.

1452
01:50:31,558 --> 01:50:34,161
Get that sub out of there. Now!

1453
01:50:35,762 --> 01:50:37,464
Move your ass, Roman!

1454
01:50:46,207 --> 01:50:48,075
- You all right?
- There's nothing all right

1455
01:50:48,109 --> 01:50:50,111
about any of this!
Let's go!

1456
01:50:50,144 --> 01:50:51,312
What about the missiles?

1457
01:50:51,345 --> 01:50:53,214
We got the chip.

1458
01:50:53,247 --> 01:50:54,448
No nukes for her.

1459
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:55,749
Hell yeah.

1460
01:50:55,782 --> 01:50:57,118
Let's roll.

1461
01:51:08,429 --> 01:51:09,763
Oh, shit!

1462
01:51:17,871 --> 01:51:19,340
The other way!

1463
01:51:19,373 --> 01:51:20,241
What?

1464
01:51:20,274 --> 01:51:22,576
Go the other way!

1465
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:24,711
The ice.
Everybody out on the ice.

1466
01:51:31,385 --> 01:51:32,786
Guys, we got company.

1467
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:34,321
A lot of company.

1468
01:51:38,525 --> 01:51:40,294
All right, team, here's the plan.

1469
01:51:40,327 --> 01:51:42,463
There's a sea lock
at the opening of the bay.

1470
01:51:42,496 --> 01:51:43,697
We get there first and close it,

1471
01:51:43,730 --> 01:51:45,499
we can stop the submarine

1472
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:48,435
from escaping into open water
and disappearing forever.

1473
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:50,871
I've got the location.

1474
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:53,140
It's ten miles southwest.

1475
01:51:53,174 --> 01:51:55,309
Ten miles? We're not gonna
make it ten seconds!

1476
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:06,453
No, no, no, no, no!
This is not good! Aah!

1477
01:52:06,487 --> 01:52:07,588
What's the matter, Roman?

1478
01:52:07,621 --> 01:52:08,789
Forgot your snow tires?

1479
01:52:12,259 --> 01:52:13,760
You loving that Lambo now?

1480
01:52:13,794 --> 01:52:16,163
Oh, sh... Oh!

1481
01:52:24,371 --> 01:52:25,706
All right, everyone.

1482
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:26,807
We'll deal with that launch chip later.

1483
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,342
Right now I want that sub

1484
01:52:28,375 --> 01:52:29,810
in deep water where no one can find it.

1485
01:52:29,843 --> 01:52:31,878
Find me the fastest route
out of that bay.

1486
01:52:31,912 --> 01:52:32,846
Copy that.

1487
01:52:42,356 --> 01:52:44,458
Why are they shooting at me?!

1488
01:52:44,491 --> 01:52:46,227
Maybe 'cause you're in
an orange Lamborghini.

1489
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:47,228
I don't know.

1490
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:48,795
Shut up, Tej!

1491
01:52:54,235 --> 01:52:57,271
Dom, do you really
want to put that car in gear?

1492
01:52:58,805 --> 01:53:00,841
Do it, huh?

1493
01:53:04,411 --> 01:53:06,747
- I didn't think so.
- They're heading for the sea lock.

1494
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:08,715
They're trying to trap
the sub in the bay.

1495
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:15,322
I should have taken care
of this a long time ago.

1496
01:53:15,356 --> 01:53:17,691
Rhodes, take his team out.

1497
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:20,761
I'm on it.

1498
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:27,401
Roman, get in front of me.

1499
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:35,942
Okay, y'all want to play rough?

1500
01:53:35,976 --> 01:53:37,778
Now it's my turn.

1501
01:53:52,693 --> 01:53:54,628
Yeah, baby!

1502
01:54:03,837 --> 01:54:05,972
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.

1503
01:54:07,908 --> 01:54:09,643
They're gonna flank us!

1504
01:54:15,416 --> 01:54:16,350
No, they ain't.

1505
01:54:22,456 --> 01:54:23,524
Oh, shit!

1506
01:54:37,771 --> 01:54:39,072
Tej!

1507
01:54:39,105 --> 01:54:40,907
Roman, hold tight.
I'm on the way.

1508
01:54:44,678 --> 01:54:46,547
I don't want to go swimming!

1509
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:47,614
No!

1510
01:54:53,754 --> 01:54:54,855
Really, Tej?

1511
01:54:58,459 --> 01:54:59,993
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1512
01:55:03,564 --> 01:55:04,998
Oh, shit!

1513
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:09,069
Roman, grab your door.

1514
01:55:09,102 --> 01:55:10,337
Tej!

1515
01:55:10,371 --> 01:55:11,605
Grab the door, Roman!

1516
01:55:11,638 --> 01:55:13,106
- It's so cold!
- Shit.

1517
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:14,808
Oh, shit!

1518
01:55:20,547 --> 01:55:22,849
Whoa!

1519
01:55:22,883 --> 01:55:24,518
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1520
01:55:24,551 --> 01:55:27,721
What is going on?!

1521
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:28,722
Roman, hang on.

1522
01:55:30,424 --> 01:55:31,157
Tej!

1523
01:55:35,028 --> 01:55:36,630
Get me off of this thing!

1524
01:55:36,663 --> 01:55:37,598
Tej!

1525
01:55:41,402 --> 01:55:42,803
Come on!

1526
01:55:57,884 --> 01:56:00,053
All right.
I've had enough of this shit!

1527
01:56:13,767 --> 01:56:16,069
Number 11, my ass.

1528
01:56:18,138 --> 01:56:19,706
Yo, Shrinkage.

1529
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:21,508
We got a sub to catch.
Get in.

1530
01:56:34,555 --> 01:56:36,590
What?

1531
01:56:36,623 --> 01:56:38,692
Depressurization alert
in the cargo hold.

1532
01:56:38,725 --> 01:56:40,527
Drop it to 10,000 feet.

1533
01:56:40,561 --> 01:56:43,163
I know how much
these people mean to you.

1534
01:56:43,196 --> 01:56:45,699
So I will let you pick the first target.

1535
01:56:45,732 --> 01:56:48,469
I don't pick a target from a mile away.

1536
01:56:50,103 --> 01:56:52,773
I stand face to face
and look 'em dead in the eye.

1537
01:56:55,141 --> 01:56:56,743
Okay.

1538
01:56:56,777 --> 01:56:58,411
The wife it is.

1539
01:57:16,262 --> 01:57:17,931
Nice plane.

1540
01:57:17,964 --> 01:57:19,533
I'm going to enjoy having this.

1541
01:57:19,566 --> 01:57:21,635
Hey, don't go getting any ideas.

1542
01:57:21,668 --> 01:57:23,136
You and planes
don't have a good history.

1543
01:57:24,971 --> 01:57:27,508
No shit.

1544
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:29,976
Okay... let's go, Scarface.

1545
01:57:30,010 --> 01:57:32,112
These assholes
ain't gonna kill themselves.

1546
01:57:35,749 --> 01:57:37,718
Pull up surveillance right now.

1547
01:57:42,022 --> 01:57:44,124
Surprise.

1548
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:47,828
You're supposed to be dead.

1549
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:06,279
We have a security breach
in the cargo hold.

1550
01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:07,581
Take care of it now.

1551
01:58:12,886 --> 01:58:14,154
Jesus, Mum.

1552
01:58:14,187 --> 01:58:15,722
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.

1553
01:58:15,756 --> 01:58:17,624
Oh, shut up.
Don't be such a baby.

1554
01:58:24,064 --> 01:58:26,066
Get to the pilot.
He's got the second key.

1555
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:29,903
- Wait for my signal.
- Give Cipher my regards.

1556
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:31,605
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?

1557
01:58:43,049 --> 01:58:45,652
He gave us this little thing here.

1558
01:58:45,686 --> 01:58:46,787
No, no, no, no.

1559
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:48,288
Don't touch.

1560
01:58:48,321 --> 01:58:49,723
You can track Cipher with this,

1561
01:58:49,756 --> 01:58:51,024
but you can't do this on your own.

1562
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:53,026
It's gotta be two of you.

1563
01:58:53,059 --> 01:58:54,861
Fine. I've got contacts.

1564
01:58:54,895 --> 01:58:57,764
No, you're gonna take your brother.

1565
01:58:57,798 --> 01:58:58,765
- No. Damn.
- Yes.

1566
01:59:02,869 --> 01:59:04,337
Toretto knows where he is.

1567
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:06,607
He's got this thing.
It can see everything.

1568
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:09,042
It's like... it's called the
Devil's Bumhole or something.

1569
01:59:09,075 --> 01:59:11,211
- It's called the God's Eye.
- Yeah, well, whatever.

1570
01:59:13,914 --> 01:59:16,617
There's no way I'm using Owen,
all right?

1571
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:18,184
He's a lost cause.

1572
01:59:18,218 --> 01:59:19,920
He's your brother, Decks.

1573
01:59:19,953 --> 01:59:21,254
He's my son.

1574
01:59:21,287 --> 01:59:23,189
He's our family.

1575
01:59:23,223 --> 01:59:27,293
And our family
don't die in bloody cages.

1576
01:59:27,327 --> 01:59:29,229
How can you talk like that about Owen?

1577
01:59:29,262 --> 01:59:30,864
I can't believe you.

1578
01:59:30,897 --> 01:59:32,032
You've gone and upset me.

1579
01:59:32,065 --> 01:59:33,634
You've really upset your mother.

1580
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:34,935
Call yourself a brother?

1581
01:59:34,968 --> 01:59:36,069
- Look, look, come here.
- You're...

1582
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:38,038
Mum. Okay, okay.

1583
01:59:39,272 --> 01:59:41,842
Every time.

1584
01:59:45,145 --> 01:59:46,780
Owen.

1585
01:59:46,813 --> 01:59:48,281
In position.

1586
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:50,884
Go.

1587
01:59:51,852 --> 01:59:53,687
I'm in.

1588
02:00:11,672 --> 02:00:13,173
I've got the package, Toretto.

1589
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:16,042
All 12 pounds of him.

1590
02:00:16,076 --> 02:00:17,410
Yeah!

1591
02:00:17,443 --> 02:00:21,147
Dada. Dada.

1592
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:39,265
You made me miss my shot.

1593
02:00:39,299 --> 02:00:41,134
What you think you're doing?

1594
02:00:43,269 --> 02:00:44,905
Looking at you dead in the eye.

1595
02:01:07,994 --> 02:01:09,863
That was for Elena.

1596
02:01:13,366 --> 02:01:15,468
Rhodes.

1597
02:01:15,501 --> 02:01:17,203
He's no longer with us.

1598
02:01:18,304 --> 02:01:19,940
Rhodes picked the wrong target.

1599
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:23,276
Congratulations, Dom.

1600
02:01:23,309 --> 02:01:25,145
You just killed your son.

1601
02:01:25,178 --> 02:01:28,048
You're wrong.
I just saved him.

1602
02:01:28,081 --> 02:01:31,017
And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.

1603
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:42,228
All right, governor,
it's gonna get noisy.

1604
02:01:43,463 --> 02:01:44,965
This is for your ears.

1605
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:51,137
Good?

1606
02:01:53,239 --> 02:01:55,141
Let's go.

1607
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:58,912
No. Stop him!

1608
02:01:58,945 --> 02:02:00,747
Do not let him get off this plane.

1609
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:06,052
We got another problem.

1610
02:02:06,086 --> 02:02:07,921
That truck's got enough
missiles to take us all out.

1611
02:02:07,954 --> 02:02:09,222
Then don't give 'em a target.

1612
02:02:09,255 --> 02:02:10,957
Everybody, get in front of us, line up,

1613
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:12,392
- and we'll take the hit.
- What?

1614
02:02:12,425 --> 02:02:14,327
I need to switch cars right now.

1615
02:02:30,877 --> 02:02:32,946
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

1616
02:02:36,216 --> 02:02:37,283
Whoa!

1617
02:02:38,284 --> 02:02:39,986
Whoo!

1618
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:41,888
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.

1619
02:02:41,922 --> 02:02:43,323
It's easy for you to say

1620
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:45,158
when your ass ain't on fire.

1621
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:52,265
All right, little man.

1622
02:02:52,298 --> 02:02:55,235
This might be a little scary,

1623
02:02:55,268 --> 02:02:56,569
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

1624
02:02:56,602 --> 02:02:57,971
Ready?

1625
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:10,083
How's the music? Good?

1626
02:03:24,097 --> 02:03:25,298
They're locking on.

1627
02:03:25,331 --> 02:03:26,900
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.

1628
02:03:26,933 --> 02:03:28,001
What do we do now?

1629
02:03:28,034 --> 02:03:29,369
We start praying.

1630
02:03:53,393 --> 02:03:54,327
Hell yeah!

1631
02:04:06,973 --> 02:04:08,574
There's Dom.

1632
02:04:12,312 --> 02:04:13,914
What, is this guy on our side now?

1633
02:04:13,947 --> 02:04:15,848
Who the hell cares?
He just saved our ass.

1634
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:21,254
Good to be riding with you again, man.

1635
02:04:34,234 --> 02:04:36,069
Toretto just cleared the way for them.

1636
02:04:36,102 --> 02:04:39,172
- Someone, give me something.
- Torpedoes are ready.

1637
02:04:39,205 --> 02:04:40,240
Then launch them!

1638
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:54,955
Shit.

1639
02:04:58,224 --> 02:04:59,292
Take the wheel.

1640
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,360
I ain't taking shit!

1641
02:05:00,393 --> 02:05:02,495
Take the wheel!

1642
02:05:02,528 --> 02:05:04,430
Where are you going?

1643
02:05:05,731 --> 02:05:08,234
- This is crazy!
- Speed up!

1644
02:05:12,038 --> 02:05:13,539
- Left and back!
- What?

1645
02:05:13,573 --> 02:05:15,976
Turn the goddamn wheel
to the left really quickly.

1646
02:05:23,449 --> 02:05:24,484
Oh, got it.

1647
02:05:24,517 --> 02:05:25,651
Boom, baby.

1648
02:05:32,525 --> 02:05:33,593
Going for a ride.

1649
02:05:38,431 --> 02:05:40,133
Back in a sec.

1650
02:06:05,658 --> 02:06:07,327
Where's that smile?

1651
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,495
There it is.

1652
02:06:15,201 --> 02:06:16,969
You were gonna shoot a baby?

1653
02:06:18,271 --> 02:06:20,540
You sick bastard.

1654
02:06:22,142 --> 02:06:23,309
You're not gonna want to see this.

1659
02:06:35,821 --> 02:06:37,623
Is that you or him?

1660
02:06:40,326 --> 02:06:42,428
Him. Good.

1661
02:06:42,462 --> 02:06:44,197
The torpedoes missed.

1662
02:06:44,230 --> 02:06:46,099
They're gonna reach the lock
before the sub does.

1663
02:06:46,132 --> 02:06:48,101
The hell they are.

1664
02:06:50,403 --> 02:06:52,205
Get ready for this.

1665
02:07:12,592 --> 02:07:13,526
Oh, shit!

1666
02:07:13,559 --> 02:07:14,760
We're gonna need a bigger truck.

1667
02:07:26,772 --> 02:07:28,441
It's right under us.
Get out the way!

1668
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,555
I'm not going back in that water!

1669
02:07:42,588 --> 02:07:43,656
Get us out of here!

1670
02:07:43,689 --> 02:07:45,358
Why are you always yelling?

1671
02:07:49,395 --> 02:07:51,231
- This bitch is crazy.
- Look out!

1672
02:07:57,837 --> 02:07:59,805
Yeah, that's not good.

1673
02:08:01,407 --> 02:08:02,742
That's not good.

1674
02:08:06,646 --> 02:08:08,514
Please tell me there's
nothing to worry about.

1675
02:08:08,548 --> 02:08:10,683
Relax. We got this.

1676
02:08:23,929 --> 02:08:25,565
That's my girl.

1677
02:08:32,272 --> 02:08:34,874
The sub's too close. We ain't
making it to the gate in time.

1678
02:08:34,907 --> 02:08:36,376
We're just gonna let it get away?

1679
02:08:36,409 --> 02:08:38,178
Not if I know Dom.

1680
02:08:42,748 --> 02:08:44,550
You lose, Dom.

1681
02:08:44,584 --> 02:08:46,886
I destroyed two of your teams,

1682
02:08:46,919 --> 02:08:49,489
I killed your redheaded boyfriend,

1683
02:08:49,522 --> 02:08:52,625
and I put two killers
on your untraceable plane.

1684
02:08:52,658 --> 02:08:56,562
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

1685
02:08:56,596 --> 02:08:59,699
Now guess who I'm coming for.

1686
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:02,402
Put a heat-seeker on him now.

1687
02:09:03,836 --> 02:09:04,870
Now!

1688
02:09:09,909 --> 02:09:11,377
Fire!

1689
02:09:15,681 --> 02:09:18,284
That's a goddamn heat-seeker
coming at us!

1690
02:09:21,287 --> 02:09:23,623
Peel off!
Head to the shore!

1691
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:31,964
All right.

1692
02:09:31,997 --> 02:09:33,466
Come and get it.

1693
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:52,585
No, no, no, no, no.

1694
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:54,454
No, no.

1695
02:09:54,487 --> 02:09:56,589
Dive! Dive!

1696
02:09:56,622 --> 02:09:58,458
This...

1697
02:09:58,491 --> 02:10:00,260
This is for my son.

1698
02:10:20,546 --> 02:10:21,481
Dom!

1699
02:11:23,075 --> 02:11:26,312
You're out of bullets, Deckard.

1700
02:11:26,346 --> 02:11:28,748
Not like I'm gonna need a gun
to take care of you.

1701
02:11:29,815 --> 02:11:31,351
How did you find me?

1702
02:11:33,586 --> 02:11:35,388
You want to see the old Dom?

1703
02:11:35,421 --> 02:11:37,490
Watch.

1704
02:11:40,125 --> 02:11:41,861
Resourceful.

1705
02:11:41,894 --> 02:11:45,064
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.

1706
02:11:45,097 --> 02:11:47,600
What you put my family through.

1707
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:50,570
My mother.

1708
02:11:50,603 --> 02:11:53,639
I'm gonna make sure
that never happens again.

1709
02:11:53,673 --> 02:11:54,940
To anyone.

1710
02:11:54,974 --> 02:11:57,643
There is only one flaw in your plan.

1711
02:11:57,677 --> 02:11:59,679
What's that?

1712
02:11:59,712 --> 02:12:01,914
Only one of us has a parachute.

1713
02:12:24,103 --> 02:12:26,005
Told you this would be fun.

1714
02:12:30,009 --> 02:12:31,977
Time to land, boys.

1715
02:12:45,525 --> 02:12:47,560
You know I never left you, Letty.

1716
02:12:47,593 --> 02:12:48,761
I know.

1717
02:12:48,794 --> 02:12:50,963
And you know I never will.

1718
02:12:52,632 --> 02:12:54,400
I know.

1719
02:13:03,876 --> 02:13:06,812
I have so much to tell you.

1720
02:13:06,846 --> 02:13:08,180
Yeah, you do.

1721
02:13:08,213 --> 02:13:10,650
And you can start with that bitch.

1722
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:18,390
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.

1723
02:13:19,659 --> 02:13:21,627
Hey, Dom.

1724
02:13:21,661 --> 02:13:23,963
I'm just throwing it out there.

1725
02:13:23,996 --> 02:13:25,931
We need to get up out of here

1726
02:13:25,965 --> 02:13:27,700
'cause there's all kind of nuclearism

1727
02:13:27,733 --> 02:13:29,735
- happening under this ice.
- Relax.

1728
02:13:29,769 --> 02:13:32,572
Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

1729
02:13:32,605 --> 02:13:34,540
Okay, so we good, then.

1730
02:13:34,574 --> 02:13:37,810
Let me go and get
my young selfie levels up.

1731
02:13:37,843 --> 02:13:40,212
You realize this is classified, right?

1732
02:13:40,245 --> 02:13:41,714
Not today.

1733
02:13:42,882 --> 02:13:44,183
Unbelievable.

1734
02:13:44,216 --> 02:13:46,619
All right, can we
get up out of here now?

1735
02:13:46,652 --> 02:13:47,753
I'm freezing.

1736
02:13:58,631 --> 02:14:03,035
♪ It doesn't get much better than this ♪

1737
02:14:03,068 --> 02:14:07,907
♪ Spent too much time
getting ready for this ♪

1738
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:13,078
♪ These days it seems
like I just can't miss ♪

1739
02:14:13,112 --> 02:14:15,147
♪ And I must confess... ♪

1740
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,616
It's okay.

1741
02:14:16,649 --> 02:14:17,783
Don't worry.

1742
02:14:17,817 --> 02:14:19,251
He's gonna be here soon.

1743
02:14:19,284 --> 02:14:21,654
I get it.
Y'all got a lot in common.

1744
02:14:21,687 --> 02:14:24,757
Computer hacks, God's Eye,
geeks, nerd, the... You know.

1745
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:26,492
But we got a lot in common, too, right?

1746
02:14:26,526 --> 02:14:28,961
- Like what?
- We walk in the room,

1747
02:14:28,994 --> 02:14:30,863
and we're oozing sex appeal.

1748
02:14:30,896 --> 02:14:32,164
We steal the show.

1749
02:14:32,197 --> 02:14:35,167
Me and you, hip to hip,
is a problem. That's us.

1750
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:37,803
I'm asking a real question right now.

1751
02:14:37,837 --> 02:14:41,140
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds...

1752
02:14:41,173 --> 02:14:43,175
Or...

1753
02:14:43,208 --> 02:14:46,278
The Dark Knight? Huh?

1754
02:14:46,311 --> 02:14:47,980
To be honest, I like both of you.

1755
02:14:48,013 --> 02:14:49,649
Yeah, baby.
You know what I mean?

1756
02:14:49,682 --> 02:14:50,883
All right, all right, baby...

1757
02:14:52,251 --> 02:14:54,720
But just before we get into all of that,

1758
02:14:54,754 --> 02:14:56,689
let me ask you one question.

1759
02:14:56,722 --> 02:14:58,658
You can ask me anything.

1760
02:14:58,691 --> 02:14:59,825
Anything.

1761
02:14:59,859 --> 02:15:01,026
What's my last name?

1762
02:15:03,796 --> 02:15:06,098
When you guys figure it out, then...

1763
02:15:06,131 --> 02:15:09,001
- I guess you can let me know.
- It's gonna be Parker.

1764
02:15:09,034 --> 02:15:10,936
That's... that's all
that really matters.

1765
02:15:10,970 --> 02:15:12,271
- Jones. Uh...
- Mrs. Parker.

1766
02:15:12,304 --> 02:15:15,240
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker.

1767
02:15:15,274 --> 02:15:17,042
- Hey.
- Letty.

1768
02:15:17,076 --> 02:15:19,712
I wanted to thank you.

1769
02:15:19,745 --> 02:15:21,747
No need.

1770
02:15:21,781 --> 02:15:24,083
Cipher is still on the loose.

1771
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:25,751
There's been some reports
she's in Athens,

1772
02:15:25,785 --> 02:15:27,219
but matter of time before we find her,

1773
02:15:27,252 --> 02:15:29,154
thanks to you guys.

1774
02:15:29,188 --> 02:15:31,090
So, I got you a party favor.

1775
02:15:31,123 --> 02:15:32,825
This can't be good.

1776
02:15:32,858 --> 02:15:34,259
Your record's been cleared.

1777
02:15:34,293 --> 02:15:36,996
Full reinstatement.
You got your job back.

1778
02:15:37,029 --> 02:15:38,598
That is, if you want it.

1779
02:15:41,934 --> 02:15:43,903
- If I want.
- Mm-hmm.

1780
02:15:50,676 --> 02:15:52,978
You know, after 16 years,

1781
02:15:53,012 --> 02:15:55,247
I figure it's time for a little break.

1782
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,016
Wow.

1783
02:16:00,119 --> 02:16:02,087
Daddy's staying home.

1784
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:07,993
Mmm... mwah.

1785
02:16:08,027 --> 02:16:09,361
Nobody.

1786
02:16:09,394 --> 02:16:11,030
Keep in touch.

1787
02:16:11,063 --> 02:16:13,165
Ah, hang on a second.

1788
02:16:13,198 --> 02:16:15,701
This could be interesting.

1789
02:16:19,939 --> 02:16:21,774

1790
02:16:22,908 --> 02:16:24,243
Brotherhood.

1791
02:16:24,276 --> 02:16:26,078
I saw that look you gave Cipher.

1792
02:16:26,111 --> 02:16:27,947
Knew you wanted revenge.

1793
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:29,915
Glad I did it.

1794
02:16:32,317 --> 02:16:34,854
Can't believe you went to see my mother.

1795
02:16:46,098 --> 02:16:47,733
Hey.

1796
02:16:47,767 --> 02:16:50,836
Hey, you know my son
is only American muscle.

1797
02:16:53,238 --> 02:16:56,341
Hey, look, had to give him something.

1798
02:16:56,375 --> 02:16:58,343
Look how I tested the little guy.

1799
02:16:59,745 --> 02:17:00,880
Come on, Roman.

1800
02:17:00,913 --> 02:17:02,114
Get to cooking, buddy.

1801
02:17:02,147 --> 02:17:05,117
We all love you.
Come on, now.

1802
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:07,820
All this fuss over you.

1803
02:17:13,292 --> 02:17:14,894
Yes.

1804
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:22,735
Elena, I promise to keep our son safe.

1805
02:17:25,037 --> 02:17:27,306
And now he always will be.

1806
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:36,816
I want to introduce you

1807
02:17:36,849 --> 02:17:40,285
to the most important person
in my universe.

1808
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:43,889
One who never gave up on me.

1809
02:17:49,829 --> 02:17:51,897
He's beautiful.

1810
02:17:51,931 --> 02:17:54,767
You've heard me say

1811
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:57,336
that you never turn your back on family.

1812
02:17:59,371 --> 02:18:00,840
And I want to thank you all

1813
02:18:00,873 --> 02:18:03,342
for never turning your back on me.

1814
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:09,949
You want to meet them?

1815
02:18:09,982 --> 02:18:12,451

1822
02:18:29,268 --> 02:18:32,071
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.
