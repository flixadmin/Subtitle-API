00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,130
- Dad, are you okay?
- [GRUNTING]

653
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,659
Please don't blame the Legends.

654
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,689
I should have been there.

655
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,859
Because then you would have seen me

656
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,789
lock eyes with the beast,

657
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,190
and it was in that moment

658
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,799
that I felt a deep and mutual respect.

659
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,040
- Wow, someone's been bonding with Papa.
- Yeah.

660
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,799
Respect that gave way to resolve

661
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,669
as the beast drew its blade.

662
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,189
The dance had begun.

663
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,809
- Okay, Gideon.

666
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,869
We need a plan B quick.

667
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,610
Okay. Dad, you heal up.

668
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,519
- We've got this.
- No, like hell.

00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,559
Ooh, mythology burn.

673
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,859
It's good to have you back.

674
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,459
There has to be a way out of here.

675
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,300
Well, it's a prison cell.

676
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,170
Or an incubator for our
burgeoning friendship.

677
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,099
Isn't breaking out of prison your thing?

678
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,049
Only reason I escaped last time was

679
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,680
because Ray gave me a Time Stone.

680
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,980
Tell me everything,

681
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,109
because I am big-time shipping you two.

682
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,769
[GROANS] No shipping the inmates.

683
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,110
It's the reason we're stuck
in here in the first place.

684
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,580
I know that getting your
boss locked in a prison

685
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,649
isn't the best way to start a job,

686
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,559
so if it comes to it, I'd
like you to eat me first.

687
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,389
No one's eating anyone, Mona,

688
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,559
but when we get out of here,
we do have to talk about

689
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,790
your continued employment at the Bureau.

690
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,699
Wait, no, no, no, you can't fire me.

691
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,600
Give me one good reason why.

692
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,070
Okay. Okay.

693
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,939
I was gonna save this for upstairs,

No, it's fantastic. Keep going.

[SIGHS] So that's it?

701
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,140
I finally find a job where
I can use my skills...

702
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,910
Debatable.

703
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,969
And I blow it in the first week.

704

706
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,770
At least Yale wants me.

Wait, wait, that's the fallback plan?

708

[LAUGHS] Law school? What
are you even doing here?

It's my mom who wants me to be a lawyer.

No, you can't give in to
what your parents want.

712
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,120
That's what I did, and
look how that ended.

713
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,629
[SCOFFS] Okay, you're not gonna take

714
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,829
life advice from Nora Darhk, right?

715
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,729
That's rich. You should
listen to your parents.

716
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,030
Think about your future.

717
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,699
Oh, easy for you to say.
At least you had a future.

718
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,539
When I was a kid, my dad convinced me

719
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,739
to be a demon vessel.

720
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,120
You think it was easy for me?

721
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,360
At least you got to be a kid.

722
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,479
Try being a clone from 2213, okay?

723

The only taste of
childhood I've ever had

Where did you...

732
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,529
We need to bag ourselves a Minotaur

This is the artificial
musk of a female Minotaur.

See, Minotaurs have a
very sharp sense of smell

741
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,979
when it comes to tracking prey,

742

but with this little bad boy,

743
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,519
I can lure it in by convincing
it that I'm a potential mate.

Then what?

You two gonna ride off together,

get a nice little flat in Soho?

747
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,289
It's good, but we still
need a way to tame it

748
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,159
and get it to the Bureau.

749
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,699
Taming the beast. Taming the beast.

750
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,799
I read about this. I read about this.

751
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,569
Um, let's see, "The Magical
Treatise of Solomon."

752
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,069
Here we go.

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,900
"To ease the Minotaur's rage,

We'll lure it out and lull it to sleep.

No one gets hurt, not even the Minotaur.

759
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,749
And then we'll have a pizza party.

760
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,450
[SIGHS] And that's when I found out

761
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,619
I was from the future.

762
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,990
- Whoa, the future.
- Yep.

763
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,729
It was all fake:

764
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,190
my parents, my memories,

765
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,629
growing up in Fresno.

766
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,279
Still better than
spending your childhood

767
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,840
with The Order of the Shrouded Compass.

768
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,970
- Wh...
- Is that like

769
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,969
the Sisterhood of Traveling Pants?

770
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,500
Even worse. Death cult.

771
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,970
And before that, I just moved around

772
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,209
from one mental institution to the next.

773
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,809
Point is, you're lucky.

774
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,939
I'm lucky?

775
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,639
I just wish my past was made up.

776
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,139
What, so you can wake up one day

777
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,989
and realize that you don't
have any family, friends,

778
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,889
or life experiences to hold on to?

779
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,289
Doesn't sound that different

780
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,469
from waking up in a prison cell.

781
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,070
Touché.

782
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,029
Are you two kidding me right now?

783
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,469
Ava, you're a clone from the future,

784
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,069
and you run the Time Travel Bureau.

785
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,609
And you're a witch. [LAUGHS]

786
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,350
And you escaped a cult

787
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,820
and a real-life demon.

788
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,029
I did.

789
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,860
You two are, like, the two coolest women

790
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,499
I have ever met,

791
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,589
and I once met Gillian Anderson

792
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,359
at an "X-Files" meet and greet.

793
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,529
Wow. Mona, you are a gem.

794
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,640
You know, we can't have a birthday

795
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,060
without birthday cake.

796
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,369
Yeah!

797
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,489
Back on your feet already, Hank.

798
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,099
Yeah, your gal patched me up good.

799
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,600
I'm just running through our strategy.

800
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,669
Oh, wait, you let him
use our "D&D" miniatures?

801
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,009
No, I didn't let him touch Cyndra,

802
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,329
Lord of the Dark Elves.

803
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,109
You guys "D&D" without me too?

804
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,679
Son, why are you holding a tiny guitar,

805
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,210
or do I even want to know?

806
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,819
Oh, this... this is a lute.

807
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,649
[GRUNTS] Someone say loot?

808
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,689
This is what we're gonna use
to put the Minotaur to sleep.

809
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,030
- I thought you said that was loot.
- I don't understand.

810
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,709
Well, I suppose it is more of a lyre.

811
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,949
Everyone's a liar.

812
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,890
This is how we're gonna
catch our creature, Dad.

813
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,529
