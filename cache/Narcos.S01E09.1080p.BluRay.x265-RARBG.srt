Good morning, sergeant.

00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,227
Good morning, paisa.
What have you got for us?

5
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,232
I've got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,

00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,400
and extra uniforms for the guards.

7
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,036
Let him go. He's been checked.

00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,038
Continue. Continue, paisa.

[Steve]
Escobar's prison was called la catedral,

13
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,852
but we nicknamed it "club medellin."

14
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,022
It was the embodiment of "the big lie."

15
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,859
It was even built
to look old and shitty on the outside.

16
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:52,363
But inside, it was anything but.

17
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,951
The other inmates?
Escobar's sicarios.

18
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,787
Hand-picked killers from his hometown.

19
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,667
[In Spanish]
You're here, my friend!

20

- Good, brother. How was the trip?

21
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,463
Fine, fine. What a long drive!

22
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,257
- Really?
- It's really hot.

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,675
Did you encounter any problems?

24
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,428
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

25
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:19,682
I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.

[Steve] Escobar hadn't
built himself a prison at all.

45
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,416
He 'd built himself a fortress.

But no matter how you decorate it...
A cage is still a cage.

[In Spanish] Excuse me, boss.

48
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,369
I've got a report.

49
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,164
Moncada and galeano
are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

through Mexico and the Caribbean.

Did they pay the war tax?

52
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,088
Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,

53
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,466
a lot of other people
have been complaining.

54
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:05,764
My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.

56
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,978
Moncada and galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.

we're going to kill a few of his men.

I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,

don't you think?

Is peace.

65
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,020
[Steve] If there was one benefit
to Escobar's imprisonment,

66

it's that peace
had finally come to Bogota'.

First... Mr. Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.

And the second thing...
This is war, pacho.

There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.

We are willing
to pay three million dollars

- The medellin cartel.

No, you're wrong, pacho.

We export twice the amount you do.

You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?

Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.

140

That's how he treats
his friends and associates?

141

Don't forget that, thanks to
Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar gaviria,

142
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:26,330
extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn't it?

143
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,957
He was the one
who got us into this mess.

bombing street corners and airplanes.

was transferred out of the country.

My superiors say I play too rough.

154
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:13,877
At least Escobar is in jail and... you can
leave knowing you helped put him there.

00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,005
Jail?

00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,181
I got some photographs,
courtesy of the Colombian military.

158
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,646
I want you to look at 'em,
tell me if this qualifies as a jail.

[Steve]
He's got a fucking soccer field.

160
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,238
Escobar is moving more coke than ever.

161
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,561
Without the Colombian government
breathing down his neck,

162
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,993
all he's gotta worry about
is the Cali cartel.

163
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,872
Let's face it, fellas...

164
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,085
He won.

[Paisa in Spanish]
We're here, gentlemen!

167
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,801
[Groans]

168
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,887
[Indistinct chatter in Spanish]

169
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,557
- Gentlemen!
- [Moncada] What a bumpy ride, paisa.

170
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,892
Where did you learn to drive?

171
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,479
[Moncada]
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

172
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,899
This takes care of the problem
we had in la and ends the war.

173
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,611
[Velasco]
Sounds like a good proposition.

174
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,947
Do you know what this means, boss?

175
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,826
We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won't be the wiser.

176
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:33,206
That way, we can... double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.

177
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,046
How did he behave...

178
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,090
When he offered you the money?

179
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,219
What do you mean,
"how did he behave"?

180
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,056
What was his attitude?

181
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,392
Well... he was respectful, Pablo.

182
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,311
Respectful in what way?

183
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,481
- He wants peace, just like us.
- Yes, but...

184
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,609
How did he react
when you told him our solution?

185
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,360
In a positive manner.

186
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,780
He just offered you the money,
just like that?

187
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:11,036
Well... he started
at three million dollars. Right?

188
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,121
- Mm.
- — [galeano] But we said no,

189
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,016
and told him
you wouldn't take less than 12.

190
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,252
So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.

191
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,672
Offered you three million?

192
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,886
He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn't accept that.

193
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:33,850
If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

194
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:38,480
That's right, boss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.

195
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,197
Tell him I'm not happy
with less than 30.

196
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,242
The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.

197
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,663
Thirty million...
If Cali wants peace.

198
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,439
Very good.

199
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,784
I also need to raise the war tax.

200
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,957
From now on, a million a month,

201
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,711
for both of you...
And all our other partners.

202
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,681
Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.

203
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,147
[In English] If we get solid proof that Escobar
is violating the terms of his surrender,

204
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,916
then they have to send him
to a real prison,

205
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,775
but we need more
than these aerial shots.

206
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,171
Can you get us satellite communications
or wire intercepts?

207
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,780
There's a no-fly zone over the prison,
with antiaircraft guns

208
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,074
manned by the Colombian army
to enforce it.

209
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,076
You're playing with fire
if noonan finds out.

210
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,162
We don't got shit on him
without intercepts.

211
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,247
- Don't need 'em.
- What? The hell we don't.

212

They're not using phones.

- The hell is that?
- — I could spot a Coop a mile away.

214

That's how they're sending messages.

215

[Steve]
To avoid our high-tech spy planes,

216
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,431
Pablo chose the most
low-tech form of communication.

217
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,725
Never said the guy wasn't crafty.

- You see anything yet?
- No, man.

- [Woman] Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

Right.

Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,543
Now, what about this war tax
he's charging you?

255
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,464
$250,000 was a lot of money.

256
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,675
And now a million?
[Scoffs] Ridiculous.

257

What do you think I should do?
Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?

258
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,265
- Obviously not.
- Then I don't understand.

- What do you want me to do?
- It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.

But the thing is, I don't know
what's going on with him these days.

00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,001
I don't know.
Maybe he's depressed.

- No tunnels.

can bet your ass he's going out that way.

274
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,754
If there's a tunnel there,
he must have dug it to China.

Good luck.

00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,766
Maybe we can... [sighs]

277
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,896
We can ask the military
to do light detection and ranging.

00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:12,004
If you'd like,
check with the cops in boyaca.

466
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:16,467
Right, because cops in boyaca
are so honest, right?

Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.

I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.

Gustavo...
Would never forget where he buried cash.

Who's putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

- We are partners and friends.
- Mm.

474
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:53,962
Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?

475
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:57,132
Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.

476
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,510
That's a lie.

477

- Because you complained to your wife.
- I haven't complained.

what I talk about with Judy.

[Galeano] I understand
this is difficult for you, Pablo...

What is difficult for me?

481
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:16,860
Well, managing all of this.
That's why you hired us.

482
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,905
- So we can manage it and look after it.
- Mm.

I understand this makes you anxious-...

- Do I look anxious?
- No, I didn't mean that.

- You said with certainty that...
- No, no, what I meant to say was-...

- I think you're the one who's anxious.
- We didn't do shit, Pablo!

With that tone of yours...
You're telling me you didn't do shit?

489

Is this my cash or not?!

No, Pablo.

Did you take it and Bury it
in rionegro or not?!

For sure,

We're family.

You're my daughter's godfather.

499

And also godfather to galeano's kids.

We've been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.

We made our first trip to Miami together.

We made so much cash together that
we don't even know what we spent it on.
