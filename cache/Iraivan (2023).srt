1
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,666
<i>I am Arjun.</i>

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,416
<i>I knowâ€¦ no fear.</i>

3
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,833
<i>I have no enemies.</i>

4
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,583
<i>But that doesn't mean I'm a nice guy.</i>

5
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,291
<i>When the need arisesâ€¦</i>

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,250
<i>I turn into a monster.</i>

7
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,125
Who gave you permission for the shootout?

8
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,291
How can a senior officerâ€¦

9
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:03,291
<i>People in my department label me</i>
<i>as a psycho, rowdy, and whatnot.</i>

10
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,208
Sorry, sir.

11
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,958
<i>But the only person who doesn't</i>
<i>give up on me is my friend Andrew.</i>

12
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,000
You better stop stooping
and covering up for me.

13
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,291
-Understood?
-I have warned you many times.

14
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,375
Can't you be patient?

15
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,041
Hey!

16
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,833
Andrewâ€¦

17
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,583
This time, if you fire without
a shooting order, you will be suspended.

18
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,708
Let them suspend me!
I don't care!

19
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,625
Just listen to me.

20
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,333
<i>When criminals turn into animals</i>
<i>and mercilessly commit crimes,</i>

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,416
<i>I can't be patient</i>
<i>and wait for God to deliver justice.</i>

22
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,333
I know you don't fear deathâ€¦

23
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,416
but don't die when I'm around.

24
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,125
Not for your own sakeâ€¦

25
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,625
I don't fear death,
and that's why I'm a cop.

26
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,583
Anything can happen to me at any moment.

27
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,791
He's going to live by his rules,
regardless of how much advice you offer.

28
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,500
Instead of living like this,
why don't you get married, Arjun?

29
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,375
So that he can ruin a girl's life?!

30
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,041
No. At least then he might be
careful and responsible.

31
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,333
Andrew has a point.

32
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,291
I don't want to ruin anybody's life.

33
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,666
Marriage is not my cup of tea.

34
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,875
I know that there are many people
out there waiting to finish me off.

35
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll die when I do.

36
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,500
Death doesn't knock on the doors
of those who don't fear it!

37
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,750
Just wait and watch.

38
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,166
Nothing will happen to you, but something
might happen to me because of you.

39
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,125
-Hey!
-And if that happens,

40
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,166
what will happen to my wife
and my unborn child?

41
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,583
You think only you are
the only punisher out here?

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,125
You are not God!

43
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,791
Just fulfill your duties.

44
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,750
Priya!

45
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,625
Priya!

46
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,541
Priya, come fast!

47
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:12,625
<i>Let's commence the new beginning</i>
<i>On a sweet note</i>

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,750
<i>Let's win each others' hearts</i>
<i>As we get closer</i>

49
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:24,666
<i>Let's enjoy every happiness</i>
<i>This journey brings</i>

50
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,708
<i>Let's live through</i>

51
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,000
<i>-These cherished memories</i>
-Andrew!

52
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,708
-It's a cute little baby girl!
<i>-The past will never return</i>

53
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,458
<i>-Our union will ebb our burdens</i>
-Congratulations!

54
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,416
<i>The good times are here</i>

55
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,458
<i>So, let's celebrate this life</i>

56
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,458
<i>The heart seeks the sweet scent</i>
<i>Joy greets us at every turn</i>

57
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,541
<i>Flowers may bloom</i>
<i>Even in withered trees</i>

58
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,916
<i>Here is a delightful dream</i>

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,583
<i>So, let's dance through it</i>

60
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,666
<i>Here we are with a few of them</i>

61
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,625
<i>Who are nothing</i>
<i>But blessings in our life</i>

62
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:12,583
<i>Our time is the price we paid for it</i>

63
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:18,750
<i>And we found shoulders</i>
<i>On which we could rest life long</i>

64
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:49,458
<i>As I lay on my bed</i>
<i>All I miss is some warmth</i>

65
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:54,708
<i>All I wish for is to cuddle with you</i>

66
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,708
<i>I was stranded by the roadside</i>
<i>When the rain poured down</i>

67
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:07,375
<i>All I wish for is a shelter</i>
<i>Beneath your care</i>

68
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,208
<i>I have surrendered myself to you</i>
<i>In this journey</i>

69
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:19,000
<i>You are the only voice I listen to</i>

70
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:25,333
<i>I had this dream</i>
<i>Of having a family with you</i>

71
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:31,083
<i>I kept my eyes closed</i>
<i>Despite knowing it's a dream</i>

72
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,708
See you. Bye.

73
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,750
<i>Let's commence the new beginningâ€¦</i>

74
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,000
-Arjun!
<i>-On a sweet note</i>

75
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,583
<i>Let's win each others' heartsâ€¦</i>

76
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,958
-Can you drop me off on your way?
<i>-As we get closer</i>

77
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:12,916
<i>Let's enjoy every happiness</i>
<i>This journey brings</i>

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,500
<i>Let's live through</i>
<i>These cherished memories</i>

79
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,333
He is not my type.

80
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,833
But he's one of those guys
you grow to like as you get to know him.

81
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,125
He gets along with people,
but he remains firmly in the friend zone.

82
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,125
He just doesn't get out of that zone.

83
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,375
I'm just saying!

84
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,250
-Don't judge me.
-Jasmine! Come on, hurry.

85
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,583
God bless you, Sophia.

86
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,666
I'm on my way. Bye.

87
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,041
Yes?

88
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,250
Somebody help!

89
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,416
Help!

90
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,500
No! No! Please!

91
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,583
Help!

92
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,625
Noâ€¦

93
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,000
Please leave meâ€¦

94
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,833
Leave me.

95
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,625
Pleaseâ€¦

96
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,583
Noâ€¦

97
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,583
Pleaseâ€¦

98
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,083
Pleaseâ€¦ leave meâ€¦

99
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:52,958
Noâ€¦

100
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,333
I called everyone here
to discuss Arjun and me.

101
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,125
But what a day for Arjun to get hurt!

102
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,250
Moreover, Andrew is upset.

103
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,083
Forget it, Priya.
We'll discuss it some other day.

104
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,416
They are engrossed in nabbing a criminal.

105
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,708
They are cops. They will be
chasing criminals round the clock.

106
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,708
It's my fault.

107
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,291
Please let's have the discussion today.

108
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,208
Call my brother.

109
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:09,916
Please.

110
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,416
Andrew.

111
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,666
Please come here.

112
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:20,041
Look, let's not drag this.
Let's get Priya married to Arjun.

113
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,333
-That's what she wants as well.
-Stop it!

114
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,333
Are you aware of the situation here?
Stop irritating me!

115
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,666
What's your problem, Andrew?

116
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,625
Why does their relationship bother you?

117
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,666
Look, I know Priya believes
that Arjun is in love with her.

118
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,958
But what's wrong with you?

119
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,291
He's right here.

120
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,125
Ask him if he wants to marry her!

121
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,125
I don't believe in compelling someone
to marry if they don't believe in it.

122
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,791
At the same time, as his friend, I know
why he doesn't want to get married.

123
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,958
He wakes up every day
believing it might be his last.

124
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,041
So, how can I ask him to marry my sister?

125
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,666
Arjunâ€¦ do me a favor.

126
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,833
She won't understand,
no matter how much we explain.

127
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,666
You need to talk to her
and put an end to this.

128
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,458
<i>Shilpa, a young woman,</i>
<i>who went missing two days ago,</i>

129
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,291
<i>was found today morning by the seashore.</i>

130
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,958
<i>She was brutally murdered with her eyes</i>
<i>gouged out and her mouth tore open.</i>

131
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,666
<i>Another woman murderedâ€¦</i>

132
00:14:54,291 --> 00:15:00,083
The murdered girl's eyes were gouged out
according to the police.

133
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,875
<i>Four murders in the last five months.</i>

134
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,666
<i>As the police are on the hunt</i>
<i>for Brahma, aka Smiley Killer,</i>

135
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,750
<i>Chennai Commissioner Harivendanth</i>

136
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,333
<i>has moved the case from</i>
<i>the Law and Order division to Special Ops.</i>

137
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,375
<i>This special force is headed by officers</i>
<i>Andrew and Arjun.</i>

138
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:26,500
Everybody is banking on them
to nab Smiley Killer.

139
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,750
The current murders

140
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,416
and the murders that took place
two years ago in Lucknowâ€¦

141
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,666
have a lot of similarities.

142
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,750
Only girls are the target.
Same pattern and the smiley signature.

143
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,916
A gruesome killer.

144
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,916
To ease this investigation,

145
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,166
except for the victims' photos,

146
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,375
I have nothing to share with you.

147
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,583
I have a very bad feeling about this.

148
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,416
<i>Following the Smiley Killer</i>
<i>murder pattern,</i>

149
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,583
<i>a girl named Subhadra,</i>
<i>who went missing two days ago,</i>

150
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,416
<i>was found with her arms</i>
<i>and legs chopped off.</i>

151
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,125
<i>She was ruthlessly killed, and her</i>
<i>lifeless body was discovered outdoors.</i>

152
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,666
<i>All the victims were abducted</i>
<i>during the night.</i>

153
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,583
The killer used a sharp weapon
to murder her.

154
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,041
Must be a knife or scalpel.

155
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,250
<i>Who is the murderer</i>
<i>behind the serial killings in Chennai?</i>

156
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,958
A psychopath? A serial killer?

157
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,083
<i>Throwing light on it is Dr. Shanmugam.</i>

158
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,625
His pattern doesn't suggest
that he's a serial killer.

159
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,166
<i>He's a serious psychopath.</i>

160
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:11,583
<i>Usually, their intent to kill</i>
<i>is a result of their past trauma.</i>

161
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,833
But this man commits murders
purely for the pleasure of it.

162
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,083
A highly intellectual psychopath
with a God complex.

163
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,916
Arjun, look at this book.

164
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,041
<i>This is the seventh murder in six months.</i>

165
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,750
The murderer showcases
the victims' bodies

166
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,791
in the old factories
and buildings within the city.

167
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,041
Wheatish, 5 ft. 5 in., left-handed.

168
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,458
Increase the surveillance
during nighttime.

169
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,875
Shut down all the nightclubs!

170
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,916
<i>Sir, we've received intel that</i>
<i>the suspect was spotted near Ennore.</i>

171
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,750
Block all the exit points!
I'm on my way!

172
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,750
Hey, wait!

173
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,791
Sir, the killer escaped.

174
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,083
Shit!

175
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,000
<i>More murders will follow.</i>

176
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,083
<i>Eight, nine, tenâ€¦</i>

177
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,833
<i>If anybody has any information</i>
<i>on Smiley Killer,</i>

178
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:39,083
<i>they can call the toll-free number 208</i>
<i>and inform the police.</i>

179
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,625
<i>Sir, we've received a complaint</i>
<i>about another missing girl.</i>

180
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,208
<i>Sir, I'm calling from the Omega factory.</i>
<i>Please come here soon.</i>

181
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,916
Eleven girls have already been
brutally murdered.

182
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,750
They have found the corpse
of Smiley Killer's eleventh victim.

183
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,125
The police are conducting
an investigationâ€¦

184
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,208
<i>Since there is no progress in the case,</i>
<i>people have started protesting.</i>

185
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,875
We won't stop until justice is delivered!

186
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,416
-Many girls have been killed.
-When will cops nab Smiley Killer?

187
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
What's happening outside?

188
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,208
Yeah, I'm coming.

189
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,041
We have traced Smiley Killer's location.

190
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,833
I've shared the location with you.
Come fast.

191
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,375
<i>I've shared the location with you.</i>
<i>Come fast.</i>

192
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,375
Andrewâ€¦

193
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,375
Andrew! Andrew!

194
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,875
Hey! What happened?

195
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,833
-Andrew!
-Over thereâ€¦

196
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,583
Come out!

197
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,583
Will you arrest meâ€¦

198
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,083
or will you save your friend?

199
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,083
Oh! Is he so dear to you?

200
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,750
He won't make it.
What are we gonna do?

201
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,166
-He won't make it.
-Hey, Arjun! Let go of him!

202
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,375
Arjun, leave him!

203
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,541
Leave him! You might end up killing him!

204
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,833
-Andrewâ€¦
-Come on.

205
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,708
Come on.

206
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,416
-That's him! Kill him!
-You shouldn't live!

207
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,166
Throw him in jail!

208
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,833
Jerk! I'll commit a crime
only to come to prison and kill you!

209
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,083
You filthy dog! You will rot in hell!

210
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,208
-Sir, break his jaw!
-Leave him to me, I'll kill him!

211
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,666
I will kill him!

212
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,541
-Hang him to death!
-Gouge his eyes out!

213
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,625
<i>After committing twelve murders</i>

-Take care of Priya.
-You'll be fine.

221
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,583
Please take care of her.

<i>But it really hurts me to think that Iâ€¦</i>

00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,666
<i>couldn't save yours.</i>

225
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,250
<i>If I had been with youâ€¦</i>

226

<i>Come back and be my strength</i>

Shall I move in here,

244
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,083
Talk to Jasmine and let me know.

245
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,958
<i>Oh, friendâ€¦</i>

246
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,500
<i>Oh, dear friendâ€¦</i>

<i>Oh, friendâ€¦</i>

250
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:04,000
Sir, I cannot continue beyond this.

251
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,375
Sorry.

252
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,250
How about starting a coffee shop?

253
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,166
Hope everything is okay.

254
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:58,000
-Take care of them.
-Sure, ma'am.

255
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,083
Hey! What's going on?

256
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,541
-Nothing much.
-Keep an eye on me every now and then.

257
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,625
Day six, Stanley Hospital.

258
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,708
Check-up on Brahma's mental state.

259
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,458
The time is 11:00 a.m.

260
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:42,708
Brahma, you've committed 12 murders.

261
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:46,125
All young girls at that. Am I right?

262
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:50,250
I don't know, doctor.
Even I heard the same.

263
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,750
You heard the same?
What exactly did you hear?

264
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:58,958
I have no idea about the voice
that I hear within meâ€¦

265
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,291
but my only duty is to obey its orders.

266
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,875
A voice? What does it order you to do?

267
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:17,000
Brahmaâ€¦

268
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,041
Brahmaâ€¦

269
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,708
Brahma!

270
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,500
I'm a lunatic.

271
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,500
What would I know, doctor?

272
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:31,000
I forgot everything.

273
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,458
You call yourself a lunatic?

274
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,166
So be it.

275
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,000
Doctorâ€¦

276
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,833
Doctorâ€¦

277
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,708
Dr. Lalitha.

278
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,583
Only young girls should be scared of me.

279
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:10,125
You have nothing to worry about.

280
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,250
I'll talk to the doctor and tell you.
Please wait.

281
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,125
What happened, doctor?

282
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,291
He's perfectly normal.

283
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,333
I mean, as a psychopath.

284
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:26,458
If it's possible, you can
take him away today evening.

285
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay. Get the documents ready.

286
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,916
-I'll start the other formalities.
-Yeah, sure.

287
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,625
-I'll do that immediately.
-She's calling you.

288
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,250
-Excuse me, doctor.
-One moment, please.

289
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,458
-What is it?
-Brahma wants to talk to you.

290
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,583
In private.

291
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,166
Ohâ€¦ okay.

292
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,208
-Come on, drink up.
-Happy birthday!

293
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:00,208
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

294
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,541
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

295
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,583
<i>Happy birthday, dear Arjun!</i>

296
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:10,583
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

297
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,041
-Give it to everyoneâ€¦
-Come here.

298
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,916
-Rock it!
-Heyâ€¦

299
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,666
This is wrong.
Don't look at me like that.

300
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,375
Then marry me.

301
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,500
You won't survive three months with me.
Do you really want it?

302
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,083
You are going to marry someone anyway.

303
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:39,083
So, let my sacrifice
save another girl's life.

304
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,333
Oh, I see!

305
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,625
Brotherâ€¦

306
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,916
-How about we make a reel?
-Enough, Divya. That's all I can do.

307
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,583
Jasmineâ€¦

308
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,333
What's going on between them?
I don't understand.

309
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,416
I don't know, Uncle,
but I'm okay with it.

310
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,125
Priya wants to propose to Arjun.

311
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,458
She is waiting for him to say yes.

312
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,125
They have my approval.

313
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,750
He was heartbroken when Andrew died.

314
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,750
I'm so glad to see him happy now.

315
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,708
Dadâ€¦

316
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,583
-Once more!
-Yeah, that way. Like that!

317
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,916
-Enough!
-What is it?

318
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,875
Go and sleep.

319
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,333
You don't seem to have a limit.

320
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:44,833
Hello?

321
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,375
When?

322
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:50,708
I'll be there.

323
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,041
What happened?

324
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,125
Looks like Brahma escaped.

325
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:59,208
He escaped from the hospital.
I wonder what's gonna happen now.

326
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,250
He won't make it.

327
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,083
Andrewâ€¦

328
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,708
<i>It's such a pleasure to see you</i>
<i>suffer in pain.</i>

329
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,791
Sir, someone murdered Dr. Shanmugam
and put his body in the trunk of his car.

330
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,250
Looks like his daughter went missing
two days ago.

331
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,375
<i>Let me see if I can find any other leads.</i>
<i>I'll call you, sir.</i>

332
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,416
Arjun!

333
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,708
A letter for you.

334
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,875
COME AND MEET ME, OR ELSE
YOUR LOVED ONES WILL SUFFER

335
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,916
Your loved ones will suffer!

336
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,541
Priya, who delivered it?
When was it delivered?

337
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,000
I don't know. It was lying here.

338
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,666
Arjun, what happened?

339
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,666
Arjun!

340
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,916
-Hey!
-Sir! I'm a food delivery boy.

341
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,375
-Who delivered this?
-I don't know. I came to deliver food.

342
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,041
-Then why are you still here?
-I just delivered the food, sir.

343
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,833
-Sir, I'm innocent.
-You better speak the truth!

344
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,541
-Arjun! What's wrong with you?
-Sirâ€¦

345
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:38,166
Priya, look at this.
That psycho is somewhere around.

346
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,916
-I know he is!
-Arjun, stop it!

347
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,416
Are we attending the function or not?

348
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,291
Come on.

349
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,291
Hi!

350
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:54,958
Hi, everybody!
Thank you all! Thank you!

351
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,041
Thank you very much. Everyoneâ€¦

352
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:00,041
Brother! Come, let's make a reel.

353
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:03,500
Hey! Don't you have anything better to do?
Making reels all the time!

354
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,250
Don't vent your anger on her.

355
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,583
Let's make his evening more memorable.

356
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,375
So, did you do something useful
during this vacation?

357
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,666
Of course! I'm taking dance classes.
I'm also learning music.

358
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,916
I'm doing okay with my studies.

359
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,458
Don't show me the arrogance
of having cleared the IPS exam!

360
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,583
Why don't you just
concentrate on your studies?

361
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:34,500
Why do you waste time on making reels?

362
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,625
This tells me you're outdated
and you're growing old.

363
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,291
In fact, this is my ambition.

364
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,958
One viral video with a million views.

365
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:45,208
-Then I'll also retire, just like Dad.
-Sure. Look at your retried dad.

366
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,000
He's boring everyone with his speech.

367
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,666
Snatch the mic from him
and sing a nice song.

368
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:53,416
Arjun received a letter
with Smiley Killer's signature.

369
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,375
Don't worry about it.
You enjoy the party.

370
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:57,875
I'll handle Arjun.

371
00:38:58,625 --> 00:38:59,500
Okay?

372
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:01,500
Excuse me.

373
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,375
Hey, Priya just told me everything.

374
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,625
I have a separate setup for you. Come.

375
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,000
-Let's have a drink.
-I'm not in the mood.

376
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,583
-I'm leaving.
-Just come!

377
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,375
-Come on.
<i>-Are you high? Are you lost?</i>

378
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:17,708
<i>Is your mind confused?</i>

379
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:22,166
<i>Is your life too shaky?</i>

380
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:23,458
Hello.

381
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:26,000
Hello, Mathews. How are you?

382
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,375
Somebody sent that letter
just to rile you up.

383
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,166
And you're taking it seriously?

384
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,625
Have some booze.
You'll get some clarity.

385
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,083
We'll discuss about it later. Come.

386
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,000
Wait, I'll fix you a drink.

387
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:12,291
Arjun!

388
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,208
Arjun! Hey!

389
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,750
<i>Shwetha, who went missing two days ago</i>
<i>and was being sought by the police,</i>

390
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:35,625
<i>was brutally murdered and</i>
<i>her corpse was discovered this morning.</i>

391
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,416
<i>Shwetha was the daughter</i>

392
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,083
<i>of Dr. Shanmugam, the chief doctor</i>
<i>at Stanley Medical Centre.</i>

393
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,875
<i>And Dr. Shanmugam happens to be</i>

394
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:46,208
<i>the psychiatrist who treated Brahma,</i>
<i>aka Smiley Killer.</i>

395
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:48,750
<i>And now, both the doctor</i>
<i>and his daughter are dead.</i>

396
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:52,208
<i>At this point, the question</i>
<i>that arises in our mind isâ€¦</i>

397
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:53,333
<i>"Where is Brahma?"</i>

398
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,583
<i>Is he in the hospital or prison?</i>

399
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:58,166
<i>We expect the police</i>
<i>to break their silence</i>

400
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,166
<i>and tell us about Brahma's whereabouts.</i>

401
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,291
<i>Brahma, aka Smiley Killer,</i>
<i>was caught a year ago</i>

402
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:08,625
<i>by Assistant Commissioners</i>
<i>Andrew and Arjun.</i>

403
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,750
-You're highly incompetent!
-Sorry, sir.

404
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,958
I'll have to bow my head in shame
in front of the press now.

405
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,583
Is Brahma linked with the murder?

406
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,208
Who killed Dr. Shanmugam?

407
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:25,583
Smiley Killer Brahmaâ€¦

408
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,125
has escaped from Stanley Hospital.

409
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,500
But there's no need to panic.

410
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,333
<i>Two special forces have been formed under</i>
<i>ACP Frank and ACP Mani's leadership.</i>

411
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,375
<i>They are on the hunt</i>
<i>for the psycho killer Brahma</i>

412
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,541
<i>according to</i>
<i>Commissioner Harivedanth's statement.</i>

413
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:45,625
<i>He also added that girls</i>
<i>must refrain from stepping out at night.</i>

414
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,375
<i>With Smiley Killer</i>
<i>having escaped from prison,</i>

415
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,833
<i>yet another girl named Raji</i>
<i>has gone missing.</i>

416
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,833
<i>This has spread shock waves all over.</i>

417
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:49,916
<i>Women are now afraid</i>
<i>to step out given the current situation.</i>

418
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,458
<i>People expect the police to nab</i>
<i>Smiley Killer as soon as possible.</i>

419
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,916
<i>It's been a week since</i>
<i>the psycho killer escaped</i>

420
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,333
<i>and the cops are struggling to find him.</i>

421
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:34,250
<i>I will capture the best</i>

422
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,916
<i>I will hunt them down</i>

423
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,541
<i>This is a demon's game</i>
<i>Humans have no control over it</i>

424
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:42,291
<i>It's the wrath of the devil</i>
<i>No one can stop it</i>

425
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,916
<i>Snatch them like a monster</i>
<i>Kill them like a creeper</i>

426
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,583
<i>Smell it like a fresher</i>
<i>Rip them like a reaper</i>

427
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,791
<i>I will break all barriers</i>
<i>And achieve my target</i>

428
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,875
This is sheer irresponsible line of work!

429
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:56,458
I don't care what you do, but this is
the last 24 hours I'm giving you!

430
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:57,666
-Or elseâ€¦
-Sir!

431
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,958
-Sir!
-Mani!

432
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:03,625
He'll have to undergo these tests.

433
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:06,041
The doctor will give further updates
when he visits tomorrow.

434
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:06,958
Okay.

435
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:08,375
Come, Arjun.

436
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:12,666
Don't you dare laugh! I'll kill you!

437
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,125
-Did the doctor say something?
-Not yet.

438
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,791
It's all his fault.
He's been drinking too much.

439
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,041
-Sir!
-Greetings, sir.

440
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:22,958
Sirâ€¦

441
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,041
I'll wait outside.

442
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,291
Arjun, it's okay. You wait.

443
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,833
What's the problem?

444
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:33,583
What gave you a heart attack, Mani?

445
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,416
He has been smoking a lot, sir.

446
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:41,208
Sir, I was compiling a report
about Brahma to present to you.

447
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,583
It stressed me out too much.

448
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,458
It's been a week
since I had a restful sleep.

449
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,375
In my 32 years of experience, I have
never encountered such a cruel murderer.

450
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:51,750
I'm scared, sir.

451
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,666
You don't sound like the Mani I know.

452
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,791
It's troubling me, sir.
I have two grown-up daughters.

453
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,500
Since his escape from prisonâ€¦

454
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,166
the murders he has committed
have become increasingly horrific.

455
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:05,250
<i>Sir, recently the daughter</i>
<i>of one of my friendsâ€¦</i>

456
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,833
Raji!

457
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:09,958
Don't tell me that's my daughter!
I can't believe this!

458
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,166
<i>In the previous cases,</i>

459
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:16,291
Brahma kept moving to his next target
after murdering his victims.

460
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,583
But now, he is targeting
the victim's family as well.

461
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:22,958
Just two days after that murder,
he sent a package to that girl's family.

462
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:24,666
RAJI

463
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,416
<i>It contained the bloodstained clothes</i>

464
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,666
<i>-that the girl was wearing last.</i>
-Raji!

465
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,583
He then sent a pen drive to their house.

466
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:42,208
<i>It featured footage</i>

467
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:45,000
<i>-of his gruesome murder of the girl!</i>
-Oh, God!

468
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,541
Sir, we are cops.

469
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:49,500
We have a higher tolerance level
than civilians.

470
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,625
I have come across many cases.

471
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,375
Yet, I'm unable to digest these murders.

472
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,375
<i>Imagine the plight of that girl's mother.</i>

473
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,583
She set herself ablaze.

474
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,625
Oh, God!

475
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:07,125
I couldn't bear it, sir.

476
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,708
-Brotherâ€¦
-Mani!

477
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,500
Arjun, call the doctor.

478
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:12,875
Doctor!

479
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,916
-Maniâ€¦
-Doctor!

480
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:17,291
Mani, relax. Don't worry.

481
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,541
Mani, relax.

482
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,250
Doctor!

483
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:24,250
Sir, look at me.
Are you with me?

484
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,333
Sir, are you with me?

485
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,541
Why are they here?
Ask them to get out!

486
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:30,250
-Sir, please wait outside.
-Sir, you're fine. Don't worry.

487
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,000
Nurse, pass me the aspirin.

488
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,125
It's gonna be okay.

489
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:39,958
Are you with me?
Look at me, sir.

490
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,666
<i>-Arjunâ€¦</i>
-Tell me.

491
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,583
Divya had gone to her dance class.

492
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:00,541
It's way past her usual return time,
but she's not home yet.

493
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,166
Don't worry. She must have
gone somewhere nearby.

494
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,791
-Look around.
<i>-No.</i>

495
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,833
<i>It's been over two hours,</i>
<i>and I've already filed a police report.</i>

496
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:11,958
Please get here soon.

497
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:12,958
I'll be there.

498
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:30,875
-Arjun!
-Yeah.

499
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:33,083
-Arjunâ€¦
-Please don't worry.

500
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,375
I'll find her.

501
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:37,291
I hope Brahma didn't kidnap her.

502
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:38,875
No, don't say that.

503
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:41,875
We'll find her soon.
You go inside. I'll be back.

504
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,375
Muruganâ€¦

505
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,958
-Sir!
-What's the status?

506
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,875
Is it confirmed that
she has been abducted?

507
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:51,791
We're gathering information, but we're
uncertain whether she has been abducted.

508
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:54,666
It's been three hours, and you haven't
determined the nature of the crime yet?

509
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,500
You think you'll be able to rescue her?!

510
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,500
Sir, you're not a cop anymore.

511
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:01,708
Why are you asking
all these unnecessary questions?

512
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,333
Just mind your own business.

513
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:04,916
I'm not questioning as a copâ€¦

514
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:06,458
but as an elder brother!

515
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:08,500
The girl missing is like my sister.

516
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:11,333
I must know what's happening!
So, tell me!

517
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:14,000
Sir, I'll explain.
Please come with me.

518
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:20,750
Sir, based on the inquiry so far,
it does look like she has been abducted.

519
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,250
She left the dance class at 6:30 p.m.

520
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:26,708
She was seen at the corner
of this street but not beyond that.

521
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:29,083
We discovered her phone
on the corner of the street.

522
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:31,708
Also, there are no CCTVs installed there.

523
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,541
Give me her phone.

524
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,500
One second, sir.

525
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:38,541
Look, when Divya is back,

526
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,958
she should not know
that we were worried and crying.

527
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,500
That will make her sad.

528
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:48,500
Sir, Divya's phoneâ€¦

529
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:50,666
Hey, we can't hand over the evidence!

530
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:54,541
Sir, he is furious
and might break your face.

531
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:55,958
Please hand it over.

532
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:03,791
Sirâ€¦

533
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:14,875
Where's her dance class?

534
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:16,500
On the main road, sir.

535
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:18,458
You please get inside.

536
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,833
-Did you inquire there?
-Everything's clear, sir.

537
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,333
-Who checked the CCTV?
-Perumal, sir.

538
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:25,833
Perumal, come here.

539
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,833
Did you thoroughly
check the CCTV cameras?

540
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:32,208
Yes, I did sir. I checked with everyone
who passed by the street

541
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:35,416
between 6:00 to 7:00 p.m.,
on two-wheelers and four-wheelers.

542
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,166
There was no cause for suspicion
regarding anyone.

543
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,166
Then how did he kidnap her?

544
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,625
Sir, this is not a case of kidnapping.

545
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:47,083
She has clearly eloped with someone.

546
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:48,958
I'll finish you off!

547
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,708
Sir, please. Let go of him.

548
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,333
He's stupid. He keeps gossiping.

549
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:54,416
Leave him, sir.

550
00:49:58,083 --> 00:49:58,958
Come on now!

551
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:04,083
I need all the residents out here
in ten minutes.

552
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,250
Bring all of them.
I want to interrogate everyone.

553
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,833
Your neighbor,
Yoganand's daughter is missing.

554
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:15,125
She's a young girl.

555
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,583
The kidnapper will murder her
within 12 hours.

556
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:20,958
We must save her before that.

557
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:25,416
Did anyone notice anything strange here
between 6:00 to 7:00 p.m.?

558
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:28,458
Please tell us.
It'll be very helpful.

559
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:31,250
Sir, this is an elite locality.
He's acting all weird!

560
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:36,041
Don't stop him. Instead, just shoot
whatever he is doing there.

561
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,750
Send it to me, and I'll take care of it.

562
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:42,416
-I was watching IPL. I didn't step out.
-Sir, there was a power cut in between.

563
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,666
I was out for my evening walk
and I saw nothing unusual.

564
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,333
Uncle, I saw a maroon-colored vehicle.

565
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:54,000
-It was parked here.
-Rahul, shut up.

566
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:56,291
Sir, that maroon-colored Qualis
was here when we arrived.

567
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:58,166
It left just a while ago.

568
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,458
Why did that car grab your attention?

569
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:05,833
We were playing cricket
and I hit the ball.

570
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,750
<i>It shattered the car's window</i>
<i>and dropped inside.</i>

571
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:10,833
<i>There was a man in there.</i>

572
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:14,875
<i>We thought he'd step out and scold us.</i>
<i>Hence, we all started to run.</i>

573
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:19,583
<i>But he didn't step out at all.</i>
<i>He just threw the ball outside.</i>

574
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,000
-Muruganâ€¦
-Sir?

575
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:28,833
Do we have photos from previous victims
Shwetha and Raji's abduction spots?

576
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:30,000
-We do, sir.
-Show it to me.

577
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,375
Sirâ€¦

578
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,541
-Deepak, Arjun here.
<i>-Tell me, sir.</i>

579
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:01,458
A maroon-colored Qualis.
Time, in between 9:30 to 10:00 p.m.

580
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,625
Can you check and tell me where
it was headed from KK Nagar, Third Street?

581
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:05,625
Okay, sir.

582
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Sir, I guess we are wasting time.

583
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:11,166
That Qualis left
only after we arrived here.

584
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:12,791
No, Murugan.

585
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:16,666
He is abducting girls from blind spots
where no CCTVs are installed.

586
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:29,291
Usually, criminals escape at once
from the crime spot.

587
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,250
But this guy?

588
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:35,250
He kidnaps the girl and stays put
in the same spot for three hours.

589
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,458
We review the CCTV footage
within a one to two-hour window

590
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:48,000
around the time of the crime.

591
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:52,291
But that car left from here after
three hours and that's when we arrived.

592
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:58,041
Divya must be in that car now.

593
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:14,708
Freeze! Rewind it.

594
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,958
-Play. Stop.
-Sir, is this the one?

595
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:20,333
That's the car!

596
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:24,083
Sir, that car is headed towards
Vadapalani from KK Nagar.

597
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,708
I'm on my way.
Keep updating me on its location.

598
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:39,000
Madam, play this visual.

599
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:43,291
It's the same car.

600
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:46,291
Sir, it crossed Koyambedu.

601
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:47,708
Okay, Deepak.

602
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:01,708
-Yes, tell me.
<i>-Sir.</i>

603
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:04,291
It went to Ambattur Estate
via Thirumangalam.

604
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,500
We couldn't trace it any further
since there are no CCTVs.

605
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,458
Okay, I'll take it from here.

606
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:00,958
Dadâ€¦

607
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:06,208
DAD

608
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,458
Please save her.
I'm worried.

609
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:36,541
-Deepakâ€¦
<i>-Sir?</i>

610
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:39,083
Divya is wearing an Apple watch.

611
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:42,958
-Can we track her location using that?
<i>-One second, sir.</i>

612
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,375
-Hey, Mridula.
-Yes?

613
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:47,166
The kidnapped girl
is wearing an Apple watch.

614
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,791
Can we track her down using that?

615
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:51,333
We can if her Apple phone
is synced with her watch.

616
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,583
-Tell him.
-Hello, sir.

617
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:55,250
<i>-Yeah, Mridula?</i>
-Sir, open the app called Find My Watch

618
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:56,333
<i>on that phone.</i>

619
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,458
Yes, it's open.

620
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:02,916
<i>If the phone and watch are in sync,</i>

621
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,250
<i>it'll show the watch's location.</i>

622
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,041
<i>Turn left.</i>

623
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,458
<i>In 500 meters, turn left.</i>

624
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,791
<i>Fifty meters ahead.</i>

625
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:47,375
<i>Destination reached.</i>

626
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:16,000
Divya!

627
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,708
Divyaâ€¦

628
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,916
Divya, look at me.

629
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:47,833
Divya, press on it firmly with your palm.

630
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,291
Hold it! Come on!

631
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:59,166
We'll reach the hospital
in five minutes. Okay?

632
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:01,125
Don't worry.

633
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:25,958
Divyaâ€¦

634
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:33,083
Divyaâ€¦

635
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:36,375
Oh, God! Divyaâ€¦

636
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,083
Divyaâ€¦

637
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:46,958
Divâ€¦

638
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:03,416
Whatâ€¦

639
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,916
What's all this?

640
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:08,458
Oh my God!

641
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,750
Divya! My child!

642
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:15,833
Look at our daughter!

643
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,250
Divya!

644
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:20,666
Look what they did to her!

645
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,375
-Okay. Cover her face.
-Divya!

646
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:27,541
-Madam, please control yourself.
-Oh, God!

647
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:28,583
Come, let's go.

648
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,125
-I must do the autopsy for my daughter.
-Listenâ€¦

649
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,291
It might hurt her
if someone else does it.

650
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,166
-No. You know very well, right?
-They'll take care.

651
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,666
-She cannot take pain.
-They'll handle it.

652
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,750
I'll do the autopsy without hurting her.

653
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:43,000
She-- Divya!
Wait, Dad's coming!

654
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:45,375
Oh, God! Divya!

655
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:52,750
Hey, you don't have the right to stop me!

656
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,666
I had faith that you would rescue her.

657
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:58,875
Now look what happened to my daughter!

658
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:03,458
My child!

659
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:31,916
Sir, he is no longer in service.
He's just a civilian.

660
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,708
And yet, like a psycho,
he created a ruckus last night.

661
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,208
Many have lodged a complaint.
It has become a serious issue.

662
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:38,125
We can't let this slide.

663
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,166
What's the update on the case?

664
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:46,458
Sirâ€¦

665
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:51,916
We found a photograph at the location
where Divya was murdered.

666
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,875
The girl in the photo is Shalu.

667
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:59,458
When Brahma was arrested a year ago,

668
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,958
the cops rescued a girl from him.
That's her.

669
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:03,250
I've sent SI Aruna to her house,

670
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,083
in order to interrogate her.

671
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:08,791
Sorry, sir. I'll leave now.

672
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:11,666
Arjunâ€¦ what are your thoughts?

673
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,000
Sir?

674
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:14,750
What's your take on this?

675
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:18,541
I feel that he'd have
already kidnapped her.

676
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:19,625
What do you mean?

677
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,458
Sir, Brahma is a typical psycho.

678
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,291
As far as I know, he has never
let his prey escape alive.

679
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,583
Shalu is the only victim
who escaped alive from his clutches.

680
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:29,541
Tell me.

681
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,416
If killing Shalu is the reason
he escaped from prisonâ€¦

682
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,166
-Did you check around?
-he has definitely kidnapped her by now.

683
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:37,791
What the hell are you saying?

684
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,000
Okay, hang up.

685
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,375
Sir, I'll take your leave.

686
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:54,791
Sirâ€¦

687
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:56,875
Shalu is missing.

688
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,625
What the hell is wrong with you?

689
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:04,625
What the hell is wrong with you?!

690
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,166
What are you doing?

691
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:07,958
You should get out there
and find out, Frank!

692
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,958
Quit the nitpicking
and show me the results!

693
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:23,625
What?

694
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:27,166
Give me a minute.

695
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:42,125
-Tell me, sir.
-Your girlfriend Shalu is missing.

696
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:44,750
When was the last time you saw her?

697
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:46,875
Sure, she is my girlfriendâ€¦

698
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,833
but she has many boyfriends.

699
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:50,541
She must have eloped with someone.

700
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,083
Ganesh! Mind your words.

701
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,541
We think Brahma might have
kidnapped Shalu.

702
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:58,875
-That's why we are here.
-Sounds very funny, sir.

703
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:03,208
Brahma doesn't have to kidnap Shalu.

704
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:05,166
With just one call, she'll run to Brahma.

705
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:07,625
-Wretch!
-Ganesh!

706
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,083
Sir, I swear.

707
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:13,000
Sirâ€¦

708
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:15,458
She is a nymphomaniac.

709
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:17,625
Don't you get it?

710
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,666
She loves sex.

711
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:25,250
-Heyâ€¦
<i>-If she is turned on when she's high,</i>

712
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:27,708
<i>then she won't care for the world.</i>

713
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,750
<i>All she needs isâ€¦ sex!</i>

714
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,875
<i>Only sex.</i>

715
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:36,833
A year agoâ€¦

716
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,000
she stormed out after
getting high and fighting me.

717
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,541
That's when Brahma abducted her.

718
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:48,666
<i>I was the one who followed Brahma</i>
<i>and shared his location with the cops.</i>

719
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:54,125
<i>She was not at all afraid of the fact</i>
<i>that she was going to die.</i>

720
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:05,458
Scream.

721
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:07,333
So, you're Brahma?

722
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:13,583
Scream.

723
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:16,833
Looking at you
doesn't make me wanna scream.

724
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,791
If anything, I want to bite you.

725
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:28,000
Hit me one more time.

726
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:35,166
<i>I thought he'd kill her.</i>

727
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:38,875
<i>But she made him fall for her. Bitch!</i>

728
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,250
<i>I saw them having sex.</i>

729
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,208
Once they were doneâ€¦

730
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,916
he changed his mind and didn't kill her.

731
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,500
She will be back.
Don't worry.

732
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,583
<i>Our channel has received a pen drive.</i>

733
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:04,000
<i>It has a heart-wrenching video</i>

734
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:06,291
<i>of a girl being brutally tortured.</i>

735
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:07,500
THE ABDUCTED GIRL

736
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:11,625
<i>Since her life is at stake,</i>
<i>we are doing a live relay of that video.</i>

737
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,791
-Frank, what the hell is happening?
-Sir.

738
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,000
-Ask them to stop telecasting that.
-Yes, sir.

739
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:18,666
This is the channel head's number.

740
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,791
-Ask them to stop the telecast right away.
-Yes, sir.

741
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:21,708
Arjun.

742
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,708
Did you see the news?
He has abducted Shalu.

743
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:26,625
I know. I'm on my way.

744
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,291
What-- Why are you going?
That's unnecessary!

745
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:30,791
Frank and his team will handle it.

746
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:33,083
He owes me an answer for killing Andrew.

747
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:36,458
Please be patient.
Listen to me, I'll come there.

748
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:37,666
-Thank you, sir.
-Location?

749
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,125
The exact same place where
I caught him the first time.

750
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,750
Alert all the teams.
I've got the shooting order.

751
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:47,208
Shoot Brahma at sight!
You understand?

752
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:35,625
I very well know you didn't
commit these murders.

753
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:38,916
Someone else is doing it
using your name.

754
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:40,333
I want him!

755
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,833
Do you think I will tell you?

756
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,208
Tell me!

757
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,208
Don't you want Shalu?

758
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:52,958
I fell for her looks.

759
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,625
For a brief moment, I faltered
and then became a normal human.

760
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:00,666
-I will kill her and turn myself in.
-Arjun!

761
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,583
Stop it, Arjun!

762
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:05,250
Stop it!

763
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:09,250
-Brahmaâ€¦
-In this gameâ€¦

764
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,250
even if I dieâ€¦

765
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,583
-Brahma!
-it'll still be Brahma who will win!

766
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:18,375
Brahma, stop running!

767
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:21,708
Arjun, move!

768
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,791
<i>This game is not yet overâ€¦</i>

769
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,500
<i>and only Brahma and I know it.</i>

770
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:59,250
-What are you up to, Arjun?
-Leave me alone.

771
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:04,125
-Why are you back to this? Throw it away!
-Give that to me! Priya!

772
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:09,125
Priya, I'm sorry. Iâ€¦

773
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:14,583
What happened, Arjun?

774
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,875
I shall move out for a few days.

775
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,250
Do you think you're not
answerable to anyone?

776
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:22,666
This isn't a hotel room for you
to come and go as you please.

777
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:26,125
I can't bear all this.
You both better get married.

778
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:28,166
Jasmine, stop talking without
knowing what's happening.

779
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,083
All this can wait.

780
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,041
Following the Brahma case,
a new killer has targeted me.

781
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,458
If I stay here, it will only
cause problems for all of you.

782
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,250
Which is why I'm moving out.

783
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:46,291
Just tell me one thing before leaving.

784
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:50,375
Were you staying here
all this time for my sake?

785
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:52,583
Or was it for my brother's sake?

786
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,166
It's okay.
Since you stayed here for a while,

787
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:05,750
I won't force you to marry me.

788
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:06,875
Priya!

789
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:09,000
Let him go.

790
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:13,208
His main objective is
to apprehend the psycho-killer.

791
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,208
He has better things to focus on.

792
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:18,708
Staying with us will only
waste his time.

793
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:19,875
Let him go!

794
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:26,041
This is what I warned you about earlier.

795
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,041
You don't understand what I'm saying.

796
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:40,875
If you suffer, it'll hurt me.

797
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,791
And if you're happy, then I'll be happy.

798
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,000
I thought I could help you
with your problem.

799
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:54,208
I wanted to be the peace
you are looking for.

800
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,041
Butâ€¦

801
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:05,500
Leave, Arjun.

802
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:18,666
Move the boat a little forward.

803
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:20,666
A little more.

804
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:28,416
Murugan, check if anybody's over there.

805
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:30,416
-Check this side as well.
-Okay, sir.

806
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,041
Turn it a little.

807
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,375
Madam, courier.

808
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:57,791
-Yogaâ€¦
-Yes, sir?

809
01:13:57,875 --> 01:14:01,708
A package meant for you
was delivered to my house. Here.

810
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:04,708
DIVYA

811
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,625
A package for Divya?

812
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:13,416
-Sir!
-Step back everybody!

813
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,791
-Clear the crowd.
-Please leave.

814
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:16,041
Leave!

815
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:17,208
Leave!

816
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:31,791
The other day, why didn't any of you
answer me when I asked about this?

817
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:35,000
Sir, I didn't want to tell you
anything without any proof.

818
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:37,125
Proof? What proof do you have now?

819
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:41,500
Sir, Brahma and this killer
have a strong connection.

820
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,250
Brahma told me this
before he was killed.

821
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:48,416
Why does the killer want
to use Brahma's killing pattern?

822
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:50,916
And how are you so confident?

823
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,458
Sir, he's a copycat killer.

824
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:56,708
It's the same person who helped Brahma
escape as well as committed these murders.

825
01:14:57,333 --> 01:15:00,416
Someone from outside had helped Brahma.

826
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:01,958
He is our target.

827
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,750
Sir, this is impossible.

828
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,083
Only two people visited Brahma in prison.

829
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:09,958
One is Father Sebastian.
He does social service for prisoners.

830
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:13,041
He had filed a petition saying
that Brahma was mentally unstable.

831
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,208
The other one is Siva Balan,
a government lawyer.

832
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:17,083
We have thoroughly investigated
both of them.

833
01:15:17,666 --> 01:15:18,750
That area is clear.

834
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,500
Then who murdered Dr. Shanmugam's
daughter Shwetha?

835
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,333
Sirâ€¦

836
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:26,833
when Brahma was in the hospital,

837
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:28,958
someone sketched a plan,

838
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:32,583
kidnapped Dr. Shanmugam's daughter,
and blackmailed him.

839
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:36,958
<i>Dr. Shanmugam helped Brahma escape</i>
<i>in order to save his daughter.</i>

840
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:39,541
<i>Brahma murdered Dr. Shanmugam</i>
<i>and escaped.</i>

841
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,916
Sir, Dr. Shanmugam called and asked us
to take away Brahma that night.

842
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,541
But later, he called again and insisted
that Brahma stay there for a week

843
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:49,166
as he needed to undergo more tests.

844
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:51,750
I had my doubts back then.

845
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:02,625
Dear! Wait! Open the door!

846
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,333
Listen, dear! Open the door!

847
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:08,750
Listen to me.

848
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:10,708
Open the door.

849
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:13,291
I'm getting worried here!

850
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,583
Sirâ€¦ Shwetha, Raji, and Divya.

851
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:21,000
It was not Brahma who
killed these three girls.

852
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:23,041
Brahma's pattern and motive are different.

853
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:27,458
This copycat killer has just used
Smiley Killer's signature.

854
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:30,250
But his motive and patternâ€¦

855
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,375
It's too psychotic.

856
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:35,833
Excuse me, sir.

857
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,875
Hello?

858
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,958
Arjun! Some package was delivered to us.

859
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:42,791
He took it inside and locked the door.
He is not letting me in!

860
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,708
Tell him not to open it!
I'm on my way!

861
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:49,208
<i>"So what if Brahma has been killed?</i>
<i>You think the murders will stop?</i>

862
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:52,000
<i>This world is the reason</i>
<i>people like us exist,</i>

863
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:53,375
<i>yet what can we give back to this world?</i>

864
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:55,000
<i>We can only take your lives."</i>

865
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:59,666
<i>A letter mentioning these lines</i>
<i>was received by our channel, Ski News.</i>

866
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:03,666
Please come out! Please!

867
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:11,166
<i>Are you high? Are you lost?</i>

868
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:16,125
<i>Is your mind confused?</i>

869
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:25,666
<i>Is your life too shaky?</i>

870
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:27,000
<i>Dad!</i>

871
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:40,916
Oh, God!

872
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:54,208
-Where is he?
-There.

873
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,541
Please open the door!

874
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:11,916
Oh, God!

875
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:17,041
Why? Why did you do this?

876
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:22,291
I very well know
how to slit the wrist to die faster.

877
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:23,708
Come, let's go to the hospital.

878
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,458
But pleaseâ€¦

879
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,000
-don't try to save me.
-Please let's go.

880
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:37,750
Divya, my child, Dad is coming to you.

881
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:54,875
Oh, God!

882
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:57,750
Oh, dearâ€¦

883
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:00,500
Oh, God!

884
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:07,000
Oh, God!

885
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,500
Look at that, Arjun!

886
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:46,500
One viral video with a million views.

887
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:48,750
Then I'll also retire, just like Dad.

888
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,750
Sir, who is the copycat killer?

889
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:09,916
Who killed those three girls?
Brahma or the copycat killer?

890
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:11,666
<i>No comments.</i>

891
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:14,583
<i>The investigation is going on.</i>
<i>Do not spread rumors. Thank you!</i>

892
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:19,375
You are handling the media really well.

893
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:21,791
Now tell me, Frank.

894
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:24,166
Who the bloody hell
is this copycat killer?

895
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:28,166
Sir, there is no such theory
as far as this case is concerned.

896
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,791
Then two questions, Frank.

897
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:32,916
Who sent those letters to the media?

898
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:35,541
And who sent that pen drive
to Divya's father?

899
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:39,208
Sir, if the media's hunch is correct,
then I suspect two people.

900
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:41,708
One is Ganesh, Shalu's boyfriend.

901
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,583
<i>When I went to Ganesh's house,</i>

902
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:46,750
<i>I saw the photos of Brahma's victims</i>
<i>in his room.</i>

903
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:49,791
<i>Moreover, Ganesh is</i>
<i>a depressive disorder patient.</i>

904
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:53,166
<i>He had consulted Dr. Shanmugan</i>
<i>and I have evidence to prove it.</i>

905
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,541
And when Brahma kidnapped Shalu,

906
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:59,458
Ganesh gave a statement that he was
present there, but now he's missing.

907
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:11,208
What about the second one?

908
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,958
Sirâ€¦ sorry to say this.

909
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:16,500
It's Arjun.

910
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:19,666
What nonsense are you talking about?!

911
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:23,333
Arjun doesn't believe in the court,
law and order, etc.

912
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:25,583
He never follows any protocol.

913
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,333
In most of the cases he has handled,

914
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:29,208
he arrested the criminals
and released them immediately.

915
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,958
Nobody has ever seen those criminals
after they were released.

916
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,083
-They are kind of missing.
-Frank!

917
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:38,041
I don't have time for your assumptions.

918
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,000
Sirâ€¦

919
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:42,750
these could be my assumptions but there's
also a possibility that they are true.

920
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,750
Evidence. Let's work
with concrete evidence.

921
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:48,958
-First, track down Ganesh.
-Yes, sir.

922
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:06,583
Catch him!

923
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,916
FUCKER, COME!

924
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,583
Hey, Arjun.

925
01:22:58,416 --> 01:23:00,166
What you're doing is totally unnecessary.

926
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,625
Anyway, what will you find in it?

927
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:08,541
Frank said only the church father
and the lawyer visited Brahma.

928
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,833
But only the lawyer's entry
is in the registry.

929
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:14,500
Father used to meet Brahma only when
he came to meet other prisoners.

930
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:15,750
Hence, his name is not in the registry.

931
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:20,750
Does anybody else accompany
the church father?

932
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:24,250
Sometimes he brings an assistant along.
That's all.

933
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:43,458
Hello, Father.

934
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:47,250
I need to discuss something with you
regarding Brahma's case.

935
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:50,000
I told Frank everything during
the inquiry. What else do you need?

936
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,083
Fatherâ€¦

937
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,083
I just have one doubt.

938
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,500
When you go to the prison
for prayer service,

939
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:59,041
do you take someone along?

940
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:01,041
Yes, a boy named Babu.

941
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:02,333
Babu?

942
01:24:02,916 --> 01:24:05,791
He's someone who was traumatized by you
and cured by our NGO.

943
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:08,875
Where is he now?

944
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,333
Do you want to see him?

945
01:24:10,416 --> 01:24:11,583
-Yes.
-Okay. Come.

946
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,666
Babu!

947
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:16,083
Babu!

948
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:17,208
-Come here.
-Yes, Father?

949
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:25,333
-He wants to talk to you.
-No, Father. He will arrest me.

950
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:26,458
-I am here.
-Noâ€¦

951
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:28,041
So, don't worry.
He won't harm you.

952
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:30,333
-I'm here for you. Just go.
-Okay, sir.

953
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,708
Didn't I arrest you a year ago?

954
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:53,291
Yes, sir.

955
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:56,500
It was me.

956
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,125
-Father, look at this!
-Babu!

957
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:11,333
-Sir, where are you taking him? Babu!
-Father, save me! Please!

958
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:12,708
Sirâ€¦

959
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:15,750
-Yes, Father?
<i>-Frank, Arjun just took Babu away!</i>

960
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:17,625
-What do you mean?
<i>-He said he wanted to talk to him.</i>

961
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:19,125
<i>Suddenly I saw him dragging him away!</i>

962
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:20,750
I'll handle it.

963
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:25,250
Sir, I'm innocent.
Please let me go.

964
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:27,458
Sir, please.

965
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,291
Sir! Sir! Please, no.

966
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:32,291
Sir!

967
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,750
You are the murderer, right?

968
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,958
What do you have against me?

969
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,583
Why are you targeting me?

970
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:04,916
Sirâ€¦ I didn't commit any murder.

971
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,166
Out with the truth.

972
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:10,000
Sirâ€¦ sirâ€¦

973
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:11,750
Sir, no!

974
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:17,125
Sir! Sir!

975
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,333
Oh, God!

976
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:20,083
-Sir!
-Stop him!

977
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:22,125
-Sir! Sir!
-Sirâ€¦

978
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,291
-Tell me!
-Sir!

979
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:24,666
-Sir, please come here.
-Arjun!

980
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:27,083
Are you a psychopath?!

981
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:28,708
Why are you unnecessarily
interfering in this case?

982
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:31,208
This is my case! I'll handle it.

983
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:34,375
He is the killer.

984
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:41,458
-So you committed all the murders?
-Yes, sir!

985
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:43,333
Stop kidding! Be serious!

986
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:44,833
What do you want me to do, sir?

987
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:48,625
You guys have already planned
to frame me!

988
01:26:49,541 --> 01:26:52,083
You won't leave me until I confess.

989
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:56,875
I was thrashed enough a year ago.
I can't take it anymore.

990
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,583
Nobody will hurt you.

991
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,500
I'm here with you.
Just tell me the truth.

992
01:27:04,708 --> 01:27:05,791
Sirâ€¦

993
01:27:06,541 --> 01:27:09,583
he is the murderer
and he is trying to frame me.

994
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,375
Don't you know that?

995
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:12,708
Who are you talking about?

996
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:19,666
Sirâ€¦

997
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:23,750
recently there was news about a girl
named Shalu who went missing, right?

998
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:26,333
He was the one who abducted her.

999
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:29,000
I saw it myself, sir.

1000
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:30,833
You saw it?

1001
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:34,083
You mean this girl?

1002
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,916
Yes, sir. It was her.

1003
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:38,583
Do you have anything to say?

1004
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:40,500
-Sirâ€¦
-Sir!

1005
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:44,791
-Frankâ€¦
-Sir?

1006
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,916
-Sir.
-What is happening?

1007
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,708
Sir, that guy witnessed
Arjun kidnap Shalu.

1008
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:58,333
-Call Arjun.
-Arjun!

1009
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:04,916
Did you kidnap Shalu?

1010
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:07,833
Yes, sir. I kidnapped her.

1011
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,166
-What are you saying, Arjun?
-Maniâ€¦

1012
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,458
Sorry, sir.

1013
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,750
Arjun, are you drunk?

1014
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,583
Sir, in order to nab the copycat killer
we needed to nab Brahma first.

1015
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:19,916
My suspicion arose upon seeing Shalu.

1016
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,875
Why are you refusing police protection?

1017
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:23,666
Your life is in danger.

1018
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,333
Brahma will definitely come for you.

1019
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:29,791
Don't worry, sir.

1020
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:33,250
Even if Brahma comes for me,
he won't be to murder me.

1021
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:40,000
From the way she spoke, I understood
that she wasn't afraid of Brahma.

1022
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:44,666
That's when I guessed that there was
a connection between Brahma and Shalu.

1023
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:48,000
I knew Shalu was the bait
to catch Brahma.

1024
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:51,000
And then, by using Brahma,
I planned to catch the copycat killer.

1025
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:54,625
So, I kidnapped Shalu,

1026
01:28:54,916 --> 01:28:57,291
tied her up in the same location
where I caught Brahma,

1027
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:59,750
and then recorded a video
and sent it to the media.

1028
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:04,166
Had I asked your permission to do all
this, you wouldn't have granted it.

1029
01:29:04,625 --> 01:29:05,791
Hence, I didn't ask anybody.

1030
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,833
If I hadn't done that, we would've
never got hold of Brahma.

1031
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:16,291
Fine, I revealed why I kidnapped Shalu.

1032
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:19,291
What was he doing there
when I was kidnapping her?

1033
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:20,750
Did you ask him that?

1034
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:22,791
-Frank.
-Sir.

1035
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:24,750
-Bring that boy.
-Yes, sir.

1036
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:26,208
Marudhuâ€¦

1037
01:29:33,791 --> 01:29:35,000
Greetings, sir.

1038
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:39,375
Hey, what were you doing there
when Arjun was kidnapping Shalu?

1039
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:43,208
Sir, I know Mr. Ganesh very well.

1040
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,583
He is also a photographer.

1041
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:48,125
But he only clicks photos
of female models.

1042
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:53,416
He'd pass me a few local orders
that he'd receive.

1043
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:54,875
He's a kindhearted man.

1044
01:29:55,166 --> 01:29:57,666
Shalu madam is his girlfriend.

1045
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:00,583
He gave me a few photos to deliver to her.

1046
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,458
That's why I went to her house.

1047
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:04,125
When I went there, I saw thatâ€¦

1048
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:08,250
<i>he kidnapped her, put her</i>
<i>in the trunk of his car and left.</i>

1049
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,958
Why didn't you inform us earlier?

1050
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:19,125
Sirâ€¦

1051
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:23,416
if cops see me, they'd arrest me,
take me to the station, and thrash me.

1052
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,208
Who would have believed me
if I had reported that?

1053
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:27,916
So, I thought I shouldn't go

1054
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,208
-and get myself in trouble.
-Hey!

1055
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,416
Sorry, sir.

1056
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,833
Where is Shalu?

1057
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:34,625
We'll get more clarity
if we investigate her.

1058
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:37,333
Sir, since she was shot in the shoulder,

1059
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:38,833
we admitted her to Devi Hospital.

1060
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:41,166
-Call her. I'll talk to her.
-Yes, sir.

1061
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:51,833
-Hello.
<i>-Karthi, put Shalu on the phone.</i>

1062
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:53,166
Just a minute, sir.

1063
01:31:28,375 --> 01:31:29,416
Shaluâ€¦

1064
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,500
Sir, Ganesh abducted Shalu
from the hospital.

1065
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:55,583
Those bloody idiots!
Frank, what's going on?

1066
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:57,125
Can't you organize adequate security?

1067
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,958
-First, arrest Ganesh!
-Okay, sir.

1068
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:00,208
Ganesh is not the murderer, sir.

1069
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:02,833
-He is the killer.
-Shut up, Arjun!

1070
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:05,041
Stop repeating yourself.

1071
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:10,458
Sir, the church father
is here with the journalists.

1072
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:14,208
-Fatherâ€¦ Fatherâ€¦
-What a bloody mess!

1073
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,500
-Babu! Babu!
-Father!

1074
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:17,750
-Why have you brought him here?
-Father!

1075
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:19,166
He's innocent. Leave him!

1076
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,708
-Father, save me!
-Babu!

1077
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:21,708
Leave him!

1078
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,083
-Babu! Please leave him.
-Father, come here.

1079
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:31,625
-Why have brought him here?
-Father! Come here.

1080
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:34,208
Come here and tell us, Father.

1081
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:36,041
Tell our viewers what's going on here.

1082
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:39,833
This morning, Assistant Commissioner Arjun
came to the church to investigate Babu.

1083
01:32:39,916 --> 01:32:42,000
But he dragged him all the way here.

1084
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:44,625
Later, I learned that he is
no longer part of the police force.

1085
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:49,083
<i>It's people like Arjun who tarnish</i>
<i>the reputation of the police department.</i>

1086
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:52,416
<i>Purely due to an old rivalry,</i>
<i>he unjustly implicated innocent Babu</i>

1087
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,791
<i>and locked him up</i>

1088
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:56,875
<i>under the pretext of an investigation,</i>
<i>without offering any explanation.</i>

1089
01:32:56,958 --> 01:32:57,958
<i>He has been torturing him.</i>

1090
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:00,375
<i>Babu is a poor downtrodden young man.</i>

1091
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:02,625
<i>He is not just poor, but also an orphan.</i>

1092
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:06,000
<i>It's our duty to speak up on his behalf</i>
<i>and ensure that justice is delivered.</i>

1093
01:33:06,208 --> 01:33:10,208
<i>Share your feedback on Twitter</i>
<i>with the #JusticeForBabu.</i>

1094
01:33:30,875 --> 01:33:34,250
No, sir. I am at the spot.
I'll take care of it.

1095
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:40,000
You're a disgrace to the department.

1096
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:44,208
Listen.

1097
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:45,625
Sorry, kid.

1098
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:48,666
Hereafter, you won't have
any trouble from our side.

1099
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,625
I shall take action for
whatever happened to you.

1100
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:51,708
-Maniâ€¦
-Sir.

1101
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:54,041
-Make arrangements to drop him back home.
-Okay, sir.

1102
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:56,208
Sir.

1103
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,666
Shaluâ€¦ are you okay?

1104
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:09,875
Shalu, I want to have a word with you.

1105
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:11,666
Shalu, just a moment. Listen to me.

1106
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,041
-Leave me.
-Shalu, you're in danger!

1107
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:15,333
-I wanna go home.
-Listen to me, Shalu.

1108
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,333
Shalu! Damn it!

1109
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:19,375
Sorry. I'm sorry, Shalu.

1110
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:22,333
Please hear me out.
My assistant, Babuâ€¦

1111
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:23,750
He is the psycho killer!

1112
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:26,041
He was the one who kidnapped
Karen and killed her.

1113
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:29,666
When I called Karen,
I heard Babu's voice.

1114
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,000
Then I called Babu.

1115
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:33,625
And when he answered it,
guess what he said!

1116
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:37,291
He said, "Forget Karen,
but take good care of Shalu."

1117
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,583
There was arrogance
in the way he spoke and laughed!

1118
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:41,000
He is out there to kill you.

1119
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:42,708
He will kill you, Shalu!

1120
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:45,166
-Shalu, please--
-Leave me alone! I want to go!

1121
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:49,875
Youâ€¦ you don't get it, right?

1122
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,458
Shaluâ€¦

1123
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:58,041
Shalu! Shalu, listen to me!
Try to understand!

1124
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:02,250
He will bloody kill you! You'll die!
Try to understand!

1125
01:35:02,458 --> 01:35:04,666
Try to understand! Shalu, come on!

1126
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:21,666
Sir, will you take action
against those accountable?

1127
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:22,875
Absolutely!

1128
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:26,625
I strongly condemn this incident.

1129
01:35:27,166 --> 01:35:30,000
And I personally apologize
for whatever happened.

1130
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,083
You made all the mistakes
without thinking twice,

1131
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,208
but it's the commissioner
who is bearing the brunt.

1132
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:37,166
Babu has been released.

1133
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,041
We will take action against each
and every person involved in this.

1134
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:52,541
-Sirâ€¦
-Arjunâ€¦

1135
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:53,791
-Sir, one more question!
-Thank you.

1136
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:54,958
-Please.
-Sir!

1137
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,250
What are you looking for in my shop,
especially at this late hour?

1138
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:53,166
Heyâ€¦

1139
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,250
I know who you are.

1140
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:58,166
You committed all those murders
and now you are playing innocent?

1141
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:01,291
-Oh, my! Look who just cracked the case!
-Hey!

1142
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:02,791
Sirâ€¦

1143
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:05,375
-Shut up and sit down!
-Okay, sir.

1144
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:06,791
Sirâ€¦

1145
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,791
<i>Are you high? Are you lost?</i>

1146
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:28,833
<i>Is your mind confused?</i>

1147
01:38:29,541 --> 01:38:32,416
<i>Is your life too shaky?</i>

1148
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,833
Sir, come on!
Am I not allowed to sing?

1149
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:38,875
Don't hit me, sir. Please!

1150
01:38:57,041 --> 01:38:58,416
Come on, sir! Come on!

1151
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,083
Come on. Bring it on!

1152
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,833
Gotcha! Stay inside!

1153
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:19,958
Stay there!

1154
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:23,458
Open the door!

1155
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,583
Do you realize now?

1156
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:28,041
Do you realize who I am?

1157
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,291
Oh, God! It hurts!

1158
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:36,375
It hurts! It hurts!

1159
01:39:36,458 --> 01:39:37,750
It hurts!

1160
01:39:38,375 --> 01:39:40,833
That is how a girl screamed
when I killed her.

1161
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:03,791
Arjun sir, I guess I should not
put on an act before you and Brahma.

1162
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,625
You both see through my act.

1163
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:10,416
<i>A year ago, you just looked at me once</i>
<i>and you saw the carnage within me.</i>

1164
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,666
-Move! Keep walking!
-Sirâ€¦

1165
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:13,708
-Sirâ€¦
-They were standing by the corpse.

1166
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:18,250
Sirâ€¦

1167
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:20,291
-Take him into custody!
-Sirâ€¦

1168
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,250
But I should thank you.

1169
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:25,041
My life changed direction
only after you incarcerated me.

1170
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:27,583
That is where I met Father Sebastian.

1171
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:30,750
He was wandering around,
desperate to offer help.

1172
01:40:30,833 --> 01:40:33,666
Father! Father!

1173
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:36,208
You have saved so many people.
Please save me as well!

1174
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:37,833
Father!

1175
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,583
-Who is he?
-He is a suspect, Father.

1176
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:44,916
Please save me, Father.

1177
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:47,583
How do you know Brahma?

1178
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:53,750
Brahma! Brahma!

1179
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:56,708
Brahma! Brahma!

1180
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:58,791
Brahma! Brahma!

1181
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:00,416
-Brahma!
<i>-Father helped me.</i>

1182
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,500
<i>As a paid religious figure,</i>

1183
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:04,666
<i>he would take me to prisons every Sunday</i>
<i>for what he called social service,</i>

1184
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,541
<i>and trouble me in the name</i>
<i>of offering prayers for others.</i>

1185
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:09,333
<i>I met Brahma on one such occasion.</i>

1186
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:11,458
<i>Brahma's lawyer and Father</i>

1187
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:14,583
<i>were getting a petition signed</i>
<i>to prove that he is mentally unstable.</i>

1188
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:17,375
<i>That's when I put on an act</i>
<i>in front of Father.</i>

1189
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:20,041
Brahma ruined my life, Father.

1190
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:25,291
Can I forgive the sins
of that troubled soul?

1191
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:27,750
Sure, come.

1192
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:49,458
I saw you commit that murder
at the iron factory.

1193
01:41:54,416 --> 01:41:56,208
<i>You hid when the police arrived.</i>

1194
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:02,750
<i>Those cops thrashed me</i>
<i>and ripped me apart.</i>

1195
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:04,541
Sir!

1196
01:42:06,166 --> 01:42:08,458
<i>Even after enduring those beatings,</i>
<i>I didn't rat you out.</i>

1197
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:10,458
Sit.

1198
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:17,000
Do you know why?

1199
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,041
I can see the carnage in your eyes.

1200
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:23,250
No.

1201
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:27,083
I cannot kill anybody, sir.

1202
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:30,041
I ruined your life.

1203
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:32,833
Wouldn't ending my life
bring you inner peace?

1204
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:34,708
But how is it your fault?

1205
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:39,458
It was the Assistant Commissioner
who put me in prison unnecessarily.

1206
01:42:41,416 --> 01:42:43,541
Didn't you do anything
to get back at him?

1207
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:44,916
He is a cop.

1208
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:48,375
The very sight of him
sends a shiver down my spine.

1209
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:51,250
How can I get back at him?

1210
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:53,625
You and I are the same breed.

1211
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:56,000
Do you know why I kill?

1212
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:02,083
The sound of their terrified screams
during their last moments

1213
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:04,916
brings me immense satisfaction.

1214
01:43:09,458 --> 01:43:10,916
I should leave.

1215
01:43:12,916 --> 01:43:13,916
Wait a minute.

1216
01:43:19,708 --> 01:43:21,333
Can you do me a favor?

1217
01:43:23,333 --> 01:43:26,750
There are a lot of mosquitoes in here.

1218
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:29,375
Kill them.

1219
01:43:51,541 --> 01:43:52,583
Nowâ€¦

1220
01:43:53,541 --> 01:43:54,625
what did you do?

1221
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:56,625
I killed the mosquitoes.

1222
01:43:58,916 --> 01:44:00,750
You don't get it.

1223
01:44:03,041 --> 01:44:05,041
It's not just a mosquito.

1224
01:44:05,375 --> 01:44:07,375
It has a life of its own.

1225
01:44:08,125 --> 01:44:10,291
You just took many lives.

1226
01:44:10,541 --> 01:44:12,166
And how did you do it?

1227
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:17,041
Those mosquitoes were
flying freely and happily.

1228
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:21,791
You tortured and killed them brutally
by electrocuting them.

1229
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:25,458
Close your eyes.

1230
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:32,291
Now, thousands of mosquitoes
are going to get electrocuted

1231
01:44:32,708 --> 01:44:34,958
and they are going to die
screaming in pain.

1232
01:44:35,208 --> 01:44:36,083
Do it.

1233
01:45:18,708 --> 01:45:23,958
These petty humans invent such things
and indulge in killing.

1234
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:27,041
So, what should we do?

1235
01:45:55,291 --> 01:45:58,333
Brahma is the one who exposed the carnage
that was brewing within me.

1236
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:06,958
The only person who escaped from me.

1237
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:08,791
The only prey.

1238
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,416
Shalu.

1239
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:13,208
I want her.

1240
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:16,166
And for that, I must get out.

1241
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:20,708
He became my mentor and I killed Shwetha,
the doctor's daughter, to help him escape.

1242
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,458
Killing her didn't quench my thirst!

1243
01:46:22,541 --> 01:46:25,583
My mentor's words kept ringing in my ears.
"Shwetha's family must suffer!"

1244
01:46:25,666 --> 01:46:28,583
You know what I did? One week later,
after things calmed down at home,

1245
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:31,666
I sent them the dead girl's clothes
and the video in which she was screaming.

1246
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,458
-It was a hit! A hit!
<i>-The clothes of the victims and videos</i>

1247
01:46:36,541 --> 01:46:39,625
<i>of them getting tortured and killedâ€¦</i>

1248
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:42,541
<i>When my hero came out,</i>
<i>he had only one thing to say to me.</i>

1249
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:46,583
He said that it wasn't enough
and asked me to face the person I feared.

1250
01:46:47,125 --> 01:46:48,958
I knew that abducting Divya
would provoke you.

1251
01:46:49,041 --> 01:46:50,208
That is why I abducted her!

1252
01:46:50,333 --> 01:46:54,166
Right before I could kill her, you
sniffed it like a dog and arrived there.

1253
01:46:55,166 --> 01:46:59,125
Butâ€¦ when I heard your voice,

1254
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:02,000
it scared the bejesus out of me,
Arjun sir!

1255
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,666
I started to tremble.

1256
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:06,500
Divya!

1257
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:10,000
Oh, God!

1258
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:11,291
He is here.

1259
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:12,708
Divya!

1260
01:47:12,791 --> 01:47:14,500
He is here!

1261
01:47:14,583 --> 01:47:15,458
Divya!

1262
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,541
Do something! He is here!

1263
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:20,416
Go and kill him.

1264
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:21,750
I'm scared.

1265
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:24,208
You are not Babu anymore.

1266
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:27,166
-You are Brahma. Do as I say.
-I can't.

1267
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:29,041
I'm scared. Do something.

1268
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:49,250
On that day, Brahma died
right in front of my eyes.

1269
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:54,000
But before he took his last breath,
he taught me something.

1270
01:47:55,208 --> 01:47:57,375
<i>He died with a smile on his face!</i>

1271
01:48:05,666 --> 01:48:07,375
That's when I realized something.

1272
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:12,583
To become the real Brahma,
one must not fear death.

1273
01:48:13,416 --> 01:48:16,125
Since then, I stopped fearing you.

1274
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:19,958
I'm not the wuss named Babu,
whom you can easily beat up!

1275
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:21,958
I'm Brahma, the one
who doesn't fear death!

1276
01:48:28,833 --> 01:48:31,291
Now, come! Come on!

1277
01:48:31,375 --> 01:48:32,750
Come on!

1278
01:48:49,875 --> 01:48:52,875
-Hey, Arjun!
-Sir, what took you so long?

1279
01:48:52,958 --> 01:48:54,041
Catch hold of Arjun!

1280
01:48:56,208 --> 01:48:58,250
Let go of him, sir!

1281
01:48:58,500 --> 01:48:59,458
Come on, sir!

1282
01:49:23,333 --> 01:49:25,416
You can never be Brahma.

1283
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,333
Sirâ€¦

1284
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:48,833
Ganesh is not the killer.

1285
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:51,291
<i>We went to his house last night</i>
<i>with a search warrant.</i>

1286
01:49:54,583 --> 01:49:56,458
We found his dead body lying in his house.

1287
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,958
No problem, sir.
I'm looking into it.

1288
01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:05,791
Okay, sir. I'll keep you posted.
Thank you.

1289
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:11,208
Despite receiving
numerous complaints about you,

1290
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:14,416
I chose not to react
for one specific reason.

1291
01:50:15,125 --> 01:50:17,125
I thought you were a sincere officer.

1292
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:18,166
But nowâ€¦

1293
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:20,125
you've stretched it too far.

1294
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:23,541
I'm left with no option
but to arrest you.

1295
01:50:23,625 --> 01:50:24,791
-Just a minute, sir--
-Mani, stop!

1296
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:26,333
Don't interrupt.

1297
01:50:27,125 --> 01:50:28,083
Sorry, sir.

1298
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:31,916
Damn it, say something!

1299
01:50:33,375 --> 01:50:34,791
Sir, Babu is the killer.

1300
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:36,916
Who are you to decide that?

1301
01:50:37,708 --> 01:50:39,333
You are no longer in the police force.

1302
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:41,208
I am his target.

1303
01:50:42,708 --> 01:50:45,791
He murdered Divya
solely to ensnare me back into this case.

1304
01:50:47,625 --> 01:50:50,208
I know that I cannot prove
anything without evidence.

1305
01:50:50,833 --> 01:50:53,166
That's why I went to his studio yesterday.

1306
01:50:54,583 --> 01:50:57,125
While I was searching for
evidence in his computer systemâ€¦

1307
01:50:57,625 --> 01:50:59,625
<i>I noticed that it had a CCTV camera app.</i>

1308
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:03,125
<i>He is holding a girl captive somewhere</i>
<i>and has installed cameras there.</i>

1309
01:51:03,208 --> 01:51:04,916
<i>He was watching her from his studio.</i>

1310
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:09,125
I found the IP address
of the camera, gave it to Mani,

1311
01:51:09,208 --> 01:51:11,208
and asked him to trace
the girl's location.

1312
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:13,041
Sir, allow me to weigh in.

1313
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:16,416
I went to the location.
We found a girl chained up.

1314
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,458
<i>Upon inquiry,</i>

1315
01:51:17,541 --> 01:51:20,958
<i>I found out that Babu has been</i>
<i>repeatedly raping her for over a year.</i>

1316
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:24,666
And the most disturbing part is that
she is his younger sister.

1317
01:51:31,916 --> 01:51:34,458
But how do you conclude thatâ€¦

1318
01:51:34,833 --> 01:51:37,375
Babu is behind all the murders
that resemble Brahma's pattern?

1319
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:39,458
Sir, you must trust me in this case.

1320
01:51:40,375 --> 01:51:41,500
Yesterday, in the studio,

1321
01:51:41,583 --> 01:51:44,083
he confessed to me
that he committed all the murders.

1322
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,166
Let's nab that bastard.

1323
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:50,208
-Do not assemble a big team. Be discrete.
-Yes, sir.

1324
01:51:50,916 --> 01:51:52,500
-Sir.
-Carry on.

1325
01:52:19,375 --> 01:52:20,416
Sir, your phone.

1326
01:52:33,333 --> 01:52:35,375
Arjunâ€¦

1327
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,000
<i>Sophieâ€¦</i>

1328
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:39,958
Jasmine?

1329
01:52:40,791 --> 01:52:42,875
Babu kidnapped Sophie.

1330
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,541
Where are you?

1331
01:52:47,833 --> 01:52:49,083
I'm at the church.

1332
01:52:49,666 --> 01:52:52,208
He will reveal Sophie's whereabouts
only if you come here.

1333
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:54,333
-Come fast, Arjun.
<i>-Everything will be fine.</i>

1334
01:52:54,416 --> 01:52:55,916
<i>Don't worry. I'll be there.</i>

1335
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:19,250
Jasmineâ€¦

1336
01:53:20,708 --> 01:53:21,791
Arjun!

1337
01:53:21,875 --> 01:53:24,250
Sophieâ€¦ our Sophie!

1338
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:26,583
-I want her back, Arjun.
-Yesâ€¦

1339
01:53:29,875 --> 01:53:31,291
Come with me.

1340
01:53:49,541 --> 01:53:51,083
Arjun, wait.

1341
01:53:54,666 --> 01:53:55,500
Babuâ€¦

1342
01:53:58,166 --> 01:54:00,708
Look, Arjun is here as per your wish.

1343
01:54:02,291 --> 01:54:04,041
Look, Arjun.

1344
01:54:05,125 --> 01:54:06,291
Where's Sophie, Babu?

1345
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:16,875
Save the drama
and tell us where the kid is.

1346
01:54:17,458 --> 01:54:18,916
Or else I'll kill and bury you!

1347
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,875
Jerk! Do you realize it only now?

1348
01:54:22,583 --> 01:54:24,250
I'm pretty pissed with you!

1349
01:54:25,416 --> 01:54:27,541
How dare you mistreat me
for the murders I didn't commit?!

1350
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:30,500
This is your last warning! Otherwiseâ€¦

1351
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,541
Tell me where the kid is,
or else I'll kill you!

1352
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:35,791
Sirâ€¦ I'll tell you.

1353
01:54:36,375 --> 01:54:39,750
You and Jasmine come with me.

1354
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,458
-I'll tell you.
-I'm not going anywhere!

1355
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:44,666
I'm giving you five minutes.

1356
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,375
Tell me where the kid is
and I'll spare your life.

1357
01:54:47,458 --> 01:54:48,958
Or else, I'll finish you off!

1358
01:54:51,708 --> 01:54:54,833
-Shit!
-Babu, please tell me where she is.

1359
01:54:55,083 --> 01:54:57,958
-Where is Sophie?
-Did you see that, Jasmine? Did you?!

1360
01:54:59,666 --> 01:55:01,250
I said that the kid would die
if we didn't get there soon,

1361
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:03,083
but I see no fear on their faces!

1362
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:06,041
Look at his face!
There's no fear at all!

1363
01:55:07,708 --> 01:55:09,583
Look at his face! No fear!

1364
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:16,833
Jasmine, the very sight of him
makes me tremble in fear!

1365
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:23,958
I can achieve the stature of Brahma
only by defeating him!

1366
01:55:31,333 --> 01:55:32,916
I don't care if I dieâ€¦

1367
01:55:33,958 --> 01:55:35,708
but I want to watch you suffer in pain!

1368
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:41,458
Jasmine, I hope you remember
everything I told you.

1369
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:42,750
If you don't do as I say,

1370
01:55:42,833 --> 01:55:44,333
-you'll find Sophie's lifeless body.
-Oh, God!

1371
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,750
-I'll kill you!
-Arjunâ€¦ please!

1372
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:50,875
Don't you get it?

1373
01:55:51,166 --> 01:55:53,166
Sophie is my life, Arjun.

1374
01:55:54,583 --> 01:55:56,750
She is all that I have
of mine and Andrew.

1375
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,458
-I want her back.
-Jasmineâ€¦

1376
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:02,666
if we obey him,
we won't be able to find Sophie.

1377
01:56:03,375 --> 01:56:05,041
He just wants to see me suffer.

1378
01:56:05,125 --> 01:56:07,500
That is all he wants,
and he'll do anything for that!

1379
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:08,916
Lookâ€¦

1380
01:56:09,666 --> 01:56:13,500
I very well know how to rescue Sophie.
Please try to understand.

1381
01:56:15,083 --> 01:56:16,041
You are lying.

1382
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:19,750
I trusted you with Andrew, right?

1383
01:56:20,708 --> 01:56:22,041
Look what happened to him.

1384
01:56:23,583 --> 01:56:24,708
He's no more with us.

1385
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,541
Please help me get my Sophie back.

1386
01:56:27,791 --> 01:56:30,458
-Please. I cannot live without her.
-God! Shall we start?!

1387
01:56:30,541 --> 01:56:32,000
Please listen to him for my sake.

1388
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:34,916
Let's go. Come on.

1389
01:56:36,708 --> 01:56:39,000
Arjun, keep this.

1390
01:56:46,833 --> 01:56:49,458
<i>Satan has risen, O Lord.</i>

1391
01:56:49,958 --> 01:56:51,791
<i>I kneel before you and pray.</i>

1392
01:56:52,208 --> 01:56:55,000
<i>Please help avoid further violence.</i>

1393
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,875
<i>Until now, I have never</i>
<i>asked God for anything.</i>

1394
01:57:12,666 --> 01:57:15,125
<i>But for the first time,</i>
<i>I'm asking God for something.</i>

1395
01:57:15,875 --> 01:57:17,958
<i>Until I get Sophie back aliveâ€¦</i>

1396
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:20,750
<i>I must control myself</i>
<i>from squashing this filthy worm.</i>

1397
01:57:21,625 --> 01:57:23,166
<i>Grant me patience and tolerance.</i>

1398
01:57:24,416 --> 01:57:27,083
Arjun sir, if you keep driving
at this pace, the kid willâ€¦

1399
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:31,375
-Step on it, sir. Drive faster!
-Driver faster.

1400
01:57:32,083 --> 01:57:33,000
Jasmineâ€¦

1401
01:57:33,625 --> 01:57:34,875
shall we play a game?

1402
01:57:38,875 --> 01:57:40,750
Sir, the game has three rounds.

1403
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:42,375
It'll be over soon.

1404
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:45,958
-Ready?
-Ready.

1405
01:57:46,041 --> 01:57:47,833
Say "one" when I ask you to.

1406
01:57:48,916 --> 01:57:51,166
You say "two" and I'll say "three," okay?

1407
01:57:56,291 --> 01:57:58,416
-Hey! Say "one"!
-One.

1408
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:59,416
Oneâ€¦

1409
01:58:02,166 --> 01:58:04,125
Sir, play the game, or else
I won't tell you where the kid is!

1410
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:06,166
Please say it, Arjun!

1411
01:58:06,791 --> 01:58:07,750
Please say it.

1412
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:10,750
Two.

1413
01:58:12,208 --> 01:58:13,166
Three!

1414
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:16,666
One.

1415
01:58:17,375 --> 01:58:18,916
-Two.
-Three!

1416
01:58:21,875 --> 01:58:22,916
One.

1417
01:58:23,958 --> 01:58:24,875
Two.

1418
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:26,166
Three!

1419
01:58:28,875 --> 01:58:29,791
One.

1420
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:33,791
Two. Three.

1421
01:58:34,166 --> 01:58:36,125
One, two, three!

1422
01:58:36,208 --> 01:58:37,500
One, two, three!

1423
01:58:37,583 --> 01:58:39,416
One, two, three!

1424
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:41,416
One, two, three!

1425
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:44,458
-One, two, three!
-Arjunâ€¦ take this.

1426
01:58:44,541 --> 01:58:46,000
-One, two, three!
-Take this.

1427
01:58:46,083 --> 01:58:47,916
One, two, three!

1428
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,666
-Arjun, take this!
-One, two, three!

1429
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:51,625
-Hey! Show me the route!
-One, two, three!

1430
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,166
-One, two, three!
-Shut up!

1431
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:56,250
-One, two, three!
-Show me the route!

1432
01:58:56,333 --> 01:58:58,125
-One, two, three!
-I said, shut up!

1433
01:58:58,208 --> 01:58:59,625
One, two, three!

1434
01:58:59,708 --> 01:59:01,083
-Arjun, look hereâ€¦
-Show me the route!

1435
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:02,250
-One, two, three!
-Arjunâ€¦

1436
01:59:02,333 --> 01:59:05,458
-Arjun, hand this over to Sophie.
-One, two, three! One, two, three!

1437
01:59:05,541 --> 01:59:06,875
One, two, three!

1438
01:59:06,958 --> 01:59:08,250
-Wait, Jasmine!
-One, two, three!

1439
01:59:08,375 --> 01:59:10,750
-Show me the route!
-Turn right! Right!

1440
01:59:10,833 --> 01:59:13,250
Turn right! Right!

1441
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:14,416
Hey!

1442
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:15,625
Jasmine!

1443
02:00:00,083 --> 02:00:01,375
Sophieâ€¦

1444
02:00:04,333 --> 02:00:05,625
Go!

1445
02:00:11,375 --> 02:00:13,250
Jasmine, you kept your promise.

1446
02:00:17,083 --> 02:00:18,041
She didn't die?

1447
02:00:25,625 --> 02:00:28,458
Sopâ€¦ Sophie! Sophie!

1448
02:00:28,541 --> 02:00:31,291
Sophie! Sophie!

1449
02:00:31,458 --> 02:00:32,500
Sophie.

1450
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:34,000
Sophie.

1451
02:00:38,958 --> 02:00:39,833
Now get in the car.

1452
02:00:44,625 --> 02:00:47,958
You sinners! You came after us
and ran over an innocent woman!

1453
02:00:48,041 --> 02:00:49,250
You're not allowed to follow us anymore!

1454
02:00:51,041 --> 02:00:52,250
Come on, sir. Let's go!

1455
02:01:19,791 --> 02:01:20,666
Where is she?

1456
02:01:21,416 --> 02:01:23,375
I don't understand one thing.

1457
02:01:24,458 --> 02:01:26,958
It makes sense for Sophie's mother
to sacrifice herself for Sophie.

1458
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:29,083
But your girlfriend? Poor girl!

1459
02:01:29,291 --> 02:01:31,125
She also loves Sophie equally.

1460
02:01:32,791 --> 02:01:35,666
Not everyone is stonehearted like you.

1461
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:39,625
Don't worry. After I kill you,
I'll take care of Priya.

1462
02:01:42,250 --> 02:01:43,916
Stop! Over here!

1463
02:01:58,833 --> 02:01:59,916
Why did you mention Priya?

1464
02:02:00,666 --> 02:02:01,708
-Tell me.
-I'll tell you.

1465
02:02:01,791 --> 02:02:03,833
-I'll tell you.
-Where is Priya?

1466
02:02:03,916 --> 02:02:04,833
Tell me!

1467
02:02:08,208 --> 02:02:11,583
You have been aggressive towards me
so many times! Have I ever hit you back?

1468
02:02:12,041 --> 02:02:14,291
I'll tell you if you let me hit you.

1469
02:02:14,625 --> 02:02:17,250
Please, sir.
Just a couple of hits.

1470
02:02:17,333 --> 02:02:18,875
Only then I'll tell you.

1471
02:02:46,375 --> 02:02:47,625
What happened, sir?

1472
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:51,333
Do you want your Priya back, sir?

1473
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:54,458
Go, fetch.

1474
02:03:10,833 --> 02:03:11,750
Hey!

1475
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:15,416
Hey!

1476
02:03:17,791 --> 02:03:18,875
Hey!

1477
02:04:40,708 --> 02:04:41,833
Why did you come here?

1478
02:04:42,416 --> 02:04:44,958
He wants to take my life
in exchange for Sophie.

1479
02:04:46,166 --> 02:04:47,666
This is why I kept my distance from you!

1480
02:04:48,208 --> 02:04:50,541
If you knew this would happen,
you should have been with us!

1481
02:04:51,125 --> 02:04:53,125
We could have been happy together
during the brief time we shared.

1482
02:04:53,916 --> 02:04:55,875
Life is too short, Arjun.

1483
02:04:57,083 --> 02:04:59,750
But now, we don't have the time for this.

1484
02:04:59,833 --> 02:05:01,625
We must rescue Sophie somehow.

1485
02:05:02,333 --> 02:05:03,166
Let's go.

1486
02:05:07,416 --> 02:05:08,333
Sophie!

1487
02:05:09,666 --> 02:05:11,333
-Sophie!
-Sophie!

1488
02:05:13,416 --> 02:05:15,333
-Sophie!
-Sophie!

1489
02:05:17,625 --> 02:05:18,708
Sophie!

1490
02:05:19,416 --> 02:05:20,541
Sophie!

1491
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,541
Sophie!

1492
02:05:25,541 --> 02:05:26,458
Priyaâ€¦

1493
02:05:32,833 --> 02:05:34,875
-Priyaâ€¦
-Sophieâ€¦

1494
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:41,500
Sophâ€¦

1495
02:05:45,375 --> 02:05:46,500
Priya!

1496
02:05:50,458 --> 02:05:51,416
What theâ€¦

1497
02:05:52,666 --> 02:05:54,125
Even after all that has happenedâ€¦

1498
02:05:55,625 --> 02:05:58,041
you still won't show your pain, right?

1499
02:05:59,916 --> 02:06:01,958
Final round.

1500
02:06:03,916 --> 02:06:08,291
Do youâ€¦ want Priya?

1501
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:14,916
Or Sophie?

1502
02:06:19,583 --> 02:06:20,625
Arjun sir!

1503
02:06:21,666 --> 02:06:23,458
Her neckâ€¦

1504
02:06:23,916 --> 02:06:25,666
is very soft!

1505
02:06:25,916 --> 02:06:28,958
-I'm finding it hard to control myself!
-No! No!

1506
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:32,750
Arjun, just rescue Sophie at any cost.

1507
02:06:33,416 --> 02:06:34,250
I'll go.

1508
02:06:44,291 --> 02:06:45,875
Come on.

1509
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:47,541
Come on.

1510
02:06:54,708 --> 02:06:56,916
Go! Sophie, go!

1511
02:07:04,041 --> 02:07:06,041
Priyaâ€¦

1512
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:10,333
Priya!

1513
02:07:15,666 --> 02:07:16,583
Priya!

1514
02:07:44,416 --> 02:07:47,458
<i>Quit wasting time and respond promptly.</i>

1515
02:07:48,708 --> 02:07:50,291
<i>I'll be waiting for you.</i>

1516
02:08:15,583 --> 02:08:17,541
Damn it, I'm unable
to hold back my tears.

1517
02:08:18,958 --> 02:08:20,166
You were right.

1518
02:08:23,083 --> 02:08:24,375
Life is short.

1519
02:08:31,666 --> 02:08:32,708
I love you.

1520
02:08:51,083 --> 02:08:51,916
Babu.

1521
02:08:54,458 --> 02:08:55,291
Babu.

1522
02:08:57,291 --> 02:08:58,125
Look here.

1523
02:08:59,916 --> 02:09:03,958
<i>Babu, who was under suspicion</i>
<i>as the psycho killer by the police,</i>

1524
02:09:04,041 --> 02:09:06,000
<i>was discovered brutally murdered.</i>

1525
02:09:06,083 --> 02:09:09,500
<i>The police couldn't find the serial killer</i>
<i>responsible for the murders in Chennai,</i>

1526
02:09:09,583 --> 02:09:11,375
<i>leading them to initiate an investigation</i>

1527
02:09:11,458 --> 02:09:13,583
<i>-into an innocent man named Babu.</i>
-Tragic! He was a nice guy.

1528
02:09:13,666 --> 02:09:14,875
It's really sad
that he was brutally killed.

1529
02:09:14,958 --> 02:09:18,833
<i>The press and media made certain</i>
<i>that Babu was set free.</i>

1530
02:09:18,916 --> 02:09:23,250
<i>Meanwhile, the cops discovered</i>
<i>a dead body near the river's edge.</i>

1531
02:09:23,333 --> 02:09:27,083
<i>Just a while ago, we received news</i>
<i>that it was Babu's dead body.</i>

1532
02:09:27,166 --> 02:09:28,208
Sir, what's going on?

1533
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30,708
The guy they are claiming
to be dead is here and alive!

1534
02:09:30,791 --> 02:09:31,625
Hey!

1535
02:09:31,708 --> 02:09:33,666
-He's the doctor. Let him go.
-Heyâ€¦

1536
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:35,791
-Leave him. It's okay.
-Doctorâ€¦

1537
02:09:36,583 --> 02:09:39,916
Doctor, there's a psycho
in our department.

1538
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,166
He is currently on vacation.

1539
02:09:41,833 --> 02:09:44,250
It's unfair to always
leave everything for God.

1540
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:45,958
Sometimes we must handle things ourselves.

1541
02:09:46,166 --> 02:09:48,708
Come, let me explain it to you.

1542
02:09:50,166 --> 02:09:51,250
Doctor!

1543
02:09:51,625 --> 02:09:52,791
Doctor!

1544
02:09:53,666 --> 02:09:54,541
Please don't go!

1545
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:12,416
<i>I knowâ€¦ no fear.</i>

1546
02:10:13,583 --> 02:10:14,833
<i>I have no enemies.</i>

1547
02:10:16,416 --> 02:10:18,708
<i>But that doesn't mean I'm a nice guy.</i>

1548
02:10:20,166 --> 02:10:21,333
<i>When the need arisesâ€¦</i>

1549
02:10:22,166 --> 02:10:23,500
<i>I turn into a monster.</i>

1550
02:10:31,375 --> 02:10:32,541
Doctor!

1551
02:10:35,125 --> 02:10:36,041
Doctor!

1552
02:10:37,125 --> 02:10:39,333
Doctor! Doctor!

1553
02:10:39,416 --> 02:10:41,333
Somebody, please help me!

1554
02:10:42,916 --> 02:10:43,875
Doctor!

1555
02:10:50,583 --> 02:10:53,041
Somebody, please help me!

1556
02:10:53,208 --> 02:10:55,125
Save me!

1557
02:11:00,125 --> 02:11:02,541
Please save me!
