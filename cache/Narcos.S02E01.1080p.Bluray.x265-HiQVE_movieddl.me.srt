- How will we proceed?
- Mr President...

92
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:53,792
Mr President, Escobar will surely attempt
to re-establish himself in the city,

93
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,463
and we can'<i>t</i> allow him and his <i>sicarios</i>
to move freely.

So my recommendation, Mr President,
is that we occupy Medellín.

95
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:04,762
Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

96
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:08,557
Close down the streets.
Establish vehicle checkpoints.

97

such an operation?

Colonel Pinzón, sir.

00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:55,844
'and all eyes were on Medellín.

166
00:11:56,428 --> 00:12:00,015
'This wasn'<i>t</i> just a manhunt...
this was an invasion.

167
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:04,770
'Gaviria was willing to go
door to door to catch Escobar.

168
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,688
'And we wanted to be a part of it.

169
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:11,693
'After all,
we represented America down here.

170
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:15,155
'We thought of ourselves
as the guys who could get shit done.'

171
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:18,158
(Javier) Jesus Christ...

172
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:22,120
(Steve) Agent Murphy,
Agent Peña. DEA.

173
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:25,958
(In Spanish) Yes, you're from the DEA,
but I have to ask Colonel Pinzón.

174
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,125
Wait one moment.

175
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:31,088
- Name Pinzón mean anything to you?
- No, don't know him.

176
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:35,217
(Steve) You see this?

177
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:38,553
Looks like we're not invited
to the dance.

178
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,348
(In Spanish)
Gentlemen, wait here for a moment.

179
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:44,393
We'll let you in
once the area is secured.

180
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:47,145
(In English) You mean
when nothing's left inside.

181
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:50,440
(In Spanish)
We're going to have to move everything.

182
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:54,569
- What do you mean by "everything"?
- Everything. The labs...

183
00:12:55,487 --> 00:13:01,743
the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...
we're moving everything.

184
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,870
Boss, even the labs?

185
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,790
They're well-guarded.
There's no problem.

186
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:11,044
Come on, don'<i>t</i> you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

187
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,716
The cops are going through all the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

188
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:17,926
Now we can'<i>t</i> trust anyone,
you bastards.

189
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:20,137
Who you calling a bastard,
you son of a bitch?

190
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:24,016
We're... moving... everything.

191
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,436
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

192
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:29,146
Yes, Don Pablo.

193
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:31,648
We're also going to need more men.

194
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,359
Last night we lost a lot of brothers.

195
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:39,197
- May they rest in peace.
- Amen.

196
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:45,412
And one last thing.

197
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

198
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:55,756
He needs to be smart,
fearless, and determined.

199
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:59,843
- Done, boss.
- (Velasco) Boss, I'm sorry, but...

200
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:02,637
you can'<i>t</i> risk yourself like that.

201
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:05,223
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

202
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:10,771
I want people to know
Pablo Escobar doesn'<i>t</i> hide like a rat.

203
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:15,859
Because <i>we...</i>

204
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:21,406
We are the Medellín cartel,
motherfucker!

205
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:23,283
(Steve) 'Now keep in mind...

206
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:26,578
'the Medellín cartel
wasn'<i>t</i> just one big gang.

207
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:29,456
'It was made up of a bunch
of smaller gangs.

208

'A collective, so to speak.

209
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:35,379

he was still their leader.

'In his mind, every trafficker in Medellín
had to pay tribute to him.

thousands of people

212

216
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,152
'and naturally,
they got the short end of the stick.'

217
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:00,529
Pablo, no!

218
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:06,993
(In Spanish) Believe whatever the fuck
you want, you son of a bitch!

219

Relax?
What do you want me to do?

Sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

He's going to come and kill you, too.

- How about that?
- Pablo won't be killing anyone.

246
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,828
- Jaime, what country do you live in?
- (Judy chuckles)

247
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:34,789
If he hasn'<i>t</i> killed anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

248
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:40,253
Haven'<i>t</i> you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven'<i>t</i> you noticed?

249
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:42,881
Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

250
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:45,926
There's a cop
on every fucking street corner.

251
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:48,929
Pablo can't move.

252
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:52,933
Then we have to find and kill
the bastard before the police find him.

253
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:54,559
(Jaime) Judy, listen.

254
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:57,604
Listen to me! Listen!

255
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:02,108
Pablo is like a caged rat right now.
Understand?

256
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,777
Jaime.

257
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:08,406
Despite everything,
you still don'<i>t</i> know Pablo?

258
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:12,410
- He's someone we can'<i>t</i> underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

259
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:15,288
They shouldn'<i>t</i> underestimate us either.

260
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,666
Pablo's running out of friends,
and you know <i>it.</i>

261
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,335
Pablo will always have friends.

262
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:24,839
Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

263
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:31,263
It should be clear that all you get
from being loyal to Pablo

264
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:33,515
is a bullet in the head.

265
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,811
They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

266
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:39,229
(Berna) Judy...

267
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,483
what do we do with the labs?

268
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:47,904
What do you suggest?

269
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,660
I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

270
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:55,161
(Scoffs)

271
00:17:55,287 --> 00:18:00,000
We have to lay low
until Pablo is killed or captured.

272
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:04,296
That's stupid, Berna. Tell me
how that makes any sense. Huh?

273
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:08,091
A lot of other people also stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

274
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:10,260
Let's join forces with them.

275
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:13,555
There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

276
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,265
I'll talk to him.

277
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,143
(Berna) Jaime,
be very careful with those people.

278
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:23,773
(Phone ringing)

279
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:25,108
- Hello?
- OK?

280
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,110
- That looks nice.
- One moment.

281
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,445
Ricardo?

282
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:33,783
Don Pablo.

283
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:40,749
Of course.
There was no decision to make.

284
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,877
You know you can always
count on us.

285
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:49,257
(Indistinct chatter in Spanish)

286
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:56,723
Sweetie! (Kissing)

287
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,685
- (Slaps car)
- Hey!

288
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,853
Faggot!

289
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:04,439
What's going on, Limón?

290
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:07,692
- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

291
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:12,697
Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

292
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:14,783
What are you doing here?
Are you going in?

293
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:16,993
No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

294
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:19,788
- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

295
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:21,289
Mm-hmm.

296
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:26,503
And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

297
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:28,546
You know. I have to pay rent.

298
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:32,717
Listen, Limón,
why don't you make good money?

299
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:34,260
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmh?

300
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:35,887
Doing what?

301
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:39,808
- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

302
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,769
Pablo Escobar, brother.

303
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:47,857
- Fuck off, you bastard.
- Limón, I'm serious, brother.

304
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:52,028
The boss asked us to find someone...

305
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,448
someone clean,
who the police don'<i>t</i> know.

306
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:58,118
He would go in the trunk.

307
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:04,582
- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he says. You don't ask.

308
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,875
Mmh.

309
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,461
What do you think, brother?

310
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:13,049
There's cops everywhere.

311
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:16,052
Why don'<i>t</i> we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

312
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:21,933
- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores, brother.

313
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:24,394
Then who, brother?

314
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:27,021
- No!
- No?

315
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,649
Why not, Maritza?

316
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:31,985
- No.

Right?

328

This is the girl I told you about.

00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:53,314
- Done, sir. Whatever you say.
- Good.

472
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,733
And fill this up, please.

473
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:10,206
(Man) Don Pablo!

474
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,166
- Sir, how are...
- Is that you?

475
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,377
- How are you, sir?
- (Man) Sweetie! Sweetie!

476
00:31:14,502 --> 00:31:17,838
Sweetie!
Don Pablo is in front of our house.

477
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:19,298
(Woman) Don Pablo?

478
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:21,175
(Pablo) Hello, Ma'am. How are you?

479
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,676
- Fine, and you?
- I'm well.

480
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,970
- It's him, old man.
- Sir, how are you?

481
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:27,390
- How is your health?
- It's good. Very good!

482
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:29,934
Good. Good. How are all of you?
Good? Good?

483
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,602
- How are you, Don Pablo?
- Good.

484
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:33,104
- It's him.
- How are you?

485
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:34,688
- In the flesh?
- And you, son?

486
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:38,192
- Good?
- Boss, we should get going.

487
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:40,986
Let them see me. Let them see me.

488
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:42,947
I never thought I'd meet you in person.

489
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:44,782
Ma'am, how are you?

490
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:48,411
- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

491
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,456
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

492
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:55,501
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

493
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:57,920
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

494
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:01,215
For you, Ma'am.

495
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,092
For you too, sir.

496
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:15,729
(Line ringing)

497
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:20,526
(Screeching)

498
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:30,202
- (Steve sighs)
- Seriously? Directly in front of me?

499
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,955
I don'<i>t</i> spend enough time
looking at your face?

500
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:36,584
That's better.

501
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:42,173
(In Spanish) There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

502
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:46,594
(In English) Nothing?

503
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,474
You picked up
the "American" part, right?

504
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:54,643
Murphy!

505
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:58,481
- (In Spanish) What's wrong, brother?
- Suck my dick, please.

506
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:04,820
- DEA, Agent Peña.
- (Rosa) 'Pay attention.'

507
00:33:05,488 --> 00:33:08,824
I know where you can find
one of Escobar's men.

508
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,202
'Oh, yeah? Which one?'

509
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:14,288
There's a reward, right?

510
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,041
Yes, there's a reward.

511
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:20,211
What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

512
00:33:23,255 --> 00:33:24,632
La Quica.

513
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,802
La Quica?

514
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,931
You know La Quica?

515
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:34,600
'He came to the brothel on 23rd street.'

516
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:37,394
He left with a man in a taxi
and said he would return later.

517
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:40,147
Do you work there?

518
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:44,777
'Yes.'

519
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:46,946
How long ago was this?

520
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:50,491
A couple of hours ago.

521
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:53,327
All right, we'll look into it.

522
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:58,749
- (In English) You think it's legit?
- Let's find out.

523
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,931
How credible is your source?

524
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:17,601
(Javier) An unsolicited phone call.
She asked to speak to an American.

525
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:19,645
We just need a couple of cars
and a few men.

526
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,773
(Pinzón) My men are either busy here
or outside in the street.

527
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:25,985
And I'm not relocating men
to chase down bullshit tips.

528
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,154
If this turns out not to be bullshit,
La Quica could give us Pablo.

529
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:33,409
(Pinzón)
So go. Go ahead.

530
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:36,412
Since when do you need an excuse
to go to a whorehouse?

531
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:41,458
(In Spanish)
It'd be worth investigating, Colonel.

532
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,460
We're not asking for a lot.

533
00:34:49,383 --> 00:34:51,302
(In English)
One vehicle, three men.

534
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:52,636
<i>Gracias.</i>

535
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:58,142
(Door opens, closes)

536
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:02,021
(Berna over phone, in Spanish)
'Did you close the lab?'

537
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:03,897
Jesus Christ.

538
00:35:04,023 --> 00:35:07,359
No, Berna, and I won'<i>t</i>
because it's not necessary.

539
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:11,989
- Listen to me, Jaime...
- 'No, you listen to me. Enough of this.'

540
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:14,366
I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, all right?

541
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:16,869
He's with us. He supports us.

542
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:19,455
Everything's good.
What more could we want?

543
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,791
I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

544
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,001
'Pay attention to me.

545
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:27,713
'First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo killed Kiko, right?

546
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,466
Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

547
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:32,176
means a bullet in the head.

548
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:36,597
And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security...

549
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:37,973
What?

550
00:35:38,098 --> 00:35:41,310
So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

551
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:44,229
'Don'<i>t</i> be an idiot.
How else would they get here?'

552
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,441
Jaime, listen to me.

553
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:50,736
Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

554
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,946
Listen to me, Berna!
Stop with the paranoia!

555
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:54,740
(Gunshots and screaming)

556
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:56,825
(Berna)
'Jaime! Get out now!'

557
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,869
- Now!
- Come play, motherfuckers!

558
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,665
'Jaime! Jaime!'

559
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,916
Get out now!

560
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:10,547
What's going on, Ricardo?

561
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,468
You're fucking up, man.

562
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:17,638
Ricardo, put the gun down, brother.

563
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:21,141
Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak, brother.

564
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,185
You know this.

565
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,646
The city's filled with cops.

566
00:36:27,022 --> 00:36:29,024
Pablo can'<i>t</i> move, brother.

567
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,777
Ricardo, put the gun down.

568
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:40,285
Hello, Jaime.

569
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:41,453
(Phone rings)

570
00:36:42,454 --> 00:36:43,622
Jaime.

571
00:36:43,747 --> 00:36:46,959
- (Pablo) 'Berna, how have you been?'
- Who's this?

572
00:36:47,084 --> 00:36:51,964
This is Pablo speaking. I imagine
you want to talk to Jaime, right?

573
00:36:55,008 --> 00:36:56,510
Berna, help me, man.

574
00:36:56,635 --> 00:37:00,431
Berna, talk to Pablo.
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!

575
00:37:00,556 --> 00:37:01,932
Pablo, no! Wait!

576
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:05,978
(Sighs)

577
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:11,984
And now, you bastard...

578
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:17,489
we're coming after you
and that bitch you protect.

579
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:20,826
Pablo, you've just made
the biggest mistake.

580
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:22,661
'Tell the others...'

581
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:25,122
Who is it?

582
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:29,460
<i>...that</i> Pablo Escobar is to be respected,

583
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:31,211
motherfucker.

584
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:39,928
(Judy) 'Son of a bitch!
His whole family, you hear?'

585
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:43,015
I want everyone
in his fucking family dead!

586
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,392
- That fat fuck!
- (Glass shatters)

587
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:48,312
(Screaming) Son of a bitch!

588
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,856
- (Sobbing)
- Listen, Judy...

589
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:56,487
I'm very sorry about Jaime,
and about all of these deaths.

590
00:37:57,029 --> 00:38:00,157
We have to accept
that we lost this time.

591
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:04,953
But you know what?
I'll be with you until the end.

592
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:09,249
And if you want to go head on
against Pablo, just say so.

593
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:15,172
We'll find strong allies. And people.
We'll need a lot of people.

594
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:18,592
(Sobs) Yes.

595
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:26,642
(Gasps, exhales)

596
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:28,018
You're right.

597
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:32,105
(Sniffles) Yes.

598
00:38:35,317 --> 00:38:38,320
I think we have to see things
for what they are.

599
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:40,739
The truth, just as it is.

600
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:44,243
And this is the truth, Berna:

601
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:49,081
I know of someone who's very powerful.

602
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:53,418
Someone who wants to kill Pablo
as much as I do.

603
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:06,682
(Javier speaks English) Alleys run
along the house here... and here.

604
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:09,518
We'll keep the other car
waiting around back.

605
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:13,188
- (In Spanish) You sure it's not a trap?
- I'm not sure of anything.

606
00:39:13,313 --> 00:39:15,983
(Phone beeping)

607
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,114
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's me.

608
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,074
Hey, honey. Um...

609
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:27,619
(Softly) I'm in the middle
of something. I'll call you right back.

610
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,371
We're at the airport.

611
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:32,165
You're where?

612
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,417
'I can'<i>t</i> do this.

613
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:36,879
'I'm taking Olivia
and we're going back to Miami.'

614
00:39:37,004 --> 00:39:39,047
(Softly) No, no, no.
Listen to me, please.

615
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:41,174
You can'<i>t</i> just do it like this.
You can't.

616
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,970
My sister's offered to help us out for
a while, so we'll be there if you need us.

617
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:46,889
- Honey...
- 'It's not right, Steve.'

618
00:39:47,014 --> 00:39:49,516
To keep Olivia here
with everything that's going on.

619
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,101
I can take her someplace safe.

620
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:55,105
You're safe in Bogotá. You're right
beside the goddamn fuckin' embassy.

621
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,065
- Look, I have to go.
- 'Connie, please.'

622
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,610
We can talk about this.
Do not get on that airplane.

623
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:01,820
Wait, OK?
I'll be right there. I'm on my way.

624
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:04,531
- I'm sorry.

Hey, hey, hey. I'm here. OK?

626
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:13,957
- She's at the airport.
- Go.

627
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:17,377
I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Guys, sorry.

628
00:40:18,837 --> 00:40:20,130
(Javier) All right.

(Indistinct chatter in Spanish)

630
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:55,832
Hello, Fernando.

631
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,089
You did very well, sister.

632
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:05,926
Look... you don'<i>t</i> just get two,
you get three.

633
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:13,475
You have a special talent. That's why
you get not only two, but three greens.

634
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:24,027
What are you doing tonight, sweetie?
I know of a nice calm place.

635
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:26,446
We could have fun.

636
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:30,951
I can'<i>t.</i> I have to take care
of my daughter.

637
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:38,125
- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limón.
- All right, brother.

638
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,294
I'm going to fuck one of them.
(Grunts)

639
00:41:44,423 --> 00:41:45,674
(La Quica) Sweetie...

640
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:49,261
Thank you, Maritza.

641

643

Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

644
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:32,721
- (In English) Flight to Miami.
- Gate 39, <i>but...</i> Sir, you can'<i>t</i> go. Sir!

645
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:35,557
- I'm DEA. I need to get on this flight.
- I'm sorry, sir...

646
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:37,601
But the plane has already left.

647
00:42:42,064 --> 00:42:43,899
Sir, please. You can'<i>t</i> be here.

648
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:45,817
Sir!

649
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:54,951
(Javier speaks Spanish) Right here,
to the right. It's the next right.

650
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:57,454
Know the area well, don'<i>t</i> you, Peña?

651
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:59,414
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:01,249
(In English)
Just fuckin' drive.

659
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:33,365
(Whispers) Enjoy.

660
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:45,544
- Get you feeling pretty good?
- Huh?

661
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:49,422
Oh, fuck. Thanks, man. Shit.

662
00:43:49,548 --> 00:43:51,716
(Laughs) Phew!

663
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:55,053
You wouldn't imagine
what a kilo of that stuff cost.

664
00:43:56,304 --> 00:43:57,472
Come on.

665
00:43:57,597 --> 00:44:00,350
- How about you, golden boy?
- What you talking about, man?

666
00:44:01,184 --> 00:44:03,854
Time it's processed, shipped,

667
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:09,943
distributed to your buddies <i>on...</i>
the Upper East Side? Yeah.

668
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:13,446
Hey, man, we don't need
any problems here. We cool?

669
00:44:21,037 --> 00:44:22,372
Six.

670
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:24,875
Lives.

671
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,961
That's how much it cost.

672
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:29,754
What do you think about that?

673
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,300
That was six people.
Six people were murdered

674
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:37,137
every time you
and your buddy over there...

675
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:40,682
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah?

There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.

(Man speaks Spanish)
Calm down! Calm down!

685

OK, let's go.

686

Brother!

Goddammit. What?

693
00:46:06,643 --> 00:46:08,728
- Quica! Quica!
- What's the problem?

694
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,605
Let's go, brother. Hurry up!

695

(Clattering above)

699

They're cops, brother!
Run, you faggot!

700
00:46:59,988 --> 00:47:01,614
That way.

701
00:47:38,234 --> 00:47:41,237
Stop looking.
This is the best place to eat.

703

(Fernando speaks Spanish)
'The situation is <i>that...'</i>

706
00:47:58,004 --> 00:48:02,634
your escape has left us without...
We don'<i>t</i> have a lot of options.

707
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:05,553
If I hadn't escaped,
they'd have killed me, Fernando.

708
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:09,641
Or I'd rot in an American jail.

709
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:13,353
You will tell Gaviria...

710
00:48:13,478 --> 00:48:16,606
Gaviria is being crucified
by the media.

711

I don'<i>t</i> think it's a good time.

712
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:26,032
You will tell Gaviria...

713
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:35,708
I'm willing to go back to La Catedral
to finish my sentence.

714

As you wish.

- No, no, no, brother.

leave for tomorrow
what we can do today. Right?

Mr President,
Mr Fernando Duque is on the line.

720
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:11,035
- I don'<i>t</i> have anything to say to him.
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.

Mr Duque.

- Eduardo Sandoval speaking.
- 'Mr Vice Minister,'

723
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:20,086
I have an important
message from Mr Escobar.

724
00:49:21,546 --> 00:49:26,968
He says he's willing to negotiate the
conditions for his return to La Catedral.

725
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:31,306
Turn on the television.

726
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:42,275
- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the TV.

This peace is now threatened

Escobar has been named
the bloodiest narcoterrorist of all time.
