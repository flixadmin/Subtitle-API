00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,679
He says the guy's
holed up there.

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,119
How much is this gonna cost me?

165
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,316
Just do your job.

166
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,154
Get the bastard.

167
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,395
Did you really think I could've
murdered all those people?

168
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,114
I don't know.

169
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,153
I guess I deserve that.

170
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
BULLOCK (over radio):
Jim.

171
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Jim.

172
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Jim, you read me?

173
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah.

174
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,955
We got a problem.

175
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,955
On my way.

176
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,990
(door opens, closes)

177
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,950
Oswald?

178
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,554
What are you doing here?

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,517
Jim, it has become
woefully apparent

180
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,240
that you are outmanned,

181
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,875
outgunned
and out of options.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,275
So I'm here to help.

183
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
That's generous of you.

184
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,638
(laughs):
I'm just getting started.

185
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,110
BULLOCK:
Well.

186
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,995
Ain't you just Saint Nick
on a Christmas morning?

187
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,670
Don't be shy. Go.
Take all you can carry.

188
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,837
I'm guessing
there are strings attached?

189
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,836
No strings.

190
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,594
Save for the one
that we will cinch

191
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,433
around the neck
of the Haven bomber.

192
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,311
I lost people, too, Jim.

193
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,475
People you lured with promises
of safety and security,

194
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,354
only to have them incinerated.

195
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,434
But let's just hold that
in abeyance for the moment.

196
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,272
I would rather we put aside
our considerable differences,

197
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,919
and go get the people
some justice.

198
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,920
What do you say, partner?

199
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,589
(sighs)

200
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,996
Apparently,

201
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,912
I've been on a trip,
or I'm going on one.

202
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,078
I've also left myself a message.

203
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,798
"In A-T number 1215 knows."

204
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,952
In... nate?

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,114
In... grate? Inflate?

206
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,995
In... mate?

207
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,193
"Inmate number 1215 knows."

208
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,960
Inmate number 1215 knows!

209
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,519
Knows what?! (groans)

210
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,672
Okay. Okay, think.

211
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,152
Prison records.
Where do I get prison records?

212
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,830
(sighs)

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Right.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,878
♪♪

215
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,559
To hell with Penguin.

216
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,596
Haven wasn't your fault.

217
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,760
I told the people it was safe.

218
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,960
I made them into a target.

219
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Jim, you gave 'em...

220
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:40,039
Don't tell me I gave
'em hope. They're dead.

221
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,960
All right, fan out.

222
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,875
We go building to building,
door to door.

223
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,279
Our source said this is where
we'll find the bomber.

224
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,360
He's here somewhere.

225
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,275
Alvarez, take a squad, grab
the north side of the street.

226
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,511
The rest of you,
cover the south.

227
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,038
To the vile miscreant

228
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,192
who murdered
those innocent Havenites,

229
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,359
you have nowhere to run!

230
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,560
There goes the element
of surprise.

231
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,360
OSWALD:
We will root you out

232
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,273
like the vermin you are!

233
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,031
Two forces united
in one purpose!

234
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
(gunshot)

235
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,197
- Get back! Get back!
- Get down!

236
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,397
GORDON: Elevated position,
back to the sun.

237
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,075
(gun cocks)

238
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,440
BULLOCK: Looks like
we found our guy, huh?

239
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
(gunshot)

240
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,976
We're sitting ducks out here.

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
BULLOCK:
And one Penguin.

242
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,576
Hey, Oswald, why don't you
crawl out there,

243
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,717
grab that bullhorn and tell him
to come down quietly?

244
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
(gunshot)

245
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,394
GORDON: Put your weapons down!
We have the building surrounded.

246
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,632
And we have more ammo than you!

247
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,837
Come out now
with your hands in the air.

248
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,555
MAN:
Pretty cozy up here.

249
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,190
Thanks, guys.

250
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,069
I know that voice.

251
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,150
Zsasz?

252
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,560
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

253
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
(gunshot)

254
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,878
(door creaks)

255
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Oh.

256
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,080
It's impolite to
sneak up on people.

257
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,515
So is breaking
and entering.

258
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,355
Heard you were dead, Ed.

259
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,795
Now what are you looking for?

260
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,915
I am given,
and I am taken.

261
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,039
I was there from
your first breath,

262
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,239
and I will follow you
until your death.

263
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,520
(exhales)
A name.

264
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,076
So...

265
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,039
you're looking for the name
of a prisoner at Blackgate.

266
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,280
Call it a personal matter.

267
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,991
- This folder's quite valuable.
- Right.

268
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,711
What is the going rate
on dust bunnies?

269
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,920
What I mean to say is,
this folder seems to be

270
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,719
quite valuable to you.

271
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
Well...

272
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,616
I'm guessing you
don't want money,

273
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,472
because, uh,
it's worthless.

274
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,752
I don't tend to
carry snacks on me.

275
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,920
And if I had any bullets,

276
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,336
I would just shoot you
and take the folder.

277
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,033
So what is it that
you would like?

278
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,079
Your expertise.

279
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,159
Surely you've noticed

280
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,958
the giant plume of smoke
in the sky?

281
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,032
Someone blew up a building
we were using to house refugees.

282
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
We need to figure out
how they did it,

283
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,271
so we can prevent them
from doing it again.

284
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,633
So, the second smartest man
in Gotham...

285
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,155
needs my help.

286
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,113
Explosives are not my expertise.

287
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,549
Didn't realize you had one.

288
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Hmm.

289
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Just...

290
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Why?

291
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
(exhales)

292
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,080
Do we have a deal or not?

293
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Fine.

294
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,479
- (door opens)
- (sighs)

295
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
(gunshot)

296
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,951
I did not make that building
go boom, Jim.

297
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Oh, please!

298
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,270
You gave up any shred
of honor long ago!

299
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,432
Why should we believe
a snake like you?!

300
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,832
Because I would never take
credit for somebody else's work.

301
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,919
Oh, no, you'd just betray
anyone and everyone

302
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,514
for the right price!

303
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,799
Is this about Sofia Falcone?

304
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,376
Because you should
really move past that.

305
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
It's not healthy.

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
(gunshot)

307
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,719
Oswald, concentrate.

308
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,480
Do you and your men
have enough ammo

309
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,480
to keep Zsasz pinned down
for a couple of minutes?

310
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,149
For you, Jim, let's say...
two and a half.

311
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,512
Concentrate all your fire
on that window up there.

312
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,554
Give me everything you got,
then abruptly cease fire.

313
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,270
You can count on me.

314
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,635
Spread the word.

315
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,160
MAN: All right,
guys, gather around,

316
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,634
we got new orders.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
All right.

318
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Ready?

319
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Yeah.

320
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Now!

321
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,597
Fire!

322
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,399
Keep it coming!

323
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,992
(slurping)

324
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,514
(watch beeping)

325
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Cease fire!

326
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Cease fire!

327
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,670
Cease fire!

328
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,799
Glad to see
you're still with us.

329
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,235
Thank you. Thank you.
You were great.

330
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,560
Glad there's
no hard feelings.

331
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,279
Day's not over yet.
Come on.

332
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,470
Well done, Jim.

333
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,760
We make a hell of a team.

334
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,239
That man is a menace.

335
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,390
Allow me to deal with him.

336
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,070
This is about more than just
your vendetta against Zsasz.

337
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,509
If he did this,
I need to know

338
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,120
if it was a part
of something larger.

339
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,200
My point exactly.

340
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,640
One of the areas
in which I excel

341
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,792
is the loosening
of tongues.

342
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,719
No. He's mine.

343
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,270

346
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,471
SYKES: You're pushing my men
way too hard.

347
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,079
We're not gonna
break through

348
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,878
for at least
a couple more days.

349
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,598
There is absolutely no way
to make it on schedule.

Well, not with <i>that</i> attitude,
you're not.

Now...

353
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,070
everyone...

354
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,871
let's reach inside and dig...

355
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,915
a little deeper, shall we?

356
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,896
'Cause that's the only way

357
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,560
you're all making it out
of this hole.

358
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,559
Come on.
Put this on.

359
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,840

360
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,195

363

Are these all
the recruits?

364
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,832
Well, I thought
you would want quality

365
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
over quantity.

366
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,398
Not everybody can pass
a.38 caliber test of faith.

367
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,069
(gasps)

368
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,276
Yes...

369
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,351
you certainly have
set a very high bar

370
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,193
- for devotion.
- (gasps)

371
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,955
(sighs)

372
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,472
Oh. Almost forgot.

373
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,395
Bruce Wayne
and his sidekick Curls...

374
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,272
Or is <i>he</i> the sidekick?
(giggles)

375
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,030
Anyway, they tried to infiltrate
our little operation here.

376
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,680
- Oh?
- Oh.

377
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,680
And Curls can walk,
really well,

378
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
especially...

379
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,709
for a paraplegic.

380
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,830
Ah. And she wants
to kill you.

381
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,274
A lot, FYI.

382
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,637
If I see her,
I'll give you a shout.

383
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,113
Oh... and kill her.

384
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Mm.

385
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,193
Okay, recruits,

386
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,760
let's do like my daddy did

387
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,879
before my sixth birthday
and move out.

388
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Ed?

389
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,312
The building's superstructure
is largely intact,

390
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,395
which would rule out
C-4 and Semtex.

391
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,551
Evidence of deflagration
would suggest something

392
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,758
with a slower burn rate,
like gunpowder

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
or nitroglycerin.

394
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,880
But for this level
of destruction,

395
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,320
that would require
a bomb that's...

396
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,079
20 cubic feet
of explosive material.

397
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,336
There's no way you could sneak
something that size into the building.

398
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,273
All the entrances were guarded,
which suggests maybe

399
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,079
that this was
an inside job.

400
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Or...

401
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,756
...a classic
locked-room mystery.

402
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,117
Man walks into a room, alone,
and is later found murdered.

403
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,710
There are no windows,
and one door,

404
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,230
which is locked
from the inside.

405
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,917
The killer was already
inside the room.

406
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,317
So, the bomb was already
inside the building?

407
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
No.

408
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,038
The bomb <i>was</i> the building.

409
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
You don't need to
smuggle in explosives

410
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,957
when you can detonate
250 gallons

411
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,077
of highly pressurized
heating oil

412
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,873
that's coursing through
all the floors.

413
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,154
True, but that doesn't
explain this.

414
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,439
Glass?

415
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,840
Presumably from there.

416
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,115
No, there's no
way that that

417
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,999
would blast in
with that explosion.

418
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,400
That would make all of that
glass go out onto the street.

419
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,671
Unless whatever ignited
those heating oil tanks...

420
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,280
BOTH:
Smashed through that window.

421
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Ow.

422
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,434
This is a really nice table.

423
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,758
We got a dozen
witnesses that saw you

424
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,230
walk out of that building
before it went kabooey.

425
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,070
Yeah. I heard some gangs
had taken over.

426
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,239
Figured, with you guys occupied,

427
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,511
I might help myself
to some of your supplies.

428
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
Hey, do you guys have
any canned peaches?

429
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,275
Man, I'd trade an arm and a leg
for that right now.

430
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,951
Not mine, somebody else's.

431
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,552
If you're innocent,
why shoot up

432
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,154
a city block full of cops?

433
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,158
Because it was full of cops,

434
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,358
who were also trying
to shoot me.

435
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,432
And, guys, those were
warning shots. I mean,

436
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,592
if I really wanted
to kill you...

437
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,436
- you'd be dead.
- You got a pen?

438
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,712
I want to write this guy
a thank-you letter.

439
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,713
ZSASZ:
Do the math.

440
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,752
If I blew up a building
full of people,

441
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,316
I would have covered
every inch of my body

442
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,193
in sweet, sweet scars.

443
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,154
You guys want to do
a strip search?

444
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,749
(door opens)

445
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,953
Got Lucius on the horn
for you, Cap.

446
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,836
Stay on him.

447
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,393
I'd let Alvarez do it.

448
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,596
He's handsome.

449
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,114
Lucius, talk to me.

450
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,079
LUCIUS: Haven wasn't
destroyed by a bomb.

451
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,550
It was an RPG, like the one
that took down the chopper.

452
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,279
You sure?

453
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,256
I'm holding what's left of it
in my hand right now.

454
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,680
We found pieces of it
in the rubble.

455
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,816
It was fired through
the basement window,

456
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,399
detonated the fuel oil tank.

457
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,056
And we're still trying
to figure out exactly

458
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,673
which rooftop it was fired from.

459
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,433
- Rooftop?
- LUCIUS: Yes.

460
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,109
The only angle you could
hit this tank from is above.

461
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,359
Our only suspect was
on the ground.

462
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,816
Zsasz was seen
leaving the building

463
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,035
moments before it blew.

464
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,032
Looks like you need
a new suspect.

465
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,358
Jim!
(chuckles)

466
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,631
Ah. I know the
wheels of justice

467
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,871
turn slowly,
so I'm here to provide

468
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,912
- a modicum of grease.
- Oswald,

469
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,839
you need to leave right now.

470
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,191
Still claiming
he's innocent, is he?

471
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,750
Yes. And as much as I hate
to admit it,

472
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,360
the evidence is backing him up.

473
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
What the hell's going on?

474
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,915
Harvey,
according to Lucius,

475
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,077
- Zsasz couldn't have done it.
- (Oswald sighs)

476
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,991
I did not expect you
to go soft, Jim.

477
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
Actually, I did.

478
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:25,518
Which is why I didn't
come alone. (whistles)

Bring me Victor Zsasz.

Torturing...

482
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,080
Torturing Zsasz into confessing
won't give the people justice.

483
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,632
As misguided as he is,

my old friend Jim is correct
in this instance.

Despite our enflamed

489
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,440
MEN:
Yeah!

490
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,193
Good to know who's
really in charge here, Jim.

491
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,279
LUCIUS:
This is it, the exact place

492
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,238
where the RPG was fired.

493
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Impressive.

494
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,840
Calculated the angle
of incident

495
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,958
to follow the trajectory through the window,
into the fuel oil tanks.

496
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
Yep.

497
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,959
That, and the RPG case
is right over there.

498
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,432
So, now we know how it was done;

499
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,636
hopefully this holds
some clues as to who.

500
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,760
I should get this
back to the lab.

501
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,336
Doubtful that someone
who could pull off

502
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,353
such an intricate plot
would forget to wear gloves.

503
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,917
True, but it's all
I've got to go on.

504
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,039
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

505
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,829
I hope so.

506
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,714
I truly hope that you
find whoever did this...

507
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,433
and you make them pay.

508
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,914
As promised.

509
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,834
I appreciate your help, Ed.

510
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,554
Couldn't have done it
without you.

511
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,955
And if you tell anyone
I said that, I will deny it.

512
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,400
"Inmate number 1215.
Frank McCann."

513
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,440
(quietly):
Frank McCann.

514
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,117
Deceased? No!

515
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,276
No! No, you can't be dead!

516
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,992
(shouts) No!

517
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,396
(shouts)

518
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,470
Lucius! Hey!

519
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,117
Di... Did you see
who blew up this building?

520
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,997
Hey! (groans)

521
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,480
Deaf old bat.

522
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,718
Hopefully she's not blind, too.

523
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,799
(excited chatter)

524
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,116
(door opens)

525
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,070
MAN:
There he is.

526
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,436
(chatter continues)

527
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,714
BULLOCK:
I got no love for Zsasz,

528
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,758
but are we really gonna
let this happen?

529
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,720
Look at them, Harvey.

530
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,680
If we try to stop it, they'll
turn that anger against us.

531
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,356
We've got to
do something.

532
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,438
Yeah? Like what?

533
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,118
I make another speech?

534
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,471
Maybe this is what
the people need.

535
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,277
- (gavel bangs)
- Order in the court!

536
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,510
So, um, will I be appointed
a lawyer?

537
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,076
I feel like my rights are
being violated.

538
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,114
Not your right
to remain silent. Bailiff.

539
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,636
No, no, no, no, no...

540
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,315
And where exactly did
you see the defendant

541
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,638
minutes before the explosion?

542
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,759
Coming out of the building.

543
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,718
The very building that
mere moments later

544
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,600
was engulfed in flames
that would claim

545
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,991
so many beloved souls?

546
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,199
(crying)

547
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,238
(quiet chatter)

548
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Are there any other witnesses

549
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:57,216
who can back up
this man's claim? Oh.

550
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,310
- Here.
- Yep. Here.

551
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,278
(chuckles weakly)

552
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,798
Captain Gordon would
have this court believe

553
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,476
that all of you
fine citizens are mistaken.

554
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,478
(crowd exclaiming)

555
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,879
He claims that Mr. Zsasz is not
responsible for the bombing.

556
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,197
(crowd exclaiming)

557
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,469
Captain Gordon, if you would
like to say something,

558
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,949
now is the time.

559
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,237
(overlapping chatter)

560
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,760
MAN:
Tell us something.

561
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,918
♪♪

562
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,920
It wasn't a bomb.

563
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,600
(crowd exclaiming)

564
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,080
GORDON:
It wasn't a bomb.

565
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,152
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

566
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,115
A rocket-propelled grenade,
fired from a rooftop.

567
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,276
If Zsasz was on the ground,
as your witnesses claim,

568
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,799
he couldn't have done it.

569
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,398
I know you all want justice.

570
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,469
So do I.

571
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,756
You're angry.

572
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,075
You're scared.

573
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,432
For months now, you've
been hearing me say

574
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,200
help is coming.

575
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,677
Truth is, we may be on our own.

576
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,399
And if that's true,

577
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,992
what we do now is
more important than ever.

578
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,030
This...

579
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,758
This is not justice.

580
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,032
This is not justice.

581
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,719
It's not who we are.

582
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,639
I'll consider that

583
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,393
your closing argument.

584
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,034
Now that the defense has rested,
let's put it to the crowd.

585
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,234
What say you, jury?

586
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,353
CROWD:
Guilty!

587
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,756
(overlapping shouting)

588
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,834
(chanting):
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

589
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,437
(chanting continues)

590
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,396
(cheering, shouting)

591
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,390
(gavel banging)

592
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,839
By the power vested in me

593
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,960
by... well, me,

594
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,236
I sentence you,
Victor Zsasz,

595
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,030
to die.

596
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,040
Any last words?

597
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,911
(muffled mumbling)

598
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,870
Well said.

599
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,430
- (people screaming)
- Get him out of there.

600
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,955
Overruled!

601
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,676
What the hell are you doing?!

602
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,150
Trying to keep you all
from making a terrible mistake.

603
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,320
OSWALD:
See?

604
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:39,272
Jim Gordon cares more
about protecting a murderer

605
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,512
than he does
about protecting you!

606
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,674
You've lost them, Jim.

607
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,598
They don't believe in you
anymore.

608
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,154
They're mine now.

609
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,359
BULLOCK:
I got to be honest, Jim,

610
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,159
I don't know how safe
Zsasz will be at the GCPD.

611
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
There's more than a few cops
that want to see him on a slab.

612
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,160
GORDON: That's why
we're not taking him there.

613
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,991
Wait. Tell me this is not
a catch and release.

614
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,039
What choice do I have?
Either I let him go,

615
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,392
or he's dead
for something he didn't do.

616
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Thank you, Jim.

617
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,310
I'm not doing this
for you.

618
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,710
Of course not.

619
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,914
This city will never be
what you want it to be, Jim.

620
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,273
It's always gonna belong
to the bad guys, like me.

621
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,759
Give him your gun, Harvey.

622
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,479
What?

623
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,880
Yeah. What?

624
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,954
Give him your gun.

625
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,359
Jim.

626
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,920
- Do it!
- ZSASZ: You got a death wish, Jim?

627
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
'Cause I'll kill you.

628
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Harvey, too.

629
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Maybe.

630
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,349
Maybe I'm just tired
of listening to you, Victor.

631
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,870
Do it.

632
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,719
You know what? You seem tired.

633
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Maybe we should
do this

634
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,359
another day, yeah?

635
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,634
People like you are always
trying to own this city.

636
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,680
But you never will.

637
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,076
Now get the hell out of my face.

638
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,320
See you around, Jim.

639
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,710
A shoot-out?

640
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,896
- Are you serious?
- What? I could've taken him.

641
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,912
That's not the
point. Never...

642
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,440
ever ask me to do anything
like that again.

643
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,233
Pull yourself together.

644
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,077
(grunting, screaming)

645
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:54,278
You see, a river cuts through
rock not because of its power,

646
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,114
but because of its persistence.

647
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,479
So what do we do
when we feel like giving up?

648
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,233
WORKERS:
Dig a little deeper.

649
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,031
And what do we do when we can't
possibly go on any longer?

650
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,112
WORKERS:
Dig a little deeper.

651
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,634
And what do we...

652
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
SELINA:
Deep enough?

653
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:16,838
(gasping)

654
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,197
(grunting)

655
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,394
(straining):
Well, Selina,

656
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,035
I must say...

657
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
(gasps)

658
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,959
Don't say anything.

659
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,950
- (shouts)
- BRUCE: Selina!

660
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,600
- Selina!
- Let me go!

661
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,632
BRUCE:
It's done! It's over.

662
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,400
MAN (distant):
Jeremiah!

663
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,719
We need to get
out of here, now.

664
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,758
(people shouting, coughing)

665
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,430
(Nygma panting)

666
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,635
I hate stairs.

667
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,033
Oh, God.

668
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,674
(wheels squeaking)

669
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,719
(gasps)
Oh, no! Go away!

670
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,918
No... hey, wait.
I need to know what you know.

671
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,558
Oh, please. Oh, oh,
please don't hurt me.

672
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,599
Listen, lady, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

673
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,799
I just want to know
what you saw.

674
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,797
Uh, uh, the-the roof.

675
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,713
You, you were on the roof.

676
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,435
And you had
some kind of a, uh,

677
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,559
you had some kind of a,
of a rocket.

678
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,039
Mm.

679
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,360
That's, that's not possible.

680
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,037
Uh, and-and you shot it
at-at-at that building.

681
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Oh!

682
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,398
♪♪

683
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,238
(rapid beeping)

684
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,080
(panting)

685
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Oh!

686
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,755
Oh, I'm sorry.

687
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,430
I promise,

688
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,471
I won't tell anybody.

689
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,479
I know you won't.

690
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,795
You said you wouldn't hurt me.

691
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
I'm really very sorry.

692
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,192
Oh, no! Oh, no!
(screaming)

693
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,192
(car alarm blaring)

694
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,919
(siren wailing in distance)

695
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,040
BARBARA:
Spotlight's off.

696
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,119
You forget to pay
the electric bill?

697
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,520
What do you want, Barbara?

698
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,355
Same as you.

699
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,993
To protect my people.

700
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,751
Your tip didn't pan out.

701
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,079
Well, I've got another one.

702
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,236
A lead on a guy selling RPGs.

703
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,360
He moves about, but...

704
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,516
That all?

705
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,880
I heard some of your people
went over to Penguin.

706
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
Yeah.

707
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,519
Well, you can't
win them all.

708
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,800
Poor Jim.

709
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,513
All alone again.

710
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,159
Get out of here, Barbara.

711
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,791
No one knows
what it's like to be him.

712
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,237
To carry the weight.

713
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,953
I told you to leave.

714
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,474
I heard you.
