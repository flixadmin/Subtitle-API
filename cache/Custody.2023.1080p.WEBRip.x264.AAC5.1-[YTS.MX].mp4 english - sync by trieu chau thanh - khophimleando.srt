1
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,640
-Honey!
-Mom?

2
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,520
Do you remember everything
you have learnt?

3
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,470
Yes, I do.

4
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,680
Do well in the exam.
-Okay.

5
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,470
By the time you come back in the evening,
your dad would bring you a big cake.

6
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,350
-But you should do your exam well.
-Okay, mom.

7
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,640
Happy birthday!
-Give your friends some chocolates, dear.

8
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,850
Happy birthday!

9
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,430
Happy birthday!
-Thank you very much.

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,810
Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

11
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,100
Hey, the bus is here.
-Happy birthday!

12
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,180
Give your other friends in the bus, okay?
-Okay, mom.

13
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,520
Bye, dear.
-Bye!

14
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,560
Bye! Bye!

15
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,100
Bye!
-Bye!

16
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,680
[all]: Happy birthday to you!

17
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,850
-Put some sambar!
-Come! Come on!

18
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,970
Come!

19
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,020
Sir, buy at least one, sir.

20
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,520
My baby is hungry and crying.

21
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,560
Okay, give me one.

22
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Hey!

23
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,270
Watch out for the baby!

24
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,100
Hey!

25
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,770
At the Morampudi junction near Rajahmundry,

26
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,720
toxic gas caught fire in a drainage
leading to a serious accident.

27
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,430
On behalf of the Opposition,
we strongly condemn this mishap.

28
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,640
This is an unforeseen accident.

29
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,720
I announce ex-gratia for the deceased.

30
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,470
The Hyderabad High Court has ordered
the government to hand over this case to CBI.

31
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,560
To consider this as a special case
and initiate fast track investigation,

32
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,640
…High Court also instructed the CBI.

33
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,770
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

34
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,430
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

35
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,390
Samaikyata Party’s Mahanadu
was a great success.

36
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,220
It witnessed large attendance of party
activists from all over the state.

37
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,560
Chief Minister Dakshayani is overjoyed
with the success of Mahanadu.

38
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
CM has stated that Mahanadu
has doubled her enthusiasm.

39
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,890
She expressed her gratitude to the
party activists who made it happen.

40
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,270
CM’s convoy has started.

41
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,180
Stall the public.
Set up barricades!

42
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,390
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

43
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,430
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

44
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,310
Side! Side!

45
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

46
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,850
Move! Move!

47
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,430
Give way!

48
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,600
Give way!

49
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,890
Hey! CM, man!

50
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:27,850
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

51
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,020
Hey! Move!

52
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
Come! Come!

53
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,930
Come on!
-Hey, stop! CM, man!

54
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,100
-Sir…
-Hey!

55
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,470
What are you doing?
-Ambulance!

56
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,180
Hey! How can you disrupt the convoy
for an ambulance?

57
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,850
Sir, when an ambulance comes through,
the way must be cleared, sir!

58
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,930
-Hey! CM, man!
-Sir, it’s a life, sir!

59
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,600
Hey!
-Sir, it’s little girl, sir.

60
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,640
She is covered in blood.

61
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,220
So, would you stop the CM’s car?

62
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,390
Ma’am…

63
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,850
Tell me.

64
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,680
Will you stop the CM’s car for that?

65
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,020
No, ma’am. Sorry.

66
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,220
You should stop.

67
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,430
CM’s life is never above
the life of a citizen.

68
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,100
Before blocking the road, don’t you check
if there are any emergency vehicles stuck?

69
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,100
Sorry, ma’am.

70
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,310
Check the girl’s condition
and keep me updated.

71
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,310
Okay, ma’am.

72
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,310
A SHIVA

73
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,220
Shiva?

74
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,890
Yes, ma’am.
Constable Shiva, Sakinetipalli.

75
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Good job, Shiva.

76
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
What you did is right.

77
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,390
You, me, and everyone else is here
to serve the public.

78
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,600
If it’s going to help the public,
don’t think twice to confront anyone.

79
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,220
Be it the CM or the PM.

80
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,180
Don’t worry. Hmm?

81
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,220
Hmm. Good.

82
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,220
“Head up high”

83
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,060
“Looking fly”

84
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,220
“Got the feel that
the world is mine”

85
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,220
“From the street
Dreaming big”

86
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,810
“Aint no longer dreaming
This legit!”

87
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,930
“For safety and security
it’s a symbol, this khaki”

88
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,430
“Even in mufti
my power knows no bounds”

89
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,850
“On duty round the clock
I am too smart to handle”

90
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,680
“A journey with lathi
Such a life is so lucky”

91
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,390
“Rose filled felicitations
For every day common service”

92
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,810
“Not needed, not at all needed”

93
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,270
“Patting my back when says the public
well-done or bravo”

94
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,600
“That will do
to keep me happy all through”

95
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,220
“Peace mantra is our slogan”

96
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,930
“We gel with the public in a jolly way”

97
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,220
“Giving up sleep, we stand guard”

98
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,470
“Your safety is our responsibility
that’s what we say”

99
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,310
“No matter what problems
Beckon us snapping their fingers”

100
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,220
“Like Lord Vishnu
we appear to say hello”

101
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,310
“No matter what time at night
there is a disturbance or fight”

102
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,680
“With wheels for our shoes
We say let’s go”

103
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,890
“It does exist
but never comes in our family time”

104
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,890
“The first wife of course
is what we wear as uniform!”

105
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,470
“This is every policeman’s life
same to same”

106
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,890
“We find no difficulty too hard”

107
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,220

115
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,600

116
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,270
“Aint no longer dreaming
This legit!”

117
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,220
Hey! Ouch!

118
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,640
Oh god! Wait!

119
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,220
I will come back and deal with you.

120
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,390
Sorry…sorry… sorry.

121
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,430
What sorry?

122
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,220
No. I mean, she is a lady driver.
She is just beginning to learn. Sorry.

123
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
What if she is a lady?
You think you can do anything and get away?

124
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,600
Brother! Do you know
what I would do if I were in your place?

125
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,060
What would you do?

126
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,600
I would say ‘It’s okay. It happens.’

127
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,310
And then leave.

128
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,680
Hey! You made a dent in my car.

129
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,850
And you are picking a fight with ladies.

130
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,270
If I demand money from you now,
would you pay?

131
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,220
Mm hmm.

132
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,600
No.
-No? Then go.

133
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,930
Hey, what are you watching?

134
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,560
Get going! Move!

135
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,220
Super, baby.
-Who is super baby?

136
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,310
How many times should I tell you
not to let go of the clutch all of a sudden?

137
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,220
The traffic is too heavy.
I am scared.

138
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,220
Oh! Do you want a national holiday
because you are driving?

139
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,430
Start the vehicle.

140
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Change the gear.

141
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,930
What’s wrong this time?

142
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,520
I was asked to stop.

143
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,600
Who?

144
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,930
Thanks, madam.

145
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,970
Don’t call me, madam.
-Then?

146
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,930
Just Julie.

147
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,930
Is that important now?

148
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,100
Why did you get in as if
this were your own car?

149
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,390
Get down!

150
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,520
I waved my hand and Julie stopped the car.
So, I got in.

151
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,180
Stop bluffing.
I was just teaching her how to apply brake.

152
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,520
Really?

153
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,930
Then teach her how to offer lift.
That’s one job done.

154
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,430
You carry on, Julie. Let’s go.
-Okay!

155
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,890
Look to your right.

156
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,270
Huh?
-There’s a car coming.

157
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,890
Hey! What is this box?

158
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,180
What have you brought?

159
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,270
Hey, lemon rice!

160
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,270
I am really hungry.
Is this fresh rice or left over rice?

161
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,930
-Why do you hit me?
-Baby, don’t fight.

162
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,930
Give it to me!

163
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,930
What are you both doing?
-Nothing.

164
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,520
She is trying to show you how to drive
with a scuffle going on in the car.

165
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,970
That’s all. Carry on, Julie.
-Hey!

166
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,890
Why are you acting smart?
How long should I wait for you?

167
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,140
What is your problem now?

168
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,520
What is my problem?

169
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,890
When did you promise to come back
before you left town?

170
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,390
Hey, they deputed me for just a day.

171
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,270
But the CM insisted I stayed there.

172
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,720
Oh!
-That’s why…

173
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,930
Just because the CM praised you,
you think you are superhuman?

174
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,890
And forget me?

175
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,770
-Hey! Don’t try to act funny.
-Hey…

176
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,520
How many days should I wait for you?

177
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,970
Why couldn’t you make a call?

178
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,100
-Baby!
-You have forgotten me.

179
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,600
Why would I?
-Don’t lie!

180
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,890
And why would I lie to you?
-Oh!

181
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,390
So, you two are lovers!

182
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,180
Not lovers, Julie.

183
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,970
Okay, okay, okay.
-Just friends.

184
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,270
Keep your eyes on the road.

185
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,970
Your class is over. Stop the car.
-Hey, careful!

186
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,100
Hey!
-Okay, okay!

187
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,180
Stop to the side!

188
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,810
Your class is over.
You can go.

189
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,310
There’s still half on hour left, baby.

190
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,770
Enough for today. Leave now.

191
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,270
Will you cover the rest tomorrow?

192
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
Tomorrow is your day off.

193
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,930
But I am coming tomorrow, baby.

194
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,770
It’s my day off tomorrow.
Go now!

195
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,930
But why?

196
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,600
It’s my match tomorrow.
-Hey!

197
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,270
You didn’t tell me!

198
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,310
Congratulations!

199
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,180
Who did you say it was?

200
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,350
It’s me!

201
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,430
Love?
-Hmm.

202
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,430
Love between our school senior
and this driving school?

203
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,930
Exactly.

204
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,930
Oho!

205
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,930
I went there to escape
my wedding torture at home

206
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,930
but he torments me
with his love proposal.

207
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,140
Too much of torture!

208
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,770
Enough for both.

209
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,720
Did you tell him about us?

210
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,930
That’s not a problem.

211
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,270
I don’t care for such things.

212
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,930
I am very open.

213
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,930
I have no doors!

214
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,180
How is it a problem for him?

215
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,520
It’s a problem for us.

216
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,930
You should have whacked that idiot.

217
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,930
Revathi loves Karthik.

218
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,350
But…

219
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,640
discovering Mohan’s pure love for her,
she lived happily ever after with?

220
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,430
Mohan. Of course,
Karthik was dead.

221
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,810
But in our story…

222
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,390
You never know!

223
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,350
Hey, hey, hey!
What was he trying to say?

224
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,930
He was talking about the film ‘Mouna Ragam'.

225
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,180
Ignore that.

226
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
He said he will speak to my dad.

227
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,600
He knows my dad well.

228
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,100
That’s why please come and talk to my dad.

229
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,140
Please.
-Hey, are you nuts?

230
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,100
He tells you something
and you believe it.

231
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,140
Anyway, my SI exam date is declared.

232
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,930
I will meet him after the exam.

233
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,720
What was it, sweetheart?
SI exam?

234
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,100
First you said you must find a job.

235
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,140
Then you said wait until you took charge.

236
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,810
Now you talk about becoming an SI.

237
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,220
I can’t wait till you become
the President of India.

238
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,140
Hey, I have no issue talking to your dad.

239
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,140
But don’t you know your dad?

240
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,520
The moment I face him,
he brings up assets, status, caste, creed…

241
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,180
Hey! What is it?

242
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,390
Who are you marrying?
Me, right?

243
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,560
I tell you this.
Come and talk to my family.

244
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,770
Hey, please.

245
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,140
Please.

246
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,100
Hello, sir!

247
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,720
-Hello, Shiva! When did you come?
-Just now, sir.

248
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,140
I heard you had stopped the very CM’s car?

249
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,350
Shiva! It’s in the paper.
Along with your name!

250
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,640
-Not so much, sir.
-Super!

251
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,140
I only stopped cars
to clear the ambulance.

252
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,600
But things took a different turn.

253
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,100
The SI asked you to meet him
as soon as you come.

254
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,140
Was expecting.
What does he say?

255
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,140
What, man?
I sent you for CM’s security.

256
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,970
And you stop the CM's car! Huh?

257
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,140
What is this, Shiva?

258
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
What is this?

259
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,470
I sent you for CM’s security.

260
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,310
And you stop HER car?

261
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,140
Every officer who praised you before CM,
is calling me and pulling me up!

262
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,600
‘Can’t you keep your station disciplined?’

263
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,680
Without even knowing the meaning of police,

264
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,970
they find their way into the force
under some quota!

265
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,810
We end up giving explanation
to everyone for all that you do!

266
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,350
Damn!

267
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,850
Hey!

268
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,220
One more complaint against you,

269
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,060
I will directly suspend you.

270
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,350
Go!

271
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,140
Stop.

272
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,970
Is this the time to report to duty?

273
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,850
I will mark your leave. Go.

274
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,930
-Please mark leave for tomorrow also.
-What?

275
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,930
My uncle is in a serious condition.

276
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,220
Serious?
-Seriously, bro.

277
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,470
That’s why these success celebrations
must go on not for three days…

278
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,810
but for ten days!

279
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,930
Surely, man.

280
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,180
Our CM has praised my son!

281
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,970
Do you know how happy I am?
-Of course!

282
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,600
That’s why this three-day celebration!

283
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,930
Shiva, your name is in the paper.

284
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,470
-You owe us a party.
-Okay, okay.

285
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,970
-Mom! Brother is here.
-Huh?

286
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,560
Neighbour’s evil eye…
Others’ evil eye,

287
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,970
All eyes are on you!

288
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,220
Let everyone’s evil eye be warded off.

289
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,850
I wish they also put your picture
in the paper.

290
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,970
The whole state would have known
how you had stopped the CM and saved a girl.

291
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,350
They publish all kinds of photos
except that.

292
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,680
I will ask them
to put a picture next time, okay?

293
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,970
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

294
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,810
Where is dad?

295
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,970
Shiva is super great.

296
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,390
Dad!

297
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,930
Hey, Shiva!

298
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,430
I love you, Shiva. I love you.
-Hey, great!

299
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,560
Dad!

300
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,390
I have something important to talk.
Please, come in.

301
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,060
If it’s important, it can wait.

302
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,140
Celebration is on going!

303
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,970
Hey, dad! Didn’t I say it’s important?

304
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,810
He is half the reason you are spoiled.
Come inside.

305
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,390
-Okay, let’s go.
-Celebration for three days.

306
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,430
-Hey!
-Huh?

307
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,220
-My son is serious.
-Okay.

308
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,970
-I am going.
-Go, go.

309
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,350
-You don’t drink but wait.
-Okay, I will wait. Okay.

310
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,390
Okay, I will wait.

311
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,390
-Dad…
-Huh?

312
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,810
I don’t know if what I am going to tell you
would make you angry but…

313
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,970
Hey, if you don’t know it yourself,
let’s talk tomorrow.

314
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,970
Dad, dad, dad!
I will tell you.

315
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,640
Sit down.
Sit.

316
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,970
What is the matter?

317
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,350
Hey! Why do you care? Huh?

318
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,020
Why do you interfere
when grownups are talking?

319
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,970
Go into your room!
-Okay, son.

320
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,140
Huh! Dad, dad!
I didn’t mean you, dad.

321
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,970
Sit down, dad.
Please. Only for a minute. Sit.

322
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,810
Okay. What is it now?

323
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,680
Actually… I… went to Bapiraju school
to study, right?

324
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,930
(Sobbing)

325
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:13,970
Sorry, son.

326
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,060
I sent you there because their fee was low.

327
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,970
The problem is not about the fee.
Dad…

328
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,470
If you keep disturbing me halfway,
I lose my flow.

329
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,180
Didn’t you bring me here midway?

330
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,770
Okay, okay, okay.
I will tell you.

331
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,600
The crux of the matter is…

332
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,470
-I…
-You?

333
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,310
My childhood… friend…

334
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,020
Oh! Revathi’s matter?

335
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,470
Revathi?

336
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,680
Revathi?

337
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,220
Revathi.

338
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,470
Who is she?

339
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,180
Dad! Brother has been in love
with a girl since school.

340
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,850
She is a very nice girl.

341
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,810
She is Driving Instructor
in Prem Driving School.

342
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,560
Wait a minute.
-Hey!

343
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,970
-Hey! Where are you going?
-Hey, wait!

344
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,430
That’s okay, son.

345
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,680
You wanted to tell me
something important.

346
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,680
What is that?

347
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,390
Mom, this is the girl.

348
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,970
What made you hesitate so much?

349
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,970
The girl looks like Goddess Lakshmi.

350
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,180
Not that song.

351
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,930
This song.

352
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,350
It’s my song.

353
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,970
Why don’t you let me sing?

354
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,970
Hmm!

355
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,810
“Love at first sight,
that’s how it happened”

356
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,970
“As soon as I set my eyes
I fell for the dainty girl”

357
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,310
“Drops of memories turn into showers”

358
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,140
“Won’t I love to get wet
in childhood memories?”

359
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,850
“Love at first sight,
that’s how it happened”

360
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,310
“As soon as I set my eyes
I fell for the dainty girl”

361
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,350
“Dewy-eyed with pearly teeth
I swooned at that smile”

362
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,680
“Those two plaits with colourful ribbons,

363
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,180
“As they scoop me out with a net,
I stand transfixed”

364
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,180
“She is the schoolmate
and then the soulmate”

365
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,970
“She is the schoolmate
and then the soulmate”

366
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,430
“She is the schoolmate
and then the soulmate”

367
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,850
“She has become a crayon
on the book of my dreams”

368
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,970
“Like a love bird she stayed in college”

369
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:53,060
“And promised me a hundred years
of togetherness”

370
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,020
“When someone like her becomes my wife”

371
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,020
“What other eminence can my favour be?”

372
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,020
“Shall I put you on a
tik-tok, tik-tok flight?”

373
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:44,220
“And show you my love story
on a large screen?”

374
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,970
“The fondness of the princess in palace”

375
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,350
“Shall I sing it for you like
the bewitched gardener?”

376
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,220
“Shall I put you on a
tik-tok, tik-tok flight?”

377
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,970
“And show you my love story
on a large screen?”

378
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,970
Super!

379
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,970
Keep this in the van.

380
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,470
You want to use the same van?

381
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,640
Hey, that’s wrong.
Withdraw your words.

382
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,970
This is Goddess Annapurna who feeds us.

383
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,470
You are super, nephew!
You said it all in a single word.

384
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,430
Your dad had come in the same van
to see your mom.

385
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,970
I asked him the same question.

386
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,060
And then he hit the roof
and preached me for an hour.

387
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,970
Where are you all going?

388
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,970
Huh?

389
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,970
Where are you going?

390
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,970
Dad!

391
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,640
Didn’t brother tell you last night?

392
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,180
Ramireddy’s daughter…

393
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,390
School?

394
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,970
Love…you even said
the song was nice.

395
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,970
Hey, was it you in the song?

396
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,310
Hey…

397
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,970
I took you to every location
and showed you, dad!

398
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,180
Hey!

399
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,430
How many times did I warn you
not to tell me anything when I am drunk?

400
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,350
Damn…

401
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,390
Where are you going anyway?

402
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,430
-Husband!
-Hmm?

403
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,640
Whole of last night we were telling you
we would be going to see the girl for Shiva.

404
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,970
Oh…

405
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,310
Sorry, let me get ready and come.

406
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,180
Ah, please do. Make it fast, dad.

407
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,640
By the way,
where did you see the girl?

408
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,970
Hey, Dharmaraju! You…
-Oh my!

409
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,970
Loker…
-Ah…going. I am going.

410
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,060
In the middle of an engagement…

411
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,810
-Shiva!
-Stop!

412
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,930
What is it, huh?

413
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,430
I am being humiliated
and you simply stand and watch!

414
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
As if you know nothing.

415
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,970
Look!

416
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,770
If it’s all me you want,
walk with me now.

417
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,180
I will take good care of you.

418
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,640
Or if you want your dad and ready to do
whatever he says, then marry that guy.

419
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,970
Leave me alone.

420
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,430
Let’s go.

421
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,350
Hey, do you think you can do anything
because you are a cop?

422
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,140
Why did you go to the temple yesterday and have
an altercation with Mr Reddy about his daughter?

423
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,220
No altercation, sir.

424
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,310
We both are in love.

425
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
I went with my parents to ask
for her hand.

426
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,470
Why did her father come to the station
to file a case?

427
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,970
Look! If I take his complaint
and raise an FIR,

428
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,970
I will have to arrest your entire family.

429
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,220
You know the rules.

430
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,970
See.

431
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,020
I convinced him you won’t go
near his daughter again and sent him away.

432
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,810
How can you tell him that, sir?

433
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,390
Sir, that is my personal issue.

434
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,810
Why are you getting involved?

435
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,970
Did you just say personal?

436
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,390
Shall I write the FIR and arrest you
along with your parents?

437
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,560
Sir!

438
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,970
Please don’t try to sound
as if you have done me a great favour.

439
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,470
I know very well why you support them.

440
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,930
What do you know? Huh?
What is it that you know?

441
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,180
-Don’t slip your tongue….
-Hey, hey…Sir, sir, sir!

442
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,600
Hey, go out now.

443
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,810
Don’t you know
how to talk to higher officials?

444
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,680
Sir, please go in, sir.

445
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,600
I will see.

446
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,470
Shiva, come here.

447
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,970
What was that temper, Shiva?

448
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,020
You were ready to catch him by the collar.

449
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,180
As if you will forget the girl just because
he promised them? Would she leave you? -Sir!

450
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,930
irrespective of who lodges the complaint,
let him take the same action.

451
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,930
How can justice be different
for rich and poor? Huh?

452
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,850
Shiva!
-Huh?

453
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,060
He has already gone inside.
Why do you want to draw him out?

454
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,560
You…
-Huh!

455
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,430
There.
Missed calls are meant only for you.

456
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,600
Go and talk.

457
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,680
Go and talk.

458
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,310
Why are you calling me again and again?
Huh?

459
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,970
Why are you yelling?

460
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,140
I want to talk to you.

461
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,970
I am at the phone booth outside.
Come there.

462
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,930
You spoke enough at the temple.

463
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,180
I have a lot of work now.
I can’t come anywhere. Okay?

464
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,970
I have something very important
to discuss with you. please, come.

465
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,970
Hey! Why don’t you understand?

466
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,970
I have a lot of work. I
cannot come.

467
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,140
Why are you overdoing it?

468
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,180
Are you coming out now
or shall I come in?

469
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,020
Tell me.

470
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,350
Fine, I am coming.

471
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,680
Sir, I will have tea and come.

472
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,020
Okay, okay.

473
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,850
You can have breakfast too.

474
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,970
Sir!

475
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,810
What?

476
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,140
I have left home.

477
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,060
Come. Let’s get married.

478
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,180
Hey!

479
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,970
Didn’t you tell me to walk away with you
dressed as I was?

480
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,930
I came away with nothing except
the churidar on me.

481
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,180
Come, let’s get married.
-Hmm.

482
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,970
You can talk.
Now you talk.

483
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,850
When you were supposed to talk,
you kept mum.

484
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,140
Fine, I accept there were elders
there yesterday.

485
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,970
What did my parents do?

486
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,930
I trusted you and brought them.

487
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,140
Your people were insulting them and…

488
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,390
I had no idea, Shiva.

489
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,640
Ah!

490
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,220
You knew nothing and yet you were there
with makeup and glowing, right?

491
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,850
I dressed up
because your parents were coming.

492
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,930
Who knows?

493
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,770
They proposed going to the temple.

494
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,640
That’s why I asked you
to come and talk.

495
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,970
I had no idea
they were all coming, Shiva.

496
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,770
What is it now?

497
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,470
Hmm?

498
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,180
For the issue created here,

499
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,560
they have arranged
my wedding tomorrow in Tirupati.

500
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,390
Tie the knot with me right now.

501
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,970
Hey! Don’t talk crazy.

502
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,640
Your dad lodged a complaint
against me and my family.

503
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,560
The SI is torturing me using it.

504
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,430
I can’t come anywhere now.

505
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,600
There is no time to think, Shiva.

506
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,970
I cannot live with someone else.

507
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,970
I don’t know what you would do.

508
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,640
But take me away.

509
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,770
Otherwise, I will meet my own fate.

510
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,640
Hey!

511
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,970
Okay.

512
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,430
I will figure out something by tonight.

513
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,020
Hmm?

514
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,060
Where is sir coming from?

515
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,560
I went to have tea.

516
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,180
Hmm. Nukaraju!
-Sir!

517
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,850
You wanted leave for some wedding, right?

518
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,350
You can go.
-The wedding is tomorrow, sir.

519
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,970
I am granting you two days leave.

520
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,220
You can go.
-Okay, sir.

521
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,970
Shiva, start the vehicle.

522
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,600
Did you hear?
Start the vehicle.

523
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,600
Go, go.

524
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,180
Take me to DSP’s office.

525
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,640
Okay, Rangappa. I will take care.

526
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,970
Where were you till now?

527
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,970
I was in class.
What happened?

528
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,180
Nothing. Go in.

529
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,220
Little further down,
take a right at the temple.

530
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,020
I will take care of everything, Mangalam.

531
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,560
Hear me out.
What is it, dear?

532
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,930
Nothing, dad.
-Okay.

533
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,600
Hey, Pinky, come here.
-Yes…

534
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,770
uncle carries the bride
in a basket to the dais.

535
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,390
Shiva!
-Sir!

536
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,600
What are you doing?
Come and start the vehicle.

537
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,810
Revathi, here. Have it.

538
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,180
I will come out and eat.

539
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,850
Not necessary.
Eat right here.

540
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,060
What is happening, mom?

541
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,810
Ask me if you want something.

542
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,140
Uh, Shiva!

543
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,970
You are here throughout the day.
Go to the station and attend to your duty.

544
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,680
Sir!
-What?

545
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,600
You have done nothing today.

546
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,430
You were simply roaming with me.

547
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,640
Huh? Go. Go to the station.

548
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,310
I don’t know what you’d do.

549
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,350
But take me away.

550
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,390
Otherwise, I will meet my own fate.

551
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,970
Where are you, Shiva?

552
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,060
What, Shiva?
Did he have a game?

553
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,180
Sir, has Revathi called?

554
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,470
No. Why?

555
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,680
Sir, she is getting married
tomorrow in Tirupati.

556
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,470
Really?

557
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,390
Sir, if I go to her house alone,

558
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,970
…it would be a problem. Will you come along?
-Mani, sir. Bye. Let’s meet tomorrow.

559
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,560
We will go check on her and come. Please.
-Why won’t I come?

560
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,020
-Let’s go.
-Sir…

561
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,220
SI put me on night duty.

562
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,560
If I go out,
it might be a problem.

563
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,600
Let’s tell him
we were on night rounds.

564
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,680
-Come.
-Sure?

565
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,970
Okay, sir. Let me change and come.
-Okay.

566
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,180
How are you less, Shiva?

567
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,310
If you get a promotion,
you will become an SI.

568
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,560
They don’t want an SI, sir.

569
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,810
They want a rich boy
from the same community.

570
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,350
As if money can make a family!
Crazy people!

571
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,020
Times have changed.

572
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,020
The couple should be happy and not…

573
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,020
Hey!

574
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,140
Sir, sir, Mani sir!

575
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,220
I hope you are not hurt?

576
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,970
I am not.
Check who they are.

577
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
Hey, Raju!

578
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,970
Come without creating an issue.

579
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,600
Hey! Get lost!

580
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,680
Hey! Hey, stop!

581
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,680
Don’t create a problem and come with me.

582
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:30,970
Hey, let go!

583
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,600
Let go! Leave!

584
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,560
How dare you heckle a policeman?
Rogue!

585
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,430
-This does not concern you.
-Hey, let go! Go away!

586
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,140
Hey!

587
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,020
Hey, you better come with me calmly.

588
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,680
Are you going to shoot me?

589
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,970
Hey, I am being kind. Listen to me.
-Hey, gun!

590
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,390
Let go! Let go, man!

591
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,970
Leave the gun!
-Leave it.

592
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,770
Hey! I said leave it.
Hey!

593
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,970
Who are you, man?
-Leave it!

594
00:36:58,970 --> 00:36:59,970
Can’t you hear? Hey!

595
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,970
Mani sir!

596
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,970
Hey!

597
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,430
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop!

598
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,850
Stop!
-Hey! Stop!

599
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,970
-Stop right there.
-Hey, don’t. Don’t shoot.

600
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,640
Hey, I am from CBI. He is an accused.
-Hey, wait!

601
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,600
Police here!
-Don’t shoot.

602
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,970
Whatever you want to discuss,
come to the station and discuss

603
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,180
Come to the station and talk
-Hey, listen to me, drop the gun.

604
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,810
Drop the gun.
-Hey, I asked you to stop.

605
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,770
Hey, hey, hey! I’m CBI. He is the accused.
-Come to the station and talk.

606
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,220
Don’t shoot him.
Hey…Leave him!

607
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,220
Hey, no! Wait!
-Hey…

608
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,310
Hey, what are you doing?

609
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,810
Hey, you! What are you doing?

610
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,770
I am asking you.

611
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,140
Hey! Speak up!

612
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,430
Do you have a match box?

613
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,390
Call for you, madam!
-Who is it?

614
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,930
Raju’s younger brother Ravi

615
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,850
Rajendar is arrested by the CBI, madam.

616
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,180
How?

617
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,180
Hey, eat a nice side dish.

618
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,970
Hello?

619
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,310
Tell me.

620
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,430
What are you saying?

621
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,600
Brother! Police! Run!

622
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,680
Who is it?

623
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,970
I only asked for a side dish.

624
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,560
I have been looking for 44 hours.

625
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,020
For a side dish?

626
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,560
Central Bureau of Investigation.

627
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,680
Hey!

628
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,560
I was drinking in peace!

629
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,220
Drop dead, idiot!

630
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,220
Do you have a matchbox?
-Brother, I don’t have one, brother.

631
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,970
How did you come to the party
without a match box, huh?

632
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,390
Brother…
-Bloody!

633
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,600
Do you have a matchbox?
-Get lost!

634
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,930
Oh, sorry, sorry. It’s ladies.

635
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,680
Do you have a matchbox, boss?

636
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,470
Match box…
-What?

637
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,970
Bidi…
-No.

638
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,350
Bloody….

639
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,140
How do they attend parties
without a matchbox?

640
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,180
Damn!

641
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,970
Who is that?
Who put this in the way again?

642
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,310
Who is that again?

643
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,560
He has come again!

644
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,680
Hey! Drive to the place I tell you.

645
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,220
Ah!

646
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,220
Which area?

647
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,310
Sir, let’s go to the hospital.

648
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,520
-It’s okay, Shiva.
-Hey, listen to me.

649
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,930
I am a CBI officer.
-Hey, stay calm for a while.

650
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,640
Don’t prattle like a madman.

651
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,970
Hello, Mani!
-What CBI?

652
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,720
Let’s move, sir!

653
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,310
Hey, Mani, listen to me.
-We can go to the hospital later.

654
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,810
Hey, hello!
-First inform the SI.

655
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,680
Hey! Don’t shout!

656
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,310
Brother, can you keep watch?
-Hey, I am a CBI…

657
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,390
-I will make a call to the SI. Hey! Shut up!
-Hey, listen to me.

658
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,560
Hey, listen to me. I am a CBI officer, man!
-Hey! Don’t shout!

659
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,310
Let me make a phone call.

660
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,270
If I get stuck here, it will be a problem.
-He is lying, Don’t listen to him.

661
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,310
Hey, shut up!

662
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,680
He gives some aunt’s number
and passes it off for CBI number.

663
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,560
Hey! shut up!
-Don’t listen to him.

664
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,680
This is all because of you. Hey, hello!
-040…23

665
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,560
Hello, excuse me, hello! Hey! Shut up!
-5143…

666
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,310
Shut up!
-You shut up!

667
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,930
Hello?

668
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,140
Sir, Shiva speaking from the station.

669
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,270
Tell me, Shiva.

670
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,270
When Writer Mani
and I were on night rounds,

671
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,180
some two guys clipped us with a car, sir.

672
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,970
Clipped?
I hope no one was injured?

673
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,310
No, sir. No one.

674
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,020
Mani sir had a minor injury.

675
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,390
What did you do with the two?

676
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,560
They are in the lock up, sir.

677
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,310
One says he is from CBI.

678
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,020
The other says he knows the CM.

679
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,310
CM directly?

680
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,390
He doesn’t know MPs and MLAs?

681
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,180
They are heavily drunk.

682
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,310
Shall I write the FIR, sir?
-No.

683
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,770
I will see to it when I come tomorrow.

684
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,310
Take good care of them.
-Okay, sir.

685
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,310
Raju was caught by the CBI.
-When was this, madam?

686
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,020
Just now… 25 minutes ago.

687
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,270
-Where, madam?
-In Sakinetipalli area.

688
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,180
I don’t care what you do.

689
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,810
There should be no problem by morning.

690
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,310
Okay, madam.

691
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,270
-Revathi!
-Huh?

692
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,770
Didn’t I ask you to stay in the room?
Where are you going?

693
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,810
I am going to the washroom.
You want me to do business in the room?

694
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,770
You are getting married tomorrow.

695
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,270
You must drink tonight.

696
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,310
Are you crazy?

697
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,810
The wedding is tomorrow.

698
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,970
And if I sit with you and drink now,
what will Revathi think of me?

699
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,310
She thinks I am a bloody drunkard?

700
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,640
You are a bad influence on society, man.
Just on temp…

701
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,680
Hi!

702
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,310
Sir!
-Tell me, Shiva.

703
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,020
SI sir says he will come tomorrow morning.

704
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,930
He said they should be
in the lock up till then.

705
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:01,810
Okay, Shiva!

706
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,270
I am leaving. I have some work.
Can you take care?

707
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,020
I will take care. Please, go ahead.
-Hey!

708
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,270
Hey!

709
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,310
Don’t go!

710
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,310
Hey, listen to me.

711
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,270
Hey, I am CBI officer.

712
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,970
He is an accused.

713
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,470
I have to present him to the court.

714
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,180
Hey, let me make a call.

715
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,770
It will be a problem
if I get stuck here.

716
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,720
Reserve your stories for the SI tomorrow.

717
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,890
You get drunk and blabber.

718
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,390
Hey! Have you any sense?

719
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,100
You keep saying you will leave?

720
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,930
Are you even a policeman?
-Hey!

721
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,890
When you look into someone’s eyes,
don’t you know if he is a criminal?

722
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,970
Do you know
the number of murders he committed?

723
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,020
He threw a bomb at Kakinada station
and killed an SI.

724
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,930
Look up the old cases if you want.

725
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,350
You will know who Raj is.
-Hey!

726
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,390
it’s not Raj.

727
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,970
Rajuuuu!

728
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,890
Hey, do you understand
what I am saying?

729
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,890
Four years ago, the gas leakage
at Morampudi junction, was not an accident!

730
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,180
He was behind it.

731
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,100
Not just that.

732
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,970
Forty innocent lives were lost in the blast.

733
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:24,890
Do you remember?

734
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,310
He was behind it!

735
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,100
Hey, not his number.

736
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,310
Try the one I gave you.

737
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,020
CM will definitely respond.

738
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,720
Then you will know about Raju.

739
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,520
Hey, this is my higher up, Varghese.

740
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,810
He is my Chief.
Take it.

741
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,470
Call him and let him know
we both are here.

742
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,310
Listen.

743
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:55,310
He should be handed over
to the CBI court in two days.

744
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,930
We shouldn’t be staying here.

745
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,470
Hey, he has the government’s backing.

746
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,770
That’s why I am making a request.

747
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,310
Take this and call up my boss immediately.

748
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,560
Take it.

749
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Please, go. Go.

750
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,100
Krishna! Krishna! Get up!

751
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,970
Hey! Krishna! Get up, son!

752
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,640
Fast!

753
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,310
Wait, wait. You can’t come in.

754
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,720
He is my son, doctor.

755
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,140
He met with an accident.

756
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:37,640
Husband! He is our only son.
-Renu! Renu!

757
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,310
I can’t live without him.
-Don’t worry! Nothing will happen to him.

758
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,310
Hello!

759
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,560
Hello?

760
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,310
Uh, Mr Varghese?

761
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:46,640
Yes?

762
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,560
Do you know any George?

763
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,930
George?

764
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:52,720
Is George with you?

765
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,810
Who are you?

766
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,310
Er…No tension.

767
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,560
I am calling from Sakinetipalli
police station.

768
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,930
George is safe here.

769
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,640
We arrested him in drunk and drive case.

770
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,680
Arrest?

771
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,270
No, no, no!
What is your name?

772
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,180
Shiva. Constable Shiva.

773
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,560
Look here, Shiva.

774
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,640
I am Varghese.
CBI investigative Head.

775
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,520
It is not safe for George there.

776
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,560
Please give the phone to him.
Is Raju with him?

777
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,310
Yes. Raju is also here.

778
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,140
Shiva?

779
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:19,720
Shiva!

780
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,770
Shiva?

781
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,970
I will ask George to call you. Okay?
-Hello…

782
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,310
Hello…

783
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,350
-Shiva!
-Sir!

784
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,390
Tell me, sir.

785
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,140
The two guys hit you with their car?

786
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,680
-Where are they?
-Yes, sir! They are in lock up.

787
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,890
One of them is from CBI.

788
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,180
I have just confirmed.
-Okay, okay.

789
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,310
Sir, they are in lock up.
-Hmm.

790
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:48,930
Hey, SP!

791
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,560
You have come here yourself?

792
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,310
Two minutes.
-Take your time!

793
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,310
Excuse me, sir.
What’s happening here, sir?

794
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,140
Sir, I am a CBI officer, sir.

795
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,520
I have arrested him legally, sir.

796
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,310
If you don’t trust me,
verify with my Chief, sir.

797
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,560
Hey! Hey!

798
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,930
Did you speak to him?
-Softly! Softly.

799
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,970
Don’t shout.

800
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,350
CBI?
-Okay, sir. Yes, sir..

801
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,720
Please!
-Hmm.

802
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,890
Do it, sir. Carry on, sir. Please.

803
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,310
Hey, call Varghese!

804
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,310
-Rangappa!
-Sir?

805
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,470
Vacate everyone.

806
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,930
No one should stay here.
-Okay, sir.

807
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,890
Go!

808
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,140
Constables! All of you leave.
-Gopal and Ramesh!

809
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,270
Subbarao! You also leave.

810
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,310
-What you need to do now…
-Sir, sir! One of them is from CBI.

811
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,680
-I just spoke to his boss.
-Hey!

812
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,350
I know what is to be done.
Go on.

813
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,180
Sir….
-Take him away.

814
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,770
Come, Shiva.
-It’s not that, sir.

815
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,770
His Chief has also confirmed just now.
-No, Shiva. Let’s go. Come.

816
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,310
No, sir. You carry on. I will come.

817
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,520
Shiva, come with us, dear.

818
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,810
You go ahead, sir. I will come.

819
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:36,970
Please, carry on.
-Listen to me, son.

820
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,640
Shiva, this involves bigwigs.

821
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,100
Why do you want to invite headache?
Do you really need this?

822
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,890
Let’s go.
Come, Shiva.

823
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,470
Come, let’s go.

824
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:49,310
Have you reached the location?

825
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,310
Yes, sir.
I’m right here.

826
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,310
Both Raju and the CBI officer are here.

827
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,930
What is the CBI officer saying?

828
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,310
He wants to talk to his superior.

829
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,520
You know what is to be done, right?
-Yes, sir. I know.

830
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,310
Call me once the job is done.
-Okay, sir.

831
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,180
Hey, no one answers the phone!

832
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,560
Rangappa, come here.
-Sir?

833
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,310
Hey!

834
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,020
Hey!

835
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,680
Hey!

836
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,390
Down!

837
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,310
Don’t! Down!

838
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,020
Hey!

839
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,020
Hey!

840
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,770
Shiva!

841
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,970
Why did you shoot me?

842
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,180
Hey! Catch him!

843
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,310
Hey…

844
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,640
Hey!

845
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,560
Hey!

846
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,720
Hey!

847
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,640
Hey!

848
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,520
Hey, stop it!

849
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,930
Hey, Shiva!

850
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,930
Hey, Shiva, wait!
-Hey! Shiva…

851
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,310
Shiva! Don’t interfere into unwanted things.

852
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,470
Listen to me!

853
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,640
You will invite problems.
Listen to me.

854
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,720
Hey, Shiva, wait!

855
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,640
Hey! Hey, wait!
-Sir, what you are doing is wrong.

856
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,310
Shiva, open the gate!

857
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,560
Shiva…

858
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,560
Hey!

859
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,770
Shiva, you are interfering
in the affairs of powerful people.

860
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,270
Open the gate, Shiva.

861
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,180
Hey!

862
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,020
I say this out of concern.

863
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,180
Your entire family will face risk, Shiva!
-Hey, Shiva!

864
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:11,100
Hey, listen to me, man!

865
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,180
Hey, catch him!

866
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,680
Hey!

867
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,890
Shiva!

868
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,310
Shiva! Come, pick up the guns.
-Hmm

869
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,020
Coming, sir!
-Come. Come, fast!

870
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,640
We must go to the hospital. Come.
-Come.Get up!

871
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,140
Come fast.

872
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,270
Let’s go.

873
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,270
Why did you shoot me instead of him?
Bloody hell!

874
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:33,180
Quick! Move!

875
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,890
Hey, Shiva! Take the guns.

876
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,020
Come! Come fast, Shiva!

877
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,810
Come! Make it fast!

878
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,310
Close that gate!

879
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,310
Come fast, Shiva!

880
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,310
There is no time.

881
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,720
Come, Shiva.
Come on!

882
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,350
Come! Come, come!
Come fast.

883
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:04,140
Hi!

884
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:05,770
Hi!

885
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:11,100
I want to talk to you.

886
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,390
Catch!

887
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,770
Yuck. No.

888
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,720
I want to talk to you.
-Oh!

889
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,680
Talk to me?
-Hmm.

890
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,310
Now?
-Yes, now.

891
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,310
Okay!
-Come.

892
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,770
Come over there.
-Okay, okay!

893
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,310
Come.
-Okay!

894
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,470
Revathi… my Revathi!

895
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,310
Where are you, my Revathi?

896
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:39,310
Vicco Vajradanti, Revathi…

897
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,470
Hey, hey! It’s time.
Where is the bottle?

898
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,720
It’s in the kitchen.
Drink from the kerosene bottle and die.

899
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,270
Revathi… my Revathi…

900
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,310
Where are you, my Revathi?

901
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,350
Hey!

902
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,310
Actually…

903
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:02,720
Can you… do me a small favour?

904
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,310
I’m willing to help you big favour!

905
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,470
What?

906
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,100
No words are coming out.

907
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,020
Only air.

908
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,810
You are so cute!

909
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,310
-Sir, your cell phone.
-Okay.

910
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:02,720
What happened?

911
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,770
Did Raju’s men come?

912
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,100
No, sir. Only one guy.

913
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,470
One guy?

914
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,310
A constable from this station, sir.

915
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,310
Constable from the same station?

916
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,020
What the hell were you doing?

917
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,270
Do you have his photo?
-Yes, sir.

918
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,310
Do as I tell you.
You won’t have any problem.

919
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:29,770
-If you say no…
-Dad!

920
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,350
Hey, Shiva!

921
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,560
What are you doing at this hour?

922
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:46,890
Hey!

923
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,310
Where have you brought me?

924
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:49,770
-Let’s go, dad.
-Let’s go, let’s go.

925
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,310
-Tell me!
-Brought you here for first aid.

926
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,930
Come. Come, Shiva.
Come, sir.

927
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:56,970
Please, check.

928
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,020
Is he a doctor?
-No.

929
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,680
I am a Mortuary van driver.
-Mortuary?

930
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,680
Hey! What’s happening, man?
-Hey, hey! Wait!

931
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,270
Hey, we need to do the first aid
and stop your bleeding.

932
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,310
Go ahead, sir.

933
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:10,770
Will he do it?

934
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,310
I will do it.
Turn the other way.

935
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,270
Sir, I hope the bleeding has stopped?

936
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,390
It will stop for a while.
Take him in the meantime.

937
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,180
Okay, dad. I will take care.
Let’s go, sir.

938
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,310
-Go ahead.
-Hey!

939
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,270
Is he your son?

940
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:32,720
Your son is taking a big risk
along with this CBI officer.

941
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:33,970
They will kill him.

942
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,970
-Tell him to leave me.
-This vehicle is not very safe.

943
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,390
Shiva, take our vehicle.

944
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:40,930
Leave this to me.

945
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,680
No matter how risky it gets,
hand him over where you should.

946
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,020
Hey, hey, hey!
What’s happening here?

947
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,930
This CBI officer is honest.

948
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,810
So is the cop.

949
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,310
Even the mortuary van driver is honest.

950
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,310
Bad vibrations all around.

951
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,270
You can’t even cross the district.

952
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,310
These two will be killed.

953
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:00,520
You will bring back your son’s body
in your own van.

954
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,470
Hey!

955
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,970
One blow from me
and you will drop dead right here, scoundrel!

956
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,770
Carrying a dead body is nothing new
for me or my vehicle.

957
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,890
Please, carry on, sir.
-Hey, gentleman!

958
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,310
No, dad. Don’t take him seriously. Go on.
-Why are you getting excited out of context?

959
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:14,350
You scared me to death!

960
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,310
-Dad!
-Huh?

961
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,470
Cops will come home looking for me.

962
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:22,270
Take mom and sister and go away.

963
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,770
I will take care of that.

964
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,310
You go ahead.

965
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,890
Take care.

966
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:45,390
Where are we going?

967
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,810
To meet Shiva.

968
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,640
To Shiva?
-Yes!

969
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,720
I must give him a good dressing down.

970
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,180
Why? Can’t he dress himself?

971
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,640
No! I must hit him.
He should be shocked.

972
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,930
Okay. Let’s get him beaten.

973
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,970
Not get him beaten.
-Hmm?

974
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,640
You must hit him yourself.

975
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:03,100
You must thrash him
until he begs you to leave him.

976
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,270
I can.

977
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:08,100
I can. But what if you develop sympathy
for him and change your stance?

978
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,310
Once I make a commitment,
I won’t even heed myself.

979
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,560
Wow!

980
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,520
But there has been a lot of gap.

981
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,020
To fight?
-To fight solo…

982
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,520
Thirty is my minimum number to thrash.

983
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,180
This guy is all by himself.

984
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,140
Okay, fine. Crowd will gather
when I start beating him.

985
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,560
I will beat them up too
in the same breath.

986
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,680
But you stay away.

987
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,310
I may end up beating you
in all the excitement.

988
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,020
I am so lucky.

989
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:34,640
Come on, baby.
Let’s go on the bullet!

990
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:35,970
Br… Br….

991
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,560
This song sounds familiar.
Did you compose it?

992
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,180
I composed it in the bathroom this morning.
For Prasad.

993
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,680
Hey!

994
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,220
CBI!

995
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,060
You are central government.
I am state government.

996
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,180
You are legal.
I am illegal.

997
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,180
That’s the only difference.

998
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,560
Our jobs are the same.

999
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,430
Hey, I don’t work for politicians like you.

1000
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,180
Hey!

1001
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,560
You work for politicians too.

1002
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:05,600
Only you don’t see it.

1003
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,520
Here’s another tune.

1004
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,180
-‘You are too beautiful and I am too hasty’
-Hey, Shiva! Stop, stop. Hey, Shiva!

1005
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,180
I think he has understood it.

1006
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,180
-What happened, Shiva?
-That’s why he stopped the vehicle.

1007
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,560
Go ahead, my boy.

1008
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,560
Sir, I will be back in a minute.
-Shiva! What happened?

1009
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,180
-Why did you stop the vehicle?
-I will be back in a minute.

1010
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,390
Shiva!
-Remove the handcuffs.

1011
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,180
Hey, shut up!
-Shiva!

1012
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,180
Revathi!
-Don’t talk!

1013
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,680
Why didn’t you come when I was ready to elope?
-Listen to me.

1014
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,180
Ah! I have heard enough.

1015
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,430
But where are you going at this hour?

1016
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,890
I should be asking you that.
What are you doing here at this hour?

1017
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,180
Oh, that!
I ran away from home.

1018
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,220
You ran away?

1019
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,390
But where are you going
in a mortuary van?

1020
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,640
Hey, Shiva!

1021
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,970
There is no time. Make it fast.
-Sir…

1022
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,890
Hey, hey! We don’t have time either.

1023
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,560
He is a CBI officer.
Show some courtesy.

1024
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,180
Sir! We don’t have time either.

1025
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,220
Is this respect enough?

1026
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,180
There is an accused in the van.

1027
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,180
Something big happened.
Try to understand. Please.

1028
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,270
I have a bigger problem.

1029
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,180
It’s my wedding tomorrow with this guy.
-Of course.

1030
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,180
Shall I marry him?

1031
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,430
-Rooms also booked.
-Tell me. Shall I?

1032
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,180
Okay, okay.
-Hey,

1033
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,140
Come fast!
-Sir, sir!

1034
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,560
Okay! You come along.

1035
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,430
What do you mean?
Hey, hey, hey!

1036
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,430
Crap!

1037
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:14,350
Who is this?

1038
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,560
Sir, my love, sir.

1039
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,430
Love?

1040
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,640
A small problem at home.
She ran away.

1041
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,270
Hi, sir.

1042
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,390
Elbow cut… round cut.

1043
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,640
Hello!
-Son-in-law!

1044
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,180
My daughter has eloped.

1045
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,180
Of course, she is eloping.
-What?

1046
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,180
Uh… uh… has she eloped?

1047
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,140
Very shocking.
Very embarrassing.

1048
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,180
Just find where the girl is.

1049
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,850
It doesn’t matter how or with whom.

1050
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,220
Just find where.

1051
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,270
Ah…

1052
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,180
Shiva!

1053
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,020
She is not Parvathi, man.
She is Revathi.

1054
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,810
I will get back to you, huh?

1055
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,640
Look at her!

1056
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,270
The girl left home trusting you.

1057
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,810
You brought me trusting this guy.

1058
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,680
At least now,
set me free and go home happy.

1059
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,270
You are spot on, brother.

1060
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,180
A criminal like you
is able to feel my pain.

1061
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,180
This cop cannot.

1062
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,970
Revathi, can you be quiet for a while?

1063
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,180
Revathi!

1064
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,520
How long have you been in love with him?

1065
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,520
Brother…Actually I have been in love
since my school days.

1066
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,680
-Ah?
-Hmm.

1067
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,180
Right from school days?

1068
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,180
But very sad!

1069
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,850
In a while, my men will kill you all.

1070
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,060
Kill us?

1071
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,180
Yeah.

1072
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,140
Don’t you know the issue?

1073
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,270
Your lover beat up the SI,
DSP and SP,

1074
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,890
ruined the police station...

1075
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,180
trusting this guy and brought me away.

1076
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,180
SP and DSP?

1077
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,180
Did you hit so many people for a stranger?

1078
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,560
I have been in love with you
since we were small.

1079
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,220
Why couldn’t you hit my dad
and abduct me?

1080
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,810
Give me the address, sister.
I will do the job for you.

1081
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,180
Revathi, don’t talk without knowing facts.

1082
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:50,640
Stay quiet.

1083
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,560
Till when?

1084
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,060
Brother says we are going to be killed.

1085
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,430
Does it mean I am going to die
before I could marry you?

1086
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,180
Dear! Can you hold it?

1087
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,180
Once this man is handed over,

1088
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,430
I will personally get you both married.

1089
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:04,970
Really?
-Sure, sure.

1090
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,060
You?

1091
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,350
That’s the end!

1092
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,850
All this is because of him.

1093
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,060
A little longer
and my people will kill you.

1094
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,180
They will take me away safely.

1095
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,350
Brother!
-Don’t trust him.

1096
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,180
You called me brother
without even looking at my face.

1097
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,140
Anyway, sister!

1098
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,270
Rest in peace.

1099
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:25,890
What are you saying, brother?

1100
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,520
Hey, stop it.

1101
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,810
He is trying to frighten you.
Don’t pay him attention.

1102
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,970
Tell me if you are scared.
I will stop the vehicle right now.

1103
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,520
-You can go your way.
-No! No!

1104
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,180
I would rather die with you
than marry him.

1105
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,560
Bad choice, sister.

1106
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,890
You go that side!
I will go this way!

1107
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,180
No one is here, sir!

1108
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,180
Stop! Stop!
Get in! Get in quickly.

1109
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,430
You don’t have to worry.

1110
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,220
Take care, okay?

1111
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,640
The CBI guy has to go to
the Bangalore CBI court with Raju.

1112
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,020
He will definitely not use a police jeep.

1113
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,390
He knows we will inform
all the police stations.

1114
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,890
So, check all the vehicles on the route.

1115
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,140
Have you ever seen
the person in the photo?

1116
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:16,350
Since he is wounded,
they will definitely stop at a hospital.

1117
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,060
Check every hospital.

1118
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,640
If you come across any suspicious vehicle,
stop them and inform me.

1119
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,640
Okay, sir.
-Sir!

1120
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,890
We checked his house, sir.

1121
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:26,060
His parents left home two hours ago.

1122
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,430
He is also a cop.

1123
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,220
Doesn’t he know that much?

1124
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:32,180
His friends, relatives…
enquire everyone.

1125
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:34,060
Sir, he has no kin except his uncle.

1126
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,520
He too is absconding.

1127
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,640
We enquired at the hospital
his dad works for, sir.

1128
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,640
But no clue, sir.

1129
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,520
I need to meet SI Rangappa.
Let me in!

1130
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,020
Or call SI Rangappa here.

1131
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,180
-Hey! What is the issue?
-Ramireddy here.

1132
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,430
Local Sarpanch, Ramireddy!

1133
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,180
Call the SI! Call the SI!

1134
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,850
Mr Ramireddy, what happened?

1135
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,350
Where is Shiva?
-He is not here.

1136
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,060
He eloped with my daughter.
I am filing a kidnap case against him.

1137
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,520
Raise an FIR against him right now.

1138
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,350
Mr Ramireddy,
there is some other issue going on here.

1139
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,220
He didn’t take Revathi with him.

1140
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,220
Son-in-law! Son-in-law!

1141
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,520
Hey, you! Can’t you hear?
Come. Tell him.

1142
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:04,850
What should I tell him?

1143
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,060
Tell sir what happened.

1144
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:11,390
Constable Shiva who works in your station,
sir…took my Revathi, ouch!

1145
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,220
Hey!

1146
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,180
I took her, sir.

1147
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,560
I took her and left her.
I confess.

1148
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,180
I was in love with Revathi
since my childhood, sir.

1149
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,600
Those two were also in love, sir.

1150
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,850
But that’s a different topic.

1151
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,270
Mine was pure love, sir.

1152
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,430
Our wedding was planned in Tirupathi, sir.

1153
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,810
But last night,

1154
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,180
Revathi looked at me…

1155
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,810
and called me sir.
-Hey, son-in-law!

1156
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,390
I thought the same, father-in-law.

1157
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,350
She drew me close
and asked me to take her somewhere, sir.

1158
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,220
I hoped we might get physical
and took her to Palem bridge, sir.

1159
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,890
He appeared there, sir.

1160
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:42,020
He came; he stopped; he spoke;
and escaped.

1161
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,060
He came, he…
-Hey, come to the point.

1162
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,600
Revathi is supposed to be with me
lively and glowing.

1163
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,020
But she got into a mortuary van
and left with him like a dead body, sir!

1164
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,770
These are not the times
for pure lovers, sir.

1165
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:51,560
Drat!

1166
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,810
Pure love never dies.
Am I right, father-in-law?

1167
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,350
I am always truly in love with her.
-Hey!

1168
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,640
Was there anyone else
in the mortuary van?

1169
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:59,770
Words don’t come out.

1170
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:01,220
Only the air is passing.
-Hey!

1171
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:04,560
-Trace the mortuary van.
-On it, sir.

1172
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,600
-Enquire in the vicinity of Palem bridge.
-Okay, sir.

1173
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,180
What happened?
-Sir, the radiator is overheated.

1174
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,270
We need water.
-Okay!

1175
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:18,180
-I will check in the shop and get it.
-Come back fast.

1176
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:19,600
No, take your own time.

1177
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,970
Hey! Your mouth…

1178
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,180
You carry on, Shiva!

1179
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,180
Tell me. Is there…

1180
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,680
Sir, the mortuary van was seen on
Donakonda road a while ago, sir.

1181
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,560
Proceeding. Over.

1182
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,180
Brother! Let me take some water.
The radiator is overheated.

1183
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,180
Please, take.

1184
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,520
Shiva, long time no see?

1185
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,180
Heard some criminal has escaped?

1186
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,770
Have they sent you to catch him?

1187
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,640
Nothing. The radiator is overheated.

1188
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:51,850
I came for water.

1189
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,350
Why are you using dad’s vehicle?

1190
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,020
Uh, the jeep broke down.
So, I am using dad’s.

1191
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,970
Constable Shiva has escaped
with criminal Raju.

1192
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:00,640
If anyone finds him,
please alert the others.

1193
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,220
Shiva, surrender!
-Sir!

1194
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,180
This is in your best interest.
Surrender immediately. -Let go!

1195
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,180
Hey!

1196
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,390
Hey!

1197
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,770
Shiva! Come fast. Come on!

1198
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,430
What happened?
-Police sir.

1199
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,810
They are almost here.
-Oh, my God!

1200
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:38,770
Be quick.

1201
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:41,890
Start the van, Shiva.

1202
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,560
Make it fast, Shiva.
They are reaching.

1203
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,180
-Fast, Shiva.
-Start the van, Shiva!

1204
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,640
Hey, Shiva!
Watch your left.

1205
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,350
Block the road. Block it.
They are here.

1206
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:29,850
Block the north side!

1207
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,350
Move it!

1208
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,220
Shiva!

1209
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,390
Hey!

1210
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,180
Hey! What are you doing?
-Stop the van!

1211
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,180
-Let go!
-Let go!

1212
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,180
-Hey, Raju! Let go.
-Hey, Raju! Let go!

1213
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,970
Keep driving. Look ahead!
-Stop the van!

1214
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,180
Hey, Shiva! Look ahead!
-Raju!

1215
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,770
Shiva! Look ahead!

1216
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:08,970
Hey, Shiva! Shiva!

1217
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:16,350
Go the other side!

1218
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,140
Check if there is a way out.
-Yes, sir. Let’s go!

1219
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,180
Hey!

1220
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,560
You go this side!

1221
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:25,680
Partner!

1222
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,140
Here!

1223
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,430
Hey, partner!

1224
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,180
It’s Raju!
It’s been long since I saw you.

1225
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,220
It’s me… Raju!

1226
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,810
Sorry, Raju!

1227
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,270
Hey!

1228
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:20,180
Hey! Come, come!

1229
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,220
Sir, what are you doing, sir?

1230
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,680
Hey, wait.

1231
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,180
Sir, what are you doing, sir?
Sir, open the door.

1232
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,640
I can’t do it, Shiva.

1233
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,600
I am hit.

1234
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,220
Open the door.
I will take care.

1235
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,350
You guys carry on.
-How can we do that without you, sir?

1236
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,180
He should be in the Bangalore court
by tomorrow morning.

1237
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,020
Get going.

1238
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,640
Ah! Please open the door, sir.

1239
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,680
Hey, if you were hit,

1240
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:58,390
I would leave you and go.

1241
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,600
There is no time to waste.
Get going, Shiva.

1242
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,600
-Trust me, sir. Please open the door.
-Move! Hey!

1243
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,180
Do you hear me?

1244
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,680
I will become a baggage for you.

1245
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,180
Hey! They are getting near.
Move.

1246
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:10,390
It’s an order! Move! Move!
-Sir!

1247
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,890
Go! It’s an order! Go!

1248
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,180
Raju!

1249
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:35,850
My friend!

1250
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:39,140
Can you hear me?

1251
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:43,560
See where you have landed yourself?

1252
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,560
You were a terror in the state.

1253
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,180
Today you hide in a narrow lane.

1254
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,180
How many times have I told you?

1255
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:52,140
Not to roam in public
and not to go out of jurisdiction?

1256
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:52,890
Did you pay heed?

1257
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,430
Not the CBI got to you.

1258
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,850
How many have we killed together?

1259
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:00,640
See the irony.

1260
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,430
I am forced to kill you.

1261
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,180
What can I do?

1262
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,180
It’s orders from above.

1263
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:09,350
Don’t feel!

1264
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,890
What is this, Raju?

1265
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,270
How fearless you were?

1266
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,850
Afraid of me,

1267
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:19,180
you hide behind
after all a constable.

1268
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:24,350
I want to see your frightened face.

1269
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,180
Let me see your face.

1270
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,020
Come out!

1271
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,430
Raju!

1272
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,140
Not Raju…

1273
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,430
Rajuuuu!

1274
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,770
As if I don’t it, partner!

1275
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,140
Hey, Raju!

1276
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,060
Hey, hey! No!

1277
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,270
Hey, hey!

1278
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:00,060
-It’s Raju, man!
-Hey, hey! Raju, stop!

1279
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:06,640
Raju!

1280
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,520
Hey!

1281
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,810
Hey!

1282
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,850
Hey, hey! Let go!

1283
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,680
Revathi!

1284
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,350
Shiva!

1285
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:34,850
Revathi!

1286
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:35,970
Revathi!

1287
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,140
Revathi!

1288
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:33,850
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!

1289
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:37,060
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!

1290
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,020
Namaste.

1291
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,270
-Namaste, madam
-Namaste.

1292
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,720
He is upstairs.
You can go.

1293
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,770
Hmm!

1294
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:57,720
Namaste, uncle.

1295
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,720
Hmm. Please, come, dear.

1296
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,560
How are you?
-Hmm.

1297
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:04,640
Are all your problems cleared?

1298
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,640
They will be, uncle.

1299
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:12,600
It took your dad and me a herculean effort
to launch this Party.

1300
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:19,470
At a time when it was unthinkable for a local
party to exist against a national party,

1301
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,640
we established our Party.

1302
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:23,640
The trust in your dad...

1303
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,640
and the sympathy for his death,

1304
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,890
made you the CM.

1305
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:32,890
But…

1306
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:35,100
because of the mistakes you have made,

1307
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:40,430
the centre wants to use CBI
and close our Party.

1308
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,640
Don’t worry.

1309
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,890
I will step out of the court tomorrow
after proving my innocence.

1310
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,350
How will you do that, huh?

1311
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:48,520
They have your entire history.

1312
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:51,470
It’s a report they have collected
for four years.

1313
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:53,470
That is not sufficient.

1314
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,600
The court needs proofs.

1315
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,640
Is it?

1316
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,640
That man… uh, who is that?

1317
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:01,140
Uh, Raju?
-He won’t turn up.

1318
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,060
He won’t exist.

1319
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:05,350
After 24 hours,

1320
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,640
no one can even prove a person
called Raju ever existed.

1321
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,220
Don’t get me wrong.

1322
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:15,430
Even if you lose,
it won’t hurt us.

1323
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,060
But if a situation arises
when the Party might lose…

1324
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:19,890
I know.

1325
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:22,850
Party is most important for me too.

1326
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,970
I will meet you after the court tomorrow.

1327
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,640
Actually…

1328
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:29,810
the elections are round the corner.

1329
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:34,100
Don’t make us look for another CM candidate.

1330
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:46,640
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!

1331
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,100
What is happening, Nataraj?
-Madam!

1332
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,140
I have killed the CBI officer, madam.

1333
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,810
But Raju…

1334
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,310
Has escaped with a constable
called Shiva, madam.

1335
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,220
Damn! Are you not ashamed?

1336
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,640
We are running short of time, Nataraj.

1337
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,850
If Raju is caught,

1338
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,640
you, me and everyone will be caught.

1339
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,100
Look! You have time till tonight.

1340
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,310
Use the entire police department
or do whatever you want.

1341
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:14,640
Raju must die.

1342
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,020
If the police department is not enough,

1343
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:20,100
use the goons and all the party activists.

1344
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,810
I want… Raju… dead!

1345
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,270
I will take care of it, madam.

1346
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:47,100
Why are you carrying that gun
with no bullets?

1347
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:47,600
Hmm?

1348
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,600
Simply.

1349
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:51,390
Can it be done, Shiva?

1350
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:53,970
Evading all of them…

1351
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,770
can it be done?

1352
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,220
It can be. Come.

1353
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,100
It won’t.

1354
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:03,060
If you want to live happily together,

1355
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,220
leave me and go.

1356
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:07,180
I will take care of myself.

1357
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,600
I will take care of all that.

1358
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:10,970
What?

1359
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,060
Trying to be a hero?

1360
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,470
Very difficult.

1361
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,560
At least you tell him, sister.

1362
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:18,270
To leave me and go.

1363
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,810
You will be better off.

1364
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,600
What are you looking at?

1365
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,850
I really mean it.

1366
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:30,470
You came for him despite knowing
how risky it is.

1367
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:33,470
I understood how much you love him.

1368
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:37,600
At least your love must win.

1369
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:40,100
‘At least your love?’
-Hmm.

1370
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:42,020
So, do you have a love story too?

1371
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,470
Where is she?

1372
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,270
Tell me, brother.

1373
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:50,100
That’s one side love.

1374
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:52,020
Doesn’t the girl know?

1375
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:53,600
You should have told her.

1376
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:56,810
I wanted to. But I couldn’t.

1377
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,600
-But unless you say it…
-Hey, Revathi!

1378
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,600
Stay quiet for a while.

1379
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,680
Brother, who is she?

1380
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,600
CM!

1381
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,600
CM?
-Yeah!

1382
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:12,770
Huh?
-Yes.

1383
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:15,560
The same CM who wanted to kill me.

1384
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,560
Had I told her,
probably this wouldn’t happen.

1385
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,600
You are super, brother.

1386
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,770
Hey, he talks some rubbish
and you believe him.

1387
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,390
Not rubbish. It’s true.

1388
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,600
Yes, Shiva.

1389
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:29,470
When he talks about her,
I saw true love in his eyes for her.

1390
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,770
You have seen, right? Huh?

1391
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,270
Have you? Super.

1392
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,930
Now, shut up and walk.

1393
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,600
First think how to get out of here safe.

1394
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,020
That’s not possible.

1395
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,270
With me,
you can’t even cross the district.

1396
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:44,220
I thought he came to rescue me.

1397
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:46,060
Tsk!

1398
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,270
But…anyway,
I will ask my younger brother to come.

1399
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,060
I will take care of myself.

1400
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,600
Take her and go.

1401
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:55,310
I feel his words have a ring of truth, Shiva.

1402
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:58,810
I have no faith that we will safely overcome
all these obstacles.

1403
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,060
I have.

1404
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,930
No matter what happens,

1405
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:06,270
I won’t let go
until he is handed over to the court.

1406
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,020
Hey! Drat!

1407
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,020
Why do you keep repeating the same thing?
Have you no sense?

1408
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:12,600
Leave me. Let go!

1409
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,560
Shiva!

1410
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:20,640
How many times should I tell you?

1411
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,020
Don’t you have any sense?

1412
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:27,220
Shiva!

1413
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:35,020
Shiva! Stop it!

1414
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:36,270
Shiva!

1415
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,560
Please…
-Hey!

1416
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,640
Why do you hit me
on the wound again and again?

1417
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,060
Hey, wait. Wait, wait!

1418
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:45,020
Shiva! Please!

1419
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:46,390
Stop fighting!

1420
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,060
What are you both fighting for?

1421
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:53,060
Why are you so keen on responsibility
no one seems to care in your department?

1422
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,430
He sounds logical.

1423
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,930
Let’s leave him and go.

1424
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:59,970
You are most important to me, Shiva.

1425
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:01,640
How can you ask me to leave him?

1426
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,430
Huh? How can you?

1427
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,470
After knowing he killed my brother,
how can I leave him?

1428
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:10,310
Damn!

1429
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,270
What did my brother do to you?

1430
01:23:51,310 --> 01:24:02,600
“Don’t you call us brothers
for we are far better friends”

1431
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:06,020
“He is the light
And I am the shade”

1432
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,850
“He is the step
And I am the support”

1433
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:14,640
“Through times eternal
Our bonding shall stay as strong”

1434
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:22,930
“Don’t you call us brothers
We will never agree, never ever”

1435
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:17,560
“If you ask for the light of my life
I shall point towards him”

1436
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:23,600
“Without him
I am so incomplete”

1437
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:29,600
“Pleading with my mom
I am born as his kid brother”

1438
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:35,930
“Asking God for his sake
I shall bring the month of spring”

1439
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:44,850
“If there is a next life,
I shall be his big brother and keep him close”

1440
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:59,600
“Don’t you call us brothers
for we are far better friends”

1441
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,810
“He is the light
And I am the shade”

1442
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:05,850
“He is the step
And I am the support”

1443
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:11,390
“Through times eternal
Our bonding shall stay as strong”

1444
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:20,810
“Don’t you call us brothers
We will never agree, never ever”

1445
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:34,470
Half of it is mine.
-Chuck it, man.

1446
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,220
You know better.

1447
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,470
I want to become a cop.
An SI to be specific.

1448
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:40,600
And I want to serve public.

1449
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:44,100
Everything is falling into place just now.

1450
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,600
Hey, Vishnu.

1451
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,060
This serious acting doesn’t suit you, man.

1452
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,850
Be the jolly guy that you are.

1453
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:51,390
Hmm? Why this charade?

1454
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,270
-Happy for you, man.
-Thank you.

1455
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:57,930
-Hey!
-Hi!

1456
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:00,770
Has Sirkanth come?
-Everybody is on the ground. Only we are late.

1457
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:03,270
Shiva! Get your dad’s medicines
from the town.

1458
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:05,810
Mom, dad work for a government hospital.

1459
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:07,600
Can’t he get them there?
I have a match, mom.

1460
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,390
Hey, you get these medicines only there.

1461
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:14,270
All the time you are either on the roads,
or at the ground with all of them behind.

1462
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,390
-No other job! Take this!
-Hey…

1463
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,850
Mom! You could have told me yesterday.
I would have gone.

1464
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,600
Hey! Look at my Sachin Tendulkar!
Get going.

1465
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:23,100
Hey! Go to the ground.

1466
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,640
I will buy medicines and come.
-Okay, man.

1467
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,600
Hey, if we win the toss, choose batting.

1468
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,180
-Okay?
-Okay. -Okay.

1469
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:34,390
Hey, Vishnu…

1470
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,770
Mom asked wants medicines
from the town for dad.

1471
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,600
Go and get them. Okay?
-Hey, hey, hey!

1472
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:41,100
Hey! Your sister-in-law is waiting for me.

1473
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:43,060
We have to finalise the invitation.
Here.

1474
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,600
Oh!

1475
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:47,600
So, your wedding is more important
than dad’s health.

1476
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,270
Hey, are you senseless?

1477
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,390
Hey, you are not even married!

1478
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,600
And you have changed already?

1479
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,600
-Mom!
-Hey!

1480
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,770
-He is changing a lot.
-Stop it!

1481
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,180
I don’t know how he is going to be
after the wedding. Watch out. -Shh…

1482
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:59,100
Don’t fight. Either of you go get them.
-How could you do this?

1483
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,560
There! She told you to get them.
Huh? Buy them quickly, okay?

1484
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,600
Hey, hey, hey!

1485
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,600
Your sister-in-law is waiting for me, man.
I have been telling you this.

1486
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,180
Hey…Mr Vishnu!

1487
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:08,810
You are the boss of the house after dad.

1488
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,560
All responsibilities you take care, man.

1489
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,600
Okay? Come on.

1490
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:13,600
Hey! Let’s go!
-Hey, let’s go.

1491
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:15,220
You are a silent killer, man!

1492
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,470
You put me in a fix every time.

1493
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,470
Hey, you won’t even win the toss.
-Okay, okay!

1494
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,680
-Even if you do, you won’t be able to play.
-Okay, bye.

1495
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,390
You will be duck out.
-Thank you. Thank you, man.

1496
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,270
-Hey! Duck out is confirmed!
-Bye!

1497
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,390
Hey!

1498
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,850
Hello, milk society…

1499
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:33,430
Hey, milk booth!
It’s me.

1500
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,560
Where are you?

1501
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,470
Sorry, dear!

1502
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,060
I must get tablets for dad.

1503
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,270
I will drop them at home
and come immediately.

1504
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:40,310
Hey…

1505
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,970
Believe me!
I will be there in no time.

1506
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:44,310
Love you. Give me a kiss.
-Hmm?

1507
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,930
Fine. I know you won’t.

1508
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:47,220
Hang up now.

1509
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:01,270
Baby!

1510
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,470
Hey!

1511
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,430
Hey, come! Come fast!

1512
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,600
Get down! Move! Quick.

1513
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:04,100
Hey, kid! Come to me.
Come. Fast!

1514
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,600
Hey, don’t be afraid.

1515
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,470
Madam!

1516
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:21,600
Come.

1517
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:24,810
Please take this boy.
Quick!

1518
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,600
Hey!

1519
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,600
Hey, Shiva!

1520
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:49,270
There was a bomb blast
at Morampudi junction.

1521
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,600
There are many casualties.

1522
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,600
Hey, hey! Vishnu!

1523
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:57,600
[indistinct voices]

1524
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:00,270
Vishnu!
-Go back.

1525
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:01,100
Vishnu!

1526
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:02,600
Hey, step back!

1527
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:03,770
Vishnu!

1528
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:05,430
Vishnu…
-Wait, wait!

1529
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,060
Vishnu!

1530
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:08,430
Madam, move aside!

1531
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:09,430
Vishnu?

1532
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,930
Hey, move back
-Hey, wait!

1533
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:14,100
Vishnu?

1534
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:15,270
Wait!
-Go!

1535
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,930
Hello, don’t go! You are allowed to go!

1536
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:20,680
Vishnu…?

1537
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:22,600
Sir, sir, please step back.
-Vishnu…?

1538
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,600
Please go back!
Please, sir!

1539
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,470
Come fast! Wait!
Vishnu!

1540
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:26,600
Ambulance!

1541
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,180
[Indistinct voices]

1542
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:33,680
Vishnu!
-Ambulance, come faster!

1543
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:35,600
Vishnu!
-Hurry up, hurry up!

1544
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,020
Vishnu!

1545
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:39,600
Please wait!
Go back.

1546
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,600
Vishnu!

1547
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,060
Vishnu! Vishnu!

1548
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:44,600
Vishnu, speak, man.

1549
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,430
Vishnu!

1550
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,270
Ambulance! Please put him in quickly.

1551
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,930
Vishnu… Vishnu…
Vishnu, you will be fine.

1552
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:57,810
Attend to him, nurse. Please.

1553
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,970
You sent me and you escaped, huh?

1554
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:02,430
Hmm?

1555
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,020
Hey…

1556
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:08,850
Don’t say that, man.

1557
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:10,270
Hey, don’t cry, man.

1558
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,600
I was kidding.

1559
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:13,470
Hey, nothing has happened to you!
-I said for fun.

1560
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,470
If I am gone, it’s all you.

1561
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,020
-Mom, dad, sister…
-Hey…

1562
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:25,060
You must take care of them all.

1563
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,180
Hey, hey! Brother,
don’t speak like that, brother. Please.

1564
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:29,020
Trust me and have courage, brother.

1565
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:31,060
Nothing has happened to you, brother.
Have courage, brother. Please.

1566
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,060
What, man?

1567
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:34,020
Where did this brother come from?

1568
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,310
Huh?

1569
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,600
Because I am going to die?

1570
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,810
Hey! Hey!

1571
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:41,600
What makes you talk like this?

1572
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,850
Are you crazy?

1573
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:44,600
Who is going to die?
No one is going to die.

1574
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,850
I am here. Be brave.

1575
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:48,100
Bro, bro! Please, come fast, bro.

1576
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,270
Go faster!

1577
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,470
Your sister-in-law must be waiting for me.

1578
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,270
It’s good that…

1579
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,850
This happened before the wedding.

1580
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:58,180
What are you saying, man?
Nothing is wrong with you.

1581
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:59,600
We will go to the hospital in five minutes.

1582
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,640
Everything will be fine.

1583
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,390
I will take you back home.

1584
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:03,930
Okay?
Nothing will happen to you, man.

1585
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:07,930
Hey, hey, hey!

1586
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,180
Please, don’t cry.
-I had great dreams.

1587
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:13,060
-Hey…please, don’t cry.
To become a policeman…S.I…

1588
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:17,220
-Calm down, man.
-And serve the public until I die.

1589
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,560
Hey, Vishnu!
You will certainly help them. Okay?

1590
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:22,930
Listen to me.
You will certainly help them.

1591
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:27,220
You will certainly help them.
-Okay, sir! Yes, sir!

1592
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:29,930
Please wait for a minute!

1593
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:32,180
Hey, hey, hey, what happened?
Why did you stop?

1594
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:33,640
Clear the vehicles!

1595
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,600
It’s emergency, brother!
We need to rush.

1596
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,640
-Hey! Hey… hey, Vishnu!
-Please, brother!

1597
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:40,060
Clear the vehicles and give us the way!
-Vishnu! Hey!

1598
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:41,600
Nurse, he just spoke to me.

1599
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:44,180
What happened?
-Let me check…

1600
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:46,600
Vishnu! Vishnu!

1601
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,930
Bro, make it fast, bro.

1602
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:49,810
Bro, please make it fast, bro!
Please! Hey!

1603
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:52,850
Vishnu…

1604
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:20,470
My brother died
and so I got his police job.

1605
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:25,850
All that my brother wanted to do
as an ideal cop,

1606
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:29,180
I started doing it for him.

1607
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,020
For their own selfish motives,

1608
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,600
they killed so many people
including my brother,

1609
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,430
and made believe it was an accident.

1610
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,220
The moment I discovered he is the reason
for my brother’s death,

1611
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:42,560
I wanted to kill him.

1612
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:45,270
But no one would know the truth then.

1613
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,810
Every family of each victim
deserves the truth.

1614
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:53,560
Let’s go.

1615
01:34:57,810 --> 01:34:58,600
Get up.

1616
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,060
He is losing a lot of blood, Shiva.

1617
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,600
You said the bullet is still lodged there.

1618
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,970
It will get serious
if he is not treated at once.

1619
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:16,810
Hmm, come on.

1620
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:33,430
(Humming a tune)

1621
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:39,930
‘I got a beautiful chance…’

1622
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:43,850
Hi!

1623
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:45,850
Hey, girl?
Do you want a lift?

1624
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:48,390
No. I want the car.

1625
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:50,270
Hey, hey!

1626
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,560
I wanted to take her
but she took off with my car. Damn!

1627
01:35:53,770 --> 01:35:55,180
He has come.
You can talk to him.

1628
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,140
Brother-in-law!
-Huh!

1629
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,520
Tell me, Pandu.

1630
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,520
Are you all okay?

1631
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:01,140
We are all fine.

1632
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,020
Any news about Shiva?

1633
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,520
No, brother-in-law.

1634
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,720
But wherever he is,
he will be safe, brother-in-law.

1635
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:09,520
Be very alert till he comes back,
brother-in-law.

1636
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,520
Ah! See you.

1637
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,770
Hmm. Okay.

1638
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:17,220
Here’s your money.

1639
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,310
Namaste.

1640
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,890
Hello! Guntur Sri Balaji Lodge…

1641
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:33,220
Here. Take left.
-Huh?

1642
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:34,520
There is a hospital here.
Take left.

1643
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,520
Hey, stop, stop! Cops! Cops!
-Huh?

1644
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,850
Revathi, reverse the car.
Slowly, reverse it.

1645
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:41,970
Go straight.
Keep straight.

1646
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:46,390
Hey, Revathi. Police, police!

1647
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,520
Revathi, get into that house.
-This one?

1648
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:51,890
Revathi!

1649
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,350
Open the gate. Huh?

1650
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:55,310
Go. Open the gate
and park the car inside.

1651
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:14,390
Madam, madam, madam!
-Hey, who are you?

1652
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:16,520
A bit of an emergency. Can we make a call, please?
-Why are you barging in? Who are you?

1653
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,970
Tell me who you are!
-Can I make a call?

1654
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:19,850
Philips! Someone barged into our house.

1655
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,520
-Hey, girl! Why are you closing the door?
-Madam! Please. He is losing a lot of blood.

1656
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,220
-Who are you all?
-Emergency. Please try to understand.

1657
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:25,720
Hey! Who is it?
-Don’t you hear?

1658
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:26,890
Please, madam.

1659
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:28,020
Who are you all?

1660
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:29,350
I am Shiva, sir.

1661
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,310
I am a constable
from Sakinetipalli police station.

1662
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:32,520
ID number 1302.

1663
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:33,520
Sir, he is an accused.

1664
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,890
He is in my custody.

1665
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,770
Please, help, sir.
-What happened?

1666
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:37,770
He is hit by a bullet, sir.

1667
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:38,930
There is a lot of blood loss.

1668
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,520
Can I make a call to the doctor, please?

1669
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,140
When did this happen?
-Last night.

1670
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:43,520
We could only give him first aid.

1671
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:47,140
-Let’s take him into that room. Come.
-Thank you, sir.

1672
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,520
Come. Come.

1673
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,520
Do you know what you are doing?

1674
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:02,180
Relax. You will be fine.

1675
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:06,020
How did this happen?

1676
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:08,560
During night duty at the station.
-Oh!

1677
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,020
Sir, is everything okay?

1678
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,180
Nothing to worry.

1679
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:35,180
Two days of rest will do.

1680
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:39,520
Sir, I have to hand him over to the CBI court
in Bangalore by tomorrow.

1681
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,720
I have removed the bullet.

1682
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:44,600
At least for six to eight hours,
I don’t see any problem.

1683
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,350
Hello…

1684
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:51,970
Sir, Shiva here.

1685
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:53,220
Shiva!

1686
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,720
Where are you calling from?

1687
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,890
They tried to kill George at the station.

1688
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:59,520
George and I ran away with Raju, sir.

1689
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:02,140
Okay. Give the phone to George.

1690
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,310
Sir…

1691
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:05,140
George was killed by IG Nataraj.

1692
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,520
He is now trying to kill us both, sir.

1693
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,140
I don’t know what to do.

1694
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,470
Raju also got shot, sir.

1695
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,600
Where are you speaking from right now?

1696
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:21,520
Sir, I am at an ex-servicemen’s house
in Thungaleru.

1697
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:23,310
Stay right there.

1698
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:26,310
I will send my team.

1699
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:30,220
One Ms Ranjitha will come
and pick you up.

1700
01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:32,100
Okay, sir. I will wait.

1701
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:33,970
Madam!

1702
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:39,560
I think Shiva has some
past connection with Raju.

1703
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,220
That’s why…

1704
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:43,520
he bashed up everyone at the station…

1705
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,680
and took off with Raju.

1706
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:48,520
What is this, sir?
You are so casual about it?

1707
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:50,220
What action did you take?

1708
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,680
We are looking for him, madam.

1709
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,350
We will certainly catch him.
-Sir…

1710
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:57,180
I want all details of this case.

1711
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,770
Keep me updated.

1712
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,180
Otherwise, you will be answerable to Delhi.

1713
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:05,560
Do one thing.
-What?

1714
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:08,020
Get a requisition from the Commissioner.

1715
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:09,310
We will give you.

1716
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,770
Huh!
-One second!

1717
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:14,930
Hello, sir?

1718
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:17,100
Ranjitha, Shiva has just called me.

1719
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,770
You wanted to meet Officer Nataraj
who is handling this case, right?

1720
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:21,720
Yes, sir!

1721
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,180
He has killed George.

1722
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:29,520
I am right now with him, sir.

1723
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:30,970
Oh, crap!

1724
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:32,890
Okay.

1725
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:36,560
Let him not know
that we are aware of this.

1726
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:38,520
Raju is with Shiva.

1727
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:42,520
They are safe
in an ex-military officer’s house at Thungaleru.

1728
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,520
-You must go quickly and pick them up.
-Husband…

1729
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:46,890
Husband!

1730
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:48,350
Listen to me carefully.

1731
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:50,520
Nataraj is a dangerous guy.

1732
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:52,520
We are alone in this case.

1733
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,140
Okay, sir!
Will take care!

1734
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:55,520
Okay.
-Bye, sir!

1735
01:40:57,930 --> 01:40:59,020
As you suggested,

1736
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:01,720
I will get the request letter
from our commissioner, sir.

1737
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:02,720
Hmm.

1738
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:04,220
Thank you.

1739
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:08,390
Then we must leave immediately.

1740
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,600
Yes, we have to!

1741
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:18,720
What, dear?

1742
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:23,850
Here, dear.
These are some clothes. You can change.

1743
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:25,970
There is a pair for your friend as well.

1744
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:26,970
Ask him to change.

1745
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:28,520
Thank you, aunty. Thank you.

1746
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:29,350
Dear…

1747
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,600
Did you eat something?

1748
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,970
No, aunty. I am famished.

1749
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,310
We have been running since last night.

1750
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:39,350
Oho! Okay, okay.

1751
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:40,520
Change your clothes.

1752
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:42,720
I will get dinner ready. Huh?
-Okay, okay.

1753
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,520
Are you okay?

1754
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,560
Do you want anything?
-Okay, sir!

1755
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:51,770
Do you have a bidi, sir?
-Hm?

1756
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:54,520
Err…It’s okay.
Forget it, sir.

1757
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:58,220
Are you a doctor, sir?

1758
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,390
No. Ex-Army officer.

1759
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:02,890
So you must have liquor, sir?

1760
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,470
Hey!

1761
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,310
Sir, it’s meant for body pains, right?

1762
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,470
You are not a doctor
but how do you know all this?

1763
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:13,890
We get trained in the Army.

1764
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,520
For field emergency.

1765
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:19,020
I wish the government taught us too, sir.

1766
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,470
We have lots of emergencies as well.

1767
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,390
How many would you have killed, sir?

1768
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:25,350
Hmm?

1769
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:26,890
Why?

1770
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:28,600
Just to know the figure, sir.

1771
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:30,140
What will you do with it?

1772
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,770
Sir, you kill at the government’s orders
and so do I.

1773
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:35,520
But you get medals
while I am called accused.

1774
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:37,520
What sort of comparison is that?

1775
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:40,390
I kill enemies to protect the country.

1776
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,350
You kill innocents for useless politicians.

1777
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:44,520
How can they be same?

1778
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,520
Don’t justify your murders.

1779
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,220
Sir, killing is killing, sir.

1780
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:51,100
My victims have families.
But yours don’t?

1781
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:53,100
Sir!

1782
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:55,350
You call it justice.
But everyone has feelings, sir.

1783
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:57,970
The court will decide
what is fair or unfair.

1784
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:59,520
Why entertain this guy, sir?

1785
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,520
Hey, what was wrong with my question?

1786
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:03,100
Whatever I ask he is…

1787
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:06,310
Hey, wait.

1788
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:13,180
Who is it?

1789
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,520
We are sent by CBI Head, Mr Varghese.

1790
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,850
I am Ranjitha.

1791
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:18,850
Is there a Shiva inside?

1792
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:23,470
It’s them, sir.

1793
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:27,890
Sir, I am Ranjitha from CBI.

1794
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:36,520
Shiva, main road is not that safe.

1795
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,560
Five kilometres from here to the left,

1796
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:40,520
you will find a path in the woods.

1797
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,520
Take that.
You will be safe.

1798
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,180
Hey! The vehicle’s approaching.
It’s heading in.

1799
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:14,390
Move back!

1800
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,140
Move back, man!
-Move, move.

1801
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,890
Everybody! Stay down! Stay down!

1802
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:27,970
Don’t move.
Bend down!

1803
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:29,520
All of you stay here.
-Bend down!

1804
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,470
Hey!

1805
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:32,520
What are you watching?

1806
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:34,020
Hey, you go that side.

1807
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:37,930
None of you want to become Raju?

1808
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,470
Oho!

1809
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,470
You move only when ‘action’ is said.

1810
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:42,600
Get going.

1811
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,850
Hey!

1812
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,520
Shiva, these people can’t deal with them.

1813
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:55,100
Remove my cuffs.

1814
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:57,520
Hey, keep quiet.
They will take care.

1815
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,520
Hey, listen to me.

1816
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,850
Or they will kill everyone.

1817
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:10,930
Unlock my handcuffs.

1818
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:14,890
Shiva, uncuff me. I won’t go anywhere.

1819
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:17,350
Open them.
Or they will kill everyone.

1820
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:40,020
Hey!

1821
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,310
Hey!

1822
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:52,180
Hey!

1823
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:02,470
Hey!

1824
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,520
Hey!

1825
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,390
Who wants to be another Raju?

1826
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:06,890
Come on!

1827
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,520
Come on!

1828
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,020
Raju…

1829
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:29,520
Hey…

1830
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:31,560
What?

1831
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,520
There is no one here.
They have escaped, sir!

1832
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:48,520
Shiva, there is a truck.

1833
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,600
Over there.
-Come.

1834
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:50,970
Come. Let’s go.

1835
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:09,930
Every man I raised is trying to become Raju.

1836
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:15,350
Every man I trust,
is trying to kill me.

1837
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:21,020
Though no way connected,
you are trying to save me.

1838
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,310
I will show what I am…
to the scoundrels.

1839
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,220
What will you do?

1840
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:31,470
Kill them?

1841
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:33,470
How many will you kill?

1842
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:36,020
They will keep coming.

1843
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:38,350
Let them come!

1844
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,680
They want you dead.

1845
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,520
If you want to show what you are,
confess to the court.

1846
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,520
If I do?

1847
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,100
Will they be convicted?

1848
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,140
They have CM behind them.

1849
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,350
They will get out in the next moment.

1850
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:56,520
CM?

1851
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,520
CM or PM… how many times
did the court make them stand in the dock?

1852
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:01,560
Huh?

1853
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:04,970
Come to the court
and try telling the truth for once.

1854
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:07,520
For justice.

1855
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:12,020
You can rectify all your mistakes.

1856
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,520
Had I come from a nice family too,

1857
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,720
would I have become this?

1858
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:28,720
I would have known right from wrong.

1859
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:33,140
I lived my life thinking
whatever I did was right.

1860
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:35,520
I never….

1861
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,520
Hey, we have reached.
Get the luggage down carefully.

1862
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,390
Okay? Hmm?

1863
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:47,100
Hey, Raju! Come.

1864
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:52,180
Revathi!
-Huh?

1865
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:55,310
Namaste…

1866
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,560
How come you are here?

1867
01:50:57,470 --> 01:50:58,350
Mangalam aunty!

1868
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,520
How did you come?

1869
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,720
Mangalam aunty?

1870
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:02,720
Who are all these people?

1871
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:05,520
Uh, is the wedding here?
-Yes.

1872
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,520
That’s why I am here.

1873
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,520
But your dad said you are getting married
in Tirupati today?

1874
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:14,310
Why are you here?
-Uh… that’s…

1875
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:15,850
Revathi! Hmm!

1876
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,890
That’s… uh…
-Tell me.

1877
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:19,470
That’s…dad lied to you, aunty.
-Damn!

1878
01:51:20,970 --> 01:51:22,520
Hey, Raju! Raju!

1879
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:23,770
Come. Come here.

1880
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,390
Hey, let’s go. Come.

1881
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:36,520
There are saris here and lots of jewellery.
There is everything.

1882
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,970
First get ready.
-Aunty, please listen to me.

1883
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:38,970
Stop!

1884
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,520
First get ready.

1885
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:42,470
In the meantime,
I should ask your dad.

1886
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,100
‘Why are you angry with me?’
-No, aunty.

1887
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:46,220
What grave mistake did I make?
-No, no, no! Aunty!

1888
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,850
Oho!

1889
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:54,350
Hello?
-Brother!

1890
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,310
Why are you angry with me?

1891
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:57,850
What have I done?

1892
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:59,770
Why would I be angry with you?

1893
01:51:59,930 --> 01:52:00,930
Nothing of that sort.

1894
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:02,180
Don’t lie, brother.

1895
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,100
Revathi has told me everything.

1896
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:05,350
Revathi?

1897
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:07,720
When?
-Just now.

1898
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:08,720
Where?

1899
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:10,100
Here. At the wedding venue.

1900
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:12,390
Why did you lie to me?

1901
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:15,100
It wasn’t me who lied.
She is lying to you.

1902
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,850
She ran away from her wedding.

1903
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:18,350
Ran away?

1904
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,520
Don’t let her move.
I am starting right away.

1905
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:22,930
Revathi is found.

1906
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:26,970
Let’s start!

1907
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:32,310
Son-in-law! We are getting late.
Come fast!

1908
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:33,020
Huh?

1909
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:33,600
Uh, uh.

1910
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,770
Bi-lingual. Take good care.

1911
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:37,100
I will take a leave!

1912
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:38,470
Pay the bill!

1913
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:39,970
Hey, wait. I am coming too.

1914
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,390
Revathi! What have you done?
-Aunt!

1915
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:56,310
Aunt, please!

1916
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:06,140
Hey, Raju! Come.

1917
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:12,720
“O my sweet Rukmini,
full of heavenly beauty”

1918
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:16,520
“Oh, my, how did you
come into this world so daintily?”

1919
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:20,600
“No care for time and tide
Like a swishing wind”

1920
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:24,560
“You come to my mind
And make me go mad”

1921
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:30,720
“Crowd or not, no matter what
you spring at me and embrace”

1922
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:36,470
“For all the caution the others give
for your infatuation”

1923
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:40,100
“You shoo them away
with a gesture of dismissal”

1924
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:43,850
“This youthful heart is totally cornered”

1925
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,600
“For the love of you,
it got badly caught”

1926
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:52,520
“This youthful heart is totally cornered”
-Please come. Sit.

1927
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:56,470
“For the love of you,
it got badly caught”

1928
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,720
Mangala, where is Revathi?

1929
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,520
Hey, are you mad? Come.

1930
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:15,970
Hey…

1931
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,890
She is in the room upstairs. Come.
-Hey, move.

1932
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:23,970
“Naughty boy that you are
it’s not easy to bear you”

1933
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:27,180
“With youthful beauty
you try to have a game”

1934
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:28,520
Son-in-law! Come on!

1935
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:31,680
“How can I pour out
my heart to you?”

1936
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:36,180
“You tempt me with your gait
and make me go round you”

1937
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:40,350
“All the eyes around
are on you and me”

1938
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,020
“And yet you pay no heed”
-Come!

1939
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:47,350
“Let it be; let them see”

1940
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:50,930
“And I drowned in your intoxication”
-Shiva! Look there.

1941
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:56,350
“This youthful heart is totally cornered”

1942
01:54:56,930 --> 01:55:00,020
“For the love of you,
it got badly caught”

1943
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:04,520
“This youthful heart is totally cornered”

1944
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:08,390
“For the love of you,
it got badly caught”

1945
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:13,970
Hey, he took her.

1946
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:14,680
He took our girl.

1947
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:15,520
Not again!

1948
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:16,720
Not again, not again.

1949
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,930
Be alert.
-Okay, sir.

1950
01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:26,020
Where is Raju?

1951
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:27,520
I am wondering the same.

1952
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,520
Raju!
-He was here till a while ago.

1953
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:33,890
I trusted him and left him.

1954
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:35,390
Where is Raju?

1955
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:37,520
Where could he have gone?

1956
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:47,310
What is going on, Varghese?

1957
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:49,890
Sir, I spoke to the military officer.

1958
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:53,970
Constable Shiva will somehow
take Raju to the court.

1959
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:58,680
Varghese, remember that this is a
very sensitive case involving a CM.

1960
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:00,770
If he doesn’t show
in the court tomorrow,

1961
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:02,520
it’s a big humiliation
for the department.

1962
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,520
Yes, sir.

1963
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:05,850
If we can depute
some extra forces …

1964
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:07,520
How many more, Varghese?

1965
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,520
Those who went are already dead.

1966
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:10,890
Ranjitha is gone.

1967
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:11,970
And so is George.

1968
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:13,020
I am losing hope.

1969
01:56:13,850 --> 01:56:16,520
Wherever they are,
it’s imperative that we find them.

1970
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:18,600
Know their location
as early as possible.

1971
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:19,770
Okay, sir.

1972
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:25,180
Hey, Shiva!

1973
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,100
Where are you?

1974
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:28,600
All because of you!

1975
01:56:29,470 --> 01:56:31,850
If you didn’t turn up in the middle of the journey,
none of this would have happened.

1976
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:32,520
I know.

1977
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,930
If I didn’t come, you would have
no problem in the first place.

1978
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:37,470
But I would have been married to him.

1979
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:39,220
You should have married him.

1980
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:40,520
You should have. Please, go.

1981
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:42,520
That would be one job done.

1982
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:43,970
Oh!

1983
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:48,520
So, if I married him,
you would have no problem?

1984
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:50,140
Is that it?

1985
01:56:51,890 --> 01:56:52,930
Stop the vehicle, Shiva.

1986
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:54,390
Revathi, be quiet.

1987
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,520
If you don’t stop the car, I will jump out.
-Hey, Revathi.

1988
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:58,520
Don’t act crazy.
Close the door.

1989
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,350
Let go of my hand.
-Revathi, close the door!

1990
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,180
I said let of my hand!
Stop the vehicle!

1991
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:07,720
Revathi…

1992
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:10,020
Revathi!

1993
01:57:12,970 --> 01:57:13,890
Ah!

1994
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:31,520
Sorry.

1995
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,350
That was not intentional.

1996
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:39,680
Don’t you know?

1997
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:43,890
This is my brother’s dream.

1998
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:47,220
Become a cop.
Serve the public.

1999
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:51,390
I became a cop
to make his dream come true.

2000
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,180
Look at me now.

2001
01:57:55,310 --> 01:57:58,890
I bashed up the inspector,
any and every guy and took off with Raju.

2002
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,890
Now I don’t know where he is.

2003
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:04,310
How will I go back?

2004
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:07,520
Will I still have my job?

2005
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:14,560
Where are my parents?

2006
01:58:18,930 --> 01:58:21,680
I felt lost and I blurted out.

2007
01:58:22,350 --> 01:58:23,350
See, Shiva!

2008
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:27,720
It’s your stubbornness
that I like most in you.

2009
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:31,350
When you start something,
you won’t give up until it’s done.

2010
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:34,100
It’s the same trust that made me
fall in love with you.

2011
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,470
Not just this problem…

2012
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:37,970
Any problem…

2013
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:39,560
I will never leave you.

2014
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:42,220
Sorry. Forgive me.

2015
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:43,770
Nothing like that.

2016
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:47,310
The moment you sat next to me,
all my anger had disappeared.

2017
01:58:58,020 --> 01:58:59,520
Shiva…
Hmm?

2018
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:01,600
I am hungry.

2019
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:06,430
I noticed a Paratha Dhaba on the way.

2020
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:07,520
Shall we go?

2021
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:23,310
Hello?

2022
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:24,640
Hey, Ravi.

2023
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:25,720
It’s me.

2024
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:27,270
Brother, tell me, brother.

2025
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:28,720
How long will it take you?

2026
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,680
It will take around 45 minutes
to one hour, brother.

2027
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:31,520
Okay, fine.

2028
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:33,100
There is a dais here.

2029
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:34,270
Near the giant wheel.

2030
01:59:34,310 --> 01:59:35,720
I am right next to it.
Come over.

2031
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:37,970
Okay, okay, brother.
I will be right there.

2032
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:46,600
First, keep your anger aside
and think properly.

2033
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:48,810
No point in thinking while angry.

2034
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,520
He is injured, right?

2035
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:54,350
He can’t have gone far.

2036
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:56,720
There will be cops everywhere.

2037
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:59,270
He will need help.

2038
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,680
I am sure he will call his brother first.

2039
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:03,350
Hmm… and?

2040
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:05,100
Where do you think he will call him?

2041
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:06,430
Welcome… hearty welcome.

2042
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:09,890
We warmly invite you to Sri Sri Sri
Ambika Mother Goddess’s temple fair.

2043
02:00:09,890 --> 02:00:12,270
The temple Committee requests
the residents of the village

2044
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:14,310
Bro! One more Paratha!

2045
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,430
[indistinct voices]

2046
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,520
Do you think we will find Raju here?

2047
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:22,930
No guarantee he is here.

2048
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:25,720
But there is no other option.
We got to look for him.

2049
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:27,720
We will find him somewhere.

2050
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:32,020
[song playing in speakers]

2051
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:48,350
Hey! Raju!

2052
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:57,970
-Look that side.
-Okay, okay.

2053
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:05,180
Shiva! Over here.

2054
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:11,180
Hey!

2055
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:13,850
Hey, Raju!

2056
02:01:13,890 --> 02:01:14,890
Stop!

2057
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:15,970
Wait!

2058
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:17,890
I trusted you and uncuffed you.

2059
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:19,560
But you took advantage and fled!

2060
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,060
Bloody wretch!
-Shiva!

2061
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:22,680
Listen to me.

2062
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:23,930
-You don’t seem to understand.
-Shiva!

2063
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:25,890
-You can’t take me evading all the cops.
-Shiva, please.

2064
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:26,930
Shiva!

2065
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:29,220
If you take me with you, you will be dead.
Take her and go away.

2066
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:31,140
Hey, where do you want me to go?
Stop!

2067
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:33,890
Where do you want me to go?
Back to the police whom I beat up?

2068
02:01:34,140 --> 02:01:37,890
Or to my dad whom I promised justice
for my brother’s death?

2069
02:01:37,970 --> 02:01:39,270
Huh? Tell me.

2070
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,470
I will take you to the court
and hand you over.

2071
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:42,930
Or I will die trying.

2072
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:43,890
Shiva!

2073
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:47,520
I know Raju and you are here.

2074
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:49,520
Enough.

2075
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:51,470
Enough of your running.

2076
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:53,600
They are here! What next!

2077
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:57,100
Someone important to you
has come here to see you.

2078
02:01:58,100 --> 02:01:58,890
Hey!

2079
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:02,770
Bring Raju and take your person.

2080
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:07,520
I am telling you. Listen to me.
-Shiva!

2081
02:02:07,890 --> 02:02:09,470
Shiva…Shiva!

2082
02:02:23,430 --> 02:02:24,220
Dad!

2083
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,890
Dad!
-Shiva! Don’t go.

2084
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:27,890
Ask Shiva to come with Raju.

2085
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:32,060
I will consider this as his ignorance
and spare your son.

2086
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:34,850
Otherwise… ask him to come!

2087
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:35,930
-Shiva!
-Hey, leave me man.

2088
02:02:35,930 --> 02:02:37,850
Listen to me.
Don’t listen to them.

2089
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:38,890
Ask him to come!

2090
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:40,140
Don’t come, Shiva.

2091
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,890
Don’t come out!

2092
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:44,430
The truth should come out.

2093
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,140
Shiva! He won’t do anything.

2094
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:49,060
Justice should be done to all those
who died with your brother.

2095
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:50,720
Go away.

2096
02:02:50,890 --> 02:02:52,560
Hey, hey, hey! Shiva!

2097
02:02:52,890 --> 02:02:54,850
Your dad speaks like a mad man.

2098
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:56,470
I am holding the gun point blank.

2099
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:58,470
If I pull the trigger…He won’t do anything.
-Shiva! Ignore him!

2100
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,350
If you want your dad bring Raju here.

2101
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:03,890
Come on!
-He won’t do anything.

2102
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:06,220
Don’t come, Shiva!
You promised me!

2103
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:07,680
You promised on your uniform!

2104
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:09,890
Hey! We made many such promises.

2105
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:12,270
Shiva! Do you want your dad?

2106
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:14,720
Or you want to take Raju to the court?
-Dad!

2107
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,970
Please listen to me. He planned to kill us!
-Leave me.

2108
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:18,220
Decide!

2109
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:19,890
I will count to ten.

2110
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:21,890
What will you do?
Kill me? Huh? Kill me!

2111
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:23,060
Hey, I will shoot you.

2112
02:03:23,310 --> 02:03:24,890
I will shoot you down!
-Shoot me, then!

2113
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:29,890
My son, who hasn’t even seen life,
is fearlessly walking towards death…

2114
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:32,350
why should I, who saw it all,
be afraid of death?

2115
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,140
-Dad! Don’t. Please.
-Don’t believe him.

2116
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:35,350
Shiva!

2117
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:37,890
You shouldn’t be defeated because of me.
-Hey, Shiva!

2118
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:39,890
Your dad is blabbering something.
-Let go of me. Dad…

2119
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:41,430
If you don’t step out with him…
-Listen to me!

2120
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:50,060
Dad!

2121
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:54,720
Dad!

2122
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:58,560
Shiva…Shiva!
-Dad, dad…

2123
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:02,220
Hey!

2124
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:03,100
Dad!

2125
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:04,220
Shiva!

2126
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:09,970
Hey!

2127
02:04:19,890 --> 02:04:21,680
Brother, come! Come fast!

2128
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:22,770
Shiva!

2129
02:04:22,930 --> 02:04:24,350
Come, come fast!

2130
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:27,890
Hurry up, hurry up!
Get in, get in!

2131
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:29,100
Dad!

2132
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,140
Shiva, Shiva!

2133
02:04:32,310 --> 02:04:33,850
Dad!
-Shiva, get in!

2134
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:35,720
Hey!
-Dad!

2135
02:04:38,890 --> 02:04:40,470
Revathi, leave me!

2136
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:41,970
Revathi, leave me!

2137
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,060
Dad!
-Move, move fast!

2138
02:04:45,850 --> 02:04:52,600
“How could you leave me?
Dad, O dad!”

2139
02:04:53,890 --> 02:04:55,850
Dad!
-Shiva, listen to me!

2140
02:04:55,890 --> 02:05:03,100
“Why have you gone away?
Dad, O dad!”

2141
02:05:05,470 --> 02:05:12,850
“Before my eyes and too early
is severed our deep attachment”

2142
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:20,770
“In this bottomless grief
My world has come to an end”

2143
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:23,520
“It’s time to part ways
and this moment feels so empty”

2144
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:26,520
“O, How terrible this is!”

2145
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:30,770
There is money in this bag.

2146
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:33,600
Take it and live somewhere happily.

2147
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:38,310
If you say, ‘No. I don’t want this money.

2148
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:41,890
I want morality, justice, and honesty.’

2149
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,350
They will first kill him.

2150
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:46,060
Then they will kill you.

2151
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:49,680
What are you staring at?

2152
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:52,890
Killing his dad was never on my list.

2153
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:54,640
It wasn’t my fault.

2154
02:05:55,310 --> 02:05:56,600
It was his fault.

2155
02:05:58,220 --> 02:05:59,640
How many times did I tell him?

2156
02:05:59,810 --> 02:06:01,640
‘Don’t come with me. Don’t.’

2157
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:02,850
Did you listen?

2158
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:05,270
At least you tell him.

2159
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:08,430
That he should live with the others.
And to live so.

2160
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:11,060
Okay?

2161
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:14,640
Take that money settle down somewhere.

2162
02:06:15,890 --> 02:06:17,220
Invite me to your wedding.

2163
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,640
I will come, eat biryani and go.

2164
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:30,890
They said whoever kills Raju
becomes the next Raju, brother.

2165
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:36,220
Instead of some outsider,
isn’t it better I kill you?

2166
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:38,310
After all I am your own brother.

2167
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:40,850
Why did you stab me here then?

2168
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,350
The liver is on the right.

2169
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:45,020
You should have stabbed me here.

2170
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:46,640
Shiva!

2171
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,020
Shiva, no, Shiva. Don’t go.

2172
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:56,720
Without even knowing where the liver is,

2173
02:06:57,640 --> 02:06:59,310
how can you become Raju?

2174
02:07:00,850 --> 02:07:02,020
Hey!

2175
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:03,020
-Shiva!
-Let go.

2176
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:04,100
-Shiva!
-Revathi, let go!

2177
02:07:04,270 --> 02:07:05,350
Shiva…

2178
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:09,470
Hey!

2179
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:10,810
Shiva!

2180
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:14,600
Raju! Raju, come.

2181
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:15,890
Raju!

2182
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:21,890
Raju!

2183
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:23,350
Let’s go.

2184
02:07:32,970 --> 02:07:34,640
Revathi! Revathi… Revathi!

2185
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:44,350
Hey, Shiva!

2186
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:47,640
Raju! Raju, come.
-Shiva!

2187
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:50,020
Raju, come.
Revathi, come.

2188
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:56,640
Come! Let’s board the train.

2189
02:07:57,100 --> 02:07:58,060
Revathi! Get in!

2190
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:01,520
Get in.

2191
02:08:19,470 --> 02:08:21,640
You kept saying…
Brother will come. Brother will come.

2192
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:25,060
He has come.

2193
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:26,640
What happened?

2194
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:29,640
No one around you is fair to you.

2195
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:33,100
Not even your own brother.

2196
02:08:37,310 --> 02:08:38,310
What did you say?

2197
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:43,220
That I can’t even
step out of this village with you?

2198
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:46,180
See how far we have come.

2199
02:08:50,350 --> 02:08:51,470
Truth wins.

2200
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:54,100
It takes time.

2201
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:55,850
But it wins.

2202
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:00,180
You said my dad’s death won’t be
on your list.

2203
02:09:01,970 --> 02:09:03,020
Fine, it won’t.

2204
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:05,640
But do you know why my dad died?

2205
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,310
Hmm?

2206
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:09,100
For truth to come out.

2207
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:17,180
Stand on the side of justice and see.

2208
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,720
Your very life will change.

2209
02:09:24,810 --> 02:09:25,640
-Hey!
-Shiva!

2210
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,640
Shiva, let go!
Shiva, leave!

2211
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:28,640
Hey!

2212
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:33,060
Shiva, leave!
Shiva! Move aside!

2213
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:45,060
Hey, Shiva! Leave me!
-Revathi, get the gun!

2214
02:09:47,270 --> 02:09:48,220
Hey!

2215
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:54,640
Revathi, Revathi, Revathi!

2216
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:56,640
Go to the engine.
This train shouldn’t stop anywhere.

2217
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:57,640
Do you get it?
-How could I, Shiva?

2218
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:00,310
Revathi! You have a gun in your hand.
Use the gun if necessary.

2219
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:02,640
Go to the engine immediately,
-But the train shouldn’t stop at any station.

2220
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:04,220
Go, Revathi. Go!
-This train doesn’t have any stops.

2221
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:06,350
Go, pack the bags.
Keep the camera safe!

2222
02:10:24,390 --> 02:10:25,390
Maintaining hundred.

2223
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:27,430
Over, over.
-Keep your walkie there.

2224
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:29,390
Right there.

2225
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:38,100
Make it fast. Faster.
-Okay, okay.

2226
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:39,850
-Get in!
-Get in!

2227
02:10:39,970 --> 02:10:41,680
Why do you stare? Faster.
-I am doing it, madam.

2228
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:46,890
-Get in, come!
-Get in!

2229
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:48,310
Let’s go!

2230
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:13,390
Come, come!

2231
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:26,600
Hey!

2232
02:11:31,770 --> 02:11:32,680
Hey!

2233
02:11:33,180 --> 02:11:34,350
Hey!

2234
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,600
Close it, close it.

2235
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:07,720
Hey!

2236
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:27,520
Raju! Come.
Raju, get up. Up!

2237
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:29,350
Raju! Come.
Let’s get to the engine.

2238
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,520
Come!

2239
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:34,020
Careful. Come!

2240
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:35,850
Come, Raju. Get in.

2241
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:37,060
Raju!

2242
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:40,350
Raju! Raju!

2243
02:14:41,310 --> 02:14:42,520
Raju! Come.

2244
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:46,720
Raju! Raju…

2245
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:48,520
Raju!
Give me your hand.

2246
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:49,720
Give me your hand.

2247
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:51,850
Raju! Come, come.

2248
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,390
Raju!

2249
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:57,520
Come!

2250
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,850
Raju! What are you doing?

2251
02:15:01,970 --> 02:15:03,520
Raju, what are you up to? Raju?

2252
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:04,930
Raju… no!

2253
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:08,100
Raju!

2254
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:09,520
Raju!

2255
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:11,520
Hey!

2256
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:12,970
Raju!

2257
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:16,890
Hey, hey! Stop the train!

2258
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:19,520
Hey!

2259
02:15:21,970 --> 02:15:22,890
Raju!

2260
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:24,220
Why, man?

2261
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:27,600
Damn!

2262
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:32,600
What, Raju?

2263
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:34,770
Were you in my place,

2264
02:15:35,930 --> 02:15:37,520
you would do the same, won’t you?

2265
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:41,770
Honestly, I wouldn’t.

2266
02:15:44,350 --> 02:15:46,520
I wouldn’t make you suffer so much.

2267
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:50,770
The moment I received the instructions,
I would kill you.

2268
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:53,520
Do you have a matchbox?

2269
02:15:58,520 --> 02:15:59,520
Hey…

2270
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:02,180
Raju! Raju!

2271
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:06,890
Raju…

2272
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:22,220
Hail! CM Dakshayani.

2273
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:25,270
Hail! CM Dakshayani.

2274
02:16:25,770 --> 02:16:28,220
Hail! CM Dakshayani.

2275
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:47,680
Your Honour!

2276
02:16:48,310 --> 02:16:51,520
Since the CBI has failed to present
witnesses at the arraignment,

2277
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:55,350
it is evident that CM’s name
was maliciously drawn into the case.

2278
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:59,180
Hence, I request Your Honour
to strike the case.

2279
02:16:59,350 --> 02:17:01,520
Your Honour!
The witness is here, Your Honour.

2280
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:04,970
With your permission…

2281
02:17:05,310 --> 02:17:06,180
Permitted.

2282
02:17:24,310 --> 02:17:25,310
Shiva, ma’am.

2283
02:17:39,770 --> 02:17:40,640
My Lord!

2284
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:42,470
I am Shiva.

2285
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:46,560
A constable from Sakhinetipalli police station.
ID number 1302.

2286
02:17:46,970 --> 02:17:53,140
While CBI officer George and I were
bringing the witness, Raju, to the court,

2287
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:58,020
IG Nataraj and a few police officials
killed both of them.

2288
02:17:58,310 --> 02:18:01,310
So, are you going to give witness
instead of Raju?

2289
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:03,100
Who said I am going to?

2290
02:18:04,350 --> 02:18:05,560
Raju will do it himself.

2291
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:07,560
But you just said he was killed.

2292
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:10,140
Is he going to come back to life
and make a statement?

2293
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:11,180
He will.

2294
02:18:11,350 --> 02:18:13,310
The train shouldn’t stop in between.
Go, Revathi!

2295
02:18:13,310 --> 02:18:15,470
Go to the engine. Go! Go!

2296
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:17,720
Hey, this train is not going to stop anywhere.

2297
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:20,180
Pack the luggage first.
Keep the camera safe inside.

2298
02:18:20,270 --> 02:18:22,310
Get down, first.
Let’s get off wherever the trains slows down.

2299
02:18:33,310 --> 02:18:34,310
What is this?

2300
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:36,520
Sorry, ma’am, sorry.
Just a minute. Sorry.

2301
02:18:47,310 --> 02:18:48,720
Shiva! Is this okay?
-Uh, okay.

2302
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:50,020
Ready.

2303
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:52,270
Greetings to you all.

2304
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:54,310
I am Rajasekhar.

2305
02:18:54,810 --> 02:18:55,810
Raju…

2306
02:18:57,140 --> 02:19:02,390
If I am not physically present there
and you are watching this video,

2307
02:19:03,020 --> 02:19:06,060
it can only mean the CM
has already got me killed.

2308
02:19:08,390 --> 02:19:10,350
I want to tell you lots of things.

2309
02:19:11,970 --> 02:19:13,310
A few years ago,

2310
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:17,180
in the gas leak accident
at Morampudi junction,

2311
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:19,310
nearly forty lives were lost.

2312
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:23,270
But it was not accident.

2313
02:19:23,890 --> 02:19:29,680
It was a well-planned bomb blast to efface
the body of IAS Officer Radha Krishna.

2314
02:19:30,970 --> 02:19:34,310
Discovering the wrong doings of the CM
and her many illegal activities,

2315
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:37,470
the IAS officer had confronted her.

2316
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:53,310
Then,

2317
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:56,310
Mr Natraj and I
placed his body in a car…

2318
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:58,310
and blew it up at Morampudi junction.

2319
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:04,390
It was also me who had brought the
low quality chemicals that caused it.

2320
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:06,810
It was CM who told me to bring it.

2321
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:09,310
I acted only on her instructions.

2322
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:13,560
I have done many such things
at the CM’s behest.

2323
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:16,180
This is my dying declaration.

2324
02:20:17,310 --> 02:20:18,310
Madam!
-Madam!

2325
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:22,310
The money I took from the party...

2326
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:29,720
and the voice recordings of my conversations
with them are all kept in a safe place.

2327
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:32,970
Shiva will hand them over to you.

2328
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:38,720
Hey, brother! One minute.

2329
02:20:40,310 --> 02:20:41,390
There is something else.

2330
02:20:42,890 --> 02:20:47,560
The first time I saw CM,
I fell in love with her.

2331
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:53,310
I don’t want to express it!

2332
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:55,560
Revathi asked me to express my love.

2333
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:57,310
Revathi, I have said it.

2334
02:21:00,970 --> 02:21:02,020
That’s all. That’s it.

2335
02:21:14,310 --> 02:21:17,180
After examining the contents of this case,

2336
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:23,930
since Raju, marked as the main witness,
is not able to attend the court,

2337
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:32,350
Raju’s dying declaration handed over by Shiva,
is accepted as the principal proof.

2338
02:21:33,310 --> 02:21:42,140
The CBI must collect all proofs
and other material from Shiva and act upon it.

2339
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:44,310
The court orders CBI to this effect.

2340
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:52,560
Also, the accused number one
in this case, Dakshayani,

2341
02:21:53,310 --> 02:21:55,810
and the accused number two,
IG Nataraj,

2342
02:21:56,270 --> 02:22:00,310
and the police officers
who cooperated with the accused…

2343
02:22:01,350 --> 02:22:05,390
should immediately be taken into
CBI’s custody for investigation.

2344
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:12,100
The report must be submitted within 21 days
as ordered by this court.

2345
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:18,180
The court is adjourned.

2346
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:27,970
Thank you, Shiva.

2347
02:22:28,390 --> 02:22:29,680
You did a great job.

2348
02:22:30,310 --> 02:22:31,310
Thank you, sir.

2349
02:22:32,270 --> 02:22:33,310
If you want,

2350
02:22:33,810 --> 02:22:36,310
you can join CBI.
I can appoint you right away.

2351
02:22:39,310 --> 02:22:40,140
No, sir.

2352
02:22:40,350 --> 02:22:41,770
I prefer being a policeman.

2353
02:22:42,310 --> 02:22:43,310
This is my brother’s dream.

2354
02:22:45,180 --> 02:22:46,310
Hmm. Okay.

2355
02:22:46,970 --> 02:22:49,560
But you know… that our doors
are always open for you.

2356
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:51,100
Hmm.

2357
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:52,720
Thank you, sir.

2358
02:22:52,810 --> 02:22:53,770
All the best.

2359
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:14,140
Good job, Shiva.

2360
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:15,390
What you did is right.

2361
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:18,470
You, me, and everyone else is here
only to serve the public.

2362
02:23:18,970 --> 02:23:21,520
If it is going to do them good,
you should confront anyone.

2363
02:23:22,100 --> 02:23:24,180
Be it the CM or the PM.

2364
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:54,350
Shall we get married now?

2365
02:23:57,640 --> 02:23:59,640
Shiva, why don’t you marry Revathi
at least now?

2366
02:23:59,970 --> 02:24:01,310
Audiences are also waiting.

2367
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:33,390
“Jagada Jagada Jagadam
we are ready for a battle”

2368
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:37,060
Ragada Ragada Ragadam
We shall shake it all”

2369
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:42,680
“Let a thousand lives come
We shall swallow death again and again”

2370
02:24:42,890 --> 02:24:46,770
“With this seething, raging poison
Our call is a drum beat”

2371
02:24:49,060 --> 02:24:53,020
“I am the king of the jungle
Sky’s the limit but I always be humble”

2372
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:55,060
“Lot of people talk about this and that”

2373
02:24:55,060 --> 02:24:57,720
“ But…In the end they fumble”

2374
02:24:57,970 --> 02:25:01,890
“I go voice by the gate
Paps follow me as I am chilling on a break”

2375
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:05,770
“Talk to me nice cuz this man don’t play man;
if goes left, then it’s a little late”

2376
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:08,850
“Talk to me nice cuz
I can boost some enterprise”

2377
02:25:08,890 --> 02:25:11,060
“Rooms flare up when I jump on the mic”

2378
02:25:11,140 --> 02:25:13,220
“Walked on the yacht with a chica
on my right”

2379
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:15,470
“The life I am living is a hella pretty sight”

2380
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,720
“Hey, I am so fly, you know”

2381
02:25:17,890 --> 02:25:20,060
“Life’s going so high,
how’d you know?”

2382
02:25:20,140 --> 02:25:22,310
“You never thought
I could spit fires you know”

2383
02:25:22,310 --> 02:25:25,060
“I am making the whole cry, you know”

2384
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:27,020
“Hey, I am so fly, you know”

2385
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:29,270
“Life’s going so high, how’d you know?”

2386
02:25:29,270 --> 02:25:31,270
“You never thought
I could spit fires you know”

2387
02:25:31,310 --> 02:25:33,720
“Now the whole world knows
I am style you know…”
