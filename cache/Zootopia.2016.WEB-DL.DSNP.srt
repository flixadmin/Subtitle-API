SHEEP REPORTER: What do you
mean by that?

1667

A biological component.

1668
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,880
You know, something in their DNA.

In their DNA? Can you
elaborate on that, please?

Yes, what I mean is,

their aggressive...

you need to carry around fox repellent?

Are you afraid of me?
