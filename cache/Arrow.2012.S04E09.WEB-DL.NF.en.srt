It's the only play we got, man.

150
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,474
THEA:
<i>The HIVE has us outnumbered.</i>

151
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,227
If we have any chance of stopping Darhk,
we need to ask the city for help.

152
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,023
If we do this, it is gonna
paint a target on all of our backs.

153
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,484
-We can take care of ourselves
-Let's light 'em up.

-(CLEARS THROAT)

155
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,953
Thank you for coming, everyone. Thank you.

156
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,165
As today's tragedy has reminded us,
we are at war.

157
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,418
For six months, we have been besieged

158
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,463
by a nameless, and a faceless organization

159
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,091
that seems hell-bent
on destroying our city.

160
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,510
You know them as the Ghosts.

161
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,555
And while they may be anonymous,
their leader is not.

162
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,224
He has a face. He has a name,
and I think that it is high time

163
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,687
the people of Star City
know the truth about who he is.

164
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,149
His name is Damien Darhk.

165
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,111
He controls the Ghosts on behalf
of an organization known as HIVE.

166
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,948
HIVE wants this city to die.

167
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,660
Now I will be distributing this,
the only known photograph of Mr. Darhk,

168
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,412
to every news outlet and
social media feed in the country.

169
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,709
{\an8}<i>For months, this man
has made us afraid to walk the streets.</i>

170
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,669
{\an8}<i>I suggest that we return the favor.</i>

171
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,879
<i>We will also be setting up a hotline.</i>

172
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,632
<i>Now, individually,
Mr. Darhk may be able to defeat us.</i>

173
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,050
<i>But united...</i>

174
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,053
<i>He doesn't stand a chance.</i>

175
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,726
Congratulations, Damien. You're famous.

176
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,444
Well, that should get
his attention at the very least.

177
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,404
-You good with the hotline?
-I'm on it.

178
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,826
-Happy hunting.
-That is a whole lot of Hanukkah.

179
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,245
Yeah. For your campaign holiday party.

180
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,373
You better believe that my faith is
going to be well-represented.

181
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,168
Felicity, we just waved
a red flag in front of a bull.

182
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,045
That doesn't mean the bull
is gonna charge right away.

183
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,132
And it doesn't mean we can put
our entire lives on hold in the meantime.

184
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,594
-But... Help me out here, man.
-No can do.

185
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,846
-Can't throw a grenade then go to ground.
-John is right.

186
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,641
As much as your speech
was about outing Darhk,

187
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,602
it was also about sending the message
that you're not afraid anymore.

188
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,647
-And canceling your Christmas party...
-Holiday. Holiday.

189
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,356
Your holiday party

190
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,067
is sending the opposite message.

191
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,032
Okay. Talk to Lance,
see if he can get some extra security

192
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,117
<i>-for this holiday party.</i>
-Yes.

193
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,046
Could I ask you a question?

194
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,632
Now? Here? I mean...

195
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,677
What's the question?

196
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,638
Did we do the right thing?

197
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,641
You mean with Darhk?

198
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:45,895
Yeah. Well, he's gonna retaliate.

199
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:48,690
Somewhere. Some place and...

200
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,400
When he does, we'll be ready.

201
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,740
I think the drugs Reiter has
you and the other captives growing

202
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,283
is just funding his bigger plan,

203
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,493
searching for some sort of
mystical artifact.

204
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,872
-He likes his prayers and trinkets.
-And maps.

205
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,334
But I cannot make that one without
detailed survey maps of the island.

206
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,502
-Reiter doesn't have them?
-Not that I've seen.

207
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,798
But Reiter is not the first person to come
to this island while I've been here.

208
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,306
If you're here to give me
a Christmas present

209
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:26,894
you can keep whatever knife
or torture device you plan on giving me.

210
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,521
No presents.
Nothing gift-wrapped, at any rate.

211
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,690
I just wanted to check
and see how you're feeling.

212
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,738
I'm great.
Haven't wanted to snap anybody's neck

213
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,282
who's given me the wrong look
since Damien Darhk whammied me.

214
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,535
I think I might be cured, Dad.

215
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,124
So, you can keep whatever file
you have on a pedophile,

216
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,709
or meter maid, or politician,

217
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,587
whoever it is
that you think I'm gonna kill.

218
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,423
Since you told me about
your encounter with Damien Darhk,

219
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,844
-I had my minions looking into it.
-You love having minions.

220
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,596
Darhk's effect on you
had nothing to do with his exposure

221
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,931
to waters from the Lazarus Pit.

222
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,392
Then why do you think
he's affecting my bloodlust?

223
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:09,686
I don't know. There are very few things
in this world that scare me, Thea.

224
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,314
But I'm beginning to suspect
we're dealing with something

225
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,026
-that might fall into that category.
-Just cheer up, Dad.

226
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,028
Okay? It's Christmas.

227
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,239
We are dealing with universal forces
that I don't understand yet.

228
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,449
Please, promise me
that you will be careful.

229
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,911
I pinky promise.

232

You were not kidding
about the extra security.

233
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,976
-Where did you find all these guys?
-Well, a friend of mine is a SEAL.

who knew someone.

a million calls on the hotline.

She must love you right now.

the U.S. Army as your caterers?

Actually, they're marines.

-A little.

Don't worry. You're handsome,
duh, but you bat for the other team.

246

And I'm practically engaged.

I mean not engaged at all. Right?

It was the summer, actually.

-near the Great Barrier Reef.

Oliver was gonna propose to me
three months ago.

286
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,728
-What?
-Three months ago.

00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,355
-How do you know?
-It's a long story.

288

But he was gonna propose
and then we moved back here.

289

So why didn't he just pop the question
once you settled back in?

-Yes.
-No.

-I don't know.
-Is it Darhk?

Inasmuch as that he's the reason that
Laurel and Thea showed up on our doorstep

295

three months ago.
Right before you were going to propose.

296
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,800
And before you say anything,
you should know that my mom found the ring

-in the decorations box.
-It's not what you think.

And then I just needed
some time to rethink things.

Because you thought
I wasn't gonna say yes?

No. Because what we're doing is dangerous.

452
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,494
I'm here. Let my friends go.

453
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,288
I'm sorry, did you think this was
quid pro quo, Mr. Queen?

454
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,833
We had a deal. Now, let my friends go.

455
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,835
Patience.

456
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,631
Do you know who perfected the gas chamber?

457
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,924
The Nazis.

458
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,637
For years, I wondered why the world would
allow those monsters to exist,

459
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,222
let alone thrive.

460
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,725
<i>And then I realized,
the world needed them to.</i>

461
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:59,771
As horrible as it sounds,
every now and then humanity needs a reset.

462
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,272
A do-over.

463
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,399
<i>That time has come.</i>

-What is this?
<i>-A demonstration...</i>

465
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,614
Of the project
that you're gonna help us with,

466
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,616
once we install you as mayor.

467
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,535

and family's life insurance policy.

472

(WHISPERS) Good.

473
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,402
Oh, and by the way, thank you for
doing the legwork on skimming the bay.

474
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,281
My people were using the harbor
to create a certain type of algae.

475
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,242
One that would allow us
to do this undetected.

476
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,369
Hmm? Aw, bummer.

477
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,247
Well, at least he lasted longer
than the previous one.

478
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,707
I guess that's something.

479
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:04,753
All right, let's continue to adjust
the ratio of the bloom.

480
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:10,676
If you told me I'd ever get used to
seeing you dressed up like that, I'd...

481
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,387
Excellent, you've got your
bondage outfit on.

482
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,514
No mask for you?

483
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,099
Not my thing.

484
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,186
If we're going after Oliver,
wouldn't it make sense for you

485
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:23,479
to bring along a few of
your little ninja friends?

486
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,566
I can't afford to pit
the League against HIVE.

487
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,192
Do you have Oliver's location?

488
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,028
An abandoned industrial complex
outside Pennytown.

489
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,781
You'd think Darhk would've checked to see
if he was tagged with a tracker.

490
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,450
Well, I'm sure he did.
Damien's very thorough.

491
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,245
But Oliver had me tag him with
the same particulate nanotechnology

492
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,040
-he used on me last year.
-What about me?

493
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:45,543
-No. You'll blow your cover with Darhk.
-It's pretty much already blown.

494
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,213
-Can you give us the room?
-Happily.

495
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,924
I have enough father and daughter drama
in my life as it is.

496
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,383
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

497
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,135
Remember, we're on a clock.

498
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,307
Okay. If this is about you not trusting me
anymore after working with Darhk...

499
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,059
No. It's just the opposite.

500
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,269
You've done things.

501
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,021
Things that you'll
never forgive yourself for,

502
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:06,356
because you were protecting me.

503
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:09,359
But I'm the one who gets to decide
whether I need anyone's protection.

504
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,653
That's not how
parenting works, sweetheart.

505
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,072
I think that you and I can both agree that

506
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,950
our relationship
is a little unconventional.

507
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,703
(SIGHS) I guess the mask
should've been the first clue.

508
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,246
Listen, sweetheart.

509
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,207
You just be careful out there, all right?

510
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,669
'Cause I don't know what I'd do
if anything were to happen to you.

511
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:30,255
In fact, that's not true,
I know exactly what I would do.

512
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,423
And it'd be ugly.

513
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,600
These people. They're volunteers?

514
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,228
True believers. Every last one.

515
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,106

516
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:50,316
DARHK: <i>Aw...</i>

517
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,611
Well, I'll give you guys some privacy
to say your farewells.

518
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,287
-Are John and Thea all right?
-Yeah. I think so.

519
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,168
Please, don't tell me that
you traded your life for ours

520
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,170
because that would be
extremely Old Oliver.

521
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,673
I had to turn myself in.

522
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,299
It was the only way to know
where you were being held.

523
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:15,466
One little problem,

524
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,053
two if you think that Darhk is gonna
keep up his end of the bargain.

525
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,014
But what happens when the cavalry shows up
and the Green Arrow's not present?

526
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,557
Darhk is evil, not stupid.

527
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,350
I have that handled, Felicity.

528
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,436
It had to be this way.

529
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:30,440
Why? Because you think that we're in
this situation because of your decisions?

(SIGHS)

531

Look, I really hate to be the one
to break this to you, Oliver,

532
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:37,322
but you are not the boss of me.

533
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,951
And I am the one who decides
whether I need anyone's protection.

534
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,493
I know.

535
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,206
Back at the Christmas party from hell,
you said you were gonna propose

536
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,333
and you didn't because you weren't sure

537
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,668
our relationship
could survive this kind of life.

538
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,671
It was a holiday party.

539
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,383
And I had more to say,
but we were attacked.

540
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,678
And here we are, fighting...

541
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:05,516
Fighting our way through the danger
instead of running away from it.

542
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,520
Isn't that the whole point of marriage?

543
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,566
To get through the hard times because
we're together, not in spite of it?

544
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,819
Um...

545
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,449
Just so you know, if you had asked me...

546

Well, I think if you replay
our conversation in your mind,

559
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,239
our bargain was only, at best, implied.
Even so... Bad guy, remember?

00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,201
-You let them go.
-I will. Existentially speaking.

that you have over me.

you have something to fight for.

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,001
I'm gonna let you live long enough
to watch me kill your little green buddy.

607
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,673
Get clear!

608
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,264

(SPEAKING INCANTATION)

610
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,360
Are you sure that Darhk
didn't make it out of the explosion?

611
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,196
Have you seen any horror movies?

612
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,988
These guys don't stay dead.

613
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,158
Especially if you can't find a body.

614
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,452
Whoa! Glass half-empty much?

615
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,413
Good news is,
whatever Darhk had going on there,

616
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:02,623
-we lit it up pretty good.
-Where is Merlyn?

617
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,625
Said he had to attend to League business.

618
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,919
Can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I owe him one.

619
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,172
-I helped out a little bit, too.
-Yes, you did.

620
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,174
Wait. Aren't we supposed to
go to that thingy?

621
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,633
What thingy?

622
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,096
It's a surprise. You're not the only one
who can keep a secret.

-Shark!

625
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,440
Guess I don't taste very good.

626
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,235
(GROANS) Oh!

627
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,403
That is gonna leave a scar.

628
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:34,072
Ahhh...

629
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,449
What?

630
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,409
Well, hey, Taiana.

631
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,579
You're a little less dead
than you're supposed to be.

632
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,750
And you, you may not be a spy
but you're definitely a liar.

633
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,544
Which means you're probably
lying about being a spy.

634
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,465
I'm gonna enjoy taking pieces out of you.

-ANDY: What do you want?
-DIGGLE: To talk.

636
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,311
-Thought you gave up on that.
-I did.

637
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,938
Until I met your cult leader,
Damien Darhk.

638
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,315
It's not a cult.

639
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,900
The man has people, regular people,

640
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,778
honest people, I'm thinking,
so brainwashed.

641
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,656
They're willing to die for him. Cult.

642
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,783
You know what?
Think what you wanna think.

643
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:22,120
It's a free country. For now.

644
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,954
This isn't you, Andy.

645
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,919
The man I knew...

646
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,630
Pulled me out of dark waters...

647
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,133
Convinced me to keep going
when I didn't see the point.

648
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,636
No. What you didn't see,
what you failed to see

649
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,929
is the man I really am.

650
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:43,391
Right in front of you. The whole time.

651
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,143
So my brother's a Ghost.

652
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:49,230
Fine. We'll treat you like a Ghost.

653
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,614
Your vigilante problem's getting worse.

654
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:01,701
Oh, relax, Ms. Nixon.
Focus on the here and now.

655
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,245
There's concerns that
you're leading us off the rails.

656
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,374
No. I'm leading us
exactly where we need to be.

657
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,086
Beautiful, isn't it?

658
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,255
(CHUCKLES) And I don't even like corn.

659
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,635
Go ahead. Breathe. Drink it in.
Tell me what it reminds you of.

660
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,181
-It seems so real.
-Ah. I liken it to the air on Everest.

661
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:27,017
A little thin, maybe but just enough
to keep things interesting.

662
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,019
I thought the tests had failed.

663

Not the last one.

664

we engineered from Star City Bay,

Here to show the people
that you're not backing down.

670

All you got to do is flick a switch
and give a speech.

That's it?

672
