1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,080
BOY: Baba...

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,480
MAN: Yes, my son.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,040
BOY:
Tell me a story.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,320
Which one?

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,560
The story of home.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,320
Millions of years ago...

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,040
a meteorite
made of vibranium...

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,520
the strongest substance
in the universe...

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,600
struck the continent
of Africa...

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,680
affecting the plant life
around it.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
And when
the time of man came...

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,880
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,160
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
until a warrior shaman...

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,640
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,840
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
a plant that granted him

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,360
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,920
The warrior became king...

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,480
and the first Black Panther...

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,200
the protector of Wakanda.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,200
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,680
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,520
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,960
more advanced
than any other nation.

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,800
But as Wakanda thrived...

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,360
the world around it descended
further into chaos.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,760
To keep vibranium safe...

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,880
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,720
keeping the truth
of their power

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
from the outside world.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,200
And we still hide,  Baba?

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,200
Yes.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,040
BOY: Why?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,760
BY TOO $HORT PLAYING)

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,320
Lucky shot!
That ain't lucky!

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,840
Whatever!
Get outta here!

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Check up.

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,200
Pick your man up!
He open.

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,400
Where you at?

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,360
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,720
Pass! Pass!

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,000
Got you, E.
E, hurry up!

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,680
Watch me get this.

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,640
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
KID: Come on.

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
BOY:
What you got?

48
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
You ain't got nothing.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
MAN: Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
won't be no worries.

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
You in the van,
come in through
from the west.

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,480
Come around the corner.

53
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,720
Land right here.
Mmm-hmm.

54
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,520
Me and the twins
are pulling up
right here.

55
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,800
We're leaving
this car behind,
okay? We come this...

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Hide the straps.

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Yo, is it the Feds?

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
No.

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,520
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
They're holding spears.

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,760
Open it.

62
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,640
JAMES: You serious?

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,360
They won't knock again.

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,240
Who are you?

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,480
Prince N'Jobu,
son of Azzuri.

66
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,680
Prove to me
you are one of us.

67
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,480
My King.

68
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,480
Leave us.

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
This is James.
I trust him with
my life. He stays...

70
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,880
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

71
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,480
As you wish.

72
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,760
At ease.

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
Come, baby brother.

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,240
Let me see
how you are holding up.

75
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,440
You look strong.

76
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,520
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
How is home?

78
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,840
Not so good.

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Baby brother.

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,360
There has been an attack.

81
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,000
This man...

82
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,080
Ulysses Klaue...

83
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,480
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,920
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

85
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,760
Many lives were lost.

86
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,120
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

87
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,840
and how to strike.

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,920
He had someone
on the inside.

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,080
Why are you here?

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,640
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.

92
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,440
I did no such thing.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
Tell him who you are.

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,840
Zuri, son of Badu...

95
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,000
What?

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
James. James,
you lied to me?

97
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Leave him.

98
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

99
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
You betrayed Wakanda!

100
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,600
How could you lie
to me like...

101
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,640
Stand down.

102
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,560
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

103
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,760
Prince N'Jobu...

104
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,560
you will return home
at once...

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,600
where you will face
the Council...

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,400
and inform them
of your crimes.

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,880
Check up!

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,560
Guard your man,
guard your man!

109
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Yo.

110
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,880
REPORTER:
The tiny nation of Wakanda

111
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,520
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,760
after a terrorist attack

114
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
at the United Nations
a week ago.

115
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,840
The suspect
has since been apprehended.

116
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,960
Though it remains one of

117
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,200
the poorest countries
in the world...

118
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
fortified by
mountain ranges...

119
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,880
and an impenetrable
rainforest...

120
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,120
Wakanda does not engage

121
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,840
in international trade
or accept aid.

122
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,280
The succession
of the throne...

123
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,640
is expected to fall
to the oldest

124
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,040
of the king's
two children...

125
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
Prince T'Challa.

126
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,400
OKOYE: My Prince...

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,480
coming up on them now.

128
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,920
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

129
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,200
Hmm.

130
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,120
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

131
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,360
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

132
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,080
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,920
I never freeze.

134
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
MILITANT 1: What's going on?

135
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,600
MILITANT 2: It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.

136
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,840
The car no start.

137
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
MILITANT 3: What happened?

138
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,680
MILITANT 4: The engine failed.

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
MILITANT 1: Ours, too.

140
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,640
What is it, Captain?

141
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,640
Defense positions.

142
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
Defense positions.

143
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,600
MILITANT 2:
Are we under attack?

144
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,160
Defense positions.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,480
Get around to the side.

146
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,520
Defense positions.

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,840
Hey. Defense positions!

148
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,840
No games.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
What do you see?

150
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,960
Come in. Come in.

151
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,480
Over there! Look back!

152
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Watch out!

153
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,520
NAKIA: T'Challa, no!

154
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,960
This one's just a boy.

155
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,480
He got kidnapped as well.

156
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
BLACK PANTHER:
Nakia...

157
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,120
I...

158
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,840
I wanted...
MILITANT 1: Hey!

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,680
I have her!
Don't move!
I will shoot!

160
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
I will shoot her right now.

161
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,320
You froze.

162
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,320
BLACK PANTHER: Ah...

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,160
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
My father is dead, Nakia.

165
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,760
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.

166
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,800
And I wish for you
to be there.

167
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,600
NAKIA:
Carry yourselves home now.

168
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
WOMAN: Thank you.

169
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,280
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

170
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,720
Thank you oh.

171
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,560
You will speak
nothing of this day.

172
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Yes.

173
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Thank you.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Thank you.

175
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,720
OKOYE: Sister Nakia...

176
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,680
My Prince...

177
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
we are home.

178
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,040
This never gets old.

179
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,240
Queen Mother...

180
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,160
Princess...

181
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,240
My comfort
for your loss.

182
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,480
RAMONDA: Thank you, Nakia.

183
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,280
It is so good
to have you back with us.

184
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Take her to
the River Province

185
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,800
to prepare her
for the ceremony.

186
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,160
Yes, General.

187
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,400
Did he freeze?

188
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Like an antelope
in headlights.

189
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,480
Are you finished?

190
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,440
So surprised
my little sister came

191
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,440
to see me off
before our big day.

192
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
You wish!

193
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

194
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,840
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,480
How many times
do I have to teach you?

196
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,840
Just because
something works

197
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,640
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

198
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,960
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

199
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,280
SHURI: More than you.

200
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,920
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...

201
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,960
to your ceremonial outfit.

202
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,560
Shuri!

203
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,360
Sorry, Mother!

204
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,200
How are you
feeling today, Mama?

205
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,720
Proud.

206
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,480
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

207
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,040
He is with us...

208
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,240
and it is your time
to be king.

209
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,080
Good morning.

210
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,720
How can I help you?

211
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,760
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

212
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,040
They tell me
you're the expert.

213
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,400
Ah. You could say that.

214
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,240
They're beautiful.

215
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,880
Where's this one from?

216
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,480
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

217
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,920
present day Ghana...

218
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,160
19th century.

219
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
For real?

220
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,320
What about this one?

221
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,120
That one's from
the Edo people of Benin...

222
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,200
16th century.

223
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,320
Now, tell me about this one.

224
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,280
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

225
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,440
Fula tribe, I believe.

226
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,920
Nah.

227
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,760
I beg your pardon?

228
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,800
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

229
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,080
but it's from Wakanda.

230
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,720
And it's made
out of vibranium.

231
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,520
Don't trip.

232
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,080
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.

233
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,440
These items aren't for sale.

234
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,200
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

235
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
You think they paid
a fair price?

236
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,200
Or did they take it,
like they took
everything else?

237
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,280
Sir, I'm going to have to

238
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,840
ask you to leave.

239
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,520
You got all this
security in here

240
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,080
watching me
ever since I walked in.

241
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,640
But you ain't checking for

242
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,760
what you put in your body.

243
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,080
All right, mate.
Let's have it.

244
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,720
Come on, mate. Time.

245
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,360
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

246
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,880
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

247
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,720
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

248
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,920
GUARD: Medical emergency
right away

249
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,400
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

250
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Look out.

251
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

252
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,160
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

253
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,640
I'm gonna take a break.

254
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,040
MEDIC 1: Let's give the lady
some space, please.

255
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,240
MEDIC 2: Step back,
please, gents.

256
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,640
Step back, please.

257
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,400
Hey, come here.

258
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,480
Come here. It's okay.

259
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,360
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

260
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

261
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,080
Because it's better to leave

262
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
the crime scene
more spread out.

263
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,080
Makes us look
like amateurs.

264
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,040
Now then,
let's see if you know

265
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,720
what you're talking about.

266
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,640
That's just a taste.

267
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,080
You're gonna be a rich boy.

268
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,320
You better sell that quick.

269
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,120
It's already sold!

270
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Whatever you try,

271
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

272
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,600
That'll make my day.

273
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

274
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,400
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

275
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,360
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

276
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,040
Onward!

277
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
Onward!

278
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,040
I, Zuri...

279
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,320
son of Badu...

280
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,240
give to you...

281
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
Prince T'Challa...

282
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,480
the Black Panther!

283
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,000
The prince...

284
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,760
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

285
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,200
stripped away.

286
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
Praise the ancestors.

287
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,520
Praise the ancestors.

288
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,640
Victory in ritual combat...

289
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,360
comes by yield or death.

290
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,080
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior...

291
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
I now offer...

292
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,680
a path to the throne.

293
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,120
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

294
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,200
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

295
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,960
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

296
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,920
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

297
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,000
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

298
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,080
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

299
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,640
This corset
is really uncomfortable...

300
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,080
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

301
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,760
Mother!

302
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Are they Jabari?
Yes.

303
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,360
M'Baku, what are you
doing here?

304
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,480
It's challenge day.

305
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,320
We have watched...

306
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,480
and listened
from the mountains!

307
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,600
We have watched
with disgust...

308
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,560
as your
technological advancements

309
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,720
have been overseen
by a child!

310
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,760
Who scoffs at tradition!

311
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,440
And now you want to
hand the nation

312
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,440
over to this prince...

313
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,560
who could not keep
his own father safe.

314
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,160
Mmm?

315
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,240
We will not have it.

316
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,480
I said,
we will not have it, oh!

317
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,160
I, M'Baku...

318
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,440
leader of the Jabari...

319
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,880
I accept your challenge,
M'Baku.

320
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,080
Glory to Hanuman.

321
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,360
Jabari!

322
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Dora Milaje!

323
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,480
Onward!

324
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,440
Let the challenge begin!

325
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,080
Oh!

326
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
M'BAKU: Stand up!

327
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,800
Come!

328
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,360
WOMAN: T'Challa!

329
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,040
Where is your god now?

330
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,040
Yes!

331
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,600
No powers.

332
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
No claws.

333
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,360
No special suit, oh!

334
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,560
Just a boy not fit to lead!

335
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Show him who you are!

336
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
I am Prince T'Challa...

337
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,760
son of King T'Chaka!

338
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,560
You can do this,
T'Challa!

339
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Yes!

340
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Come on!

341
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
Yield!
Don't make me kill you.

342
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
I would rather die!

343
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,400
T'Challa!

344
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
T'Challa!

345
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,400
T'Challa!

346
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
T'Challa!

347
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,240
T'Challa!

348
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
You have fought with honor!

349
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,200
Now yield!
Your people need you.

350
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
T'Challa!

351
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
T'Challa!

352
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,000
Yield, man!

353
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,440
T'Challa!

354
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
T'Challa!

355
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,200
Yes! Yes!

356
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,360
ZURI: I now present to you...

357
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,840
King T'Challa...

358
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,440
the Black Panther.

359
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,560
Zuri.

360
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,680
My King.

361
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,000
Wakanda forever!

362
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,240
ALL: Wakanda forever!

363
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,200
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

364
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,520
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

365
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,600
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

366
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,160
ZURI: T'Chaka...

367
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,360
we call on you.

368
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,400
Come here to your son.

369
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,360
Praise the ancestors.

370
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,240
Father.

371
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,920
My son.

372
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm sorry.

373
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,720
T'CHAKA: Stand up.

374
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,080
You are a king.

375
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
What is wrong my son?

376
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,760
I am not ready.

377
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,960
Have you not prepared

378
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,320
to be king
your whole life?

379
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,040
Have you not trained
and studied,

380
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,040
been by my side?

381
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,480
That is not
what I am talking about.

382
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,600
I am not ready
to be without you.

383
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,760
A man who has not prepared
his children

384
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,400
for his own death...

385
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,720
has failed as a father.

386
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,440
Have I ever failed you?

387
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,440
Never.

388
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,720
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.

389
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,440
I want to be
a great king, Baba.

390
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Just like you.

391
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,000
You're going to struggle.

392
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,000
So you'll need to
surround yourself

393
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,800
with people you trust.

394
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,200
You're a good man
with a good heart.

395
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,720
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

396
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,520
Breathe.

397
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,240
T'Challa, breathe.

398
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,360
Breathe.

399
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
He was there.

400
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,680
He was there.
My father.

401
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Just one?

402
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,240
Come home, Nakia.

403
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,640
I'm right here.

404
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,280
Stay.

405
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,440
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

406
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,960
but I can't stay.

407
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,960
I found
my calling out there.

408
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,600
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

409
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,600
I can't be happy here...

410
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,480
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

411
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,520
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

412
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,840
Share what we have.

413
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,520
We could provide aid...

414
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
and access to technology

415
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,960
and refuge
to those who need it.

416
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,600
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

417
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,160
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

418
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,280
If the world found out
what we truly are...

419
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,920
what we possess...

420
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,760
we could lose
our way of life.

421
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,200
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others

422
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,120
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

423
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,800
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

424
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,480
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

425
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,160
Ah! See, you admit it!
If that's what I wanted.

426
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,920
T'CHALLA: Is that him?

427
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,160
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

428
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
W'KABI: Of course.

429
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
I see Nakia is back.

430
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,200
You guys going to work it out?

431
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,600
T'Challa...

432
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,840
what's wrong?

433
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,600
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.

434
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
More, like what?

435
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,200
Foreign aid,
refugee programs.

436
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,240
You let the refugees in...

437
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,880
they bring their problems
with them.

438
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,320
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

439
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,040
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

440
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,720
to go out there
and clean up the world,

441
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,400
then I'll be all for it.

442
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,800
But waging war
on other countries

443
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,480
has never been our way.

444
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,240
You, too, huh?

445
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,040
Bast! We're in trouble.

446
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
My King.

447
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,080
My love.

448
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,680
You will never guess
who just popped up
on our radar.

449
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,280
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

450
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,160
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

451
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,440
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...

452
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,440
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

453
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,960
in South Korea...

454
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,560
tomorrow night.

455
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,120
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

456
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,560
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

457
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,800
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

458
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,600
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

459
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,000
We need a king.

460
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,800
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

461
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,680
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

462
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,840
about what Klaue
took from us.

463
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
From me.

464
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,600
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.

465
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,920
W'KABI: Take me with you.

466
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

467
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,200
I need you here
protecting the border.

468
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,640
Then I ask...

469
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,920
you kill him
where he stands...

470
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,160
or you bring him
back to us.

471
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,480
You have my word.

472
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,360
I will bring him back.

473
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,840
We will proceed
with the mission.

474
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
My King!

475
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,760
Stop it. Stop it.

476
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,960
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

477
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,440
Who are you taking
with you to Korea?

478
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,960
Okoye.

479
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,560
And Nakia as well.

480
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,200
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

481
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,760
Yes.

482
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,960
We'll be fine.

483
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,960
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

484
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,280
Yes!

485
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,840
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

486
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

487
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
Unlimited range,

488
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,720
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

489
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,240
Check these out.

490
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,520
Remote access
Kimoyo Beads.

491
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,480
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

492
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,200
Ah.

493
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,320
And what are these?

494
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,400
The real question is
 what are those?

495
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,040
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

496
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,240
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?

497
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,200
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

498
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,280
I bet the Elders loved that.

499
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
Try them on.

500
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,680
Fully automated.

501
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,360
Like the old American movie
Baba  used to watch.

502
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
Mmm.

503
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,680
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

504
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Interesting.

505
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,760
Guess what I call them.

506
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,320
Sneakers.

507
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,240
Because you...

508
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,560
Never mind.

509
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,440
If you're going to take
on Klaue...

510
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,800
you'll need the best
the design group
has to offer.

511
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,080
Exhibit A.

512
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,800
T'CHALLA: My design.
SHURI: Old tech.

513
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,240
Old?
Functional, but old.

514
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,080
"Hey, people are
shooting at me.

515
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,120
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."

516
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
Enough.

517
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,920
Now, look at these.

518
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,880
Do you like that one?

519
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,320
Tempting.

520
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,560
But the idea
is to not be noticed.

521
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
This one.

522
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,080
Now tell it to go on.

523
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,600
Ooh!

524
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,840
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

525
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,160
Strike it.

526
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,320
Anywhere?
Mmm-hmm.

527
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,440
Not that hard, genius!

528
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,840
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

529
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,280
I invite you to my lab,

530
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,840
and you just
kick things around?

531
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,720
Well, maybe
you should make it
a little stronger.

532
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,840
Hey.

533
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,480
Wait a minute.

534
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,360
SHURI: The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...

535
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,920
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

536
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,440
Very nice.

537
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,240
Strike it again
in the same spot.

538
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,400
You're recording?

539
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,720
For research purposes.

540
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,600
Delete that footage.

541
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,000
This way.

542
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,600
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...

543
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,760
and I can
get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

544
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,160
It looks nice.
Just whip it back
and forth.

545
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,000
What?
It's a disgrace.

546
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,640
Hello Sophia.

547
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,160
Good to see you.

548
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,040
Who are these two?

549
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,240
My friends
from Kenya.

550
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,800
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

551
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,680
Good for trouble...

552
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,440
...like you?

553
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,720
Thank you!

554
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,840
Spread out.

555
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,400
The buyer
is likely already here.

556
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,920
The woman outside.

557
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,080
What trouble
was she referring to?

558
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,960
Ah... I got into
a disagreement

559
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,880
with some ivory traders.

560
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,080
Made a bit of a mess.
Hmm.

561
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,320
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

562
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,320
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

563
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,720
Depends...

564
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,080
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

565
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,080
Can we please focus?

566
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,120
Thank you.

567
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Over here.

568
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,320
One whiskey, please.

569
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,680
Eyes up. Americans.

570
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,480
I count three.

571
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,880
OKOYE: Five.

572
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,360
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

573
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,720
there behind you?

574
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,000
Six.

575
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,600
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

576
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,360
It just got
a little more complicated.

577
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,800
Agent Ross.

578
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,080
Your Highness.

579
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,160
You are buying from Klaue.

580
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,880
What I'm doing
or not doing...

581
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,480
on behalf of
the U.S. government

582
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,760
is none of your concern.

583
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,600
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

584
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,840
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

585
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,280
I gave you Zemo.

586
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,840
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...

587
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,600
that the king of
a third world country

588
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,640
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?

589
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,200
I'd say we were even.

590
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,960
You really need
to leave, now.

591
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,920
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

592
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,600
You've been warned.

593
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,560
CROUPIER: Three, craps.

594
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,440
Hey, you won!

595
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,320
You know what?

596
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
I think
I'll just take these...

597
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,360
bring them over here

598
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,800
and hold on for safekeeping.
ROSS: Mmm-hmm.

599
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,520
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

600
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,400
He cannot leave with Klaue.

601
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
All right.

602
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,440
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia

603
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,520
links back to a person...

604
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,800
that I'm not actually saying

605
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,880
I'm here to make
a deal with...

606
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,440
but that deal
will not be called off.

607
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,880
When the dust settles,

608
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,480
you and me can work
something out.

609
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,520
I'm not here
to make a deal.

610
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,480
Klaue, plus eight!

611
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,760
General.

612
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,840
In position
to secure our exit.

613
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,000
And the vibranium?

614
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,760
I don't see it yet.

615
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,520
OKOYE: I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.

616
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,440
There's not supposed to be.

617
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,000
Somebody did not
get the memo.

618
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,480
Definitely armed.

619
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,200
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

620
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,520
You got a mixtape
coming out?

621
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,320
Yeah, actually, there is one.

622
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,400
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

623
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,880
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

624
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,640
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

625
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,560
I just meant you
got a lot of
people with you.

626
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,120
You think they're for you?

627
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,440
Don't worry.

628
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,480
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,

629
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,720
thank you very much.

630
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,600
OKOYE: Six more.
It's a setup.

631
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,840
You got the diamonds?

632
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,320
Okay. That's enough.

633
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,840
We need to move on Klaue.
T'CHALLA: Stand down.

634
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,920
We can't afford a shootout.

635
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,080
Vibranium?

636
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,560
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

637
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,200
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

638
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,320
It's now or never.

639
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,600
Stand down!

640
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,880
Hey!

641
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,160
Wakandans! They're here!

642
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,200
ROSS: Get outta here!
KLAUE: Kill 'em all!

643
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,440
Diamonds, quick!

644
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,280
Murderer!

645
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,160
You know, you look just like
your old man.

646
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,800
Let's get out
of here, boss!

647
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,480
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

648
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,200
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

649
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,600
Do we just leave him?
He'll catch up.

650
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,960
Shuri!

651
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
Yes!

652
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,120
AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote
driving system activated.

653
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,640
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?

654
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,840
T'CHALLA: For Bast's sake!

655
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,360
Just drive!
Okay, calm down!

656
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,320
Whoo! Let's go!

657
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,720
Put some music on.
What do you think
this is, a funeral?

658
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,800
Which one is he in now?

659
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,480
Hey, split up!

660
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,800
They're trying to lose us.
I'll take the right.

661
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,640
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

662
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,920
We're not going to make it!

663
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,640
BLACK PANTHER: Keep going!

664
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,760
Whoo! Brother!

665
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,760
Hey, what was that?

666
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,920
BLACK PANTHER: Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.

667
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,440
Guns.

668
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,000
So primitive!

669
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,000
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!

670
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,240
The bullets
won't penetrate!

671
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,480
What are you doing?

672
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,880
Just drive.

673
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,960
Whoo!
Shit!

674
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,960
Hey, look at your suit.

675
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,240
You've been taking bullets,

676
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,200
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

677
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,280
BLACK PANTHER:
Pull around the truck.

678
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,320
Where'd he go?

679
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,080
You show-off.

680
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,360
There he is!

681
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,760
Hold tight!

682
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,720
All right.
Let's have some fun!

683
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,080
Hop in.

684
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,960
Put that spear
in the trunk.

685
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,320
BLACK PANTHER: Faster, Shuri.

686
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,120
I'm going as fast as I can!

687
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,960
Take a right! Take a right!

688
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,720
No, no, no!

689
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,200
Brother!

690
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,760
BLACK PANTHER: Klaue!

691
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,520
Did you think
we would forget?

692
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,480
Look at me, murderer!

693
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,920
Where did you get this weapon?

694
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,760
You savages
didn't deserve it.

695
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,880
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

696
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,160
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

697
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,600
King!

698
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,080
The world watches.

699
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,160
Come on. Guys.
Let's go, huh?

700
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,240
Yeah.

701
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,920
KLAUE: Hello.

702
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,560
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

703
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,520
So this is
a big mess, huh?

704
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,880
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

705
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,360
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

706
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,360
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.

707
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes

708
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,400
than to make
a scene here.

709
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,840
After your questioning,

710
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,880
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

711
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,560
What? No. Look,
I like you, a lot.

712
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,520
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

713
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,360
Listen, I'm doing
you guys a favor

714
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,040
by letting you
even be in here.

715
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,880
If he touches you again,

716
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,800
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.

717
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,040
Does she speak English?

718
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,120
When she wants to.

719
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,000
Huh.

720
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,120
I'm going in.

721
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,400
When I'm done,
you guys are up.

722
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,360
Agent Ross.
Yeah?

723
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,800
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

724
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,560
You see that?

725
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,320
It's called diplomacy.

726
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
You're welcome.

727
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,560
BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN
AND JUNIOR TORELLO)

728
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,720
Okoye.

729
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,920
Play nice.

730
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,160
Americans.

731
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,120
You know,
you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

732
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,600
I'm much more your speed.

733
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,600
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

734
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,240
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

735
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,600
Where'd you get that?

736
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,480
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

737
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,000
But I can get you one,
if you like.

738
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,040
Why don't you
give me the name
of your supplier,

739
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,200
and I'll ask them.

740
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,800
He's right outside.

741
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,560
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

742
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,200
What? T'Challa?

743
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,680
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

744
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Bingo.

745
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,200
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

746
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,600
Um...

747
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,880
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.

748
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,320
It's all a front.

749
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,520
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.

750
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,160
El Dorado, the Golden City.

751
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,680
They thought they could
find it in South America...

752
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,720
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

753
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,680
A technological marvel.

754
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,240
All because it was built
on a mound

755
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,400
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

756
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,680
Isipho,  they call it.
The gift.

757
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,400
Vibranium.

758
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,720
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

759
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,120
It's not just a metal.

760
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,760
They sew it
into their clothes.

761
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,720
It powers their city,
their tech...

762
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,160
their weapons.

763
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,920
Weapons?

764
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,080
Yeah.

765
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,560
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

766
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,040
That's a nice fairy tale,

767
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,040
but Wakanda is
a third world country...

768
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,680
and you stole
all their vibranium.

769
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,120
I stole...

770
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,760
All of it?

771
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,640
I took a tiny piece of it.

772
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,520
They have
a mountain full of it.

773
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,880
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...

774
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,320
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.

775
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,480
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it

776
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,160
and got out of there alive.

777
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,000
If you don't believe me,

778
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,280
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.

779
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,200
What his claws
are made of.

780
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,880
Your father told
the UN...

781
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,960
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

782
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,680
But now he's telling me
you have more.

783
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,280
And you believe the word

784
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,880
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

785
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,760
Where is that?

786
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,480
Back there.

787
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,640
How much more
are you hiding?

788
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,960
Something is happening
out back.

789
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,240
Get down!

790
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,160
Stand down!

791
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,720
MAN 1: Cover!

792
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
MAN 2: Grenade!

793
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,720
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

794
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,800
My King!

795
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,720
My King.

796
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,440
Nakia.

797
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,000
He just jumped in front of me.

798
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,480
I don't think
he'll make it here.

799
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,960
It hit his spine.

800
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,280
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

801
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,560
This will stabilize him
for now.

802
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,080
Give him to us.

803
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,520
We can save him.

804
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,960
OKOYE: Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.

805
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,400
We failed.

806
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,800
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

807
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,480
How do we justify
bringing him
into our borders?

808
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,920
He took a bullet for me.

809
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,800
OKOYE: That was his choice.

810
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,520
So now we are
just supposed to
let him die?

811
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,520
Let us consider
that we heal him.

812
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,920
It is his duty
to report back
to his country.

813
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,760
And as king,
it is your duty
to protect ours.

814
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,360
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

815
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,160
I cannot just
let him die...

816
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,360
knowing we can save him.

817
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,000
Where exactly
are we taking him?

818
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,360
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

819
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,480
This is going to be fun.

820
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,840
He will live.

821
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,480
W'Kabi is here.

822
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,080
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

823
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,200
He's not here.

824
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,240
He slipped
through our hands.

825
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,040
"Slipped"?

826
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,800
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

827
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,160
With you, I thought
it'd be different.

828
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,040
But it's more of the same.

829
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,560
Let's get going, boss.

830
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,960
You always sell
to the CIA?

831
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,040
I sell
to the highest bidder.

832
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,320
But don't you worry.
When I get back
to Joburg...

833
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,800
and I lay low
for a bit,

834
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,280
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

835
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,160
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

836
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,240
I know you good for it.

837
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,000
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

838
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,080
You don't want to
go there, boy.

839
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,160
Yeah, I do.

840
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,120
KLAUE: Drop it!

841
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,760
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine

842
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,120
ends today.

843
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,680
Put your gun down now!

844
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,440
I'm sorry.

845
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,840
Sorry, Erik.
It's gonna be okay.

846
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,760
You really want to go
to Wakanda?

847
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,240
They're savages.

848
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,360
This is what they do
to people like us.

849
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,680
KILLMONGER: I ain't worried
about no brand.

850
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,320
Check these out.

851
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,000
Each one is for a kill.

852
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,160
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

853
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,160
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.

854
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,600
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

855
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,440
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

856
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,040
T'CHALLA: Leave us!

857
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,480
So your mission
did not go as planned.

858
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:18,200
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

859
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,720
My father told me
he disappeared.

860
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,280
There was a man today...

861
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,160
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

862
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,720
That is not possible.

863
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,600
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

864
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,000
My grandfather's ring!

865
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,720
Do not tell me
what is possible.

866
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,840
Tell me the truth!

867
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,120
Some truths...

868
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,600
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.

869
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,080
That is not your choice
to make.

870
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,920
What happened to him?

871
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,600
I promised the king
to say nothing.

872
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,600
I am your king now!

873
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,560
Your uncle took...

874
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,720
a War Dog assignment
in America.

875
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,720
Your father...

876
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,240
placed me there...

877
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,120
to observe...

878
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,720
unbeknownst to him.

879
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,800
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

880
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,640
They had a child.

881
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,400
The hardships
he saw there...

882
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,880
radicalized your uncle.

883
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,240
I observed
for as long as I could.

884
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,080
Their leaders
have been assassinated.

885
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,680
Communities flooded
with drugs and weapons.

886
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,200
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

887
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,440
All over the planet...

888
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,880
our people suffer because

889
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,960
they don't have the tools
to fight back.

890
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,280
With vibranium weapons,

891
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,920
they could overthrow
every country...

892
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,880
and Wakanda could
rule them all

893
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,280
the right way.

894
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,960
He knew your father
would not support this.

895
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,920
So, your uncle betrayed us.

896
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,280
No!

897
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,720
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.

898
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,680
No, no, no.

899
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,440
You will return home
at once...

900
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,440
where you will face
the Council...

901
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,560
and inform them
of your crimes.

902
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,440
ZURI: He drew his weapon
on me.

903
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,880
No!

904
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,720
ZURI: Your father
killed his own brother...

905
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,720
to save my life.

906
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,800
Speak nothing of this.

907
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,440
And the child?

908
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,840
We left him.

909
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,440
We had to...

910
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,720
maintain...

911
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,480
the lie.

912
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,360
What is this?

913
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,400
Just a little gift.

914
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,520
Who are you?

915
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,320
All right,
where am I?

916
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,120
Don't scare me
like that, colonizer!

917
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,440
What?
My name is Everett.

918
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,760
Yes, I know.
Everett Ross...

919
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,720
former air force pilot
and now CIA.

920
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,240
Right.

921
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,400
Okay, is this Wakanda?

922
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,160
No, it's Kansas.

923
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,040
How long ago was Korea?

924
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,320
SHURI: Yesterday.

925
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,480
I don't think so.

926
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,800
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

927
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,120
They do here.

928
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:57,520
But not by magic,
by technology.

929
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,200
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

930
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,400
ROSS: These train things...

931
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,760
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

932
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,000
Obviously.

933
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,400
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.

934
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,200
The light panels,
what are they?

935
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,880
Sonic stabilizers.
Sonic what?

936
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,520
In its raw form...

937
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,320
vibranium is too dangerous

938
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,160
to be transported
at that speed...

939
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,400
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

940
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,040
ROSS: There's vibranium
on those trains?

941
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,440
There's vibranium
all around us.

942
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,760
That's how I healed you.

943
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,280
Where is T'Challa?

944
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,440
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.

945
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,880
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

946
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,320
A man showed up
at the border

947
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,680
who claims
to have killed Klaue.

948
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,880
What?

949
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,480
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.

950
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,520
We need to find your brother!

951
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,720
An outsider?

952
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,480
No, a Wakandan.

953
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,080
He's not a Wakandan.

954
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,920
He's one of ours.

955
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,960
He killed his
own brother...

956
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,320
and left a child behind...

957
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,720
with nothing.

958
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,280
What kind of king...

959
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,360
What kind of man
does that?

960
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,720
No man is perfect.

961
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,960
Not even your father.

962
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,880
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

963
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,840
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

964
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,280
he may have created
something even worse.

965
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:17,720
Hey.

966
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,720
Look at me.

967
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,840
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

968
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:34,120
You get to decide
what kind of king
you are going to be.

969
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,720
Brother, you need to
get here now!

970
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,440
ROSS: Erik Stevens.

971
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,120
Graduated Annapolis
age 19...

972
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,240
MIT for grad school.

973
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,600
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...

974
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,160
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

975
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,320
like it was a video game.

976
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,560
Started calling him
Killmonger.

977
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,360
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

978
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,960
They will drop off
the grid...

979
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,400
so they can
commit assassinations

980
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,600
and take down governments.

981
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,800
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

982
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,640
SHURI: He has
a War Dog tattoo...

983
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,880
but we have no record of him.

984
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,400
Is this man Wakandan or not?

985
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,440
Tell us what is going on.

986
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,960
Speak.

987
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,400
Speak.

988
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,600
I'm standing
in your house...

989
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,160
serving justice to a man

990
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,520
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

991
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,640
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

992
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,680
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

993
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,200
Only reason
I don't kill you
where you stand

994
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,320
is because I know
who you are.

995
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,280
Now, what do you want?

996
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,600
I want the throne.

997
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,280
My goodness.

998
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,080
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.

999
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,200
Must feel good.

1000
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,440
It's about
two billion people

1001
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,120
all over the world
that looks like us.

1002
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,680
But their lives
are a lot harder.

1003
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,160
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

1004
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,520
And what tools
are those?

1005
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,760
Vibranium.
Your weapons.

1006
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,520
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

1007
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,440
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

1008
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,440
for people
who are not our own.

1009
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,480
Not your own?

1010
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,120
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

1011
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,720
So ain't all people
your people?

1012
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,520
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

1013
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,280
And it is my responsibility

1014
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,240
to make sure
our people are safe...

1015
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,640
and that vibranium
does not fall

1016
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,520
into the hands
of a person like you.

1017
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,680
Mmm...
RAMONDA: Son.

1018
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,560
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

1019
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,480
Reject his request.

1020
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,120
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.

1021
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,960
Ask who I am.
You're Erik Stevens.

1022
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,800
An American
black operative.

1023
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,640
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

1024
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,720
That's who you are.

1025
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,440
That's not my name,
Princess.

1026
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,200
Ask me, King.

1027
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,520
No.

1028
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,800
Ask me.

1029
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,520
Take him away.

1030
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Who are you?

1031
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,520
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.

1032
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,680
Son of N'Jobu?

1033
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,800
I found my daddy

1034
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,920
with Panther claws
in his chest!

1035
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,080
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

1036
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,400
You're lying!

1037
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,520
Lies!
I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1038
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,080
RIVER TRIBE ELDER:
 What?

1039
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,720
The descendent
of N'Jobu.

1040
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,440
Hey, Auntie.

1041
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,800
I'm exercising
my blood right

1042
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,560
to challenge
for the mantles of king...

1043
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,320
and Black Panther.

1044
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,400
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1045
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,760
BORDER TRIBE ELDER:
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

1046
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,440
he is within his rights.

1047
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,960
He has no rights here!

1048
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,200
The challenge
will take weeks
to prepare.

1049
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,600
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1050
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,000
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1051
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,360
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

1052
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,280
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?

1053
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,000
I accept your challenge.

1054
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,480
SHURI: He'll never
beat T'Challa.

1055
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,800
He should've just come
to the first challenge

1056
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,640
and gotten it over with.

1057
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,000
ZURI: The king
will now have the strength

1058
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,840
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

1059
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,120
Where is Agent Ross?

1060
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,040
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1061
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,440
This is your last chance.

1062
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,280
Throw down your weapons,

1063
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,000
and we can handle this
another way.

1064
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,280
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

1065
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,160
I trained,
I lied, I killed...

1066
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,040
just to get here.

1067
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,440
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

1068
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,360
Iraq.

1069
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,840
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

1070
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,080
right here on this continent.

1071
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,200
And all this death...

1072
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,800
just so I could kill you.

1073
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,600
Let the challenge begin.

1074
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,240
Yield!

1075
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,320
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1076
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,680
Come on, get up.

1077
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,040
Come here.

1078
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,040
This is for my father.

1079
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,800
ZURI: Erik!

1080
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,200
Zuri, no.
Stop!

1081
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,800
Zuri!
Zuri, don't!

1082
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,960
I am the cause of
your father's death.

1083
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,360
Not him.

1084
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,080
Take me.

1085
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,000
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.

1086
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,520
No!

1087
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,040
No! No!

1088
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,760
Zuri, no!

1089
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,080
No!

1090
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,920
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

1091
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,240
No! No!

1092
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,720
Is this your king? Huh?

1093
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,280
Is this your king?

1094
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,120
The Black Panther,

1095
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,000
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

1096
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,680
Come on, Brother!

1097
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,160
Is there nothing
that can be done?

1098
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,680
Him?

1099
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:25,800
He's supposed to protect you?

1100
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,760
No.
No!

1101
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,200
No!

1102
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,800
Nah. I'm your king.

1103
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,640
No! No!
We have to go now!

1104
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,880
Queen Mother,
let's go!

1105
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,400
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

1106
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,240
Yes.

1107
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,720
Thank you.

1108
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,240
We should get
to them immediately.

1109
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,280
I cannot.

1110
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,080
What?

1111
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,680
Though my heart
is with you.

1112
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,400
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

1113
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,160
who showed up here
only hours ago.

1114
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,280
He is of royal blood.

1115
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,680
He killed T'Challa!
In ritual combat.

1116
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,680
Does that really matter?

1117
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,240
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

1118
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:07,400
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes
too strong.

1119
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,680
Overthrow?

1120
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,720
Nakia!

1121
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,960
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1122
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:21,160
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

1123
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,520
What are you loyal to?

1124
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,440
I loved him.

1125
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,120
I loved my country, too.

1126
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,360
Then you serve your country.

1127
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,680
No. I save my country.

1128
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,720
What's wrong?

1129
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,480
The king is dead.

1130
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,800
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1131
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,120
First Baba.

1132
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,240
And now my brother.

1133
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,880
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

1134
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:33,120
It's me.
Nakia. Who is this man?

1135
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,120
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1136
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,320
Where's Okoye?

1137
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,480
Okoye is not coming.

1138
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,400
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1139
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,680
Wait here.

1140
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,080
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1141
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,600
SHAMAN:
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

1142
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,720
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

1143
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,680
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1144
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:43,600
N'JOBU: What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1145
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Hmm?

1146
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,200
What did you find?

1147
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,560
Your home.

1148
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,920
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1149
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,960
Yes. The sunsets there

1150
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,840
are the most beautiful
in the world.

1151
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,240
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.

1152
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Why?

1153
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,800
They will say you are lost.

1154
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,080
But I'm right here.

1155
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,840
No tears for me?

1156
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,360
Everybody dies.

1157
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,160
It's just life around here.

1158
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,520
Well, look at what
I have done.

1159
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,600
I should've taken
you back long ago.

1160
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,840
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1161
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,520
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1162
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,960
That's why they can't find us.

1163
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,360
Breathe! Breathe,
My King, breathe.

1164
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,920
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1165
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,520
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?

1166
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,600
This all of it?

1167
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,640
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

1168
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,880
we will be ready.

1169
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
Another king?

1170
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,040
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

1171
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,800
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

1172
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,400
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.

1173
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,880
Burn it all!

1174
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,560
You know, where I'm from...

1175
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,600
when black folks
started revolutions,

1176
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,480
they never had
the firepower...

1177
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,680
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1178
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,960
Where was Wakanda?

1179
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,520
Hmm?

1180
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,800
Yeah, all that ends today.

1181
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:15,080
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1182
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,960
Already in place.

1183
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,480
I know how colonizers think.

1184
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,160
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.

1185
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:25,040
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

1186
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,920
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

1187
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,520
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1188
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,360
And their children.

1189
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,240
And anyone else
who takes their side.

1190
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,840
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1191
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,640
We're warriors!

1192
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,920
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1193
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,880
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1194
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,280
OKOYE: Wakanda has survived
for so long...

1195
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,760
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1196
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,560
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1197
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,280
But the world is changing,
General.

1198
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,480
Elders,
it is getting smaller.

1199
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,520
The outside world
is catching up...

1200
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,680
and soon it will be
the conquerors

1201
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,840
or the conquered.

1202
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,480
I'd rather be the former.

1203
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,520
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1204
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,280
ROSS: So where are we
going again?

1205
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,040
NAKIA: We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb

1206
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,120
to Jabariland.

1207
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,920
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

1208
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:29,480
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1209
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,240
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.

1210
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:33,840
Nakia.

1211
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,080
I don't like this.

1212
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,000
The Herb belongs to us.

1213
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:45,360
We may be creating
a bigger monster
with M'Baku.

1214
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:55,240
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

1215
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,240
I am a spy with no army.

1216
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,360
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1217
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,600
We'll go.

1218
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,520
Oh, boy.

1219
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,160
ROSS: Oh, shit.

1220
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,160
Look down. Stay calm.

1221
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,320
Shuri.

1222
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,040
Look down.

1223
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,680
My son...

1224
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,320
was murdered
in ritual combat.

1225
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,960
Were the odds fair?
Yes, but...

1226
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,720
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.

1227
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,760
Do not rub our noses in it!
Silence!

1228
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,520
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.

1229
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:21,360
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

1230
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,360
The new king...

1231
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,360
M'BAKU: You cannot talk!

1232
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,920
One more word,

1233
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,240
and I will feed you
to my children.

1234
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,640
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.

1235
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,120
NAKIA: Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1236
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,920
this is why we are here.

1237
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,880
To offer this to you.

1238
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,080
An outsider
sits on our throne.

1239
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,040
Only you can
help us stop him.

1240
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,920
Come with me.

1241
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,320
Impossible!

1242
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,240
Is he breathing?

1243
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,160
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1244
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,200
One of our fishermen found him

1245
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,920
at the edge
of the river border.

1246
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:02,360
He brought him to me.

1247
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,280
Why do you have him
in the snow?

1248
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,600
It is the only thing
keeping him

1249
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:06,760
from joining
the ancestors.

1250
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,440
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1251
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,160
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

1252
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,520
Nakia, the Herb.

1253
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,400
I call upon
the ancestors.

1254
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,760
I call upon Bast.

1255
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,240
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.

1256
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,760
Heal him.

1257
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,640
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1258
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,040
Okay.

1259
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,480
Praise the ancestors.

1260
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:12,640
Praise the ancestors.

1261
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,240
Praise the ancestors.

1262
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,680
Praise the ancestors.

1263
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,200
Wake up, T'Challa.

1264
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,800
Wake up.

1265
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,640
My son.

1266
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,920
The time has come
for you to come home...

1267
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,520
and be reunited with me.

1268
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,880
Why?

1269
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,120
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

1270
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,360
Why, Baba?

1271
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,400
He...

1272
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,640
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

1273
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:10,400
You were wrong to abandon him.

1274
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,440
I chose my people.

1275
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,840
I chose Wakanda.

1276
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,880
Our future depended...

1277
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,600
You were wrong!

1278
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,000
All of you were wrong!

1279
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,960
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1280
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,240
We let the fear
of our discovery

1281
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,880
stop us from doing
what is right!

1282
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,320
No more!

1283
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:42,880
I cannot stay here with you.

1284
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:48,920
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1285
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:52,440
He is a monster
of our own making.

1286
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:57,440
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1287
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,160
I must right these wrongs.

1288
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,680
Do you have a blanket?

1289
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,280
NAKIA: Killmonger
has the full support

1290
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,520
of our military.

1291
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,880
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1292
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:27,080
ROSS: Of course he did.

1293
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,960
That's what he was
trained to do.

1294
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,760
His unit used to work
with the CIA

1295
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,640
to destabilize
foreign countries.

1296
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,920
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

1297
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:37,240
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1298
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,800
You get control of government,
the military...

1299
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,040
Our resources.
ROSS: Right.

1300
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,160
The Great Mound.

1301
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,000
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

1302
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,840
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1303
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,480
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1304
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,640
What?
What about you?

1305
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,520
The challenge
will have to continue.

1306
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:02,000
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.

1307
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,160
It is my duty
to keep you safe.

1308
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,800
If he gets control
of our technology,

1309
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,240
nowhere will be safe.

1310
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,800
The Black Panther lives.

1311
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,840
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

1312
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,560
I will be right there
beside him.

1313
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,880
As will I.

1314
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,600
ROSS: I'm in, too.

1315
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,400
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1316
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,160
Are you done?

1317
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,360
Are you done?

1318
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:57,080
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

1319
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,720
Thank you.

1320
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,640
I owed you a great debt.

1321
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,000
A life for a life.

1322
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,720
Consider it paid.

1323
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,600
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1324
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,320
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1325
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,160
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1326
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,240
But no.

1327
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,560
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1328
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,400
It is our cause.

1329
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,320
It is for all of us.
Oh, us?

1330
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,760
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

1331
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,880
and now you speak of "us"?

1332
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,840
I cannot speak for past kings.

1333
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,360
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

1334
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,400
We both know the power
of vibranium.

1335
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,120
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1336
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,200
who do you think
he will come for next?

1337
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:10,160
We will not help you.

1338
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,960
W'KABI:
Everything is on schedule.

1339
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,320
Have the spies
been alerted?

1340
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,600
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1341
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,480
But the War Dogs
in London,

1342
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,360
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

1343
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,600
We'll strike there first.

1344
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,560
The others'll come around.

1345
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,160
Look at this.

1346
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:55,400
A handheld sonic cannon,

1347
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:56,880
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

1348
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,640
untraceable by
metal detectors.

1349
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,880
And we got thousands of them.

1350
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,160
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1351
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:38,920
He lives.

1352
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,880
N'Jadaka!

1353
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,320
Wassup?

1354
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,240
I never yielded!

1355
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,720
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1356
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:56,320
All that challenge shit
is over with!

1357
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,560
I'm the king now!

1358
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,920
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1359
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,000
Shuri, now.
SHURI:  Copy that.

1360
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:16,040
SHURI: Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!

1361
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,640
W'Kabi, man,
kill this clown.

1362
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,920
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1363
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,120
What will we do?

1364
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:30,640
Border Tribe!

1365
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:45,680
You!

1366
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,200
Your heart
is so full of hatred...

1367
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,200
you are not fit
to be a king!

1368
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,560
Come on!

1369
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,200
Ayo, the king!

1370
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,520
Shields!

1371
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,160
Ah!

1372
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,960
W'Kabi, stop this!

1373
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,720
Stop this now!

1374
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,880
No!

1375
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,720
Nakia and I will get control
of the Royal Talon  with this.

1376
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,320
So what do I do?

1377
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,600
You'll have to fly it.

1378
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:34,360
What?
You were a great pilot.

1379
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,600
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1380
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:38,880
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.

1381
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,240
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?

1382
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:43,200
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1383
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,120
I'm not a Dora.
Just put it on, it's armor!

1384
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,680
Come!

1385
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,280
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1386
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,800
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

1387
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:55,280
NAKIA: We're counting on you.

1388
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,320
Wakanda forever.

1389
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,560
Come on!

1390
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,160
NAKIA: Go, go!

1391
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,960
AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote
piloting system activated.

1392
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:40,960
My God.

1393
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:44,160
SHURI: I made it American
style for you. Get in.

1394
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,880
All right.

1395
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,080
Yes!

1396
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,880
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1397
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,920
All right, I'm on it.

1398
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,320
Lock!

1399
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:21,680
Get him down!

1400
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,440
Get the necklace!

1401
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,480
Get the necklace!

1402
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,280
Wakanda forever!

1403
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,320
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1404
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,880
Shoot them down, genius!

1405
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,040
All right.

1406
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,720
Here goes nothing.

1407
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,080
All right, got them.

1408
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,640
Oh, shit.

1409
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,360
Shit, shit, shit.

1410
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:27,760
KILLMONGER: Nice!

1411
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,040
BLACK PANTHER: Shuri!

1412
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,720
What's up, Princess?

1413
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,960
You'll never be a true king.

1414
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:15,920
Brother!

1415
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,360
Shuri.

1416
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:50,800
Brother!

1417
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,360
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1418
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,560
SHURI: The stabilizers
will deactivate your suit!

1419
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,040
You won't have protection!

1420
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:58,560
Neither will he.

1421
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,080
Okay!

1422
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:26,400
I don't need a suit
to kill you.

1423
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:27,800
Your reign is over!

1424
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,560
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1425
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,120
T'CHALLA: You want to
see us become

1426
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,120
just like the people
you hate so much.

1427
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,040
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

1428
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,640
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

1429
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,040
You have become them!

1430
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,720
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1431
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,640
The world took
everything away from me!

1432
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,320
Everything I ever loved!

1433
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:46,920
But I'mma make sure
we're even.

1434
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,240
I'mma track down
anyone who would

1435
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,800
even think
about being loyal to you!

1436
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,280
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

1437
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,440
right next to Zuri!

1438
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,040
Nakia!

1439
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,960
Are you all right?
I'm okay. You?

1440
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,880
Yes.
Let's go.

1441
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:12,320
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1442
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,960
Shit. What the hell was that?

1443
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,480
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The lab is under attack.

1444
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,600
What? Where?

1445
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,600
Deactivating hologram.

1446
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:27,480
SHURI: Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!

1447
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,440
How long have I got?

1448
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:33,160
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Glass integrity is at 50%.

1449
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:35,000
Put me back in.

1450
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,880
SHURI: Ross! Ross!

1451
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,280
Surrender now!

1452
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,640
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1453
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:01,920
One!

1454
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:03,040
Two!

1455
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:17,320
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

1456
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,720
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Glass integrity is at 15%.

1457
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,600
Critical weapons failure.
Shit!

1458
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:18,480
Hey, Shuri!
The last cargo ship

1459
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,800
is almost at the border...

1460
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,120
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1461
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,600
Make an X with your arms!

1462
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:25,600
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sonic Overload initiated.

1463
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,600
Now break it!

1464
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,440
AUTOMATED VOICE:
System rebooting in five...

1465
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,960
four, three...

1466
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,720
two, one.

1467
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:44,440
System rebooted.

1468
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,120
Yes! We did it!

1469
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:59,840
SHURI: Great!
Now get out of there!

1470
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,320
Charge!

1471
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:34,400
Drop your weapon!

1472
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:38,120
Would you kill me, my love?

1473
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,800
For Wakanda?

1474
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,800
Without question!

1475
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,360
This is it for you, Cousin.

1476
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,600
Hell of a move!

1477
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,400
My pop said Wakanda was

1478
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,080
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

1479
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:28,240
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1480
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,480
You believe that?

1481
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:33,480
Kid from Oakland,

1482
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:35,440
running around
believing in fairy tales.

1483
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,760
It's beautiful.

1484
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,400
Maybe we can still heal you.

1485
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,000
Why?

1486
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:49,960
So you can just lock me up?

1487
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,520
Nah.

1488
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,400
Just bury me in the ocean...

1489
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:01,120
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

1490
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:05,320
'Cause they knew
death was better
than bondage.

1491
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:30,880
Thank you.

1492
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,480
You saved me.

1493
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,520
You saved my family.

1494
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,200
Our nation.

1495
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:43,680
There's nothing
to thank me for.

1496
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,400
It is our duty to...

1497
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,640
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1498
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:53,680
I should've...

1499
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,600
You can't blame me,
I almost died.

1500
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:07,520
Stay.

1501
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,240
I think I know a way

1502
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:13,600
you can still fulfill
your calling.

1503
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:16,160
Please stay.

1504
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,040
KID 1: Oh, he moves it!
He moves it!

1505
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,880
KID 2: Who man is that?
KID 3: Bucket!

1506
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,040
KID 2: Easy.

1507
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,400
When you said
you would take me

1508
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,400
to California
for the first time...

1509
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,520
I thought
you meant Coachella...

1510
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,160
or Disneyland.

1511
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:06,280
Why here?

1512
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,840
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

1513
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,760
They're tearing it down.

1514
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:21,880
Good.

1515
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:24,040
They are not tearing it down.

1516
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:26,800
I bought this building.

1517
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:30,760
And that building.

1518
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,320
And that one over there.

1519
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:35,840
This will be the first

1520
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:38,240
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

1521
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,160
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

1522
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,160
And you will spearhead

1523
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:46,480
the science
and information exchange.

1524
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,120
You're kidding.

1525
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:50,800
Eh?

1526
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:01,080
Oh...

1527
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:04,080
Hey, yo. Man,
what the hell is that?

1528
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:05,960
KID 2: That's like
a Bugatti spaceship!

1529
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,720
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

1530
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,000
What?

1531
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:15,840
KID 2: Check it out, bro.

1532
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,360
We can take this back
to the house.

1533
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:19,760
Pull up to school in this.

1534
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,800
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

1535
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:22,880
KID 4: On eBay.

1536
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,040
KID 2: Everybody get, like,
a million apiece.

1537
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:25,480
SHURI: I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.

1538
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:26,680
KID 2: Where you come from?
SHURI: From Wakanda.

1539
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:27,920
KID 4: What is a Wakanda?

1540
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
KID 5: Hey, yo!

1541
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:30,920
This yours?

1542
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,080
Who...

1543
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:37,600
Who are you?

1544
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:25,760
My name is King T'Challa...

1545
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:28,040
son of King T'Chaka.

1546
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:32,520
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.

1547
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:35,440
And for the first time
in our history...

1548
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:38,840
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...

1549
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,880
with the outside world.

1550
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:44,400
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

1551
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:46,000
We cannot.

1552
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:48,640
We must not.

1553
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,600
We will work to be an example
of how we...

1554
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:54,000
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...

1555
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:56,240
should treat each other.

1556
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,240
Now, more than ever...

1557
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:03,920
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

1558
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:06,280
We all know the truth.

1559
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:09,840
More connects us
than separates us.

1560
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,680
But in times of crisis...

1561
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:14,320
the wise build bridges...

1562
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:17,280
while the foolish
build barriers.

1563
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,480
We must find a way...

1564
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:22,280
to look after one another...

1565
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:27,160
as if we were one,
single tribe.

1566
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:28,800
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...

1567
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,200
what can
a nation of farmers

1568
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:32,160
have to offer
the rest of the world?

1569
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,760
Are you playing around
with that man again?

1570
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:34,840
No.
You're teasing him again.

1571
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:38,400
Don't wake him. He must rest.
THABO: No, I'm not.

1572
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:40,720
No, I'm not.

1573
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:42,880
SHURI: Thabo,
you're doing that.

1574
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:44,440
KID 2: He's doing it.
He's lying.

1575
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:46,040
SHURI: No, he's resting.

1576
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:47,520
Go, go!

1577
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:49,480
White Wolf!

1578
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:50,640
Stop that!

1579
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:51,920
White Wolf!

1580
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:56,280
Good morning,
Sergeant Barnes.

1581
02:13:57,800 --> 02:13:58,800
Bucky.

1582
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:01,440
How are you feeling?

1583
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:03,080
Good.

1584
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:06,800
Thank you.

1585
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,400
Come.

1586
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,800
Much more
for you to learn.
