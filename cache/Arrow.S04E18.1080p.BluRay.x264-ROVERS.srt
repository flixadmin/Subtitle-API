1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,241
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,363
<i>Mr. Darhk will be held
without bail or possibility of release.</i>

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,288
You may now call your organization
and have that other message delivered.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,604
<i>He said
you were his ace in the hole.</i>

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,649
Is that what you'd like me to call you?

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,766
Or do you prefer Mr. Diggle?

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,641
DIGGLEI <i>Andy?</i>

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,882
What are you doing in the dark, man?

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,121
Didn't wanna wake Sara up.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,800
Thanks for letting me know where this was.

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,121
I want you to feel safe.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,322
You sounded pretty rattled on the phone.
What the hell's going on?

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,246
HIVE knows I'm alive, John.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,041
Did they come after you?

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,482
In a way.
I mean, one of them reached out.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,005
Some guy with perfect teeth
and a missing hand.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,527
- I didn't... He didn't tell me his name.
- Malcolm Merlyn.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,722
- The head of the League of Assassins?
- Well, not anymore.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,365
Yeah. Well, now he works for Damien Darhk.

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,847
- Since when?
- Two nights ago.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,411
Andy, you should've told me this earlier.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,523
<i>"ANDY". I know, man, and I'm sorry. But...</i>

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,605
This whole thing's gotten me thrown, man,
I didn't think HIVE knew where I was.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,001
What did Merlyn want?

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,687
I think there's some kind of friction
going on between HIVE and Darhk.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,241
Have you noticed they haven't even tried
to bust Darhk out of prison?

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,521
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,091
And now this Merlyn guy
asked me to help him.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,771
Help him with what?
Bust Darhk out of Iron Heights?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,005
DOD's scheduled to run Paveway missiles
through Pennytown tomorrow night at 2300.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,690
Merlyn wants me to help him
hijack the shipment.

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,370
Yeah, well, just one of those Paveways

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,522
makes for a pretty good
"get out ofjail free" card.

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,048
And that's why I'm asking you, man.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,681
What do I do?

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,243
First kidnapping, then stealing missiles.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,681
Merlyn's trying really hard
to be friends with Darhk.

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,527
If Malcolm's convinced
Darhk is on the winning side, it...

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,041
He's even trying to protect me
from whatever he's planning.

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,885
The only thing Darhk should be planning on
is getting convicted at trial.

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,123
Why does that thing creep
me out the way it does?

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,566
Because it's creepy.

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,370
There's something
that I haven't told you guys.

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,647
Shocker.

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,767
Sorry.

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,329
- I've seen this idol before.
- What?

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,561
Where?

48
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,761
Lian Yu.

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,284
You really love not talking
about that place, don't you?

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,891
Where are we with the security upgrades?

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,326
Everything's in place. We're good to go.

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,925
Because Merlyn knows
the bunker's location.

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,321
And if he's working with Darhk...

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,483
Then that means we have to worry
about him coming down here

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,927
and stealing this creepy stone-thingy.

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,849
And what about his plan
to hijack the missile shipment?

57
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,481
Oliver, I think we keep Andy
right where he is.

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,846
That way we'll have someone on the inside.

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,081
Are you sure that's a good idea?

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,487
Well, he's out from under the influence
of Darhk. We can trust him.

61
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,410
Trust is one thing,

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,404
and selling him as a double agent,
that's another.

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,165
It's a lot of pressure to put on someone.

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,402
Especially someone
that is still in recovery.

65
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,001
Oliver, Andy is stand-up guy.

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,446
He's got this.

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,004
And you've got this.

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,681
You can blow that off.
You don't owe Ruvé Darhk anything.

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,283
Tradition, loser attends
the winner's acceptance speech.

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,841
You didn't lose, you pulled out
of the race because of her husband.

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,600
Which I will try not to mention
to the press.

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,451
Let's get this over with.

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,851
<i>We worked hard to get to this moment.</i>

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,647
<i>But now the real work begins</i>

75
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,441
<i>to make this city great again.</i>

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,601
<i>Thank you.</i>

77
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,802
Mr. Queen.
Have time to answer a few questions?

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,167
Not a candidate anymore,
I'm just here to support the new mayor.

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,010
So, no comment on the write-in results?

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,486
What write-in results?

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,005
Forty-eight percent
of the electorate wrote in

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,645
your brother's name on their ballots.

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,043
That's a historic showing for a candidate
who pulled out of the race.

84
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,051
I'll let you and your former opponent
catch up.

85
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,723
Well, thank you for coming out
tonight, Mr. Queen.

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,325
It's a very gracious gesture.

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,568
I'm always gonna have this
city's best interests at heart.

88
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,928
Well, let's hope the same can be said
for your friends.

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,167
- Ms. Lance. I am so pleased to meet you.
- Mmm.

90
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,562
I was very impressed by your handling
of the Damien Darhk hearing.

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,490
I was just getting warmed up.

92
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,008
Well, my hope is that you'll be too busy
to handle the trial.

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,524
District Attorney Remz has taken on
a new position as my Deputy Mayor.

94
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,002
And I would like you to succeed him as DA.
Think about it.

95
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,686
I think that we could do great things
for this city if we work together.

96
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,886
Thank you.

97
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,491
<i>Listen, Reiter's men outnumber us.</i>

98
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,806
We have guns, but so do they.

99
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,407
So when we get up there,
we cannot hesitate to kill.

100
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,687
Do you understand?

101
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,561
Taiana?

102
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,362
Just months ago, I was a dive instructor.

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,722
I couldn't dream of taking a life.

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,885
I wouldn't.

105
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,045
This place truly is hell.
It makes monsters of us all.

106
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,891
Who's in that photo?

107
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,042
Me and my brother.

108
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,081
I forget sometimes that we were once
this happy and this innocent.

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,723
When I first got here,
I used to look at a photo from my past.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,241
It helped for a time,

111
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,087
reminded me of the person
that I used to be.

112
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,968
But I'm telling you now
that that person wouldn't survive here.

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,089
And you won't either
if you stay focused on the past.

114
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,570
Do you understand?

115
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,931
Da.

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,401
How do we take those bastards out?

117
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,445
Follow me.

118
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,601
It's past 11:30.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,882
It's the US Army, man.
"Late" means "on time."

120
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,451
Or we're staking out the wrong place.

121
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,444
If Andy says this is where it's gonna be,
this is where it's gonna be.

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,011
No movement yet on the missiles.

123
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,480
You know, we should be out there
with them.

124
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,165
Even with John's fancy A.R.G.U.S toys,

125
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,801
this place is more secure
with us watching over it.

126
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,090
So, are you gonna do it?

127
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,649
Be a District Attorney by day
and Black Canary by night?

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,805
I don't know.

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,925
I mean, it would help
having eyes on Mrs. Evil.

130
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,245
Yeah, well, if you believe Malcolm,
it would be a short-term job anyway.

131
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,445
There won't be any need for a DA
once the city's destroyed.

132
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,971
You stopped calling him "Dad."

133
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,488
That's because he's not "Dad."

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,129
Look, I know I've said that before,

135
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,330
but this time is different.

136
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,485
This time, it's mutual.

137
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,525
That couldn't be
further from the truth, dear.

138
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,047
Mr. Diggle's upgraded security
needs a few upgrades, by the way.

139
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,481
<i>You know why we're here.</i>

140
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,725
Hand over the idol
and there won't be any trouble.

141
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,803
Well, there's gonna be trouble, then.

142
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,081
All right, that's the signal.

143
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,684
Guy's dressed like League of Assassins.

144
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,042
Merlyn probably has a few loyalists left.
Get me in position.

145
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,530
Hold on! It's me! It's me. It's me.

146
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,531
Are you always this quiet?

147
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,927
Come on, we just saved the shipment,
and you made it look easy.

148
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,601
It's because it was easy.

149
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,961
The idol.

150
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,645
It's gone.

151
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,283
You two can stand down. He's gone.

152
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,201
- Merlyn?
- Yeah.

153
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,805
And a few League of Assassin members.

154
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,202
He took the idol.
I should have stopped him.

155
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,488
We should have been here. We...

156
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,606
I'm sure you did everything you could.

157
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,768
Merlyn's gonna give that idol
to his new friend Darhk

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,604
to get his mojo back.

159
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,047
We've been scouring the street cams,
it's like he just vanished.

160
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,009
<i>Yeah, that's why
the League calls him the Magician.</i>

161
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,123
I'm gonna go hit the streets.

162
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,482
Thea, no one is gonna give up Merlyn.

163
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,523
Well, then I'm gonna hit people
on the streets.

164
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,005
I'll check with Andy.
See if he can get a 20 on Merlyn.

165
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,851
Uh, John, Andy has already risked a lot.

166
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,361
I don't wanna put him
in a compromised position.

167
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,369
Oliver, he's already in
a compromised position.

168
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,881
There's a direct line between him
and the man we are looking for.

169
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,201
Let's use that.

170
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,521
Yeah.

171
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,521
Talk to me.

172
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,043
This missile job was too easy.

173
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,487
It was like Merlyn's men
weren't even trying.

174
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,364
Meanwhile, it pulled our focus,

175
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,166
Merlyn was able to come down here
and get exactly what he wanted.

176
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,521
You think Merlyn played Andy?

177
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,489
What if Andy is playing us?

178
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,050
Look, I'm...
I'm not saying it's not possible,

179
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,929
but this is John's brother
we're talking about.

180
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,686
I mean, he's done so much for us.
He... He saved Lyla.

181
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,564
Should I just trust him outright?

182
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,610
No. But you better be sure
before making an accusation

183
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,842
that you and John can't recover from.

184
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,921
It's my dad. I have to take this.

185
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,610
Help me! Please help me!

186
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,802
- You have to help me!
- What is it?

187
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,201
- What's going on?
- Conklin!

188
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,086
Or what remains of him.
The thing that killed those men.

189
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,008
It killed Oliver.
It has Reiter trapped down there.

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,361
Come on.

191
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,925
<i>MERCENARY'. Who... Who's that?</i>

192
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,761
<i>Stop running.</i>

193
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,247
Don't be too impressed.

194
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,125
That's the only Chinese
I was able to pick up from Sara.

195
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,446
So, listen, you thought about how
you're gonna tell our newly elected mayor

196
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,244
that you're turning down herjob offer?

197
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,761
I have.

198
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,963
But I'm not sure that I will.

199
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,326
Well, this one's a no-brainer, sweetie.
You can't go work for a murderer.

200
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,483
This job would put me in the inner circle.

201
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,404
Yeah, at the cost
of being the Black Canary.

202
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,443
Look, ever since HIVE had DA Bray killed,

203
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,326
the District Attorney has 24-7 protection,
they would not let you out of their sight.

204
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,481
I'll waive it.

205
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,404
You think Ruvé Darhk will let that happen?

206
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,126
Listen, I never thought I'd say this.

207
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,969
But I'm glad
that you are the Black Canary.

208
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,849
I'm glad for all the good you're doing,
and I'm glad for the good it's done you.

209
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,842
But you gotta know that taking this job,

210
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,325
that means taking off that mask, forever.

211
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,006
Careful. You could hurt yourself
with that.

212
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,167
It's not myself
I'm planning on hurting with it.

213
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,841
Andy. Yeah.

214
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,361
- I've got eyes on Merlyn.
<i>- Okay.</i> Where are you?

215
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,363
In some old box factory, I think.

216
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,327
- You sure this is the place?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

217
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,165
Come on. Merlyn's this way.

218
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,964
Why didn't you have him radio us in?

219
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,161
I had him stay behind for backup.

220
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,361
Merlyn!

221
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,721
The door!

222
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,561
Look out!

223
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,526
You Okay?

224
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,881
Swell.

225
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,527
What happened?

226
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,726
He took an arrow for me.

227
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,684
Let me see. Let me see.
Don't worry about it, man.

228
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,649
We deal with this kind of stuff
every week. Come on.

229
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,723
No, no, no, no!
You gotta get to Iron Heights now.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,365
<i>If Merlyn's not here, then that...</i>

231
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,722
That means he's on his way there
with the idol.

232
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,005
If Darhk gets that idol,
no prison will be able to hold him.

233
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,444
One of these days you're gonna tell me
how you get in and out of here.

234
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,250
A magician never reveals his secrets.

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,091
And what next? You're gonna make
a coin appear from behind my ear?

236
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,011
You know, you're awfully flippant
for a man who's asked a great deal of me.

237
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,526
Do you have it?

238
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,441
Perhaps now's a good time
to remind you of our terms.

239
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,604
Yes. You and your daughter get spared
from Genesis. Is that still the play?

240
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,968
I don't think you appreciate
what this cost me.

241
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,921
Oh, come on. Stop being so highhanded.

242
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,961
What's wrong?

243
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,243
Mr. Merlyn, do you know
what the khushu idol is?

244
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,046
<i>Khushu</i> is an old Arabic term
for "humbleness."

245
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,766
Suffice it to say, something
I wouldn't associate with you.

246
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,247
When the earliest Homo Magi
forged these idols,

247
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,802
they did so in the image of those
whose powers they wished to channel.

248
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,242
<i>So attention to detail is essential.</i>

249
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,330
It's missing a piece.

250
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,805
The Ribalvei stone.

251
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,729
They must have hidden it someplace else.

252
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,321
Find it.

253
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,484
Or Genesis is not what you
and your daughter have to fear.

254
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,850
You're gonna need a few stitches,
but, uh, this should hold for now.

255
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,651
I'm gonna need a whole lot more
than a few stitches.

256
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,242
Merlyn's men saw me
fighting for your team.

257
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,960
Darhk's now gonna know
that I'm on your side.

258
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,685
I'm a dead man.

259
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,450
And he's just not gonna stop with me.

260
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,120
He's gonna come for you,
he's gonna come for Lyla, Sara. Oh, God.

261
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,603
Listen, listen, he's not gonna
come for anybody, okay? He can't.

262
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,444
Merlyn has the idol.

263
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,610
Look, he's probably delivering it to him
right now!

264
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,804
Andy, no, he doesn't.
There's a piece missing.

265
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,007
What?

266
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,965
We separated a piece of it
and put it in another location.

267
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,481
The only thing Merlyn's delivering
is a big-ugly paperweight.

268
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,603
- Darhk will find it. He finds everything.
- Listen, listen.

269
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,444
Andy, listen to me, man.

270
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,531
He won't find anything.

271
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,482
- I hid it myself.
- John?

272
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,166
May I speak to you?

273
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,207
This information
needs to be compartmentalized.

274
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,811
Listen, he's scared, man.
And for good reason.

275
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,527
He's entitled to know
that we have the situation under control.

276
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,411
Well, that control is only as strong
as the secret.

277
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,484
The less people who know, the better.

278
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,523
He risked everything, everything for us.

279
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,688
He took an arrow for you.

280
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,330
He has my trust.
Why doesn't he have yours?

281
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,090
Malcolm's gonna try and get the idol
to Darhk, if he hasn't done it already.

282
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,323
I can go there as ADA
and have the entire cellblock searched.

283
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,851
Do it.

284
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,368
Speedy, you and Spartan
go back to the bunker.

285
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,251
Work CCTV, work facial recognition.

286
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,091
Anything that we can do
to get a line on Merlyn.

287
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,004
- Okay.
- And what can I do?

288
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,726
You should go home and rest.

289
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,211
You've done enough for tonight.

290
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,765
What about you?

291
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,922
I'll be right behind you,
I'm just gonna run down a lead.

292
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,405
You guys, get to the surface,
gather the others and go for the boats.

293
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,647
Go, come on!

294
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,325
- What about you?
- Reiter's still in the catacombs.

295
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,131
If he's found that idol,
you won't be able to stop him.

296
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,131
We don't need to stop him.

297
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,605
We need to trap him.

298
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,001
You guys are doing a wonderful job
in there.

299
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,885
You know, I've been meaning
to redecorate the place myself.

300
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,082
You know,
my office received an anonymous tip

301
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,443
that contraband intended for your use
was smuggled into this prison.

302
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,011
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

303
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,125
Find anything? All right.

304
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,560
Search every cell in this tier.

305
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,127
I wanna make sure none of his friends
are stashing anything for him.

306
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,647
You know, you're lucky I'm not the man
that you think I am, Ms. Lance.

307
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,889
If I were the man
that your father so vehemently claims,

308
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,445
you'd be in a lot of trouble right now,
wouldn't you?

309
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,927
Are you threatening
an Assistant District Attorney?

310
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,400
Oh, no! No, no, no. Not at all.

311
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,729
Just merely trying to figure out where
your father gets these vicious ideas from.

312
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,251
On!

313
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,401
I hope his mind isn't starting to go.

314
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,570
You know, dementia is sometimes
an after effect of long-term alcoholism.

315
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,921
You're a son of a bitch.

316
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,444
Regardless, it's comforting to know
that his heart is in the right place.

317
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,645
A father who would do anything
to protect his daughter from the dark.

318
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,284
I'll see you in court.

319
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,565
- Looking for something?
- Oh, jeez, man.

320
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,450
Do you know how to knock?

321
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,446
Any luck finding Merlyn?

322
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,325
No, but I think you already knew that.

323
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,042
I'm gonna ask you again,
what are you looking for?

324
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,082
Surveillance. Okay, look.
HIVE knows I'm John's brother.

325
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,486
They could've hidden bugs here.

326
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,485
Maybe that's how that one-handed friend
of yours found me in the first place.

327
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,290
You always have an answer for everything.

328
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,845
Hey, what are you talking about?

329
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,011
I think that you've been working
with Darhk since the beginning.

330
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,004
That you and Merlyn have been playing us
this entire time,

331
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,921
and now you're here
looking for the missing piece of the idol.

332
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,323
I'm on your side, remember?

333
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,729
I even got hurt trying to protect you.

334
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,411
I remember.

335
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,088
I told John to trust you,
to give you another chance.

336
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,603
But I was wrong,
because men like you don't change.

337
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,207
Now, you tell me.

338
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,491
What does Darhk have planned?

339
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,404
If I'm the man that you think I am,

340
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,847
then you know torture
is not gonna get me to say anything.

341
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,802
I haven't started torturing you yet.

342
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,366
- What the hell are you doing?
- Showing you who he really is.

343
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,210
- Tell him.
- John, he thinks I'm a traitor.

344
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,122
I know exactly
what that Kevlar won't protect.

345
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,721
Let him go.

346
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,049
Dig, you can't trust him.

347
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,207
- Get out.
- John!

348
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,447
Now.

349
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,004
You had no right!

350
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,885
I had every right.

351
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,367
- This is about keeping us safe.
- No, it's not, Oliver.

352
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,171
This is about you controlling
everything and everyone around you.

353
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,600
Andy tipped us off to the missile heist,

354
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,050
we go there,
Merlyn comes here and takes the idol.

355
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,046
Then he brings us to Merlyn's hideout,
where we are met with an ambush.

356
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,170
- Where he took an arrow for you.
- That could've been a feint.

357
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,728
When I confronted him at your apartment,
he was tearing it apart!

358
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,081
Looking for surveillance.

359
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,408
Or, he was looking
for the last piece of the idol.

360
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,003
John, you are the one who always tells me,

361
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,771
"Do not have a blind spot
when it comes to your family."

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,287
And you're the one who told me
to give Andy a second chance.

363
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,369
You're the one
who wanted to extract him from HIVE.

364
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,088
You're the one who said he could come back
from the darkness, the same way you did.

365
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,651
But I didn't.

366
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,645
Ihavetfled.

367
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,324
I have tried harder at this
than I ever have at anything.

368
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,891
But at the end of the day,

369
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,927
I am who those five years away
turned me into.

370
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,124
I'm what they turned me into.

371
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,641
So, what, Oliver?

372
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,887
Just because Felicity left you,
I'm supposed to believe

373
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,764
that all men are incapable of redemption?

374
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,930
Not all men are like you, Oliver.
Some of us change.

375
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,485
Some of us grow.

376
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,810
Some of us evolve.

377
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,161
You are stuck, man.

378
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,682
Stuck in your self-pity
and your self-righteousness,

379
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,082
and that is why Felicity left you.

380
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,251
My brother is my business.

381
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,650
You have no idea what he's been through,

382
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,649
and you sure as hell
had no right to judge him.

383
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,370
I'm sure he didn't mean that, Ollie.

384
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,846
Yes, he did.

385
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,123
How'd it go at Iron Heights?

386
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,041
Turned up a few burner cell phones,
six bags of heroin,

387
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,441
and no idol.

388
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,210
THEAI <i>Well...</i>

389
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,006
We're hacked into the security system
at the prison,

390
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,009
so if anything happens, we'll see it.

391
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,081
Right.

392
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,364
Hey? Are you okay?

393
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,369
John and I had a difference of opinion.

394
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,246
- About Andy?
- I confronted Andy, and Dig walked in.

395
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,801
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

396
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,487
Probably should've taken your advice,
District Attorney Lance.

397
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,963
I'm still just an ADA.

398
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,920
I'm turning down the promotion.

399
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,043
Because it's being offered by Ruvé Darhk?

400
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,369
No. Because taking the job means
giving up my place here,

401
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,725
with you and the team.

402
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,530
Team's falling apart.

403
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,482
John's furious with me.
Thea is consumed with rage for Malcolm.

404
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,886
And...

405
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,568
Well, Felicity is gone.

406
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,441
Becoming District Attorney is something

407
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,608
that you've worked
the better part of three years for.

408
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,451
I might've wanted to be DA,
but that was a lifetime ago.

409
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,801
Sara's lifetime.

410
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,005
You channeled your grief
and became the Black Canary.

411
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,283
But Sara's not dead anymore.

412
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,165
Maybe you owe it to yourself
to pursue the path you were on.

413
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,930
You're serious?

414
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,724
This city has enough heroes with masks on.

415
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,250
With Ruvé Darhk as mayor,
it needs a hero without a mask.

416
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,604
It needs Laurel Lance.

417
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,164
<i>Break time!
Twenty minutes! Twenty minutes!</i>

418
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,686
DARHKI Ah...

419
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,007
Are you in touch with the land?
Spend much time in Mother Nature?

420
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,409
No. Well, your ancestors did.

421
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,201
But they knew
that life is a series of phases.

422
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,328
A time to be born, a time to die,
a time to plant, a time to uproot,

423
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,001
a time to kill.

424
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,643
<i>Master the paradox of change
within constancy,</i>

425
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,487
and the primordial force of nature itself
will be at your beck and call.

426
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,208
<i>Ah, my idol. Julius Caesar.</i>

427
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,570
"Cry 'Havoc, '
and let slip the dogs of war."

428
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,848
LOCK down.

429
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,406
<i>Lock down cell block A.</i>

430
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,964
<i>Lock down cell block A.</i>

431
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,600
What happened?

432
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,201
It was rec hour,
the prisoners were out of their cells.

433
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,129
- He's holding the guards hostage.
- How many?

434
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,931
It doesn't matter how many.
We have to put Darhk back in his cage.

435
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,121
Let's gear up.

436
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,807
Oliver, I can't prosecute him
without getting him into custody first.

437
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,086
One last time.

438
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,730
What the hell is going on around here?

439
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,924
You can't just stand around here waiting
for something to happen. Who's in charge?

440
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,646
Not you, Captain. You've been suspended.

441
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,923
Pike, right? That figures.

442
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,646
Wait it out till we got
a stack of dead bodies on our hands.

443
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,490
I'm sorry, sir.
You need to get back to your vehicle.

444
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,446
No, I wanna speak with him.
I need to speak with him now!

445
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,250
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can do that.

446
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,011
You can do that. Go get him...
Never mind. I see him.

447
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,685
- Sir, no...
- Hey! Pike!

448
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,171
Pike! Yeah, I see you over there.

449
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,930
How do we get through
all those cops?

450
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,485
Looks like Lance has it covered.

451
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,331
He's laying into
Lieutenant Pike, apparently.

452
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,643
And he just knocked him out.

453
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,525
As a distraction to give us an opening.
Let's move.

454
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,010
I thought I told you to come alone.

455
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,611
You did. And I didn't.

456
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,485
Look, I know you don't trust me.

457
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,525
But that's why I'm here, to prove you can.

458
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,008
Darhk has the hostages in the mess hall.
Let's fan out and hit him from all sides.

459
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,280
I remember this guy.

460
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,721
Those lips.

461
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,007
Gross.

462
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,929
Not a bad warm up.
Seems like you're ready for a rematch.

463
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,367
Go get the others. I've got this.

464
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,925
- No. Let me take him.
- Go!

465
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,410
Let's see how well I taught you.

466
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,846
You know, the police took me seriously

467
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,930
when I said I would start killing hostages
if they moved upon the prison.

468
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,002
Too bad our masked vigilante friends
didn't get the memo.

469
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,920
Well, too bad for you, really.

470
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,761
Kill them.

471
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,606
You no longer have the drive to kill,
and it shows.

472
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,849
You lost a part of yourself
when they cured you of that bloodlust.

473
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,283
And that is why you will never beat me.

474
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,964
Andrew Diggle. It's been a while.

475
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,690
- Let him go.
- Drop your weapons.

476
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,484
- Don't do it.
- Suit yourself,

477
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,806
but on the count of three,

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,890
I'm gonna turn that wall into a Jackson
Pollock painting with his brains.

479
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,650
- One...
- Dammit!

480
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,887
Two...

481
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,206
Okay.

482
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,766
Now, was that so hard?

483
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,920
I believe you have something for me.

484
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,561
Andy?

485
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,721
I'm sorry, man.

486
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,681
Andy?

487
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,364
I've been tracking your movements
for months.

488
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,686
<i>I</i> know everywhere you've been.

489
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,885
All I needed to hear
was that it was you that hid the stone.

490
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,606
Was there ever a chance for you?

491
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,411
Your brother's way beyond reach,
Mr. Diggle.

492
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,211
It's all over now.

493
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,724
You took the words right out of my mouth.

494
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,810
It needs a sacrifice.

495
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,447
Not enough.

496
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,926
<i>You know what to do.</i>

497
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,130
Oh, it feels so much better.

498
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,847
I am sorry about your buddies.
But omelets and eggs and all of that.

499
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,961
<i>But I know
how to make it up to you, though.</i>

500
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,966
Who wants to take go for a walk outside?

501
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,124
Andy, here, might have mentioned
that his brother, John,

502
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,641
worked for the Green Arrow,
or should I say

503
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,651
Oliver Queen.

504
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,485
Oh, and see, I know what you're all
thinking, but, no, but he didn't tell me.

505
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,684
It was really just a hop, skip and a jump
from the whole Diggle connection to you,

506
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,127
to your little sister,
to your ex-girlfriend.

507
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,800
But when you came to rescue that boy,
William, that look on your face...

508
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,331
That was a father's look.

509
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,164
I should have recognized it
there and then.

510
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,526
We need to get out of here. Now.

511
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,040
Pafience.

512
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,320
I've been waiting for this moment
for a long time.

513
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,567
Ms. Lance.

514
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,006
Nine months ago,

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,286
I made your daddy a promise.

516
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,009
I told him what I would do
if he betrayed me.

517
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,167
Impressive. Now where was I?

518
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,525
Oh, yeah.

519
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,004
I want you to give your father
a message from me.

520
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,040
I want you to tell him...

521
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,648
I'm a man of my word.

522
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,921
Hey! Hey. It's all right. It's okay.

523
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,491
Hey, hey. Look at me.
You're gonna be all right.

524
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,210
You'll be all right. Come on!

525
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,607
Help! Help in here, please!

526
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,050
You have to help her. Please!

527
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,725
She's lost a lot of blood.

528
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,281
I need a crash cart and the trauma team
in here stat!

529
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,606
- Let her go.
- What?

530
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,406
I need you to let her go
so I can do my job.

531
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,085
Now, leave! The trauma team
will be in here any second.

532
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,720
And the last thing she needs
right now is a circus.

533
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,649
Go! Go.

534
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,485
How do you know how to do this?
To bury a man alive?

535
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,606
You were right.
How this island changed you.

536
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,929
Do you still look at your picture?

537
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,526
She's beautiful. Who is she?

538
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,490
Her name is Laurel Lance.

539
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,927
And she was my home

540
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,850
before all of this.

541
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,442
I don't know what she'll think
of the man I've become.

542
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,810
If I don't make it off this island,
you will go to Russia and find my parents,

543
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,530
and tell them what happened
to me and Vlad.

544
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,125
If you don't make it,

545
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,969
I will find this Laurel
and tell her how you saved us all.

546
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,805
Deal?

547
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,801
Deal.

548
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,686
Baron, we've got to get out of here.

549
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,640
There is no getting out.

550
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,802
But with your deaths,
I might yet just live.

551
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,200
What're you talking about?

552
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,480
<i>Iron Heights has left the city on edge.</i>

553
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,730
Hey, Lopez. Lopez.
What happened at the, uh, at the prison?

554
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,530
Uh, you punched out a lieutenant.

555
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,088
Yeah, I mean after that.
Did they keep those inmates from escaping?

556
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,371
There's too many of them.
And one, Darhk, he hurt one of them.

557
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,686
What? Who, who did he hurt?

558
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,890
The vigilantes. The Black Canary.
Supposedly, he hurt her real bad.

559
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,363
Uh... Um...

560
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,682
All right, listen.
I gotta get out of here, all right.

561
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,049
It's really important,
so please can you get me, uh...

562
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,890
Can you get Lieutenant Pike on the phone?

563
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,566
He's out supervising the manhunt
for the escaped prisoners.

564
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,040
Listen, you gotta get him on the phone,
all right?

565
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,207
'Cause I gotta talk to him.

566
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,731
'Cause I gotta get out of here.
Just for an hour.

567
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,042
Then I'll surrender myself back in,
all right? It's fine.

568
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,569
Butjust, just...
Get Lieutenant Pike on the phone. Please.

569
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,807
Laurel, is she...

570
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,128
Laurel's in surgery. Um...

571
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,721
I don't know.

572
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,248
I've tried calling Lance, too, so...

573
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,970
What happened with Darhk?

574
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,562
He's in the wind.
Along with 50 or so inmates.

575
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,966
And Andy.

576
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,805
You warned me, and I didn't listen.

577
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,280
How am I gonna be able to forgive myself?

578
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,801
Oh, my God.

579
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,691
She's out of recovery.
She's gonna be fine.

580
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,770
She's a strong woman, your friend.

581
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,611
The strongest.

582
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,205
She's been asking for you.

583
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,686
Hi.

584
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,406
Hey, yourself.

585
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,161
Did Darhk...

586
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,765
Don't worry about him.

587
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,646
Just worry about getting better, okay?

588
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,446
It's not exactly how I wanted
my last night to go.

589
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,200
What are you talking about?

590
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,526
It's a long story.

591
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,161
I was gonna give up being
the Black Canary, but...

592
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,483
I realized I didn't know how I could.

593
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,245
Because going out there
and fighting alongside you guys,

594
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,801
that's what makes me feel alive inside.

595
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,604
And I love you guys so much.

596
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,166
We love you.

597
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,646
We love you.

598
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,206
We love you.

599
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,767
We should probably let you get some rest.

600
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,605
- We'll be right outside, okay?
- Okay.

601
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,850
You should probably get some rest, too.

602
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,241
No chance.

603
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,965
I'm gonna stay right here.

604
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,886
It's, um...

605
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,284
There's something in my left pouch.
Will you bring it to me?

606
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,361
Yeah.

607
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,485
- May I?
- Yeah.

608
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,051
You kept this?

609
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,601
Yeah.

610
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,166
It's a little reminder
of when things were simpler.

611
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,840
For us.

612
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,410
The way we used to be.

613
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,411
I'm really glad that you found Felicity.

614
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,527
I hope you find your way back to her.

615
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,970
And, Ollie, I know
that I am not the love of your life,

616
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,008
but you will always be the love of mine.

617
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,330
Why are you telling me this?

618
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,160
Why now?

619
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,647
Because tonight
it was just a reminder that

620
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,680
anything can happen.

621
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,365
Which is why I need you
to promise me something.

622
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,646
Just got off the phone with Captain Lance.
He's on his way.

623
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,809
I, I told him that she's doing fine.

624
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,041
Out of the way!

625
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,801
She's seizing.

626
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,401
Embolism! I need 5,000 units
of heparin bolus.

627
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,525
- What happened?
- I don't know. She was fine.

628
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,688
Paddles.

629
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,529
- Charging 200. Go.
- Clear.

630
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,801
Clear.

631
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,121
Nothing.

632
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,642
<i>Let's gag her.
Open up her air way.</i>

633
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,530
Come on. Come on.

634
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,731
<i>"MALE DOCTOR". Lodge 30% drop.</i>

635
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,002
- Come on!
<i>- 6-12.</i>

636
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,000
Come on, Laurel.

637
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,326
<i>No response.</i>

638
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,491
Time of death, 11:59.

639
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,281
