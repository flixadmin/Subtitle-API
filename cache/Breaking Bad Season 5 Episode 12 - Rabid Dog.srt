2
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,662
Jesse!?

3
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:50,692
Jesse!

4
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:56,335
You show yourself right now!

5
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,353
I'll be in touch.

6
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,822
Okay. Hey, Huell.

7
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:39,193
Listen, I want you to swing by the
high school on your way to Saul's.

8
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:42,079
I can't believe that he would
go after my son, but...

9
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,214
You got it.

10
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,882
And Kuby's
at the car wash, right?

11
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,751
Parked right across the street.

12
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:48,586
All's quiet.
No Pinkman.

13
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:50,671
Okay.
Just find him.

14
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:10,157
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

15
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:14,728
Jesse, listen, uh,

16
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,564
I mean, obviously
you've changed your mind here,

17
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:20,251
and so thank you for that.

18
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:23,004
And I know you're angry.

19
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,673
I wanna fix this, okay?

20
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:28,626
Whatever it takes, all right?

21
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:32,546
We'll talk, and we will fix this.

22
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,549
Until then, just...

23
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,585
just...
sleep it off, okay?

24
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,638
And then call me.

25
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:42,356
Be safe.

26
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:46,978
How's it coming?

27
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:49,030
I replaced the doorjamb
and the striker plate.

28
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:50,264
Switch this out,
we'll be good to go.

29
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:51,315
Good.

30
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:53,100
Oh, hey, uh,
do you want separate keys

31
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:54,118
for the different locks,

32
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:55,786
or do you want just one
working both?

33
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,872
No, no, no.
No re-key.

34
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:00,291
Same exact keys as before.

35
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,043
Okay, it's just that
usually with a break-in,

36
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:03,210
people like to get new keys.

37
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:05,079
No, same key, same locks.

38
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,381
The old keys
have to work here, okay?

39
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,334
- Okay.
- All right.

40
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:15,788
Good.

41
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,644
Good.
Good, good, good, good.

42
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:26,734
Oh, no, no.

43
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:28,302
Um, hey, guys, guys, guys.

44
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,488
Cut that.
Yeah, this, uh...

45
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:31,906
That area's still pretty bad.

46
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,275
Right, right.
We'll have to go over this a lot more.

47
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,077
Well, we've made
three passes already.

48
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,778
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.

49
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:39,447
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

50
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,115
The smell has got
to be gone completely.

51
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,616
My wife is coming home,

52
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,585
and I can't have any odor,
any stain,

53
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:47,088
any sign that anything
happened here.

54
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:49,990
Understand?

55
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:51,509
I... I know.

56
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:55,012
This is short notice,
and I really appreciate it.

57
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,381
Sir... sir, we'd love
to take more of your money,

58
00:06:57,432 --> 00:07:00,468
but you've got gas soaked straight
through to your subfloor.

59
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:03,437
Until you pull this up and
get new carpet, new padding,

60
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:04,972
this is as good as it gets.

61
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:24,811
Is that gasoline?

62
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:25,863
Ask dad.

63
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:28,815
Hey. Over here.

64
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,501
What happened?

65
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:32,819
What happened is that
I should sue someone.

66
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,338
That's what happened.

67
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,423
So I'm on my way
to the drugstore,

68
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,292
and I have to stop
to get some gas,

69
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:41,629
and there is this
total pump malfunction.

70
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:43,664
You know what? She really
shouldn't be in this room at all.

71
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:46,550
I mean, this is supposedly
green, but you know how it is.

72
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,769
You can close the windows
in the nursery,

73
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:52,005
because it's really
only out here.

74
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,775
Ugh. This is
as good as it gets.

75
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:13,077
So, um, pump malfunction?

76
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:16,697
Yeah. So I'm standing there filling up
like I've done a thousand times before,

77
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,716
and I hear a chunk.

78
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,801
You know, the pump's nozzle.

79
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,915
The... the metal thing.
The thing you squeeze, right?

80
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:27,675
I hear a chunk.
So I suppose, in my naivete,

81
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,426
I took to understand that gas

82
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:31,345
is no longer
coming out of the nozzle,

83
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,230
so I pull out the hose
to put it back

84
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,481
and whoosh!

85
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:37,551
You know, I am suddenly
soaked in gasoline.

86
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:42,156
I mean, on my arms
and my legs and my... my groin.

87
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,358
So now I am in a panic,

88
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:47,161
and I race home,
I run inside the house,

89
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:49,830
and I'm stripping off
my clothes as fast as I can.

90
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,081
I jump in the shower.

91
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,250
It's not until after
I get out of the shower

92
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,920
that I realize
my gas-covered clothes

93
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:59,623
have been soaking
in the living room rug

94
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:01,175
this entire time.

95
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,177
I mean, it's... it's...

96
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,429
the whole thing
is just so stupid.

97
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:07,748
I could have rinsed off
at the station.

98
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:09,916
Halfway home,
I'm starting to realize...

99
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:11,385
wait a minute...
there's a water hose

100
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,971
right there next to the air pump.

101
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:15,022
You know, for tires.

102
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:17,191
Anyway, so that was my day.

103
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:19,593
How was yours?

104
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:23,347
- Dad?
- Yeah.

105
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:27,268
Please, can y...
you just tell the truth?

106
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:32,921
Tell... what do you mean?

107
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,535
You fainted, didn't you?

108
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,962
'Cause you're sick again.

109
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:41,582
You were pumping gas,
and the fumes,

110
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:43,884
they... they made you
pass out again.

111
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:45,952
Just... just admit it.

112
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,389
No, the... no.

113
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:50,591
It was the pump.

114
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,014
All right, I... I...

115
00:11:57,065 --> 00:12:01,185
maybe I did get a little
swimmy at one point,

116
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:03,303
but I did not faint.
Okay?

117
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,856
I'm fine, and that's the truth.

118
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:08,141
However, in the best interest

119
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,194
of all of our continued
good health,

120
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,913
I don't think we can stay here.

121
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:14,748
I mean,
not until we get new carpet.

122
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:15,816
Yeah.

123
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,984
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie,

124
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:21,321
they... they got
plenty of space.

125
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:22,589
Hey, what about a hotel?

126
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:25,259
A hotel.
That could be sweet.

127
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,044
A... a good one.

128
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:29,546
I like the way you're thinking.
Yes.

129
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:31,598
Could be a little
family vacation.

130
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,600
Might be fun.
What do you say?

131
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,052
Why don't you put
some clothes together?

132
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:38,439
Yeah. All right.

133
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:40,507
I'm sorry.

134
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:44,144
It's not my finest hour.

135
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:45,612
I'll go pack a bag.

136
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,514
- Okay.
- Okay.

137
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:52,853
Think this'll leave a scar?

138
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:59,827
I never should have let
my Dojo membership run out.

139
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,968
Jesus.
Jesse did that?

140
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,003
Yeah, but you gotta understand,

141
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,805
deep down he loves me.

142
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,259
So... where is he?

143
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,895
- Still looking.
- Where have you looked?

144
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,481
His place, his folk's place,

145
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:22,816
uh, this Brock kid's place.

146
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:25,218
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills,

147
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,688
the Indigo, the Crystal Palace,

148
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:29,606
go-kart joint
on Copper Ave.

149
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:32,392
Uh, AA meeting off the 40.

150
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,778
His buddies,
Beaver and what's-his-name?

151
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:36,447
Uh, Badger and Skinny Pete.

152
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:38,248
Yeah, no, he's not with them.

153
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,950
They could be covering for him.

154
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,702
I posed as a meter reader.

155
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,504
I put a bug in
the tall kid's mom's place.

156
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:44,905
For three hours straight,

157
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,341
<i>all he talked about was
something called Babylon 5.</i>

158
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,960
I checked with my gal at APD.

159
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:51,929
Uh, she said Pinkman's
not in their system,

160
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,079
so the cops don't have him.

161
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:54,765
Yet.

162
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,433
Maybe he changed his mind
about leaving,

163
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,968
called your guy back.

164
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,587
No. Somebody misses their
first chance with my guy,

165
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,606
there's no second.

166
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,975
Well, keep looking.

167
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:07,427
What then?

168
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,862
What do you mean?

169
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:10,898
I mean,
Pinkman's like a bad penny.

170
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,366
Sooner or later,
he's gonna turn up.

171
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,269
I'm wondering what
you wanna do when he does.

172
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,155
Jesse is upset about the boy.

173
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,407
I just need to explain to him

174
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:22,042
why that had to happen.

175
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:26,880
Okay, but say, you know,

176
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:28,832
just for the sake of argument,

177
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:30,116
the kid's not in the mood

178
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,169
for a nuanced discussion

179
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,120
of the virtues
of child poisoning.

180
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:37,341
You know, his plans are running
more towards stabbing you to death

181
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:38,425
with a pointed stick.

182
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,428
In that scenario, then what?

183
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,982
You have a suggestion?

184
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,350
We were wondering

185
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:51,438
if maybe this isn't
an "Old Yeller" type situation.

186
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:53,907
"Old Yeller"?

187
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:55,659
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,

188
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,661
most loyal dog there ever was.

189
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,580
I mean,
everybody loved that mutt,

190
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:02,416
but one day he showed up rabid,

191
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,319
and Little Timmy,
for Old Yeller's own sake,

192
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:09,322
had to, uh...

193
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,793
Oh, you...
you saw the movie.

194
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:16,129
You're full of colorful
metaphors, aren't you, Saul?

195
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:18,882
Belize, Old Yeller.

196
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,001
Just brimming with advice.

197
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,060
Do not float that idea again.

198
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:35,032
Find him.

199
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:53,133
Sorry. Ah. Sorry. Room key wouldn't
let me into the ice room,

200
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:56,637
so I had to go down
to the front desk.

201
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,639
But here we are.

202
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,591
Checked in on Junior.

203
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:05,145
Pay-per-view and room service.
He's in heaven.

204
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:08,815
Hey, I thought you
were gonna take a bath.

205
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,069
How's Saul doing?

206
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:15,322
Saul? Goodman?

207
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:19,392
I have no idea.

208
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,945
No?

209
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,581
You were just out talking
to him in the parking lot.

210
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:31,505
I'm sorry.
Were you spying on me?

211
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,040
Yes.

212
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:36,093
And I feel
just awful about it too.

213
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,211
You know, I played along

214
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:40,263
with your
pump malfunction bullshit

215
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,248
because Junior
was standing right there,

216
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:45,636
but now I would like
to know what's going on.

217
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,728
First of all, it's no big deal.

218
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:58,031
Coming here is just me
being overly cautious.

219
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:06,323
Jesse Pinkman, you know?

220
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:11,778
He came over to the house
that time for dinner, remember?

221
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:14,965
Well, he... he got upset

222
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:17,801
over this...

223
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:21,221
something he thinks I did.

224
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:22,622
I did do it.

225
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,290
But I did it
for very good reasons.

226
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,793
It's... just...
it's complicated.

227
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:30,847
Wait. Are you...
are you telling me

228
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,816
that he tried to...

229
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,736
burn our house down?

230
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,606
That was,

231
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,826
probably for a brief moment,
his intention,

232
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,696
but obviously
he changed his mind.

233
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:49,166
And how does that work?

234
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,168
Him... him changing his mind?

235
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:55,422
Ah, God.

236
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:57,323
Look...

237
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,161
With... you've got
to understand that...

238
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,579
with... with Jesse,

239
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,783
there are emotional issues,
personal issues,

240
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:08,635
some drug abuse.

241
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:14,608
But he has always been more of a
danger to himself than anyone else.

242
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:17,978
He has a tendency
to fly off the handle.

243
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,029
That's all.

244
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:22,115
So he has never hurt anybody?

245
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,746
No.

246
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:32,292
I can't believe
you got her down so fast.

247
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:38,698
Oh...

248
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:41,968
So...

249
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,421
what's your course
of action here?

250
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:49,726
Saul's guy, Kuby,
tracks him down,

251
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,845
which shouldn't take long,

252
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:55,599
and when he does, I'm gonna...

253
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,769
I'm gonna talk to him.

254
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,937
Make him see reason.

255
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:03,573
"Talk to him.

256
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,276
Make him see reason."

257
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,949
So I'm clear,

258
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,619
these are just euphemisms...

259
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,571
you're using here, right?

260
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:22,592
No. What?

261
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:25,462
Wh-what does that mean?

262
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:26,913
My God.

263
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:29,800
I knew this was going to happen.

264
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:30,801
I knew it.

265
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:32,585
I told you that someday,

266
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:35,639
someone was going to come
to our door and try to hurt us.

267
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,140
And now here we are.

268
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,424
No.

269
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:41,061
Jesse didn't go there
to hurt anyone.

270
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:44,397
He poured gasoline
all over our house, Walt.

271
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,817
He tried to set
our house on fire.

272
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:49,269
He changed his mind.
He didn't do it, did he?

273
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,487
What if he changes it back?

274
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,077
Walt, you need

275
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:59,079
to deal with this.

276
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:00,664
How much have you had to drink?

277
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,633
Not nearly enough.

278
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,635
I... I don't know
how we got off

279
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,056
on whatever it is
we're talking about here.

280
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:13,093
But clearly, I haven't explained
the situation well enough,

281
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:15,461
because this
is a big overreaction.

282
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:19,316
We all need to just take
a deep breath and calm down,

283
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,319
because Jesse isn't just some...

284
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:25,272
some... some rabid dog.

285
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,406
This is a person.

286
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,193
A person that is a threat to us.

287
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:32,162
I mean, my God,

288
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:35,916
where we are now
with Hank and Marie

289
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,285
and that awful tape we made.

290
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,820
After everything we've done,

291
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:43,823
you can't just talk
to this person.

292
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:48,044
You're s-saying

293
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:51,598
that I just...

294
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:56,219
What... what exactly
are you saying?

295
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,889
We've come this far.

296
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:02,508
For us.

297
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:07,697
What's one more?

298
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,430
Jesse!

299
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:03,267
Stop what you're doing
and turn and face me!

300
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:07,488
You wanna... you wanna
know what he did?

301
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:09,106
You wanna hear about it?

302
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,859
Jesse, put out the lighter.

303
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,828
He poisoned a little kid.

304
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,864
An eight-year-old boy.

305
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:19,032
Just because, you know...

306
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,817
just as a move!

307
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:23,453
Walt's a bastard.
Secret's out.

308
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:24,671
We'll talk about it.

309
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:28,375
But I need you to put out
the lighter, okay?

310
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:31,328
Look, Jesse...

311
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:33,330
Jesse, I don't want to kill you.

312
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:35,883
And you don't wanna be killed.

313
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:38,668
So put it out.

314
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:44,641
He can't keep
getting away with it!

315
00:22:47,195 --> 00:22:48,979
He can't keep
getting away with it!

316
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:50,280
He won't.

317
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,452
You really wanna burn him down?

318
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:59,206
Let's do it together.

319
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,013
So you were
fo-following me?

320
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:58,632
Yeah.
Since Goodman's.

321
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:02,552
Where we going now?

322
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:07,140
DEA. Downtown.

323
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:10,760
What, I'm, like, arrested?

324
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:13,113
Yeah, you know how this works.

325
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:14,615
Be a good witness for me,

326
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:17,734
it'll go better for you.

327
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:20,770
Yeah, sitting around MDC,

328
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:23,457
waiting to be a witness
against Mr. White.

329
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:25,826
It's...

330
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:28,045
It's gonna go great for me.

331
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:42,125
So... you're angry.

332
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:45,979
I can't sleep.
I'm not eating.

333
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:52,302
Last night I was online for six hours
looking up untraceable poisons.

334
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,304
This close family friend

335
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:56,657
had been keeping a secret
from you and Hank,

336
00:24:56,691 --> 00:25:00,861
and somehow this person's
secret became known,

337
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,080
and now you're sad and hurt

338
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:05,332
and angry.

339
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:09,870
I'm...
I'm in the ballpark?

340
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:14,791
To be this wrong about someone.

341
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:16,877
This off.

342
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:20,163
We all live double-lives
to some extent, don't we?

343
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:21,998
- We all have our secrets.
- Yeah.

344
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:24,017
Not like this.

345
00:25:25,303 --> 00:25:27,304
Not like him.

346
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:31,358
Marie, I think it's time
you filled me in

347
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,343
on some more details here.

348
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:35,529
Who and what
are we talking about?

349
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:37,481
I said I can't do that.

350
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:40,067
It'd be bad for Hank.

351
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:43,537
Our friend made that clear
in his little movie.

352
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:48,909
Those kids...

353
00:25:50,194 --> 00:25:52,162
under his roof.

354
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:53,530
That baby.

355
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:58,001
I'm sick just thinking about it.

356
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:00,670
How could I have not seen this?

357
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,376
If I weren't being such a...

358
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,746
idiotic, stupid idiot,
I could've...

359
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:11,782
We could have...

360
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,921
Blackjack winnings.

361
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:21,024
Nothing suspicious
about that at all.

362
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,560
Tell me about this movie.

363
00:26:23,578 --> 00:26:26,947
Dave, can't we simply

364
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:29,065
just focus on my feelings here?

365
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,668
The details don't
really matter, do they?

366
00:26:31,702 --> 00:26:34,004
There is nothing
to be done, okay?

367
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:35,956
He screwed us, and he won.

368
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:38,959
Can we just...

369
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,628
Can we talk about
something else, please?

370
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,597
Yes?

371
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,250
How's work?

372
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:51,605
Last week, you were upset
about the new parking rules.

373
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:58,779
Marie?

374
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:02,949
Saxitotoxin.

375
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:04,951
"Derived from shellfish.

376
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:09,606
Produces a flaccid paralysis
that leaves the victim conscious

377
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:13,210
through a progression
of symptoms.

378
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:15,328
Death occurs
from respiratory failure."

379
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:17,947
That is definitely a contender.

380
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:20,617
Marie,

381
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:23,720
you're not ready
to fill me in here,

382
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:26,089
that's fine.

383
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:29,125
But I want you to listen.

384
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:32,562
There is no problem,
no matter how difficult

385
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:35,965
or painful
or seemingly unsolvable,

386
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:37,767
that violence won't make worse.

387
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,655
I know. I...

388
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,824
Don't worry.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.

389
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:46,493
I just...

390
00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:54,167
It just feels good
to think about it.

391
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,927
- Hey, babe.
- What's the story here?

392
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:06,179
Oh, uh, well, uh,
something's come up.

393
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:08,515
I thought you might wanna
get outta the house for a day or two.

394
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,601
You thought I might wanna
pack up and move out of my own house.

395
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:13,186
Why?
What's going on?

396
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:15,605
Look, I don't wanna
get into it now.

397
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,024
But you know that thing with Walt?
There's, uh...

398
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,026
there's been a development.

399
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:21,862
What happened?
Are you in danger?

400
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:23,530
No. No, no, no,
not at all.

401
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:25,649
Just...
it's a fluid situation,

402
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:28,235
and I think it might go a little
smoother if you're not here.

403
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:30,687
So, I, uh...
it'll be great, you know?

404
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:33,022
I-I-I booked you
a spa package at La Posada.

405
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,958
You can do
that river stones thing.

406
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:37,244
Hank, what the hell is going on?

407
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:41,631
Hank?

408
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,917
We have a guest.

409
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,395
He was a little keyed-up.
Gave him a couple sleeping pills.

410
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:05,722
Okay. So listen.

411
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,108
I bring that kid in and...
and put him in the system,

412
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,726
Walt's gonna find out
five minutes later.

413
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:13,229
You know, my last ten witnesses
died in jail, remember?

414
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:16,249
A-a-and I can't use a DEA safe
house without writing him up.

415
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:18,034
I can't risk a... a motel.

416
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:20,921
I know it sounds crazy,
but this is the best place for him.

417
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:23,206
For now.
Just for a day or two, tops.

418
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,742
Okay, just answer me
this one question...

419
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,744
Is this bad for Walt?

420
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:29,296
Yeah. Very.

421
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:33,266
Good. I'm staying.

422
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:35,752
I'll heat up lasagna.

423
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,221
Phone's ringing.

424
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:54,237
<i>You have one new voice mail.</i>

425
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:58,941
<i>Jesse, listen.</i>

426
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,710
<i>Uh...</i>

427
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:03,496
<i>I mean, obviously
you've changed your mind here,</i>

428
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:06,333
<i>and so thank you for that.</i>

429
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:08,468
<i>And I know you're angry.</i>

430
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:11,838
<i>And I wanna fix this, okay?</i>

431
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:14,424
<i>Whatever it takes, all right?</i>

432
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,509
<i>We'll talk, and we will fix this.</i>

433
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:21,481
<i>Until then, just...</i>

434
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:24,484
<i>just... sleep it off, okay?</i>

435
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:27,153
<i>And then call me.</i>

436
00:30:27,188 --> 00:30:29,138
<i>Be safe.</i>

437
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:57,769
Hey.

438
00:30:57,803 --> 00:30:59,270
Hey.

439
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:01,189
What are you still doing up?

440
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:02,857
Couldn't sleep.

441
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:04,809
Ah. You and me both.

442
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:07,512
Here. Have a seat.

443
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:15,737
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah.

444
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:19,124
Just business stuff.

445
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,544
Going over some options.

446
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:25,997
You guys still think
you might buy another car wash?

447
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:32,137
Oh, uh, yeah.
Well, maybe.

448
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:34,372
See how it goes.

449
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,374
How it goes now that...

450
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:39,260
now that you're...
you're sick again, right?

451
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:42,897
No. That's not
what I mean.

452
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:46,017
Hey. Told you not to worry,
remember?

453
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,103
H-how can I not worry?

454
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:49,771
Come on.

455
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:51,606
You think I came all this way

456
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:53,825
just to let something
as silly as lung cancer

457
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:56,661
take me down?

458
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:59,614
Not a chance.

459
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:02,367
I'm not going anywhere.

460
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,758
Should've brought our suits, huh?

461
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:21,853
It's okay.

462
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,755
It's all right.

463
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:34,949
I'll be up in a minute.

464
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:36,818
Okay.

465
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:38,769
See you in the morning.

466
00:32:38,787 --> 00:32:40,738
Okay.

467
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,584
Would you like some coffee?

468
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:04,455
Morning.

469
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,374
You want some coffee?

470
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:08,743
Uh, no.
Uh, the lady, um...

471
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:10,745
I think your wife...

472
00:34:10,796 --> 00:34:12,747
You take cream and sugar?

473
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:15,750
Uh, black's...
black's good.

474
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,919
Thanks.

475
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:29,764
Uh, thanks.

476
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:35,603
Thanks.

477
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:47,064
This is probably
gonna take awhile.

478
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:48,983
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:50,952
- I'll run some errands.
- Okay.

480
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:52,620
<i>All right.</i>

481
00:34:52,654 --> 00:34:55,439
Uh, you remember, uh,
Agent Gomez?

482
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:01,128
How you feeling?
Your head clear?

483
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:03,581
Yeah.

484
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:05,583
This... this can't be
what you mean

485
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:09,286
by burning him
to the ground, right?

486
00:35:09,304 --> 00:35:11,672
I-I got stories
that'll make your toes curl,

487
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:15,643
but, you know, it's just
"My word against his word" kind of stuff.

488
00:35:15,677 --> 00:35:19,013
So, you know, I don't really have
any, like, proof or anything.

489
00:35:19,064 --> 00:35:21,015
Gomie, can you, uh, grab
the curtains over there?

490
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:23,734
There's a...
there's a glare thing happening here.

491
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:29,023
You know he's retired,
right? He's...

492
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:31,158
he's not even
in the business anymore.

493
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:33,327
So you're never gonna catch him
with a camcorder.

494
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:34,812
We're gonna catch him.

495
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,948
We gotta do this first, okay?
Come on.

496
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:46,724
Just, uh, tell us
everything you remember.

497
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:50,211
Any business dealings,
any personal dealings,

498
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:53,598
any criminal activity you
were a witness or a party to.

499
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:55,516
Anything and everything.

500
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:58,052
Just tell us your story, okay?

501
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,171
Start from the beginning.

502
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:03,674
When did you
first meet Walter White?

503
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:08,229
Right. Okay, uh...

504
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:14,402
I first met Mr. White...

505
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:16,704
Walter White...

506
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:19,907
in junior year chemistry.

507
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:24,862
He was my teacher.

508
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:41,729
You believe him?

509
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:44,515
Yeah.
I do, unfortunately.

510
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:46,517
And I hate to admit it,

511
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:49,103
but I think the kid is right.

512
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:51,555
There is no physical evidence,
not that I heard.

513
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:53,724
Yeah, well, no weapons,

514
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:56,327
no bodies, no working lab.

515
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:59,196
Just the word of one nut-job
meth-head

516
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,866
against
Mr. Rogers-Has-A-Lung-Tumor.

517
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,085
So, do we take a run
at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?

518
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,421
Vamonos Pest? Follow up
with the Drew Sharp killing?

519
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,923
Where do we start?

520
00:37:08,957 --> 00:37:11,909
I say we start with this.

521
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:14,244
<i>Jesse,</i>

522
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:18,716
<i>I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza
tomorrow at noon.</i>

523
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,718
<i>I hope you'll give me the chance</i>

524
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:23,087
<i>to explain myself</i>

525
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:26,440
<i>and talk through everything
once and for all.</i>

526
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:31,929
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>

527
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:34,649
<i>So if you wanna come
and shoot me in the head,</i>

528
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,034
<i>that's up to you.</i>

529
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:41,288
<i>Either way,</i>

530
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:43,824
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>

531
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:56,954
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

532
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:58,956
Go and talk to that asshole?

533
00:37:58,974 --> 00:38:00,958
You... you can't
be serious.

534
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,459
Go and listen.

535
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:04,178
He wants to explain himself.

536
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:06,797
We put a wire on you
and let him explain.

537
00:38:06,815 --> 00:38:09,967
So your plan is to do his plan?

538
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:11,986
You... you seriously think
that this...

539
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,106
this whole "Once and for all
in the Plaza" thing

540
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,607
is so he can talk to me?

541
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,160
Why not?

542
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:22,312
I... I...
I can't believe you two.

543
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,916
The dude wanted me out of town before
I came to burn his house down,

544
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:28,119
and now I'm even more
of a threat to him, okay?

545
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:31,038
And he's got a zero-tolerance
policy on threats, you know?

546
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:34,375
If I go to this Plaza,
I'm a dead man is why not.

547
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:36,544
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

548
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:39,764
He'll do just about anything
to protect his interests.

549
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:43,551
I agree.
Except when it comes to you.

550
00:38:43,602 --> 00:38:46,554
He cares about you.

551
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:48,389
Can't you see?

552
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,691
Oh, yeah.
You mean when he's not,

553
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:53,527
uh, ripping me off
or calling me an idiot

554
00:38:53,562 --> 00:38:56,614
or poisoning people
that I care about?

555
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:59,567
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.
Everyone knows that.

556
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:02,820
No, I mean it.
Based on everything you told us.

557
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:04,872
Uh, he paid for your rehab,

558
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:07,124
uh, ran over those two
drug dealers with his car.

559
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,909
Sounds like he saved your life.

560
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,328
Uh, made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

561
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,598
Yeah, no, he sort of did. I'm the
only one near as good as him, so...

562
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,267
I don't know.
The way you tell it,

563
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,636
sounds to me like he's
manipulating you to stick around.

564
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,137
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.

565
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:22,072
I mean with all those numbers
he... he runs on you,

566
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,725
over and over,
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

567
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,727
Come on.
Look how far he'll go to show you...

568
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:29,597
to convince you
that he's not such a bad guy.

569
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:32,216
- That's what this is.
- What if it's about, um,

570
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:34,218
killing me, you know?

571
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:36,570
You know, getting me
out in the open,

572
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:40,157
hire some, uh...
some clock tower guy,

573
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:43,727
or... or have me sit on a poison needle,
or something, you know?

574
00:39:43,745 --> 00:39:45,229
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

575
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:47,231
I mean, the Plaza's
one of the most wide-open

576
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,066
public places
in all of Albuquerque.

577
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:50,567
It's middle of the day.

578
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:52,753
And Agent Gomez and I
will be right there with you.

579
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:54,905
Look...
look, you two guys

580
00:39:54,923 --> 00:39:58,959
are just... guys, okay?

581
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,746
Mr. White...
he's the devil.

582
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:05,466
You know, he is...
he is smarter than you,

583
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:07,518
he is luckier than you.

584
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:09,770
Whatever... whatever you think
is supposed to happen...

585
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:12,923
I'm telling you,
the exact reverse opposite

586
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:14,925
of that is gonna happen, okay?

587
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:18,863
Jesse... Jesse,
we're not brainstorming here.

588
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:21,148
This is not asking.

589
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,317
Unless you know
another way to get the man,

590
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:24,985
or unless
you wanna take your chances

591
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,037
with the banger boys over in MDC,

592
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:28,706
then this is it.

593
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,275
This is what's happening.

594
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,277
I gotta piss.
Can I piss?

595
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:35,946
Yeah.
Down to the left.

596
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:40,117
You got another SD card?

597
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:44,255
What?

598
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:47,141
What if the kid's right?
What if it's a trap?

599
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:49,510
"The kid"?

600
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:52,062
Oh, you mean the junkie murderer

601
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:54,298
that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

602
00:40:56,017 --> 00:40:58,185
Well, then, he's right.

603
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:00,637
Pinkman gets killed,

604
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,157
and we get it all on tape.

605
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:12,854
Remember, you're
hurt, you're angry,

606
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:14,856
but you're here
for answers, okay?

607
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,526
But don't, uh...
don't push the questions, okay?

608
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,028
Let's not get him suspicious,
all right?

609
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:23,115
You let him do the talking,
right?

610
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,250
Just relax. That's what...
that's what matters most.

611
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:27,285
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

612
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:31,706
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

613
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,792
<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
You getting that?</i>

614
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,544
<i>Loud and clear, idiota.</i>

615
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,078
<i>How's it looking, Gomie?</i>

616
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,765
No change.

617
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:41,716
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>

618
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,685
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>

619
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,720
Ready to kick some ass, partner?

620
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:52,144
All right.
Time to go.

621
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,142
Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?
What's with the kid?

622
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:16,177
He's just standing there.

623
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:19,013
<i>What the hell's he doing?</i>

624
00:43:40,586 --> 00:43:43,221
He's on the move now.

625
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:44,839
He's taking off.
I think he's running.

626
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,041
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, kid.
Come on.

627
00:43:55,735 --> 00:43:58,853
You got him?
He's at the pay phone.

628
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,022
Who the hell is he calling?

629
00:44:03,276 --> 00:44:05,527
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Come on, kid.

630
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:07,495
No! Come on!

631
00:44:20,126 --> 00:44:21,459
Hello?

632
00:44:22,511 --> 00:44:24,579
Nice try, asshole.

633
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:27,515
<i>Jesse, where are you?</i>

634
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,217
<i>I just wanna talk to you.</i>

635
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:32,587
No. I'm not doing what you want anymore.
Okay, asshole?

636
00:44:32,605 --> 00:44:35,890
<i>This is just a heads-up to let
you know I'm coming for you.</i>

637
00:44:36,892 --> 00:44:38,443
<i>See, I decided</i>

638
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,595
<i>that burning down your house
is nothing.</i>

639
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:44,199
Next time, I'm gonna get you
where you really live.

640
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,484
<i>Jesse, listen to me.</i>

641
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:49,621
Jesse? Jesse?

642
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,348
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Hey!

643
00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:31,696
Get in.

644
00:45:31,747 --> 00:45:33,648
Little son of a bitch!

645
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,316
Stupid, high little...

646
00:45:35,334 --> 00:45:36,984
What the hell
was that all about, huh?

647
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:38,503
What were you thinking?

648
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:40,538
- Thinking there's another way.
- What?

649
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:44,342
To get him.
There's another way.

650
00:45:46,512 --> 00:45:48,463
A better way.

651
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:07,899
Uh...

652
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,617
Hey.

653
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,486
It's Walt.

654
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,043
I'm okay.

655
00:46:18,077 --> 00:46:20,161
I, uh...

656
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:23,631
Todd,

657
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:27,135
I think I might have
another job for your uncle.
