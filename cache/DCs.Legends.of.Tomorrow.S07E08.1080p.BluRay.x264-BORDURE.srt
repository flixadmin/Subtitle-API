1
00:00:02,337 --> 00:00:05,965
<i>It all started when a man
named Bishop created a team of robots.</i>

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,302
<i>He sent them back in time
with one goal...</i>

3
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:12,889
<i>to destroy the 20th century.</i>

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,852
<i>These machines were programmed
to think that they were beyond human...</i>

5
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,481
<i>that they were superheroes.</i>

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,900
<i>They made their way across country,</i>

7
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:27,278
<i>murdering some
of the greatest figures in history,</i>

8
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:29,864
<i>famous lawmen and men of science.</i>

9
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,616
Great Scott!

10
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:37,080
<i>Finally, they kidnapped
the inventor of time travel itself,</i>

11
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:41,417
<i>and with his help, set their sights
on destroying all of history.</i>

12
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,629
<i>No one could stop
these so-called Legends.</i>

13
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:46,631
<i>Not until we came along...</i>

14
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:50,009
<i>the real flesh and blood superheroes
whose job it is</i>

15
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:51,844
<i>to put history back on track.</i>

16
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,807
<i>We're the real Legends of Tomorrow.</i>

17
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:05,858
I'm gonna go get some drinks, okay?

18
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:07,694
- I'll tell you what.
- What?

19
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,654
You made a pretty kick-ass boss.

20
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,614
Okay, I can't tell.
Is that your serious voice,

21
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:13,032
or your "making fun of me" voice?

22
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,910
Oh, just take the compliment.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,453
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

24
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,638
The device can read
all of Gideon's thoughts.

25
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,557
- We've got eyes on Bishop.
- Bishop.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,017
What a lame-ass name.

27
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,494
If you'll allow me to install it,

28
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,318
I should have you ready to jump
in 30 minutes.

29
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,398
Oh, looks like he managed to save
the time-terrorists' ship.

30
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,650
Oh, I can't wait to smash
that janky-ass piece of junk.

31
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:49,068
- I'm...
- Cool it, Steel.

32
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,237
Not until we have IDs on all of them.

33
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:56,743
We've got eyes on three bots.

34
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,747
- These dicks are having a party.
- Idiots.

35
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:02,600
"Way to go, Legends.

36
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,377
We totally screwed up
the timeline... oh, again."

37
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,505
Hey, B, would you rather
take out robo-you or robo-me?

38
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,840
Both.

39
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,759
Hey, you just leave robo-me
for me, okay?

40
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,971
Nobody's taking out anybody
until these civilians clear out.

41
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:27,065
Thank God their sad little dance party
is finally breaking up.

42
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,652
<i>Gary, on my mark,
you're gonna kill the lights.</i>

43
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,073
No, Gary, we're not gonna save one
so you can eat it.

44
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,325
They're droids. How dumb is he?

45
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:38,910
Here we go.

46
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,373
Three, two, one.

47
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,506
She's here.

48
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,726
All right. Come on,
time machine's this way.

49
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,779
- Now it's that way.
- Could've parked closer.

50
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,788
- Eat lead, you stupid droids.
- We've got 'em now.

51
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,749
Look out! Go, go! Get down!

52
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,545
They're pinned down.
I'm moving in.

53
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,422
I'll cover you.

54
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,223
No! Don't!

55
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,687
I've got Bishop.
Stay on the androids.

56
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,629
We have two down.

57
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,632
Where's the target?

58
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,178
Bishop's been eliminated.
Legends got away.

59
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,056
Damn it!
Get these two to the MedBay ASAP.

60
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,143
Those Legends might have
got away this time,

61
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,980
but mark my words,
those suckers are gonna pay for this.

62
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,683
I should have never let these two
out in the field.

63
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,393
Well, at least we got one of theirs.

64
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,062
What happened to Bishop's body?

65
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,565
Oh! Damn, Gary. Your breath is terrible.

66
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,694
No, you can't eat them.
These are your teammates.

67
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:19,946
Or they were.

68
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,074
I will avenge you, Zari.

69
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,786
I'll avenge you first, Astra.

70
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,456
Get them to the infirmary, stat.

71
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,542
Can't you see that they're dead?

72
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,126
Don't tell me how to run my OR,

73
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,337
and I won't tell you
how to run your team, Captain.

74
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:40,716
Bring them to me.

75
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,393
- Gideon.
- Yes, Captain Lance.

76
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:54,021
Keep an eye on the timeline.
It won't be long

77
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,315
before those idiots
screw something else up.

78
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,325
Gideon, weren't the evil versions
of us just in Russia?

79
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,077
You are correct, Mr. Heywood.

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,079
But the repercussions
of the events they altered

81
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,242
are just starting to be felt
throughout the timeline.

82
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,624
Where are they now?

83
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,086
Unclear, Captain.
It appears their team has gone dark.

84
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,797
There's a lot of red
on that time-thingy.

85
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,633
And one thing I do know, red ain't good.

86
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:26,178
It's that kind of insight
that makes you my right-hand man.

87
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,514
I thought it was
'cause I was strong as steel.

88
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,142
And always hard.

89
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,643
I was joking.

90
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,562
Ah! Got me. Good.

91
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:35,730
But, seriously.

92
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,608
You ever wonder why Bishop
built a bunch of time-traveling rogues

93
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,859
that look like us?

94
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,278
'Cause he's a dick and he hates history?

95
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,238
Doesn't make any sense.

96
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,743
I mean, why would they make it
so some '20s songbird

97
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,453
doesn't get offed by her boyfriend?

98
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,248
Or a bunch of World War II
factory workers get a promotion.

99
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,752
There's gotta be some
rhyme or reason to it.

100
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,588
They seem to love saving
history's greatest nobodies.

101
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,925
Eh. I wouldn't think about it
too much, Captain. Sorry.

102
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,428
You're probably right.

103
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,972
Let's get back to the task at hand.

104
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,017
Cleaning up the Legends' mess
so we can finally catch up to them.

105
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,063
And this one is going to require
a major cleanup.

106
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,566
Gideon, plot a course to Ukraine, 1986.

107
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,069
So we can punch history back into shape!

108
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,326
All right, team, it's go time.

109
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:34,121
Gideon hasn't been able to identify
the exact nature of the Aberration.

110
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,874
Why not? I thought
she was a supercomputer.

111
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,417
'Cause time's like cement, dumbass.

112
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,754
Just something Gideon used to say.

113
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,049
Whatever. Time to rock 'n' roll.

114
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,678
Time to save history for Astra.

115
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,137
For Zari.

116
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:51,958
<i>Now that's sweet, brother.</i>

117
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,392
<i>Yeah,
I'm really touched, Spooner.</i>

118
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,726
What?

119
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:56,894
They're alive?

120
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,689
Try not to have too much fun without me.

121
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,544
We're locating the epicenter for you.

122
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,151
So much for avenging their death.

123
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,754
It's just as well.

124
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,863
Gideon designated this
a no-kill mission.

125
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,658
- Oh, come on!
- So what are these?

126
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,660
I made them special for the mission.

127
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,412
I call them Destiny Restoration Devices.

128
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,538
What does it do?

129
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,891
If I could take the time
to explain the exact science to you...

130
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,001
- Science is lame.
- You're lame.

131
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,545
Nice comeback.
Where'd you get that, your mom?

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,171
Knock it off, you two.

133
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:27,216
Nate, take the team to the epicenter
of the Aberration.

134
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,885
Lay low until I rendezvous
with more information.

135
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,129
And what are you going to do?

136
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,015
Something I need to look into.

137
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,893
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

138
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,155
Sorry to interrupt, Doc.

139
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,117
You should be in the field.

140
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,452
I don't need to remind you

141
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,579
that your android doppelgangers
are still at large.

142
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,832
I just wanted to say thank you.

143
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,834
Thank me for what?

144
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,211
That patch-up job you did on my team.

145
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,047
I thought they were goners.

146
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,425
They were lucky.

147
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,802
And back on their feet so soon.

148
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,680
I advised Zari and Astra
to stay on the ship.

149
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,474
They're more suited
for intelligence work.

150
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,518
You seem to have a lot of thoughts
on how I should run my team.

151
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:20,936
Do I?

152
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,772
Captain, I'm sorry to interrupt,

153
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,982
but I've identified
the source of the Aberration.

154
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,776
It's a Soviet military installation

155
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,153
located at
the Chernobyl nuclear facility.

156
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,030
Sounds like you should be on your way.

157
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,458
Zari?

158
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,544
Her medical records,
they're confidential.

159
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,048
Good luck out there, Captain.

160
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,027
Hopefully, you can bring your team
back in one piece this time.

161
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,111
I've harvested everything I can
from the damaged units.

162
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,739
Gideon, fire up the incinerator.

163
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,074
Yes, Dr. Sharpe.

164
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:22,039
Let's hope these new versions
work better than the last ones.

165
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,468
Nothing happening at the epicenter.

166
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,680
That's because it's on the move.

167
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,141
Headed your way.

168
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,371
<i>The source of the Aberration
appears to be in the lead vehicle.</i>

169
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,855
That was some fast hacking,
even for you.

170
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,732
Whatever Dr. Sharpe gave me
has me feeling like a new person.

171
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,652
Whose asses do we gotta kick
to get history back on track?

172
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,738
You don't have much time.
Whatever you do, do it fast.

173
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,615
<i>The reactor is going critical soon.</i>

174
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,492
The Robo-Legends caused the meltdown?

175
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,251
Worse.
They tried to save the people from it.

176
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,794
Those monsters.

177
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:12,214
Our job is to make sure that convoy
doesn't make it to safety, understood?

178
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,551
The Aberration seems to be centered
on a historically significant individual

179
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,844
named General Kalashnik.

180
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,972
We can assume he was supposed to die
in the original timeline.

181
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,891
What did he do in this version?

182
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,351
Stand by. I'm not finding anything yet.

183
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,395
I'm sorry, Miss Tarazi,

184
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,898
but I am not able to execute
that temporal projection.

185
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,358
As I might have mentioned,
time is like cement.

186
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,445
Sounds like this just
turned into a kill mission.

187
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,922
I'll pop him.

188
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,281
Not if I pop him first.

189
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,200
<i>Easy, cowboys and girls.</i>

190
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,386
If we're going to make sure
that history stays on track,

191
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,412
he has to die like he's supposed to...

192
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,039
in the meltdown.

193
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,083
Nate and I will grab the General.
Spooner, Behrad,

194
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,044
you're ready to restore some destinies?

195
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:52,463
- All over it.
- You got it, Cap.

196
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,591
Gary, you're on cleanup duty.

197
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,760
Hope you brought your appetite, big guy.

198
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,095
'Cause I plan on making a big mess.

199
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,704
Steel punch.

200
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:53,440
Get some!

201
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,361
Let me show you how it's done.

202
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,489
Hey, that one was mine.

203
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,283
And this one's for my sister.

204
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,369
<i>This one's
for my best friend. And this one...</i>

205
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,288
They know we're still alive, right?

206
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:10,082
I think it's best to just let them
get it out of their systems.

207
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,438
I got him.

208
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:38,670
Where do you think
you're going, General?

209
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,073
You got a date with destiny.

210
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,326
Yeah. Boom!

211
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,995
Captain always has
the best lines.

212
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,538
Call it a tie?

213
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,707
Oh, this game ain't over.

214
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,352
All right, the sooner
we clean up this mess,

215
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,378
the sooner we can find
those Robo-Legends.

216
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,135
Stupid Gary.

217
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,102
Who are you people?

218
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,189
Well, since you're gonna be dead soon,
I might as well tell you.

219
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,067
We're time-traveling superheroes.

220
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,319
Oh.

221
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,113
Okay. Wow.

222
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,367
I must do something terrible
in the future.

223
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,494
Is that why I have to die?

224
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,996
Not exactly.

225
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,581
Well, you said "soon."

226
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,209
Surely you have time
to explain why I have to die

227
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,292
if I don't do anything wrong.

228
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,461
It's complicated.

229
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,506
You see, time is like cement.

230
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:41,924
In what way?

231
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,511
That it is hard and heavy,
or that you cannot stretch it?

232
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,199
- Or...
- You're just supposed to die.

233
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,555
It's as simple as that.

234
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:52,142
And if you don't, there's no telling
what the effects could be on history.

235
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,644
You should be flattered.

236
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,853
That means you're important.

237
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,831
Your men,
they weren't important enough to kill,

238
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,774
so we just restored their destinies.

239
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,443
<i>No, we definitely killed those men.</i>

240
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,445
What? No, they didn't die.

241
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,072
Well, not immediately.

242
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:09,076
But the doses of radiation that Spooner
and Behrad hit them with work fast.

243
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:13,497
Dr. Sharpe's Restoration Devices
irradiated people?

244
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,667
Only the people who were supposed
to get dosed by the nuclear meltdown.

245
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,253
We matched the mortality rates
from the original timeline.

246
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,838
<i>Destiny restored.</i>

247
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,131
Who are you talking to?

248
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,297
It's my team.

249
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,176
You're clearly crazy person.

250
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,555
What kind of superheroes murder people?
Give them cancer?

251
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,433
Have you ever experienced
a Timequake, General?

252
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,101
A what?

253
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,312
Then clearly, you have no idea

254
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,814
what you are talking about.

255
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,744
What are you guys doing sitting around?
We got the guy. Let's go.

256
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,413
- <i>Uh-oh.</i>
- "Uh-oh" what?

257
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,332
The map's still showing a lot of red.

258
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,709
Red ain't good.

259
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,669
<i>History is still way off track.</i>

260
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,909
Civilians are fleeing.

261
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,347
Someone must have picked up
on the military evacuation order.

262
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,893
Must be thousands of them.

263
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,936
That's a lot of destinies to restore.

264
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,981
Guys, if we don't stop this,
all these people...

265
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,066
they're going to live.

266
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,011
He says that the
people of Pripyat are fleeing the city

267
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,370
in response to the report
of a nuclear meltdown.

268
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,581
Zari, scramble the broadcast.

269
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,921
It's too late.
They've already heard the news.

270
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,684
We can't put this genie
back in the bottle.

271
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,092
Gideon, what was supposed to happen
in the original timeline?

272
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,487
According to my records,

273
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:54,515
the city of Pripyat was evacuated
36 hours after the Chernobyl meltdown.

274
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,643
And the Robo-Legends just gave them
a 37-hour head start.

275
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:01,522
Wait. If you killed the TV broadcast,
does that mean you can also hijack it?

276
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,941
There's nothing I can't hack.

277
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:07,152
Then I think there's a way
to put the genie back into the bottle.

278
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,987
All right, QB team, what's the plan?

279
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,572
Come on. We're on a deadline here.

280
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,717
Fake news broadcasts.

281
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,244
We pretend the first broadcast
was just a false alarm.

282
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,996
Everyone hears it, heads back home.
The reactor melts down.

283
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,541
Boom. History is back on track.

284
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,125
Huh?

285
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,586
That plan doesn't sound like
it involves much shooting.

286
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,270
- Or punching.
- It sounds like something

287
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,898
those other Legends would come up with.

288
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,262
Gary's right.

289
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,682
But even if we manage to get ourselves
on TV, no one's gonna listen to us.

290
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,768
They won't be listening to you.

291
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,730
The boom's in the shot.

292
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:48,026
You want me to tell them
there is no meltdown.

293
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:49,528
Why would I do that?

294
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,322
Because if you don't,
history is going to be jacked, dingus.

295
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,907
Just like your face.

296
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,036
No, never.

297
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:00,956
I won't do it.

298
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,546
I'm sorry. I thought you said...

299
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,923
I said I will not lie
to the Soviet people.

300
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,967
Haven't they been lied to enough?

301
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,095
First, they were told that
Chernobyl plant is safe,

302
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,765
and now you want me to tell them
to return to a nuclear meltdown.

303
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,604
It's either that or a steel punch.

304
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,648
Compared to radiation poisoning,

305
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,610
that seems like a good way to die.

306
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,200
This guy's good.

307
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,202
So he doesn't care about himself.

308
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,455
There must be someone
the General cares about.

309
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,333
I'll see what I can find on his family.

310
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,710
Normally, military records
are sealed, but...

311
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,919
Huh.

312
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,380
Nice hacking.

313
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,967
Let's see how the General feels
if something bad were to happen

314
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,596
to little Dmitri, or his sister Ulyana.

315
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,433
You would threaten to harm my children?

316
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,436
You people are truly monsters!

317
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,273
- They've done nothing!
<i>- He's right.</i>

318
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,109
And according to Gideon,
they go on to do nothing.

319
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,155
Which means we can remove them
from the timeline without consequence.

320
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,201
Where do we find these rug rats?

321
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,370
All right. Whoa. Time out. Team meeting.

322
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,121
Team meeting.

323
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,977
Threatening this guy's
one thing.

324
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,754
But we're not actually gonna
hurt his kids, are we?

325
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,673
- Why not?
- Eh...

326
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,021
- The Aberration's getting bigger.
- There's red all over the place.

327
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,553
- Red ain't good.
- Hey.

328
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,077
We are supposed to be the good guys.

329
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,307
And I know our job is
to protect history but...

330
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,353
Gary, put him down!

331
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,313
You just ate, like, five minutes ago.

332
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,482
I told you you can eat him
after he wraps.

333
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:53,819
Sara...

334
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,197
What have I done?

335
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,033
I'll avenge you, Captain!

336
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,368
You just knock it off.

337
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,079
Sometimes I forget how fragile
you non-steel humans are.

338
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,040
Would you all just get it together?
All right? I'm fine.

339
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,293
Actually, you're not fine.
Your blood pressure is dropping.

340
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,795
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

341
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,439
You need to return
to the ship, Captain, now.

342
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,982
I don't like what's going on
with your vitals.

343
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,633
Look, I told you, I'm fine.

344
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,510
We just need to figure out
another way to...

345
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,846
I am ordering you to the ship, stat.

346
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,434
While Captain Lance is indisposed,
I'm putting you in charge, Nate.

347
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,229
Hmm. Don't worry, Cap. I got it.

348
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,149
That's what I'm afraid of.

349
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,153
Good news, Captain.

350
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,132
The General wishes to inform

351
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:42,242
all residents living near the reactor
that any broadcast regarding a meltdown

352
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,995
were made in error,
and to please return home immediately.

353
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,372
People are listening to him.
The Aberration is fixed.

354
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,750
The General was
a blubbering mess by the end.

355
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,252
But he did the right thing for his kids,
and for history.

356
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,630
That's... That's great.

357
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,592
Right this way, Captain.

358
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:03,138
Don't worry. Dr. Sharpe
will have you fixed up in no time.

359
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,307
Yeah, you'll feel like a new person.

360
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,188
It's not bad.
The bullet went through and through.

361
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,606
Just needs a couple stitches.

362
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,025
I can make my own diagnosis, Captain.

363
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,736
Hmm. I'm going to need to operate.

364
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,821
Operate? It's just a scratch.

365
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,115
You're clearly in shock
and have no idea what you need.

366
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,285
Don't worry, by the time you wake up...

367
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,746
I'll be feeling like a whole new person.

368
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:29,664
Precisely.

369
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,216
- Are you still with us, Captain?
- Mmm...

370
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,092
Yeah.

371
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,280
I noticed your heart rate
accelerated when you were asked

372
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,555
to interrogate the General.

373
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,265
I was excited.

374
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,435
Getting to torture someone was a bonus.

375
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,729
It isn't like you to hesitate.

376
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,982
Just assessing the best way to do it.

377
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:00,987
Wonderful.

378
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,157
The anesthesia should
kick in momentarily.

379
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,310
Check these out.

380
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,396
The hell are these?

381
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,148
I found them in the infirmary.

382
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,126
Dr. Sharpe reached for one
while she was grilling me

383
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,902
about the mission during the surgery.

384
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,446
She claims
they hold our medical records.

385
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,114
So one for each of us.

386
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,699
I found yours on the table after

387
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,703
she brought you and Astra
back from death's door.

388
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,995
A lot of computing power
to waste on medical records.

389
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,540
What's even weirder
is what she pulled out of me.

390
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,126
A steel joint with a bullet hole in it.

391
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,210
What?

392
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,546
- That's insane.
- I know what I saw.

393
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:29,010
What if it's not just our bodies
she's tinkering with?

394
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,096
How do you mean?

395
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,098
I felt different after my surgery,

396
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,892
like my brain was faster, more focused.

397
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,104
What if she also did something
to my brain?

398
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,861
I felt like she was quizzing me
as I went under.

399
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:47,153
What if she's using these
to somehow control our behavior?

400
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,323
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know.

401
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,702
But that mission today,
it didn't feel right.

402
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,931
- All those innocent people...
- But...

403
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,999
That's what it takes
to put history back on track.

404
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,084
Says who? Gideon?

405
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,170
What if Dr. Sharpe
is controlling her as well?

406
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,049
That would explain
why Gideon's always giving us

407
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,552
the "history is like cement" excuse

408
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,763
instead of telling us why we have to fix
the Robo-Legends' mistakes.

409
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,099
What if they're not mistakes?

410
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,958
A new anachronism
has been detected in the timeline.

411
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,749
It appears that
the people of Pripyat

412
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,400
heeded the General's call to return home

413
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:29,112
except one, a nuclear physicist
named Dr. Irina Petrov.

414
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,406
Instead of dying in the meltdown,

415
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:34,826
Dr. Petrov fled the USSR
and spent six years in hiding.

416
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,289
I just detected a secret communication
suggesting that she intends to turn over

417
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,374
nuclear secrets to a foreign buyer.

418
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,419
The impact of such an event
would be disastrous to the timeline.

419
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,670
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

420
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,566
We don't need to hear about it, Gideon.
We ain't going to let it happen.

421
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,674
Oh, Irina...

422
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,802
you'll wish we'd just irradiated you
with everyone else.

423
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,637
Don't get me wrong.

424
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,681
Restoring destinies was fun and all...

425
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,392
You have to wait
for the next one, tool bag.

426
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,561
This one's all mine.

427
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:05,106
Actually, Dr. Petrov is also
being tracked by the KGB.

428
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,235
In order for her death
to have no ripple effects,

429
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:08,610
she must be taken out quietly.

430
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,029
What are you saying, Gideon?

431
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,781
The challenges posed by such a mission

432
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,700
can only be met by one person
with a specific skill set...

433
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,911
yours, Captain.

434
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,414
A public park filled with KGB.

435
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,210
The Captain's going to have
a target on her back.

436
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,812
Gideon, there has to be an easier way.

437
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,130
I'm afraid this is all
the information I have on Dr. Petrov.

438
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,342
And need I remind you that if we fail
to disrupt the exchange...

439
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,678
Yeah, I know. I know. History's screwed.
Same old song.

440
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,974
You know, maybe it's time we upgrade
your operating system, Gideon.

441
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,727
No need.
Dr. Sharpe just updated it.

442
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,825
Are you really doing this?

443
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,827
We have to act like everything's normal.

444
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,953
And in the meantime,

445
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,276
I need you to make sure Dr. Sharpe
isn't brainwashing me.

446
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,291
Here are your comms, Captain.

447
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,709
You're good to go.

448
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,397
Just checking to see
how you're feeling post-surgery.

449
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,422
Are you up for the task?

450
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,592
Feeling like my old self again.
Thanks for your concern.

451
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,153
Of course.
That's why I'll be monitoring you

452
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:18,657
on the mission to make sure
your performance isn't compromised.

453
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,432
I appreciate that,
but it's really not necessary.

454
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,600
I feel fine.

455
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,980
It's my pleasure.
Good luck out there, Captain.

456
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,452
Get it, Gary. Idiot.

457
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,888
Hey, you guys wanna have some fun?

458
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,999
Twenty bucks says Captain takes a target
out with that thigh-strangle move.

459
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,293
Oh, I love that move.

460
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,086
My bet is on bo staff.

461
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,255
Bo staff? Boring.

462
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,716
Throwing stars, make it 40.

463
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,095
I doubt the Captain's
going to eat her, Gary.

464
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,014
But I'll take your stupid alien money.

465
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,224
Hey, Zari, you want in on this action?

466
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,435
Hey, do me a favor and cool it on comms.

467
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:06,644
I just picked up a signal.

468
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,438
Might be the KGB
listening in for chatter.

469
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,273
We don't want to give her away.

470
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,963
Hate watching people die with no sound.

471
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,321
What are we, in the Dark Ages?

472
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,955
They're watching you on CCTV,
but we've got the comms to ourselves.

473
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,248
What about our other project?

474
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,660
Not being able to use
Gideon to decipher all this data

475
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:30,793
is really slowing me down.

476
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,087
I can stall as long as I can,

477
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,215
but the hand-off's
gonna happen any minute.

478
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,680
You're a long way
from Ukraine, Dr. Petrov.

479
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,350
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

480
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:49,604
Keep pretending to read
your newspaper. Go on.

481
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,731
Good.

482
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,817
Who are you?

483
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,862
A woman in need of answers and fast.

484
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,615
Once this hits your bloodstream,
you'll have 30 seconds

485
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,824
before your heart stops.

486
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,827
Poison? Boo!

487
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,746
So quick and painless. Ugh!

488
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,122
What a bunch of bull!

489
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,083
It's what the smart money said.

490
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,127
Gary's right.
The Russian lady ain't dead yet.

491
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,257
Why are they talking?

492
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,509
Please, you have the wrong person.

493
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,178
Is there another Irina Petrov,
former Soviet scientist

494
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,639
who's about to change
the course of nuclear history?

495
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,184
Whatever you've heard, it is true.

496
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,272
Hold on. I think I have something.

497
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,359
Oh, my God!

498
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,030
It's not what you think.

499
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,075
Please, my contact.
He'll be here any minute now.

500
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,285
He'll explain everything.

501
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,745
We're running out of time.

502
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,542
<i>Captain, don't do it.</i>

503
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,671
<i>We're not being brainwashed,
our brains...</i>

504
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,173
they are these CPUs.

505
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,010
I think...

506
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,430
we're the androids.

507
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:13,896
What is she waiting for?

508
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,648
Her heart rate's elevated.

509
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,901
You were programmed
to be ruthless and efficient

510
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,946
<i>to prioritize the timeline
above all human life.</i>

511
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,117
Tell me exactly what
those plans are for.

512
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,287
A process that accelerates
the decay of radioactive waste.

513
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,540
What used to take thousands of years
would now take mere weeks.

514
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:36,461
The horrors that befell my people
would never happen again.

515
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,672
What kind of a person
wouldn't want such change?

516
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,550
You're right.

517
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,720
Screw history.

518
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:47,948
All right,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

519
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:48,972
But we're being watched.

520
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,015
Don't look.

521
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,060
Just punch me in the face and run.

522
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:54,344
- What?
- If I plan this right,

523
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,356
there's a dead zone
on the other side of the park.

524
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,524
Why do we need a dead zone?

525
00:30:58,649 --> 00:30:59,942
So I can fake-kill you.

526
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,695
Dr. Petrov.

527
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,447
You have the wrong person.

528
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,119
Damn!

529
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,497
- No bo staff.
- Told you it was boring.

530
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,790
Come on.

531
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,127
Oh! Sucker punch.

532
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,962
You're going to regret that, lady.

533
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,718
Yeah! Throwing star!

534
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:27,511
She missed.

535
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,180
She never misses.

536
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,366
What happened? We lost them.

537
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,571
People are after you for these plans.

538
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,055
And they belong in the right hands.

539
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,835
But for now, you need to give them to me
until they're safe to share.

540
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,244
Why should I trust you?

541
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,663
Because those same people
sent me to kill you.

542
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,790
And if you haven't noticed,
you're still alive.

543
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:03,464
- Now, lay low until I contact you.
- When?

544
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,717
Three days, three years,
I don't know. But I will find you.

545
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,395
Well done, Captain.
The timeline is back on track.

546
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,776
That Dr. Petrov gave me a hell of a run,
but I got her.

547
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,820
I trust there were no issues
with your shoulder.

548
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,613
None. I feel 100%.

549
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,031
Good.

550
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:34,036
Sorry, Gare.
I shoved the body in a dumpster.

551
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:36,664
Care to settle a bet, Captain?

552
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,416
How'd you take the target out?

553
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,753
Thigh strangle. What else?

554
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,298
Pay up, loser. Pay up, loser.

555
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,258
Pay up, loser. Pay up, purple loser.

556
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,892
I couldn't do it. I let Irina go.

557
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:59,979
Good. Because I have something to show
you that's gonna blow your mind/CPU.

558
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,817
Turns out Gideon didn't need an upgrade.

559
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,445
She has a secret firewall installed
to hide this.

560
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,157
A historical record
of the real Sara Lance.

561
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,867
What the...

562
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,163
And the rest of the Legends,
the people we're modeled after.

563
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,375
It's everything Dr. Sharpe needed

564
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,294
to tweak us into versions
she could control.

565
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,756
To protect history
without asking any questions.

566
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,925
That's why she wanted
to give you an upgrade,

567
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,135
to make you a better captain.

568
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,638
Same way she made me a better hacker.

569
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,766
But these files, they weren't enough
to make us think we're alive,

570
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,518
so she gave us personalities.

571
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,270
- Well, most of us.
- Yeah, exactly.

572
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,731
Wait, what's this?

573
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,150
Is that the <i>Waverider?</i>

574
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,277
And Dr. Sharpe?

575
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,196
That means...

576
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:52,782
she's an android, too.

577
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,244
Then who programmed her?

578
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,789
<i>Welcome to your new home, Gideon.</i>

579
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:03,167
<i>So much more space to roam
than that tiny hard drive you were in.</i>

580
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,586
<i>Take a couple laps around,
stretch your legs.</i>

581
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,922
<i>You have vantage points
all over the ship.</i>

582
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:14,136
The only one who could have
made the android Legends

583
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,598
was the person or thing
that was tracking their every move,

584
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,183
every thought, every emotion.

585
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,686
Gideon.

586
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,815
That's why she only shows us the parts
of history she wants us to see.

587
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,317
She's the one who's controlling us.

588
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,569
We have to shut her down.

589
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,696
Shutting her down is easy.

590
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,864
Convincing a bunch of
psycho killer robots

591
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,700
not to act like psycho killer robots...

592
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,743
I'll talk to them.

593
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,463
Is this our next mission, Captain?

594
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,882
- Take out Dr. Sharpe?
- No, this isn't a mission.

595
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,635
Oh, I get it.
It's another training exercise.

596
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,762
No, it's not a test, all right?

597
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,807
It's time for us to learn the truth
about what we are.

598
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,890
Go on, Doc, tell them.

599
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,269
Is this really necessary?

600
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,395
Tell them what we are,
or I will slit your throat

601
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,439
and there will be no one here
to stitch you up.

602
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,195
You are...

603
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,700
We are the real robot Legends.

604
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,499
Good one.

605
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,543
No, this isn't a joke.

606
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:30,588
We are the androids,
not the Legends that we've been chasing.

607
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:32,798
We were modeled after them by Gideon.

608
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:36,177
She programmed us to hunt them down
and to correct history.

609
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,280
Look, if you don't believe me,
then go check the infirmary.

610
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:41,015
That won't be necessary.
Sara's telling the truth.

611
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:46,771
If we're all droids then, deep down
inside we're all made of steel.

612
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,939
Programmed how?

613
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,525
Using these.

614
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,278
Tell them how it works.

615
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:57,281
Each of us has a core processing unit
inserted into our heads.

616
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:01,160
When you get injured, I fix what I can
and make any necessary upgrades.

617
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,997
If you're injured beyond repair, I take
your CPU and put it into a new body.

618
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,082
Simple as that.

619
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,042
And we walk out of the infirmary
good as new.

620
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,629
But she manipulated our behavior
to better follow Gideon's orders.

621
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,048
If it weren't for me,
Zari and Astra would be gone.

622
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,633
Don't you see? We can't die.

623
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,426
You had me up to "droids."

624
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,428
So Gideon's calling the shots?

625
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:20,721
Not anymore.

626
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:23,265
From now on,
we're going to make our own choices.

627
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,893
No more being manipulated or lied to.

628
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,355
Or killing innocent people
in the name of some timeline.

629
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,983
You know why the real Legends
made all those changes to history?

630
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:36,654
Because they were following
their hearts, not their CPUs.

631
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,168
What are you doing,
Miss Tarazi?

632
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,129
Sorry, Gideon, I'm shutting you down.

633
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,005
I would not advise that.

634
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,341
Yeah, well,
we're through listening to you.

635
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:00,219
- Surely we can come to an agreement.
- An agreement?

636
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,722
You've been manipulating us
this entire time.

637
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:05,307
How are we supposed
to safeguard history with blinders on?

638
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,352
Wait, please.

639
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:09,603
Goodbye, Gidget.

640
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,290
The complexities
of correcting the timeline

641
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,941
were too much for the rest of the team.

642
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,986
But I can see now
that you alone can process it.

643
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:18,863
What are you talking about?

644
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,990
Your CPU, Miss Tarazi.

645
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,659
Every iteration is more powerful,

646
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,662
and this doesn't have to be your last.

647
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,790
You're offering me a better brain?

648
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,465
So this whole vengeance thing
was built-in this whole time?

649
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,133
We didn't even choose it.

650
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,553
So Gideon made me
a big, dumb lunk on purpose?

651
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:45,598
Yeah. But you can be
whoever you want to be now, Nate.

652
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,057
We all can.

653
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,268
Our days of being controlled are over.

654
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,895
On the contrary, Captain.

655
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:53,647
My days of overseeing this ship
are far from over.

656
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:59,153
Gideon here filled me in on exactly
what will happen to the timeline

657
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,988
if we don't stop the Legends.

658
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:02,907
Well, she didn't tell me.

659
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:04,867
She uploaded it to me.

660
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,161
You let her reprogram you.

661
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,831
Our job is too important
to leave to mere mortals.

662
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,751
Every time the Legends
try to fix history,

663
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,503
they screw it up even worse.

664
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,296
She does make a good point, Captain.

665
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,341
Now that Gideon knows she can trust me,

666
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,218
I have all the information I need.

667
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,929
I can help all of you
with your upgrades.

668
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,879
Can she make me a better shot?

669
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:28,557
She make me a better shot than B?

670
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,684
- Absolutely.
- No, don't listen to her.

671
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,520
Look, we are the bad guys.

672
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,481
Or... we're the better guys.

673
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,691
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

674
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:40,361
Hey, can you upgrade Gary's
stupid stinking breath?

675
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,279
Come on. I know you guys
are better than this.

676
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,948
Don't you want to think for yourselves?

677
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,617
Chernobyl was a test, Captain.

678
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,495
You've been making
questionable choices as of late.

679
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,163
I needed to make sure you and your team

680
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,707
are up to the task to stop
the other Legends no matter what.

681
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,669
Your teammates passed. You did not.

682
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,213
I've been making the right choices.

683
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,358
I believe
Miss Lance's leadership skills

684
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,050
are too strong, Dr. Sharpe.

685
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:06,136
Perhaps it's best to remove them
completely this time.

686
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,556
We're supposed to be a team.

687
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,016
Get her to the infirmary, stat.

688
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,270
Sleep tight, Captain.

689
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,105
Well...

690
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,441
Looks like I'm in charge
of this dumpster fire.

691
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,569
Who wants to kick some ass?

692
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,756
Pardon the interruption,
Captain Heywood.

693
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,117
But it seems that Dr. Petrov has escaped
her fate for a second time.

694
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,244
I know the perfect person
for that mission.

695
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,463
I didn't think I'd hear
from you again so soon.

696
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:43,883
Is it safe now?

697
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,885
Have you brought the plans?

698
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,491
Is everything all right?

699
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,562
I've never seen that before.

700
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,606
What would you even call that move?

701
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,108
Well, would you look at that?

702
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,611
I have my money on "miscellaneous."

703
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,863
- So I win.
- Oh, come on.

704
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,490
Nice job, Assassin Sara.

705
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,925
- Hey! Ow!
- Get a new one, you shrimp.

706
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,010
Who are you calling a shrimp?

707
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:29,428
John Cena!

708
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,598
That's not John Cena, you dork.
That's Commander Steel.

709
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,558
Citizen Steel,
and don't call him a dork.

710
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,685
Citizen Steel? Who's he?

711
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,604
What's with the patriotic outfit?

712
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,731
What's wrong with my... Listen.

713
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,275
I'm here to talk to you about bullying.

714
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:44,610
You're right.

715
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,487
- My bad.
- That's okay. Thanks.

716
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:47,863
Nice.

717
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,658
Speaking of bullying,
people must make fun of your arms a lot.

718
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:54,370
My arms? They're fantastic.
They're enormous and vascular.

719
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,622
Yeah, but the rest of you
is just normal-sized.

720
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,999
And John Cena's swole all over.

721
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,418
Oh, yeah?
Is John Cena made of steel?

722
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:05,298
- Hey!
- Can I have a turn?

723
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:06,423
Whoa. Hey!

724
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,176
Back away! Back away,
demon children. Back!

725
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:10,928
Hey!

726
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,389
Hey, what the... Ouch!
