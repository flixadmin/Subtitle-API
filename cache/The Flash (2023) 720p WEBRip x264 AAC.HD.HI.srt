If that briefcase
falls into the water,

00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,034
it could wipe out half
of Gotham by lunchtime.

- [Batman] Damn it.
- Please don't drop me.

171
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:46,173
Oh, God, no. Please,
please don't.

172
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,217
No!

[Wonder Woman theme playing]

174
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,051
Sorry I'm late.

175
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:01,884
Watch your step.

176
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,408
- Hi.
- Hey.

177
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,238
Nice suit.

178
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:09,500
Looking good, Flash.

179
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:11,546
Oh, uh... Thank... Uh...

180
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:13,983
And you...

181
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:15,581
are welcome.

182
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,841
My ego's far too big to say
"thank you" to someone else.

183
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:18,867
Hmm.

184
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,792
I developed this...

185
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,503
all-powerful persona to compensate
for my childhood trauma...

186
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:27,138
I, too, have childhood trauma.

[Wonder Woman] never gets old.

190
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:35,851
I'd do a lot better just giving all my money away. Yes,
if I really wanted to end crime, I should end poverty.

191
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,730
I know sex exists.

192
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:39,887
I've just never experienced it.

193
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:42,138
Damn it.

194
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:43,375
Well...

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,924

Yeah.

197
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,839
Always a pleasure.

198
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:52,664
The sex thing was a metaphor...

199
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:54,527
for gothic literature.

200
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,436
There was just no way
to recover from that.

201
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,199
Just let it go.

The road to destruction.

211
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:22,564
This was never about her.

This is about you.

213
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,941
You have to stop
living in the past.

214

enough for you?

[Barry] Shut up, Albert.

219
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,172
Every day. I don't know
how you do it, Barry.

220
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,860
What'd you, like,
crawl here, bro?

221
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:49,589
- Is he mad?
- Well, you're getting fired.

222
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,461
-[Albert] You're getting murdered.
-Oh, no, no, no.

Let me guess.

224
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,670
Your alarm clock didn't go off.

225
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:57,611
- No...
- Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

226
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,647
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

227
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:02,631
Your keys' grandmother died,
and they need a personal day.

228
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:04,982
- It was none of those things.
- What was it this time, Barry?

229
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:06,835
It was, um, something else

230
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,601
that was far less outlandish.

231
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:10,864
And I know I missed
the meeting...

232
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,823
but I'd still really like to present
these case files for potential review.

233
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,284
I think we rushed these cases.

234
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,224
- We need to reopen them.
- Oh! Rushed?

235
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,326
We got a backlog six months deep,
and you want us to move slower?

236
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,425
You need to focus your motion.

237
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,931
Do the work, close
the case, move on.

[sighs]

239

You have a lot of
potential, Barry.

240
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,968
You shouldn't still be getting
me coffee after all these years.

241
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:33,691
You're right.
That's... That's true.

242
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:34,769
Go get me a coffee.

I'm very satisfied with the
ruling in the Johnson case.

248
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:00,246
The evidence our lab analyzed...

249
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:03,714
was more than sufficient
to be conclusive.

250
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:06,437
- I'm still working that evidence.
- Because of the diligence

251
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:08,551
and hard work and focus...

252
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:11,100
Barry was still working
on that evidence. [laughs]

253
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,706
Think if it were up to you

254
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:14,965
that we'd still be scraping
Ted Bundy's molars.

255
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,360
You know what? I'm so happy
you find this all so hilarious,

256
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:22,105
but we are dealing with real
people's lives, people's families.

257
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,306
And I don't think you can
grasp the gravity of that.

258
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,029
So, why don't you
leave me alone?

259

- [woman] Barry Allen?
- Iris West.

260

You...

261
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:32,356
know my full name also.

262
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:34,152
Yes, from school.

263
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,329
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us
you had a friend from school.

264
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,202
- We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend.
- Wow.

265
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,025
[Albert] Yeah, what
does that make it now?

266
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:41,093
- One?
- One.

Um, bye, you guys.

269
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,109
Okay. Oh, my God.
That was just...

270
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,706
Um...

271
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:50,994
They're not really my friends.
They're my work friends.

272
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,288
Do you work here?

273
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,815
Yes, I do.

274
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,667
God, it's been a long time, huh?

275
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:57,476
Hmm.

276
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,895
I feel like we saw each other...

277
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,907
like a few years ago, right?

278
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,430
No, because...

279
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:05,824
we haven't seen
each other since...

280

281
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,174
Ah.

282
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:11,612
Maybe I was just
thinking about you.

283
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,832
Well, I'm really
glad I ran into you.

284
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,398
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

285
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,618
Your father's appeal
is tomorrow, right?

286
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,273
Yeah. How...

287
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:21,927
Sorry, how do you
know about that?

288
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,929
I'm covering it for the paper.

289
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:24,886
Oh.

00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,540
How is he holding up?

00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:28,753
Um...

292
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,477
Are you asking for the paper?

293
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,869
- No, I'm asking as a friend.
- Oh.

294
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:35,723
Although I'm sure the public
would want to know as well.

295
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,582
Well...

296
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:42,487
my only official comment
is that my dad is innocent.

297
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:43,470
Right.

298
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:45,300
I mean, no one...

299
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:47,974
would want to believe that their
father killed their mother.

300
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:51,154
What do you mean, "believe"?
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

301
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,660
My mom should be alive. It's
not about what I believe.

302
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:56,850
- It's about what the truth is.
- Right. No, yes, that's...

303
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,354
Oh, my God. That's
what I meant.

304
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,300
Right.

305
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,910
Sorry, I have no official
comment at this time.

00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:33,300
- Do you wish to accept?
- Yes.

00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,167
- Hey, Dad.
- [Henry Allen] Hey, Barry.

- How ya doing?
- I'm fine.

- You getting out much?
- Yeah.

Well, no. Uh, no.

315
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:45,072
But I, um, I ran into
an old college friend...

316
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,881
Iris West, today.

317
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,951
Didn't you have a
monster crush on her?

318
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:50,542
Well, she have a boyfriend?

319
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,223
- Why don't you ask her out?
- Dad, I, um...

320
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:58,252
I had a friend run the old security
camera footage from the store...

321
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:00,845
through this new
program he's developed.

322
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,264
And it's crystal clear now.

323
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:04,420
It's just...

324
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:07,855
you never look up, Dad.

325
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,886
You can't see your face.

So, without new evidence
to support your alibi...

327
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,964
we're just gonna need to start
thinking about the next appeal.

328
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,105
No, uh-uh. You need to stop
worrying about your old man.

329
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,583
Do that, you might actually
have time for a girlfriend.

330
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,800
But Dad, I don't want...

331
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,218
We've done this before.

332
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:29,722
This was a last-ditch effort...

333
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:32,489
and we'll go through
the motions tomorrow.

334
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,675
I'm okay, really.

335
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,300
You know, sometimes I even think it's
probably easier for me to be in here

336
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:39,586
than out there...

337
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,261
without her.

338

00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:58,393
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

344
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:01,943
Hey, remember that sauce
she'd make on Sundays?

345
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,841
The whole house would
smell like basil, tomatoes.

346
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:08,503
And she'd put on my
sweats and start singing.

I loved that song.

How many calculations can you
think of with an answer of 24?

355
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,405
There are a bajillion answers.

How am I supposed
to fit them all?

357
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:36,531
You are right. There are a
bajillion answers to this question.

358

00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:56,451
And, um, I probably could've
been less sensitive.

491
00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:59,285
I mean, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

492
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:02,322
It's like you lost both
parents in one day.

493
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:04,219
I did.

494
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:05,949
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

495
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:09,020
and I lost my dad to the
failures of the justice system.

496
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:12,190
Is that why you got
into criminal forensics?

497
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:13,730
To try and fix the system?

498
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:18,292
Yeah.

499
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:19,839
Yeah, to fix it.

500
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,346
There's gotta be a
way to fix it, right?

501
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:26,069
I mean, that's kinda why I
got into journalism, too.

502
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:28,277
I could make it right if I
could just go back somehow

503
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:31,461
and warn them without them
knowing that I'd warned them.

504
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:33,749
I... thinking like that's
gonna... [chuckle softly]

505
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,471
drive you crazy.

506
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,247
"If I could just
go back in time...

507
00:29:37,272 --> 00:29:38,488
and stop the guy
who did it." It's...

508
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:40,929
No, I can't do that, 'cause
that's way too much interaction.

509
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:41,880
[chuckles]

510
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,195
My dad wasn't even at home.

511
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,657
My mom sent him to go
get a can of tomatoes.

512
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,015
I think whoever broke into the
house thought it was empty.

513
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:52,218
And then my mom was in there
with the knife in her hand

514
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:54,733
and things went bad,
just this absurd

515
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,042
chain of events.

516
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:59,441
And it's like, this footage should've
finally supported my dad's alibi.

517
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,800
But instead...

518
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:03,839
three lives ruined
for a can of tomatoes.

519
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:11,407
Oh, my God.

520
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:12,883
What?

521
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,996
Well, that could be it.

522
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,738
If my mom doesn't forget the
tomatoes in the first place,

523
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:20,026
then he never leaves
and she never dies.

524
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:22,862
No one would even
have to see me.

525
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,473
Bruce said no interaction.
This is no interaction.

526
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:25,894
This is just quick
in, quick out,

527
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,561
back to the present, like
I was never even there.

528
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,370
That's how I fix it.
Oh, my God, Iris.

529
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:30,933
- Hmm?
- Thank you, so much.

530
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,307
- This has been great.
- Oh.

531
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:34,186
Um... I'm sorry.

532
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,855
I... I have to leave.

533
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,095
Okay. Right.

534
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:40,496
- Uh...
- [door closes]

535

the way. We should do this again.

Don't forget the tomatoes.

See you soon.

Barry? And he's early?

You've cut your hair.

Now you can see your eyes.

- You look terrible.
- Henry!

- You look old.
- You look beautiful, baby.

to you over there?

Come here.

"Old," seriously?

Well, no, I mean like mature.

587
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:10,134
He's at that age, he
wants to look old.

588
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:12,527
He, you know, gets
into bars that way.

589
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:14,285
How can I help?

590
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:22,571
Mm. Hey, Mom,
how was your day?

591
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:24,617
How was your month,
or your last 18 years?

592
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,053
Or that's a weird question...

593
00:35:26,097 --> 00:35:27,620
'cause I was here.

594
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:30,362
But obviously, we share
those memories together.

595
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,209
Or I don't know, maybe we
could make some new memories.

596
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:34,073
Like we could go to the
aquarium, or the circus,

597
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:35,976
or to the park and you
could push me on a swing.

598
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,935
That's also weird
because I'm an adult now,

599
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,111
so I'd probably motivate
my own motion on a swing.

600
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:42,097
So, how was it this
week? How's school?

601
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:46,856
At school was... is good.

602
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,467
- Mm.
- School's been great.

603
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,252
I've just been working
really hard there on my...

604
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:52,480
studies.

605
00:35:52,505 --> 00:35:54,134
Did you ask out
that girl from econ?

606
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:56,823
I know freshman year is about

607
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:59,404
going out, meeting people, okay?

608
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:00,517
Exploring things.

609
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:02,754

Oh, shit.

00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:11,207
I... have to shit.

00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:23,436
Shh! Why are you here?

619
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,385
What year is it?

620
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:27,680
- No, no, no.
- Help!

621
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:35,035
That's my face.

622
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:37,027
You stole my face.

mushroom flashback?

Eighteen.

00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:53,834
Whoa.

627
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:56,274
This is mad trippy.

628
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:57,840
So, we're, like, in the future.

629
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,365
No, wait. This is
not trippy, dude.

630
00:37:00,408 --> 00:37:04,543
This is catastrophic. And no, we're not in the
future. I was supposed to be back in the present,

631
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:05,707
but I'm still in the past.

632
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:07,746
And there's not supposed
to be two of me.

633
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:09,997
You and I are not supposed to be
occupying the same reality at all,

634
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:11,715
let alone interacting.

635
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,136
I just can't believe I'm a
superhero who time travels...

636
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:17,183
No, no, no. You
are not anything.

637
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,038
Which is good. You don't want
to be a superhero. It's scary.

638
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:23,502
And I get bug splatter
in my teeth all the time.

Awesome.

640
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:27,087
Hey, do the thing again.

641
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:28,324
No, we don't have time.

642
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:32,353
- Mom!
- Shh!

643
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:34,117
What are you doing?
You're gonna tattle now?

- Fine.

- Yeah. Yeah.
- Happy?

647
00:37:43,756 --> 00:37:44,757
Now undo it.

00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:06,886
[Nora] Barry, are
you okay up there?

652
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,514
[both] We're fine! I'm fine!

653
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,150
[Nora] Okay, Monkey.

654
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:12,830
So, do you have like a
plane that goes underwater?

655
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:15,467
Or like a boat that can fly?

656
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,667
How old are you, like 40?

657
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:18,737
Okay, you don't stop talking.

658
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,852
It's not charming. It's
abrasive and exhausting.

659
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:24,793
And, oh, my God. I am starting
to realize what people mean.

660
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,199
Just...

661
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:27,668
do me a favor

662
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:31,301
and promise me that meeting me
isn't gonna screw up space-time.

663
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,892
Broski...

664
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:34,730
I got you.

665
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:36,105
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

666
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,299
What do you mean?

667
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:39,638
What do I do?

668
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,340
I could drug you.

669
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:43,671
Yeah, I could drug you,

670
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,109
and then you'd pass
out, you'd wake up

671
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,621
and you'd forget that
anything ever happened.

672
00:38:46,646 --> 00:38:48,268
And it wouldn't be wrong,
right? Because you're me.

673
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:49,988
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

674
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:52,365
- Please don't... drug me.
- No.

675
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,194
No. Because here's the thing,
and I thought about it before.

676
00:38:54,218 --> 00:38:55,741
I don't want to be drugged.

677
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:58,831
But I'm sure we can
think of another way.

678
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:00,311
Let's put on our
Barry thinking caps

679
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:02,313
and think of a
different solution

680
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,792
for memory loss.

681
00:39:03,836 --> 00:39:05,751
Also, I'm a green belt...

682
00:39:05,794 --> 00:39:07,231
in the capoeira,

683
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:09,320
and I have extensively
studied wrestler,

684
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,061
and I could just go
frickin' lunatic on you.

685
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:13,300
Besides, I have
a date tonight...

686
00:39:13,324 --> 00:39:14,325
[speech stops]

687
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:18,329
Okay.

688
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:20,437
How hard do you have to hit
someone to make them forget stuff?

689
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,160
If I hit you in the past,
will it hurt me in the future?

690
00:39:23,203 --> 00:39:24,987
Wait. You say you
have a date tonight?

691
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,685
Yeah. Wait, what
were you doing?

692
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:28,643
Uh, nothing. Who's
your date with?

693
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:31,690
This super babe
in my econ class.

694
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,928
- Iris West?
- Oh, my God!

695
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:35,259
Do we marry her?

696
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,981
You're going on a
date with her tonight?

697
00:39:37,006 --> 00:39:38,604
That's why I need
Mom to do my laundry.

698
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,501
You don't even do
your own laundry?

699
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:41,439
Do you?

700
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,676
Okay.

701
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,791
- I'm actually gonna go.
- What do you mean?

702
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,619
Enjoy your life. Do you.

703
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:49,795
Change literally nothing.

704
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,165
- Um, I'll see you again never.
- I have a few more questions, though.

705
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,103
We have so much to
learn from each other.

706
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:55,409
[thunder rumbles]

707
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:56,497
Oh, great.

708
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:57,977
Well, you're leaving me.

709
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,935
And now the storm's
gonna ruin my date.

710
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:02,111
What day is it today?

711
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:05,854
Uh... Uh...

712
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:07,900
Sunday?

713
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:08,901
No, the date.

714
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,637
It's September 29th.

715
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:14,428
Shit.

716
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,171
This storm, this is the day.

717
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,608
- What day?
- The day I got my powers.

718
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,828
The day you get your powers.

719
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,570
- Powers?
- Listen...

720
00:40:25,613 --> 00:40:27,373
I can't tell you why I
traveled back in time,

721
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:30,009
and I can't tell
you what I changed.

722
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,620
But, essentially, in
my version of reality,

723
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,753
I ended up interning at
the Central City Crime Lab

724
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:37,451
in my freshman year, and
that's where it happened.

725
00:40:37,495 --> 00:40:38,980
Well, happens.

726
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:42,021
Tonight, September 29, the
accident that gives me my powers.

727
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,675
And if you're not there...

728
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:45,677
in 30 minutes...

729
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:48,810
then you won't get the powers.

730
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,639
Which means I don't
get the powers, maybe?

731
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,686
And then, that would
mean that I lose my way

732
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:56,688
of getting back in time
in the first place,

733
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:58,777
and then I literally have
no idea what happens.

734
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,779
Powers?

735
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,563
[thunder crashes]

736
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,609
[laughs gleefully]

737
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:06,306
Wait, but what about
our date tonight?

738
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,178
She might be our future wife.

739
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:12,051
There might not be a future...

740
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,879
if you don't come with me...

741
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,010
right now.

742
00:41:15,054 --> 00:41:16,664
[thunder cracks]

743
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,320
Eight minutes.

744
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:25,280
How are we gonna to get
inside? What are you doing?

745
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:26,631
Would you stop whining?

746
00:41:26,674 --> 00:41:29,155
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

[shushing]

751
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:57,550
[softly] Yes, it's okay.
It's called phasing.

752
00:41:57,575 --> 00:41:58,663
Come on.

753
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,797
I love phasing.

761
00:42:33,828 --> 00:42:35,917
Well... this is it.

762
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:38,006
This is where I was sitting.

763
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,313
And actually, let me
take this for you.

764
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,662
Thank you.

765
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:44,121
Okay, I had just
opened those windows...

766
00:42:45,753 --> 00:42:47,668
to clear out the fumes.

767
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:49,931
Right around now.

768
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:51,890
And I was sitting in that chair,

769
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:53,733
and I was right under
this shelf of chemicals.

770
00:42:53,761 --> 00:42:55,763
And that's when
the lightning hits.

771
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,069
Wait.

772
00:42:57,112 --> 00:42:58,612
- I get hit by lightning?
- No, no, no.

773
00:42:58,636 --> 00:43:00,159
You don't get hit by lightning.

774
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,528
Okay, 'cause for a second
I thought you said...

775
00:43:01,552 --> 00:43:02,912
The lightning hits
the chemicals...

776
00:43:02,944 --> 00:43:04,555
which then you get bathed in,

777
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:06,513
- and that's what electrocutes you.
- Okay,

778
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:08,361
- but I don't want to be electrocuted, though.
- Sit down.

779
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,517
- No, you sit down.
- I already have the powers!

780
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,667
You already have the powers!

781
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:12,621
Exactly!

782
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:14,941
I am not getting
struck by lightning!

00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,590
[Barry] Why is your
place so much nicer

816
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,655
- than I expected it to be?
- [past Barry] You like it?

817
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:54,681
Mom had to help decorate.

818
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:55,900
You know Mom.

819
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:58,424
Right, yeah. Classic Mom.

820
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,496
Classic Mom.

821
00:46:00,034 --> 00:46:01,035
[grunts]

822
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:03,342
Hmm.

823
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:08,565
- What a day.
- Barry,

824
00:46:08,608 --> 00:46:09,957
the accident gave you powers,

825
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,611
but took mine away.

826
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:13,744
So, I don't know how I get back.

827
00:46:13,787 --> 00:46:15,180
Without access to
the Speed Force,

828
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:17,835
I don't know how I ever leave.

829
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:20,011
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

830
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:22,143
- I might be stuck.
- Wait.

831
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:24,832
I have powers now?

832
00:46:25,669 --> 00:46:26,931
Yeah, but...

833
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:28,527
- you... No, no, no.
- [gasps]

Holy speedballs.

837
00:46:44,122 --> 00:46:46,341
Okay, I know this is
incredibly exciting,

838
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:47,647
because I went through it.

839
00:46:47,691 --> 00:46:48,953
Speedy Gonzales!

840
00:46:48,996 --> 00:46:51,129
Yes, I've done it
many times myself.

841
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:53,087
- You can't just start...
- [laughs, yells]

842
00:46:54,132 --> 00:46:55,655
Shit.

843

[muffled clattering]

866
00:48:36,887 --> 00:48:38,192
What did you do?

867
00:48:38,236 --> 00:48:40,107
Nothing. Why?

868
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:47,269
Barry...

869
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:49,626
I could've told you about
the clothes. It's friction.

870
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:51,803
You run too fast, and regular
fabrics are gonna burn up.

871
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:54,916
It's the same reason why you can't
move people very far at hyperspeed.

872
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,751
That broccoli looks rotten.

873
00:48:56,776 --> 00:48:58,256
Look, some things you can move.

874
00:48:58,299 --> 00:48:59,910
Like, you can move,

875
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:02,452
for instance, a microwave.

876
00:49:02,477 --> 00:49:04,741
But you can't move
something like, say...

877
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,037
- a baby.
- Barry,

878
00:49:06,062 --> 00:49:07,849
it's like I've never
eaten anything before.

879
00:49:07,874 --> 00:49:11,573
Everything has this vivid
flavor. Try a little.

880
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:13,445
Just take a little bite.

881
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:14,524
That's bad, isn't it?

882
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:16,462
[laughs] Yeah, this is not
good. No, I was kidding.

883
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:18,425
- [gags]
- I'm amazing. We're amazing.

884
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,712
I'm so hungry.

885
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,194
Hey, wait.

886
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:25,283
I wanna try that phasing
thing. How do I do that?

887
00:49:25,326 --> 00:49:27,372
You don't. Not yet.

888
00:49:27,415 --> 00:49:29,181
Okay? It's very complicated.

889
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:31,772
Takes a long time to train your
body to be able to speed up

890
00:49:31,797 --> 00:49:33,775
whilst your molecules slow
down enough to pass through

891
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,758
the molecular structure
of solid objects...

892
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:37,817
[muffled thud]

897
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:44,955
[door opens]

898
00:49:46,957 --> 00:49:49,394
You've gotta start letting
me finish my sentences.

899
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:52,397
Are we always this sleepy?

900
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,834
And hungry and naked?

901
00:49:54,878 --> 00:49:56,673
Well, the first two, yes.

902
00:49:56,698 --> 00:49:59,230
The third one, no. I've
figured that part out.

903
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:00,927
And honestly, if
we're gonna do this

904
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:02,929
there's a lot I'm gonna
have to explain to you.

905
00:50:02,973 --> 00:50:05,410
So, a good place
to start, I guess,

906
00:50:05,453 --> 00:50:08,195
is that, yeah, the original suit

907
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,399
- was actually made out of this polysynth...
- [snoring]

908
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:12,721
Or we'll

909
00:50:12,765 --> 00:50:14,636
pick this up tomorrow.

910
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,310
[past Barry] So, the
suit is inside the ring?

911
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:18,379
- Yeah.
- What?

912
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:20,673
And I can have this?

913
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:22,862
No, you can't have
it. You can borrow it

914
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:24,690
so you don't kill yourself
using your powers.

915
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:26,039
[whispering gibberish]

916
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,048
You're gonna push this button

917
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:29,802
and the silk molecules are gonna
uncoil, absorbing atmospheric gases

918
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,566
and expanding the
suit to full size.

919
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,785
Ready?

920
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:35,701
[clinks]

921
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:40,184
[dramatic music playing]

922
00:50:48,496 --> 00:50:50,672
[laughing]

923
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:52,345
It was so tiny...

924
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,435
You're supposed to put it
on before it hits the floor.

925
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:56,504
What, like change...

926
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:58,158
right here in front of you?

927
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:00,006
There's no one even here
anyway, Barry. Come on...

928
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:03,251
- [exclaims] Whoo, man.
- Tight.

929
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:05,470
It hurts.

930
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:06,993
You know where it hurts?

931
00:51:07,037 --> 00:51:09,343
- In my dick.
- Okay. I know, I know,

932
00:51:09,387 --> 00:51:11,041
but I don't need to know.

933
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:13,173
- Sorry, can we move on?
- Mm-hmm.

934
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:14,871
Here's what I'm thinking.

935
00:51:14,914 --> 00:51:16,873
If I can train you
to move like I do,

936
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,285
then we can re-create
the Chronobowl.

937
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:19,310
Chronobowl?

938
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:20,311
In the Speed Force.

939
00:51:20,354 --> 00:51:21,688
Speed Force?

940
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:25,770
-And then maybe we can find some way to get me back to the future.
-Back to the Future. Yes!

941
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,231
Eric Stoltz

942
00:51:27,274 --> 00:51:29,642
is chur boy in that movie.

943
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:31,732
What an embodied performance.

944
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:33,585
You mean Michael J. Fox?

945
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:34,938
Back to the Future?

946
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:38,003
-Yeah, in the movie Back to the Future?
-[woman] Oh, my God! [people clamoring]

947
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,431
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

948
00:51:49,644 --> 00:51:50,964
You need to take
the suit off now.

949
00:51:50,994 --> 00:51:52,514
- Thank God.
- [distant sirens wailing]

950
00:51:58,044 --> 00:51:59,979
[man on TV] ...reported
seeing a mysterious object

951
00:52:00,003 --> 00:52:02,570
hovering above the
Australian seaboard.

952
00:52:02,614 --> 00:52:04,790
- We've obtained footage from the sighting...
- Zod.

953
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,942
- and as you can see, the object...
- [past Barry] "Zod"?

954
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:10,056
- appears to be a flying ship of some sort.
- What's a zod?

955
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,363
[on TV] According to US
government officials,

956
00:52:12,406 --> 00:52:13,485
satellite data

957
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,013
has confirmed the
presence of a spacecraft.

958
00:52:16,038 --> 00:52:17,910
- We'll be sure...
- [past Barry yelps]

959
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,153
[static]

960
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:23,069
My name is General Zod.

961
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,551
I come from a world

962
00:52:26,594 --> 00:52:28,422
far from yours.

963
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:30,990
For some time, your world

964
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:34,733
- has sheltered one of my citizens.
- No, no, no.

965
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,182
- This can't be happening.
- I request that you return this individual...

966
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:38,991
- [Barry] Not now.
- To my custody.

967
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:41,235
What's happening?

968
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,739
For reasons unknown...

969
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:44,438
Zod's looking for Superman.

970
00:52:44,482 --> 00:52:45,918
What's a superman?

971
00:52:46,662 --> 00:52:47,916
[police siren chirps]

972
00:52:47,941 --> 00:52:50,029
[Barry] Superman is an
alien who lives on Earth.

973
00:52:50,053 --> 00:52:52,055
I'm assuming still incognito.

974
00:52:52,098 --> 00:52:55,145
But, yeah, he's an alien,
and he's very powerful,

975
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,929
and he's just the best.

976
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,193
And then Zod is an alien
from the same planet,

977
00:53:00,237 --> 00:53:01,635
also very powerful,

978
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,153
but he's just the worst.

979
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:06,025
And Zod came here to find Clark.

980
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:08,985
- Wait, who's Clark?
- Clark is Superman.

981
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:11,074
- Oh. Okay.
- But then

982
00:53:11,117 --> 00:53:14,512
Zod also tried to terraform the
planet with this World Engine thing,

983
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,122
and Superman stopped
him eventually,

984
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:19,169
but not before Zod killed
thousands of people.

985
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:20,408
- Yeesh.
- And at the time,

986
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:23,276
there was nothing
I could do, I've...

987
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,352
Wait, you...

988
00:53:28,395 --> 00:53:29,752
You were there?

989
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,183
Yeah, I had just
gotten my powers.

990
00:53:33,226 --> 00:53:35,794
[people screaming]

991
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,188
And I was still putting some
finishing touches on my suit.

992
00:53:39,189 --> 00:53:40,842
[people screaming]

993
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:43,721
This thing, Zod's World Engine,

994
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:46,544
it started destroying
Metropolis, so I just went there

995
00:53:46,587 --> 00:53:49,199
and I started trying
to save people.

996
00:53:50,156 --> 00:53:51,027
[boy] Daddy?

997
00:53:52,506 --> 00:53:53,551
[man] Listen to me!

998
00:53:53,594 --> 00:53:55,205
Run away!

999
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:56,119
Run away!

1000
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,692
[Barry] There was
this kid, and I...

1001
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:06,557
I got him, but then...

1002
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:08,305
I couldn't get his dad.

1003
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:11,047
Daddy!

1004
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,918
[solemn music playing]

1005
00:54:25,322 --> 00:54:26,932
[metal groaning]

1006
00:54:28,151 --> 00:54:29,239
It was all I could do,

1007
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:30,501
save that one kid.

1008
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,374
Only Superman could stop Zod.

1009
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:38,422
But not in time to
save those people.

1010
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:40,119
And now it's about
to happen again.

1011
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:42,121
But...

1012
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:44,384
if I can find the
entire Justice League,

1013
00:54:44,428 --> 00:54:46,517
Superman and the
rest of the band...

1014
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,877
Right.

1015
00:54:47,902 --> 00:54:49,757
Then maybe I can
prevent the whole thing

1016
00:54:49,781 --> 00:54:51,522
from ever even happening at all.

1017
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:57,136
- Um, give me your laptop.
- Okay.

1018
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,442
What is that smell?

1019
00:54:58,485 --> 00:55:00,244
Ugh. Could be anything.

1020
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,213
Honestly.

1021
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:04,502
Who's that?

1022
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:06,965
Oh. That's Gary. That's
the smell. It's...

1023
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,072
- [snoring]
- Don't worry. He's breezy.

1024
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:12,143
[Barry] We can do this.

1025
00:55:12,168 --> 00:55:14,924
Uh, let's see, Victor Stone,
Gotham City University.

1026
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:16,559
[woman screams, muttering]

1027
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:19,661
Oh, this is my roommate, Patty.

1028
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:20,622
Patty...

1029
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:21,953
is your roommate?

1030
00:55:21,978 --> 00:55:24,590
And that's her
boyfriend, Albert.

1031
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:26,078
What's up?

1032
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:27,906
[in sing-song] Good morning.

1033
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,879
Oh, sorry. And, uh, guys...

1034
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:34,027
This is my cousin.

1035
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:35,696
Barry.

1036
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:38,873
[past Patty] Whoa.

1037
00:55:41,697 --> 00:55:42,524
I'm starving.

1038
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:47,730
Okay.

1039
00:55:47,755 --> 00:55:49,381
Victor Stone, Gotham
City University.

1040
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:51,234
Yes. Here he is.

1041
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:53,348
Victor Stone, star
quarterback for the Knight...

1042
00:55:53,373 --> 00:55:54,722
Shit, okay.

1043
00:55:54,802 --> 00:55:56,195
He's not Cyborg yet.

1044
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:58,719
Wonder Woman.

1045
00:55:58,763 --> 00:56:00,068
Wonder Woman!

1046
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:02,636
Las Vegas residency.

1047
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,204
Illusions, juggling, and zebras.

1048
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:07,641
No. That is not Diana.

1049
00:56:07,685 --> 00:56:09,556
- Aquaman.
- Aquaman?

1050
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,210
Is that like a super mermaid?

1051
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:12,559
[Barry] No, Albert,

1052
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,170
he's not a super mermaid.

1053
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:16,433
Okay? He's half
Atlantean, half human

1054
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:19,349
with superhuman strength who can
control marine life with his mind.

1055
00:56:19,392 --> 00:56:20,587
So, like a super
mermaid? [plays keyboard]

1056
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:21,761
No, Albert!

1057
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:23,701
[laughs] That is
what you described.

1058
00:56:23,744 --> 00:56:25,572
[Barry] We'll just
try Arthur Curry...

1059
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:26,921
Maine...

1060
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:29,750
lighthouse.

1061
00:56:29,794 --> 00:56:31,234
[whimsical music
playing on keyboard]

1062
00:56:31,274 --> 00:56:33,450
Here we are. Thomas
Curry. That's his dad.

1063
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:34,386
Uh, phone.

1064
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,410
- [phone rings]
- Hello.

1065
00:56:37,454 --> 00:56:39,456
- [Barry] Hello, Thomas Curry?
- Yes.

1066
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:41,066
Could I speak to Arthur?

1067
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,459
Is Arthur around?

1068
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:44,504
You wanna speak to my dog?

1069
00:56:44,548 --> 00:56:47,768
What? No, no. Um, sorry. Uh...

1070
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:49,857
- Is this Thomas Curry?
- Yes.

1071
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:52,643
- And you work at a lighthouse?
- Yes.

1072
00:56:52,686 --> 00:56:54,862
Okay, and your wife is
the queen of Atlantis?

1073
00:56:54,906 --> 00:56:57,187
-[man on TV] Will you accept this rose?
-[woman on TV] Yes.

1074
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,737
Uh, no.

1075
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,521
Uh, right, but maybe, maybe...

1076
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:04,089
um, a fishlike woman

1077
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,379
washed into your life

1078
00:57:06,483 --> 00:57:08,572
- at some point or another?
- Very funny, asshole.

1079
00:57:08,615 --> 00:57:10,051
[line disconnects]

1080
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:13,794
Arthur Curry was never born.

1081
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:15,622
- What?
- This is a disaster.

1082
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,320
I-I-I completely
destroyed history.

1083
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:18,886
Like Eric Stoltz.

1084
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,473
Okay, why do you keep
saying, "Eric Stoltz"?

1085
00:57:20,497 --> 00:57:21,933
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

1086
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:23,326
- What?
- Time travel?

1087
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:25,676
Oh. We talking "BTTF"?

1088
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:26,851
Come on, who is this guy?

1089
00:57:26,894 --> 00:57:28,331
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

1090
00:57:28,374 --> 00:57:30,158
I've seen all of them

1091
00:57:30,202 --> 00:57:32,726
and Eric Stoltz is
not Marty McFly.

1092
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,597
[Gary] Really?

1093
00:57:35,512 --> 00:57:37,296
Then explain Marty McThigh here.

1094
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,819
I can't explain
that to you, Gary.

1095
00:57:38,863 --> 00:57:40,604
That's not your thigh.

1096
00:57:40,647 --> 00:57:43,160
It's the wrong actor,
and it's upside down.

1097
00:57:44,477 --> 00:57:46,044
[Gary] Is it?

1098
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,927
[whimsical music continues
playing on keyboard]

1099
00:57:48,525 --> 00:57:50,048
The point is that

1100
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,702
in Back to the Future

1101
00:57:51,745 --> 00:57:55,183
Marty McFly is very famously
played by Michael J. Fox.

1102
00:57:55,227 --> 00:57:56,489
The guy from Footloose?

1103
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:58,230
No, that's Kevin Bacon!

1104
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,058
-Bacon.
-[past Barry] Kevin Bacon's Maverick

1105
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,731
with the volleyball, the
gay guys, and the planes?

1106
00:58:01,755 --> 00:58:03,670
-Top Gun.

1107
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:05,672
- Top Gun, right?
- [Barry] No, no, no.

1108
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:07,761
I completely broke the universe.

1109
00:58:07,805 --> 00:58:10,111
[whimsical music continues
playing on keyboard]

1110
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:11,983
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

1111
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:14,072
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1112
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:17,554
I created a world
with no metahumans.

1113
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:19,904
And now there's no one to
defend us from Zod. Albert!

1114
00:58:19,947 --> 00:58:21,297
[stops playing keyboard]

1115
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:23,995
There's no Cyborg.

1116
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:25,910
There's no Aquaman.
There's no Wonder Woman.

1117
00:58:25,953 --> 00:58:27,781
There's no Superman.

1118
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:29,043
There's no Batman.

1119
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:30,175
[past Patty] I'm Batman.

1120
00:58:30,218 --> 00:58:32,351
[dramatic musical sting]

1121
00:58:32,395 --> 00:58:35,267
What, you... What
did you just say?

1122
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,356
I'm [burping] Batman.

1123
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,792
[all laughing]

1124
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,012
Batman exists?

1125
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:42,250
- Hundo p.
- [Gary] Yeah, dude.

1126
00:58:42,274 --> 00:58:44,015
Nobody knows who he really is,

1127
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:46,583
- but he exists.
- [Barry] Right.

1128
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:48,280
Well, uh, we...

1129
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,977
my cousin Barry and I,

1130
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:52,676
have to go to that
cousin's dinner.

1131
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:54,417
Now.

1132
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,375
But it was a pleasure to meet

1133
00:58:56,419 --> 00:58:58,246
- you all.
- [Albert resumes playing keyboard]

1134
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,727
- And Gary.
- [Gary] Barry.

1135
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,076
- Barry.
- Gary.

1136
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,121
Barry!

1137

It's open.

["25 Or 6 To 4" by Chicago

01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:02,267
Hello?

1147
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:04,965
Bruce?

1148
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:07,957
Bruce, are you there?

01:00:09,622 --> 01:00:11,145
Oh, boy.

[Barry] Hey, I didn't
know you painted.

They're good.

[song fades]

1156
01:00:44,483 --> 01:00:46,026
[past Barry] Hey, check
this out. There's, like,

1157
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,878
bells connected to every
room in this house.

1158

Hey, maybe we can
find this Bruce guy...

1159
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:51,882
if we just ring all
these bells, right?

1160
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:54,783
[Barry] You don't understand how servant
bells work? Those are all the bells.

1161
01:00:54,808 --> 01:00:57,245
- You ring them from all the other places.
- What?

They're like, it's like
cheaper Bananabee's.

Oh, you know what I'd
really go for right now?

I'm the guy who lives here.

We're looking for Bruce Wayne.

You hungry?

1187
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,348
Following the broadcast
earlier from General Zod.

1188
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,741
The individual
they're searching for

1189
01:02:32,765 --> 01:02:35,115
- is still at large.
- So...

1190
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,006
The president has yet to respond
to the broadcast from earlier,

1191
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,902
and other foreign
leaders are said to be...

1192
01:02:38,945 --> 01:02:40,773
you're the same person as him...

1193
01:02:40,817 --> 01:02:43,559
- but from an alternate timeline.
- Yes.

1194
01:02:43,602 --> 01:02:44,560
In which...

1195
01:02:46,213 --> 01:02:47,606
you and I are friends?

1196
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,696
Yeah, you're like
probably my best friend.

1197
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,785
- Okay.
- [Barry] Well, but you're a bit...

1198
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:54,787
you're, uh...

1199
01:02:54,831 --> 01:02:57,052
- chronologically different.
- Older.

1200
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:59,487
That's what I can't understand.

1201
01:02:59,531 --> 01:03:02,490
I traveled back in
time from here to here.

1202
01:03:02,534 --> 01:03:05,406
Yet somehow,
everything's all changed

1203
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:06,950
back here.

1204
01:03:06,975 --> 01:03:09,341
- Or like when you were born, so...
- [older Bruce] Well...

1205
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:11,365
time isn't linear.

1206
01:03:11,456 --> 01:03:12,675
Right?

1207
01:03:12,718 --> 01:03:13,676
Right.

1208
01:03:16,401 --> 01:03:17,664
At some point

1209
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:20,953
you probably saw a
movie that told you

1210
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,163
that if you went back
and changed the past,

1211
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:26,558
you'd create a kind of a
branched timeline, right?

1212
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:27,733
Like, look.

1213
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:33,086
New present

1214
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,698
- and new future.
- [past Barry] Yeah.

1215
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:37,569
Well, time doesn't
work like that.

1216
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:38,875
That's not how time works.

1217
01:03:38,918 --> 01:03:40,920
When you go back
and change the past

1218
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:43,009
you create a fulcrum.

1219
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:45,969
You put yourself on a whole
nother strand of spaghetti.

1220
01:03:47,231 --> 01:03:49,668
New future. New past.

1221
01:03:49,712 --> 01:03:51,191
[spaghetti snaps]

1222
01:03:51,235 --> 01:03:52,628
It's retrocausal.

1223
01:03:52,671 --> 01:03:53,933
It goes both ways.

1224
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:56,457
Actually, it goes many ways.

1225
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:58,416
Maybe some other time.

1226
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:01,854
Okay, but in an ontological
paradox model, there's not...

1227
01:04:01,898 --> 01:04:04,683
What you did was you
changed the future

1228
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:06,052
and you changed the past.

1229
01:04:06,729 --> 01:04:07,730
If a person

1230
01:04:07,773 --> 01:04:09,993
is stupid enough

1231
01:04:10,036 --> 01:04:11,559
to mess with time...

1232
01:04:11,603 --> 01:04:13,866
what you eventually
end up with is this.

1233
01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:17,914
The multiverse.

1234
01:04:17,957 --> 01:04:19,698
Some strands run

1235
01:04:19,742 --> 01:04:21,178
almost parallel.

1236
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:23,876
There will be inevitable
intersections,

1237
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,835
and others that are just...

1238
01:04:25,878 --> 01:04:27,706
wildly divergent.

1239
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,708
What it is...

1240
01:04:30,258 --> 01:04:31,161
is a hot mess.

1241
01:04:32,842 --> 01:04:34,539
It's a crapshoot.

1242
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:35,975
It's all just a crapshoot.

1243
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,317
What does the parmesan mean?

1244
01:04:37,342 --> 01:04:39,214
The metaphor's over.
It's just a garnish.

1245
01:04:39,264 --> 01:04:41,179
And I'll tell ya something.

1246
01:04:41,372 --> 01:04:43,239
A person would have to be

1247
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:44,854
an idiot

1248
01:04:44,897 --> 01:04:46,638
to play craps

1249
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,553
with the space-time continuum.

1250
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:50,120
Yeah, an idiot.

1251
01:04:51,774 --> 01:04:52,644
Here.

1252
01:04:54,774 --> 01:04:56,820
[slurping] Mm.

1253
01:04:56,845 --> 01:04:59,390
Are you joking with the
chewing noises right now?

1254
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:01,559
So, uh, you're the reason

1255
01:05:02,707 --> 01:05:04,012
this Zod character

1256
01:05:04,037 --> 01:05:06,387
is about to destroy the Earth?

1257
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:07,532
Maybe.

1258
01:05:07,557 --> 01:05:09,418
There's a guy called Superman

1259
01:05:09,443 --> 01:05:10,662
who can stop Zod?

1260
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,186
- Yeah, yeah.
- And flies?

1261
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,724
Shoots lasers out of his eyes?

1262
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:17,165
Yes, he flies, and he shoots
lasers out of his eyes. Yes.

1263
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:18,452
No one said "Superman"...

1264
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:22,587
that might be a
little on the nose?

1265
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,763
- You call yourself Batman.
- Yeah.

1266
01:05:24,807 --> 01:05:26,634
I don't call myself
Super Batman.

1267
01:05:26,678 --> 01:05:28,506
[laughs]

1268
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:31,030
Wait, he's Batman?

1269
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:33,032
What did you think
we were doing here?

1270
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:35,252
I thought this was
the cousin's dinner.

1271
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:37,863
He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1272
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:39,604
Not really. Not
so much anymore.

1273
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,519
You know...

1274
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:42,868
they don't really need me.

1275
01:05:44,802 --> 01:05:47,065
Things have changed.
Gotham's now

1276
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,222
one of the safest
cities in the world.

1277
01:05:49,266 --> 01:05:51,355
Well, I... I need
you. We need you.

1278
01:05:51,398 --> 01:05:52,660
In my timeline,

1279
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:54,880
Batman's our
strategist, our leader.

1280
01:05:54,924 --> 01:05:57,578
The world needs Superman. You're
the best detective in the world.

1281
01:05:57,622 --> 01:05:59,818
You're probably the only person
who can help me find him.

1282
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:01,321
So, will you help us?

1283
01:06:01,365 --> 01:06:02,801
[heroic music builds, stops]

1284
01:06:02,845 --> 01:06:03,715
Pass.

1285
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,589
[Barry stutters]

1286
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:10,458
Like pass the salt?

1287
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,376
Bruce?

1288
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:14,204
[crows cawing]

1289
01:06:14,247 --> 01:06:16,293
[Barry] He doesn't
want to help us...

1290
01:06:16,336 --> 01:06:17,947
we're gonna use his bat shit.

1291
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,035
Bat shit?

1292
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:22,821
Yeah, his bat stuff,
his bat things.

1293
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:23,822
Stand on that thing.

1294
01:06:26,869 --> 01:06:29,001
Okay, remember when you
phased through the floor?

1295
01:06:29,045 --> 01:06:30,524
- Yeah.
- So,

1296
01:06:30,568 --> 01:06:32,526
- I need you to do that again.
- [vibrating]

1297
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,224
- [heavy thud]
- [past Barry] Ow.

1298
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:36,008
- [sighs]

Has the gravity of this

Shut up. Shut up.

You have no idea

No idea!

1346
01:09:25,553 --> 01:09:28,572
You take everything for granted.
You don't even appreciate...

1347
01:09:28,615 --> 01:09:31,183
You just walk around
thinking that you're so funny

1348
01:09:31,227 --> 01:09:32,576
and so cool.

1349
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:34,012
And it's embarrassing,

1350
01:09:34,056 --> 01:09:37,102
because you're not
any of those things!

Hey, screw you, man!

I've done nothing but
everything you've asked.

You made me get
struck by lightning!

I phased naked through the floor.
And I terrified Mrs. Johannson.

Now I'm probably
gonna have to move.

1356
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:50,768
You won't even tell
me why you're here.

1357
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,553
But will you at least tell me
why you're being so mean to me...

Wait, what?

1361

Forget it.

The monkey? Wait...

1363
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:08,693
So, you're mad at me
for playing with a toy?

1364
01:10:08,718 --> 01:10:10,763
It's not a toy.

1365
01:10:10,788 --> 01:10:12,355
Mom bought us that monkey.

1366
01:10:12,398 --> 01:10:14,357
'Cause she calls us Monkey.

1367
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,186
She gives us monkey
stuff all the time.

1368
01:10:18,143 --> 01:10:19,057
Right.

1369
01:10:20,102 --> 01:10:20,972
Look...

1370
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,061

You're... You're not that bad.

01:10:33,245 --> 01:10:35,622
You can just be kind
of a dick sometimes.

1378
01:10:37,554 --> 01:10:40,078
But let's face it. I
am pretty obnoxious.

1379
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:42,037
But I just get excited.

1380
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,648
Come on. This place
is pretty cool, right?

1381
01:10:45,562 --> 01:10:46,389
Yeah.

1382

All right, well, um...

That thing you said,
with the spaghetti.

1389
01:11:22,272 --> 01:11:25,184
You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.

1390
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:28,387
You had an Alfred.

But this is more than that.

Inevitable intersections

1401
01:11:54,718 --> 01:11:56,391
are something none of the theories
could have anticipated 'cause,

1402
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,026
well, how do you explain
that except for...

There are good Kryptonians...

[whispering] And I
was very confident

that we were just
gonna find Superman,

1594

then this would all
be super simple.

But we found you instead.

1601
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:46,435
What do you want with Kal-El?

1602
01:26:46,478 --> 01:26:48,045
We were trying to rescue him.

1603
01:26:48,089 --> 01:26:49,873
Why?

1604
01:26:49,916 --> 01:26:52,702
Because he's my friend.

1605
01:26:52,745 --> 01:26:54,095
Do you... Do you know him?

1606
01:26:54,138 --> 01:26:56,271
[whispering] She
looks mad. Get ready.

1607
01:26:56,314 --> 01:26:58,684
She might do laser vision, or she
might do, like, a freezy breath...

1608
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:01,232
- or she'll just start throwing crazy...
- My name is Kara.

Daughter of Zor-El.

Kal-El was my cousin.

01:27:06,063 --> 01:27:08,370
- Right, and who's Kal-El again?
- It's Superman.

1612
01:27:08,413 --> 01:27:11,068
- No, 'cause you said that was Clark.
- Who's Clark?

1613
01:27:11,112 --> 01:27:14,289
Clark is his human name.

He was an infant when we left.

01:27:21,818 --> 01:27:23,428
The last son of Krypton... I...

1618
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:26,910
I was sent to protect him.

1619
01:27:26,953 --> 01:27:28,912
It looks like he
never made it to Earth

in this universe.

have separated.

Wait, so you thought a baby

1623
01:27:35,092 --> 01:27:37,529
was gonna protect us
from this Zod guy?

General Zod is here.

1625
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,316
He must have tracked
my pod's signal.

1626
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:43,666
- I have to go. [groans]
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1627
01:27:43,709 --> 01:27:47,322
Well, you need to recover your
strength. Actually, Barry...

1628
01:27:47,365 --> 01:27:48,888
take her to the roof

1629
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:50,934
and put her in the sun.

1630
01:27:50,977 --> 01:27:52,240
Yeah.

1631
01:27:52,283 --> 01:27:54,242
- Yeah.
- Whatever, like if, I mean,

1632
01:27:54,285 --> 01:27:55,852
you're solar powered.

1633
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:57,419
Good for you. I've
been trying to...

1634
01:27:57,462 --> 01:27:58,898
- [Kara panting]
- Oh, uh...

1635
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,337
We'll take that with us.

1636

[enthralling music playing]

1637
01:28:11,302 --> 01:28:14,088
Um, am I cool to...

1638
01:28:14,131 --> 01:28:15,001
turn around?

1639
01:28:16,133 --> 01:28:17,439
Are you dressed

1640
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:19,615
in a red cape?

1641
01:28:19,658 --> 01:28:21,747
[breathing heavily]

1642
01:28:26,187 --> 01:28:28,319
You're levitating?

01:28:38,851 --> 01:28:40,114
[sighs]

1649
01:28:40,157 --> 01:28:42,028
Is it loud?

1650
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:45,336
Are you, uh, good?
Do you feel, um...

1651
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,598
strong yet, or...

1652
01:28:47,556 --> 01:28:49,340
[hawks, spits]

1653
01:28:49,384 --> 01:28:50,211
[past Barry gasps]

1654
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:53,997
Yep, that seems, uh,

1655
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,781
seems strong. You know...

1656
01:28:55,825 --> 01:28:58,436
old man Barry, down there,

1657
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,743
says if we don't
stop Captain Zode,

1658
01:29:00,786 --> 01:29:03,137
he'll kill thousands of people.

1659
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,660
Billions of people.

1660
01:29:04,703 --> 01:29:05,791
Billions?

1661
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:08,751
Of your people.

1662
01:29:08,794 --> 01:29:10,492
- They're good people.
- Good people?

1663
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:13,321
We came to this planet

1664
01:29:13,364 --> 01:29:15,366
looking for a safe
place to live,

1665
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,629
and they put me in a cage.

1666
01:29:17,673 --> 01:29:20,328
Yeah. A lot of
humans are dicks.

1667
01:29:20,371 --> 01:29:22,721
But then

1668
01:29:22,765 --> 01:29:25,115
there's babies and ballerinas.

1669
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,943
And entertainment wrestlers.

1670
01:29:26,986 --> 01:29:28,423
A lot of humans
are worth saving.

1671
01:29:29,554 --> 01:29:30,773
Maybe to you.

1672
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,471
But I'm not a human.

1673
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:36,213
I'm a Kryptonian.

1674
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:41,697
She's gone.

1675
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:43,438
I have to get my powers back.

1676
01:29:46,267 --> 01:29:47,572
If I can re-create the accident

1677
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:49,139
that gave me my powers...

1678
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:50,638
maybe I can reconnect
to the Speed Force...

1679
01:29:50,662 --> 01:29:53,448
and maybe we'd stand
a chance against Zod.

1680
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:55,928
Or kill yourself in the process.

1681
01:29:58,931 --> 01:29:59,758
Tell me something.

1682
01:30:01,673 --> 01:30:03,806
If you get your powers back,

1683
01:30:03,849 --> 01:30:05,155
you can go anywhere.

1684
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,722
You can go to another timeline,

1685
01:30:06,765 --> 01:30:08,202
another universe.

1686
01:30:08,245 --> 01:30:10,378
Why do you wanna stay...

1687
01:30:10,421 --> 01:30:12,728
and fight to save this one?

1688
01:30:12,771 --> 01:30:15,121
Because this is the
world where my mom lives.

1689
01:30:18,342 --> 01:30:21,084
I went back in time to save her.

1690
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:23,260
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1691
01:30:23,304 --> 01:30:25,175
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1692
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,917
How do you tell someone
something like that?

1693
01:30:31,442 --> 01:30:33,444
I lost my parents...

1694
01:30:36,404 --> 01:30:38,057
but that pain...

1695
01:30:41,713 --> 01:30:43,324
made me who I am.

1696
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:45,848
I'm not sure I know who I
am without it, actually.

1697
01:30:45,891 --> 01:30:47,893
[wistful music playing]

1698
01:30:50,156 --> 01:30:52,898
I spent a lifetime...

1699
01:30:52,942 --> 01:30:55,771
trying to right the
wrongs of the past.

1700
01:30:57,163 --> 01:30:58,382
As if

1701
01:30:58,426 --> 01:31:01,298
putting on a cape
and fighting crime

1702
01:31:01,342 --> 01:31:03,169
would bring my parents back.

1703
01:31:09,088 --> 01:31:10,394
You actually did it.

1704
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,354
So...

1705
01:31:13,397 --> 01:31:14,790
I guess the plan is

1706
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,183
to douse yourself in
industrial chemicals

1707
01:31:17,227 --> 01:31:19,055
while electrocuting yourself?

1708
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:19,925
Yep.

1709
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:25,409
Want some help?

[rousing music plays]

1711
01:31:27,324 --> 01:31:29,674
[Barry] Hell yeah. That
would be incredibly useful.

1712
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:31,348
I've actually already
borrowed some chemicals

1713
01:31:31,372 --> 01:31:32,590
and your soldering iron,

1714
01:31:32,634 --> 01:31:34,810
and I'm sitting
in your bat-seat.

1715
01:31:34,853 --> 01:31:36,290
Is that like a faux pas?

I gave you a warning.

Your failure to deliver

Okay, when I throw the switch,

1737
01:33:14,518 --> 01:33:16,085
the current should
run up the wire

Should protect you a little.

1742

Right, but the point is
for me to not be protected.

Okay.

1744

You're gonna need to
be out of the way.

[laughs] That's the whole thing.

2117
01:56:57,810 --> 01:56:59,768
We can take as much
time as it takes.

2118
01:56:59,812 --> 01:57:01,901
No, that's not
what I mean. Hey!

- [grunts]

2123
01:57:23,313 --> 01:57:25,794
Okay, you good? Come on.

2124
01:57:25,838 --> 01:57:27,622
I need you in there. Let's go.

2125
01:57:27,665 --> 01:57:29,406
Barry, please,
just listen to me!

2126
01:57:38,372 --> 01:57:39,590
[yells]

2127

[up-tempo music playing]

2129
01:57:47,511 --> 01:57:48,904
Where were you?

2130
01:57:48,948 --> 01:57:50,490
What, you just stand
here the whole time?

2131
01:57:50,514 --> 01:57:53,387
Barry, this is an
inevitable intersection.

2132
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,215
You have to stop. Barry!

2133
01:58:00,611 --> 01:58:01,612
[grunts]

2134

[vibrating]

2135
01:58:10,578 --> 01:58:11,840
No, Barry, wait!

2136
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:20,196
Barry, listen. [echoes]

2137
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,640
There's something
I should tell you.

2138
01:58:24,244 --> 01:58:26,724
I went back in time initially

2139
01:58:26,768 --> 01:58:29,249
- because...
- Yeah, because Mom died.

2140
01:58:29,292 --> 01:58:30,990
How do you know?

2141
01:58:31,033 --> 01:58:33,601
It doesn't matter. Does it?

2142
01:58:33,644 --> 01:58:35,255
You know that I have
to undo what I did.

2143
01:58:36,343 --> 01:58:37,213
No.

2144
01:58:37,257 --> 01:58:38,649
It's not a mistake.

2145
01:58:38,693 --> 01:58:39,737
We can save her.

2146
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:41,000
And we can save them.

2147
01:58:41,043 --> 01:58:42,740
No, we can't.

2148
01:58:42,784 --> 01:58:45,482
This is what Bruce
was talking about.

2149
01:58:45,526 --> 01:58:47,702
Barry, this is inevitable.

2150
01:58:47,745 --> 01:58:50,385
We can try a million times, and
we're not gonna be able to fix this.

2151
01:58:51,053 --> 01:58:52,489
No matter what we do...

2152
01:58:53,142 --> 01:58:55,014
this world dies.

2153
01:58:56,015 --> 01:58:57,973
Today.

2154
01:58:58,017 --> 01:58:58,974
Look around.

2155

[distorted rumbling]

2156
01:59:03,152 --> 01:59:05,198
Look at the damage
we're causing.

2157
01:59:11,334 --> 01:59:12,596
Now we have to stop.

2158
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,989
Okay?

2159
01:59:14,033 --> 01:59:15,817
Look, I was just
doing my laundry.

2160
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:18,994
You're the one who came and
told me that I'm a superhero.

2161
01:59:19,038 --> 01:59:20,865
And now you're saying what?

2162
01:59:20,909 --> 01:59:22,780
[stutters] You
don't want me to be?

2163
01:59:22,824 --> 01:59:25,305
Well, guess what!
It's too late!

2164
01:59:25,348 --> 01:59:28,003
I am... [echoes]

the Flash.

2166
01:59:29,526 --> 01:59:31,398
And I can save everyone.

2167
01:59:31,441 --> 01:59:33,182
Nobody dies!

2168
01:59:33,226 --> 01:59:34,227

has a solution.

Sometimes we just
have to let go.

01:59:54,508 --> 01:59:56,814
[Nora] Sometimes you
just have to let go.

2174
01:59:56,858 --> 01:59:59,469
Let go of Mom?

2175
01:59:59,513 --> 02:00:02,820
She'll always be alive,
somewhere in time.

2176
02:00:04,039 --> 02:00:04,997
Always.

2177
02:00:05,736 --> 02:00:06,868
Just not for us.

2178
02:00:08,087 --> 02:00:10,176
You're full of shit, dude.

2179
02:00:10,219 --> 02:00:11,612
I'm going back.

2180
02:00:11,655 --> 02:00:13,483
[shouts] You're going
back to kill Mom?

2181
02:00:13,527 --> 02:00:14,702
No!

2182
02:00:14,745 --> 02:00:16,486
You're staying!

2183
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:18,532
You stay, right here.

2184
02:00:20,055 --> 02:00:21,535
Just give me one more time.

2185
02:00:21,578 --> 02:00:23,319
Barry, stop!

2186
02:00:23,363 --> 02:00:25,843
You, stop!

What's your name?

I've lived...

- [crackling]

Yes, I am...

you.

We are so close.

02:01:50,624 --> 02:01:52,582
I've got it almost figured out.

How long have you
been doing this?

Time is inconsequential.

You have to stop.

02:04:07,195 --> 02:04:10,024
It stops once I've fixed it!

2243
02:04:11,678 --> 02:04:14,724
It's not entirely
your fault, Barry.

2244
02:04:14,768 --> 02:04:18,380
I pushed you out of the
Chronobowl on that September 29

2245
02:04:18,424 --> 02:04:21,601
so you could start
me on this path. Hmm?

How do you like our
endless paradox?

2247
02:04:24,343 --> 02:04:26,475
I made you create me...

2248
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,348
and now you're the one...

2249

in my way.

2250
02:04:32,133 --> 02:04:35,092
No matter how close I get
to winning this fight...

2251
02:04:35,136 --> 02:04:37,138
you go back

2252
02:04:37,181 --> 02:04:38,922
and let Mom die.

2253
02:04:38,966 --> 02:04:41,142
You're the inevitable

2254
02:04:42,143 --> 02:04:44,406
And you do have to let go.

Hey, hey. Don't worry.
It's gonna heal.

But do you want a hug?

Mm-hmm. Sure.

- [tearfully] I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't say that.

Your mom must be grateful

She's very lucky to have you.

Ah! You have to tell her that.

you should ask me to dinner.

Okay? And I didn't listen.

very, very weird,

back, I promise.
