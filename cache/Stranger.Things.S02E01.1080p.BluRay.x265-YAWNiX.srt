1
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,783
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

2
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,006
- Move it.
- Let's get out of here!

3
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,133
Headed down Poplar, toward Main.

4
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,060
- Get 'em off of us, Mick!
- I'm working on it!

5
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,732
- The alley. To your right.
- Okay.

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,321
Shit!

7
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,831
Shit! Shit! Shit!

8
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,876
Shit!

9
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,098
Okay. Okay.

10
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,642
- Son of a bitch! We got more!
- Oh, shit!

11
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,487
They're headed down 7th.

12
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,532
Do something, Kali. Do something!

13
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,908
Next right. There's a tunnel. Take it.

14
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,669
We got these bastards now!

15
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,937
Boom.

16
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,605
Holy shit!

17
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,235
Shit! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,442
What the hell is wrong with you, Adams?
The hell are you doing?

19
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,699
Adams! Come on.
What the hell? Why'd you stop?

20
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,076
Adams! Adams!

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,748
Adams, I'm talkin' to you!

22
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,834
Adams! Adams!

23
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,773
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

24
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,395
<i>A police chase rocked downtown Pittsburgh
earlier this evening...</i>

25
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,153
- Another stupid penny!
- Dusty, watch it! You almost hit Mews.

26
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,279
- Can I please check under your cushions?
- Dusty.

27
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,157
Mom, please? It's an emergency!

28
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,832
Who's your buddy? Who's your buddy?

29
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,327
Love you, Mom.

30
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,710
Lucas, you copy? I've got four quarters.
What's your haul?

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,713
Take your puny haul
and multiply it by five.

32
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,795
- How?
<i>- While you were scrounging around</i>

33
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,346
like a homeless bum,
I mowed Old Man Humphrey's lawn.

34
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,845
Old Man Humphrey's got that kinda cash?

35
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,801
- Just call Mike already.
- You call Mike.

36
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,854
I have to go take a shower
from doing real work, like a man.

37
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,101
Over and out.

38
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,651
<i>Mike, do you copy? Mike, do you copy?</i>

39
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,023
Yeah. Yeah, I copy.

40
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,400
- What are you doing on this channel?
- Nothing.

41
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,902
<i>Lucas and I have six bucks total.</i>

42
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,359
<i>- What's your haul?</i>
- Shit! I don't know yet.

43
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,446
- What do you mean you don't know yet?
- Hold on. Call Will.

44
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,173
What the hell are you doing?

45
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,718
I'll pay you back!

46
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,176
- Bye!
- Mike!

47
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,018
- Mike! Get back here!
- Hey. No running in the house.

48
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,686
What is going on?

49
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,264
Mike! Mike!

50
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,982
Asshole!

51
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,668
- Hey!
- Okay. So, I'll pick you up in two hours.

52
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,095
- That's 9:00 on the dot, okay?
- Okay.

53
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,981
If anything happens,
if you need to come home,

54
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,266
just ask them to use their phone
and call home. Okay?

55
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,810
- Don't...
- Don't walk or bike home. I know.

56
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,105
- Okay, but, sweetie...
- Mom, I have to go.

57
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,522
Have fun.

58
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,326
<i>To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.</i>

59
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,870
Oh, Jesus!
I'm in unchartered territory here, guys.

60
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,699
- Down! Down! Down!
- I'm going! I'm going!

61
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,964
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!

62
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,168
Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

63
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,555
No. No. No!

64
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,726
No! No! No!
I hate this overpriced bullshit!

65
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,894
Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!

66
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,438
You're not nimble enough.
But you'll get there one day.

67
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,517
But until then,
Princess Daphne is still mine.

68
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,104
Whatever. I'm still tops
on <i>Centipede</i> and <i>Dig Dug.</i>

69
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,405
You sure about that?

70
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,865
Sure about what?

71
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,529
You're kidding me. No, no, no.

72
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,741
Move! Move! No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, no! No! No!

73
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,292
- 751,300 points!
- That's impossible.

74
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,795
- Who is Mad Max?
- Better than you.

75
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,877
- Is it you?
- You know I despise <i>Dig Dug.</i>

76
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,837
- Then who is it?
- Yeah, spill it, Keith.

77
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:57,221
You want information,
then I need something in return.

78
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,268
No, no, no. No way.
You're not getting a date with her.

79
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,940
Mike, come on. Just get him the date.

80
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,767
I'm not prostituting my sister!

81
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,507
- But it's for a good cause.
- No, don't get him the date. Know what?

82
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,365
He's gonna spread his nasty-ass rash
to your whole family.

83
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,864
Acne isn't a rash and it isn't contagious,
you prepubescent wastoid.

84
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,072
Oh, I'm a wastoid?
She wouldn't go on a date with you.

85
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,578
You make, like, what? $2.50 an hour?

86
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,588
- Nice perm.
- Gonna make fun of my hair?

87
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,962
Hey. Hey, guys, do you see the...

88
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,131
Will! Are you okay?

89
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,175
Yeah. I just...

90
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,721
- I needed some air.
- Come on. You're up on <i>Dig Dug.</i>

91
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,928
Let's take that top score back, huh?

92
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,215
Good morning, Jim.

93
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,547
- Jim. Hold on a second. We need to talk.
- Get away from me.

94
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,849
Okay, no... I think you really
wanna hear this.

95
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,144
- Get away from me.
- Trust me. I only want five minutes!

96
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,723
Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek.
We all want things.

97
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,558
This isn't a laughing matter, Jim.

98
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,188
This is serious, okay?

99
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,190
I really got something here.
I'm telling you!

100
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,612
- Hey. Mornin', Chief.
- Morning.

101
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,779
Morning, Murray.

102
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,404
Got any proof
on your butt-probin' aliens yet, Murray?

103
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,828
I believe there was, and may still be,

104
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,746
a Russian spy presence in Hawkins.

105
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,290
Russian spies!

106
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:31,963
Are the spies in cahoots with the aliens?
Or how do they fit in here? I'm confused.

107
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,836
I'm talking multiple reports now.
Multiple reports, okay?

108
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,417
Of a Russian child in Hawkins.

109
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,596
- A child? What are you talking about?
- A girl who may have psionic abilities.

110
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,093
- "Psionic"?
- Psychic.

111
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,266
What about that girl
that made that kid pee himself?

112
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,217
- A prank.
- What girl?

113
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,631
Wasn't a prank.

114
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,554
You got five minutes. Not a second more.

115
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,641
I talked to a Big Buy ex-employee

116
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,523
who said some little girl
shattered the door with her mind.

117
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,478
I heard that story.

118
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,693
Did you hear the one about the fat man
with the beard who climbs down chimneys?

119
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,276
Then last month,
a co-worker of Ted Wheeler's claims

120
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,829
some Russian girl with a shaved head
was hiding in his basement.

121
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,156
Ted now denies this.

122
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,788
- Oh, wow. That's a surprise.
- But it connects.

123
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,289
- Enlighten me.
- This girl,

124
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,962
she's some kind
of a Russian weapon, right?

125
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,085
Barbara sees this girl,
tries to help her, perhaps.

126
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,044
But before she can,
the Russians find them, take them...

127
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:23,177
Wait. You're telling me Barbara Holland
was kidnapped by Russian spies.

128
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,804
- Kidnapped. Killed.
- Killed?

129
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,305
- Don't you get it, Jim?
- No.

130
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,433
This has potentially
international implications.

131
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,062
I'm talking a full-on Russian invasion
right here in Hawkins.

132
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,239
Do you have any proof of this girl?
I mean, has anybody seen her recently?

133
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,510
These are separate...

134
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,741
Excuse me. Sorry.

135
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,943
- Okay.
- Hello?

136
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,654
Merrill called,
wants you to check out his pumpkins.

137
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,206
<i>- Says they've been contaminated...</i>
- All right.

138
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,911
...by his vengeful neighbor, Eugene.
You're welcome.

139
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,005
I'm sorry. I really hate to do this,
but I gotta run.

140
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,457
- It's an emergency.
- You gave me five minutes.

141
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,231
Yeah, listen, you know what?
I liked your alien theory a lot better.

142
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,844
And you want my advice?

143
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,015
Why don't you stop bleeding
those people dry and go home? All right?

144
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,013
- I am not bleeding anyone... dry.
- Listen to me. Go home.

145
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,654
It's crap, I know.

146
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,282
No, it's not crap.

147
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,323
- It's not good.
- It's going to be.

148
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,157
Just... It needs some reorganizing.

149
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,083
- Can I mark on it?
- Yeah, I guess.

150
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,785
So, in the first paragraph,

151
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,872
you used the basketball game
versus Northern

152
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,583
as a metaphor for your life,
which is great.

153
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,215
But then, around here,

154
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,342
you start talking about your granddad's
experiences in the war.

155
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,639
And I...
I don't see how they're connected.

156
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,139
It connects because...

157
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,563
because, you know, we both won.

158
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,020
- Do you think I should start from scratch?
- No. I mean...

159
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,901
When's the deadline?

160
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,824
It's tomorrow for early application.

161
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,152
Can you come and help me tonight?

162
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,533
We have our dinner tonight, remember?

163
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,081
- Oh, my God!
- We already canceled last week.

164
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:18,542
- You don't have to go. Just work on this.
- No, no, no. What's the point?

165
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,877
- Hey, calm down.
- I'm calm. I'm calm.

166
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,675
I'm just being honest. You know, I mean...

167
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,300
- I'll end up working for my dad anyway.
- That's not true.

168
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,190
I don't know, Nance.
Is that such a bad thing?

169
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,977
There's insurance and benefits
and all that adult stuff.

170
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,396
And if I took it, you know,
I could be around for your senior year.

171
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,602
- Steve...
- Just to look after you a little bit.

172
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,688
Make sure you don't forget
about this pretty face.

173
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,652
Nance, I'm serious.

174
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,078
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

175
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,329
Who is that?

176
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,581
I have no idea.

177
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,038
But would you check out that ass?

178
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,499
Just look at it go.

179
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,116
Meet the human brain.

180
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,535
I know. I know, it doesn't look like much.

181
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,455
A little gross even, right?
But consider this.

182
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:21,002
There are a hundred billion cells
inside of this miracle of evolution.

183
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,498
All working as one.

184
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,298
No, no, I did not misspeak.
I did not stutter.

185
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,797
A hundred billion.

186
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,050
Ah, this must be our new student.

187
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,506
Indeed. All yours.

188
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,057
All right. Hold up.
You don't get away that easy.

189
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,680
Come on up. Don't be shy.

190
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,807
Dustin, drum roll.

191
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:45,021
Class, please welcome,
all the way from sunny California,

192
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:50,027
the latest passenger to join us
on our curiosity voyage, Maxine.

193
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,240
- It's Max.
- Sorry?

194
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,943
Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max.

195
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,871
- Mad Max.
- Well, all aboard, Max.

196
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,135
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

197
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,688
Do you have these in any other colors?
I'm not a big fan of orange.

198
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,140
Hmm...

199
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,441
I'll have to check in back.

200
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,576
Oh, shit!

201
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,028
- You're gonna get me fired.
- That's my master plan.

202
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,802
Get you fired so I can hire you
and we won't have to hide back here.

203
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,877
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.

204
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,751
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't stop thinking about you.

205
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,254
- It's crazy. I feel like a teenager.
- Me, too.

206
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,836
You know, in high school,
you didn't know who I was.

207
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,796
Come on.

208
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,758
Bob, I have to get back to work.

209
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,092
Okay.

210
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:05,523
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies,
and I'll see you tonight for movie night.

211
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,849
Jonathan's night to pick?

212
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,229
- Yes.
- Okay.

213
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,242
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

214
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,114
Hey, look, a green one.

215
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,461
Tell Jonathan not to pick anything scary.
I hate scary movies.

216
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,146
You're saying
this was fine yesterday?

217
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,233
Fine?

218
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,185
These were prize winners, Chief.
You should've seen 'em.

219
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,646
For the life of me,
I couldn't figure out what happened.

220
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,947
And then I remembered... Eugene.

221
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,159
What about him?

222
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,844
He's been complaining about me
to just about anyone who'll listen.

223
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,575
Why's that?

224
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,783
Well, he started this
"Pick Your Pumpkin" thing.

225
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,412
Acted like it was trademarked.

226
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,621
I said, "Hire yourself a damn lawyer.
See how far that gets you."

227
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,674
You're telling me that nice old Eugene

228
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,345
came out here after dark
and doused your field with poison?

229
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,547
Not Eugene himself.

230
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,599
- I'm thinking one of his field hands.
- Uh-huh.

231
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:27,146
Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing around
accusations lightly. You know me.

232
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,520
This happening the day before Halloween,
when sales are peaking?

233
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,101
That's a hell of a coincidence.

234
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,436
Hell of a coincidence.

235
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,989
You got somebody working on that field?

236
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,444
Yeah, screw you, too.

237
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,331
Hey. Be there.

238
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,161
- Hey, Nancy.
- Hey! Thanks.

239
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,622
- Oh, could I get one more?
- Yeah, sure.

240
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,092
You're coming to this.

241
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,011
"Come and get sheet faced."

242
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,389
No, I'm not.

243
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:49,220
I can't let you sit all alone Halloween.
That's just not acceptable.

244
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,021
Well, you can relax.
I'm not gonna be alone.

245
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,774
I'm going trick-or-treating with Will.

246
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,647
- All night?
- Yeah.

247
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,405
No, no way. You're gonna be home by 8:00,

248
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:06,909
listening to the Talking Heads
and reading Vonnegut or something.

249
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,533
Sounds like a nice night.

250
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,994
Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows,
you might even, like, meet someone.

251
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,966
- Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off.
- I missed you.

252
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,385
- It's been like an hour.
- Tell me about it.

253
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,009
Okay. Okay, okay. God.

254
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,438
Sorry.

255
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,861
- There's no way that's Mad Max.
- Yeah. Girls don't play video games.

256
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,444
And even if they did,
you can't get 750,000 points on <i>Dig Dug.</i>

257
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,700
- It's impossible.
- But her name is Max.

258
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,578
- So what?
- So, how many Maxes do you know?

259
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,876
- I don't know.
- Zero. That's how many.

260
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,123
She shows up at school

261
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,081
the day after someone with her same name
breaks our top score.

262
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,044
- I mean, you kidding me?
- Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max.

263
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,470
And plus she skateboards,
so she's pretty awesome.

264
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,014
Awesome?
You haven't even spoken a word to her.

265
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,094
I don't have to. I mean, look at her.
Shit, I've lost the target.

266
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,724
Oh! There.

267
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,406
Got it. There we go.

268
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,582
"Stop spying on me, creeps."

269
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,878
Well, shit.

270
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,004
William Byers.

271
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,757
Your mother's here.

272
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,990
You guys think he's okay?

273
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,319
He's always weird
when he has to go in.

274
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,075
I don't know. He's quiet today.

275
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,081
He's always quiet.

276
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,719
You feeling any better?

277
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,229
Will?

278
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,432
Huh?

279
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,984
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

280
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,447
Hey. What did we talk about, huh?
You've got to stop it with the sorries.

281
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:52,198
Sorry. I mean, yeah, I know.

282
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:57,958
And listen, you know, there's nothing
to be nervous about, you know.

283
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,832
Just tell 'em what you felt last night
and what you saw.

284
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:07,464
Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time.
So it's gonna be okay. Okay?

285
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,555
Okay.

286
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,279
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

287
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,743
Hey.

288
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,767
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

289
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,954
Sir Will, how are you?

290
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,751
Mom. Pop.

291
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,454
Let's take a look,
see what's going on here.

292
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,087
I see you shaved off a pound
since we saw you last.

293
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,920
Must be making room
for all that Halloween candy.

294
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,129
What's your favorite candy?

295
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,761
Desert island candy,
if you had to pick one?

296
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,307
- I don't know.
- Come on.

297
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,306
Life or death situation,
what would you pick?

298
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,888
- I guess... Reese's Pieces.
- Reese's Pieces.

299
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,725
Good call. Good call.

300
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,104
I'm more of a Mounds guy,

301
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:51,404
but I gotta say, peanut butter
and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that.

302
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,322
<i>All right, tell me
what's going on with you.</i>

303
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,071
<i>Tell me about this episode you had.</i>

304
00:24:56,662 --> 00:25:01,578
<i>Well, my friends were there
and then theyjust weren't,</i>

305
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,329
<i>and I was back there again.</i>

306
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,202
In the Upside Down?

307
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,329
All right, so what happened next?

308
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:14,921
I heard this noise, and so I went outside,
and it was worse.

309
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,255
How was it worse?

310
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,218
There was this storm.

311
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,930
Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?

312
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,024
I felt...

313
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,067
frozen.

314
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,239
- Heart racing?
- Just frozen.

315
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,317
Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?

316
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,404
No. Like how you feel when you're scared,

317
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:44,867
and you can't breathe or talk
or do anything.

318
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,954
I felt... felt this evil,
like it was looking at me.

319
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,711
It was evil?

320
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,010
Well...
What do you think the evil wanted?

321
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,337
To kill.

322
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,715
To kill you?

323
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,351
Not me.

324
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,224
Everyone else.

325
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,281
All right,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

326
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,284
It's probably gonna get worse
before it gets better.

327
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:28,084
Worse? He's already had
two episodes this month.

328
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,708
He'll likely have more
before the month is out.

329
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,508
It's called the Anniversary Effect.
And we've seen this with soldiers.

330
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,007
The anniversary of an event brings back
traumatic memories.

331
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,555
Sort of opens up
the neurological floodgates, so to speak.

332
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,257
So what does this mean for the kid?

333
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,217
He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares?

334
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,224
Yeah, that.
Maybe some personality changes.

335
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,977
He might get irritable. He might lash out.

336
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,478
What do we do when that happens?

337
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,938
Okay. Well, from what we know
about post-traumatic stress...

338
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,820
And we're still learning, okay?
Just treat him normally.

339
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,403
Be patient with him.
Don't pressure him to talk.

340
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,908
Just let him lead the way.

341
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,207
I'm sorry, what you're saying
is it's gonna get worse and worse

342
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,501
and we're just supposed to pretend
it's not happening?

343
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,249
It sounds counterintuitive, I know.

344
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,707
But I assure you that is really
the best thing you can do for him.

345
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,515
Listen. I understand what you went through
last year. I get it.

346
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,219
But those people are gone.
They're gone. Okay?

347
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,437
So if we're gonna get through this,

348
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,729
I just... I need you to realize
I'm on your side.

349
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,521
I need you to trust me.

350
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,149
<i>"Trust me"?</i>

351
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,235
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, I know.

352
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,072
But, you know, university gives out
a degree, this guy's got it.

353
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:51,160
And look, that post-traumatic stuff
he's talking about, that stuff is real.

354
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,746
He's gonna be okay. All right?

355
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,048
How's Bob the Brain?

356
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,218
Don't call him that.

357
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,795
Sorry. Old habit.

358
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,423
He's good. We're good.

359
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,599
Good. I'm happy for you.

360
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,768
Really. Hey...

361
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,771
Things get worse, you call me first.

362
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,358
You call me.

363
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:15,985
Okay.

364
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,083
They're ready for you, sir.

365
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,108
- Patty.
- Sam.

366
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,570
Afternoon, sir.

367
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,981
- Looks like another hot one today, huh?
- Never gets old, sir.

368
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,954
Still no sign?

369
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,076
Jack shit.

370
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:58,286
- Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me.
- So go home. I'll radio if she comes.

371
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,589
Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me
out of here so you can make your move.

372
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,635
- Oh, 'cause you're such a threat.
- That's right.

373
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,135
She will not be able to resist
these pearls.

374
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,756
- Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock.
- What?

375
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,612
- They're arguing. They're arguing.
- Oh, my God.

376
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,939
I see that. I don't even know
why you need those.

377
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,396
God. You're so stupid.

378
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,334
She's incredible.

379
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,426
She's...

380
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,593
Mad Max.

381
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,222
After dinner, I want you to pick out
your toys for the yard sale.

382
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,053
- Fine.
- Two boxes' worth.

383
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,934
- Two boxes?
- You heard me.

384
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,811
I'm fine with you giving away a couple,

385
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,984
but the other ones have
way too much emotional value.

386
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,653
- Emotional value?
- They're hunks of plastic, Michael.

387
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,980
You already took away my Atari.

388
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,674
Didn't wanna lose more toys,
you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy.

389
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,158
I didn't steal. I borrowed.

390
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,844
Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr. Kowalski
last week either, right?

391
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,452
Or plagiarize that essay?
Or graffiti the bathroom stall?

392
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,248
Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.

393
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,919
So if your friend jumps off a cliff,
you're gonna jump, too?

394
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,794
We know you've had a hard year, Michael.
But we've been patient.

395
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,592
This isn't strike one.
This isn't even strike three.

396
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,216
It's strike 20. You're on the bench, son.

397
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:35,050
And if it'd been my coach,
you'd be lucky to still be on the team.

398
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,227
Two boxes. Two.

399
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,274
<i>Okay. Ready?</i>

400
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,314
Yeah.

401
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,111
Okay.

402
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,579
I'm so sorry
I didn't get to cook.

403
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,582
I was gonna make that baked ziti
you guys like so much,

404
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,959
but I just forgot about the time,
and before you know it,

405
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,631
"Oh, my God, it's five o'clock."

406
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,676
- It's fine. It's great.
- Right. I love KFC.

407
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,515
So, I noticed a "For Sale" sign
out in your yard.

408
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,139
Is that the neighbors', or...

409
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,721
- You wanna tell them?
- Go ahead.

410
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:27,861
We hired a man named Murray Bauman.
Have either of you heard of him?

411
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,109
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

412
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,738
He was an investigative journalist
for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times.</i>

413
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,114
He's pretty well known.

414
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,744
Anyway, he's freelance now,
and he agreed to take the case.

415
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,789
That's... That's great.

416
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,796
No, that's really... That's great, right?

417
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,341
Um, what exactly does that mean?

418
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,386
Means he's gonna do
what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop...

419
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:56,724
Sorry.

420
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,427
What the Hawkins police haven't been
capable of doing.

421
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,394
Means we have a real detective
on the case.

422
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,484
It means...

423
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,356
we're going to find our Barb.

424
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,026
If anyone can find her, it's this man.

425
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,536
He already has leads.
By God, he's worth every last penny.

426
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,872
Is that why you're selling the house?

427
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,371
Don't worry about us, sweetie. We're fine.

428
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,244
More than fine.

429
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:30,173
For the first time in a long time,
we're hopeful.

430
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,258
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

431
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,933
- It's finger-lickin' good.
- Mmm.

432
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,232
El, are you there? El?

433
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,787
It's me. It's Mike.

434
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,534
It's day 352, 7:40 p.m.

435
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,129
I'm still here.

436
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,544
If you're out there, say something.
Or give me a sign.

437
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,382
I won't even say anything.
Just... I wanna know if you're okay.

438
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,561
I'm so stupid.

439
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,484
<i>Mike.</i>

440
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,941
- <i>Mike?</i>
- Hello, is that you?

441
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,115
<i>Yeah, it's me, Dustin.
What're you doing on this channel again?</i>

442
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,615
I've been trying to reach you all day.
We were right. Max is Mad Max.

443
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,161
- Yeah, I'm busy.
<i>- But...</i>

444
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,703
- What do we do now?
- We stick to the plan.

445
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,794
Mike's not gonna like it.

446
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,995
Last time I checked,
our party is not a dictatorship.

447
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,126
- It's a democracy.
- What if Max says no?

448
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:19,004
How can Max say no to these?

449
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,630
I told you to stop that.

450
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,336
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Later.

451
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,408
Mews!

452
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,498
Mews.

453
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,593
- Stop. Stop!
- What?

454
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,970
Come on, you gotta get used to it.
This is the future.

455
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,052
Well, put the future down
and get me a clean bowl.

456
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:22,484
Hey, bud. I didn't know
what you'd like, so I got a variety.

457
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,574
- Take your pick.
- Whatever you want.

458
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:27,828
All right.

459
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,455
What are you working on?

460
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,043
Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?

461
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,415
- Me.
- Did someone call you that?

462
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,674
Hey. You can talk to me.
You know that, right?

463
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,507
Whatever happened.
Will, come on, talk to me.

464
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,557
- Stop treating me like that.
- What? Like what?

465
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,010
Like everyone else.
Like there's something wrong with me.

466
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,845
What are you talking about?

467
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,181
Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone.

468
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,312
They all treat me like I'm gonna break.

469
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,985
Like I'm a baby.
Like I can't handle things on my own.

470
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,323
It doesn't help. It just makes me feel
like more of a freak.

471
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,573
- You're not a freak.
- Yeah, I am.

472
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,497
I am.

473
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,497
You know what? You're right.

474
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,416
You are a freak.

475
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,716
- What?
- No, I'm serious. You're a freak.

476
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:28,422
But what? Do you wanna be normal?
Do you wanna be just like everyone else?

477
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,632
Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.

478
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,933
Is that why you don't have any friends?

479
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,144
I have friends, Will.

480
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,348
Then why are you
always hanging out with me?

481
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,018
Because you're my best friend, all right?

482
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:46,196
And I would rather be best friends
with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.

483
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,614
You know what I mean?

484
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,817
Okay, look...

485
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,329
Who would you rather be friends with?
Bowie or Kenny Rogers?

486
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,622
Ugh.

487
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,870
Exactly. It's no contest.

488
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,124
The thing is, nobody normal

489
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,672
ever accomplished anything meaningful
in this world.

490
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,333
- You got it?
- Well...

491
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,928
- some people like Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny Rogers.

492
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,631
I love Kenny Rogers.

493
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,221
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

494
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,393
<i>Mr. Mom.</i> Perfect!

495
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,441
<i>Where's Mommy keep the extra diapers?</i>

496
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,116
<i>Hey! Cowards.</i>

497
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,547
Hey.

498
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,166
It's okay. Let it go.

499
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,626
Probably just a crank call.

500
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,712
- Okay.
<i>- Holy mackerel!</i>

501
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,843
- Let it go.
<i>- Aw, man!</i>

502
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:58,296
Hey, what'd we talk about?

503
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,549
No signal.

504
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,850
- What?
- No signal.

505
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,223
It's 8-1-5. You're late.

506
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,815
Yeah, I lost track of time.
I'll signal next time, all right?

507
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:18,696
Uh, and it's 8:15. It's not 8-1-5.

508
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,858
Eight-fifteen.

509
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,738
Now, what did we talk about?

510
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,869
Dinner first, then dessert. Always.

511
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,871
That's a rule.

512
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
Yeah?

513
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,340
Yes.

514
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:45,364
