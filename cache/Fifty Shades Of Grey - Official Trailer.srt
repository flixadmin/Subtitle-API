1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,282
So this is just an interview for the newspaper.

2
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,282
I just have a couple of questions.

3
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,782
Mr Grey will see you now.

4
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,782
What was he like?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,782
He was..

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,300
polite

7
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:31,782
intense

8
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:32,782
smart

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,782
really intimidating.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,600
Do you have any interest outside of work?

11
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:41,282
What about you?

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,300
I'd like to know more about you.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,500
There's really not much to know about me.

14
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:47,100
I mean, look at me.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
I am.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
To what do you owe your success?

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,400
I exercise control in all things, Miss Steele.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
It must be really boring.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,600
I’m incapable of leaving you alone.

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,100
Then don't.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,600
I had a rough start in life.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,900
You should steer clear of me.

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
I don't do..

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,600
ROMANCE.

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,400
My tastes are very..

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,400
singular.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,300
You wouldn’t understand.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,300
Enlighten me, then.
