1
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:40,034
I'm sure you recognize
some of these people, right? Agent Peña?

2
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,141
It looks like you raided
the family album...

3
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,014
Mrs. Moncada.

4
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,378
Please, call me Judy.

5
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,487
Let me tell you...

6
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,356
before this son of a bitch
killed my husband and my brother,

7
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,359
all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

8
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:04,887
Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

9
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:09,731
We might say that we share
a common goal.

10
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,539
- The same as yours, Agent Peña.
- Is that right?

11
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,440
Yes.

12
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,106
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

13
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,510
Wait, Javier.

14
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,613
I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

15
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:33,023
You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

16
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,952
But let's not lie to ourselves.

17
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,427
You haven't been able to get
close to him.

18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,794
The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

19
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,636
And we know how that ended, right?

20
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:52,702
So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,740
What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

22
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:02,722
We're going to kill everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

23
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,453
Until he's alone. With nothing.

24
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,221
What we want, Mr. Peña,

25
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:14,063
is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

26
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,966
We want him to be afraid.

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,434
There's just one small problem.

28
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,805
Just one?

29
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:28,009
To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

30
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,106
that your government has,
Agent Peña.

31
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,687
And I'm just going to
hand that over to you?

32
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:38,190
We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Peña.

33
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,788
All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,195
We are simply making
a small adjustment.

35
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,975
Thanks for the drink.

36
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,734
Too much stupidity for my liking.

37
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,373
The Castaños can be useful.

38
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,137
I was talking about you.

39
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,313
Yes, Javier.

40
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,019
I'm a narco.

41
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,649
And I believe in honor and loyalty,
like you.

42
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,056
Pablo doesn't.

43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,152
Berna. Go get the car.

44
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,172
Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

45
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,353
Well...

46
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,365
we really want you to realize,
Agent Peña,

47
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,099
the potential of what
we're offering you.

48
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:38,940
Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

49
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,207
you still have to be a policeman, right?

50
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,119
I know what it feels like
when Pablo kills someone close to you.

51
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,791
What's that?

52
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,793
Information that would be
very valuable to you.

53
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,066
That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

54
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:09,670
She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

55
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,007
The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo killed.

56
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,512
You'll find her there.

57
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,812
I told you we have an enemy
in common.

58
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,666
If you change your mind,
give us a ring.

59
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,875
<i>Life goes on, right?</i>

60
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,745
<i>And for Escobar,
that was a pretty good thing.</i>

61
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,551
<i>He remained at large,
protected by an army of sicarios...</i>

62
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,089
<i>in a city that refused
to give him up.</i>

63
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,789
<i>Pablo kept his lawyers working
overtime...</i>

64
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:49,434
<i>continuing to negotiate his surrender
with Colombian Attorney General De Greiff.</i>

65
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,237
<i>But it was bullshit.</i>

66
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,070
<i>Why surrender when
you're holding all the cards?</i>

67
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,139
<i>He was free.
And business was booming.</i>

68
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,770
LEADER OF THE SEARCH BLOC KILLED

69
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,646
<i>For those of us tasked
with catching Escobar,</i>

70
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,741
<i>Carrillo's death was a punch
in the gut.</i>

71
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,915
<i>But life went on for us as well.</i>

72
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,788
<i>Centra Spike was still busy
gathering intel.</i>

73
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,363
<i>The brass was still
reviewing and approving it.</i>

74
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,695
<i>And it was still finding
its way to us.</i>

75
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,665
<i>But, shit, man...</i>

76
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,771
<i>you can have all the intelligence
in the world,</i>

77
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,005
<i>but if nobody's there to act on it,
what's it worth?</i>

78
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,806
<i>Nothing.</i>

79
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,013
<i>All it adds up to
is a growing stack of unread files</i>

80
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,988
<i>on a dead man's desk.</i>

81
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,117
<i>We were back where we started,
nowhere.</i>

82
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,164
Look, Dad.

83
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,289
Let's see.

84
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,403
- Nine point seven.
- Why?

85
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,502
I would've given you a ten,
but here, next to me,

86
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,845
is an Argentinian judge who's very picky.

87
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,311
Very picky.

88
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,218
Why don't you jump in here with me?

89
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,383
If I dive in there,
I'd splash all the water out of the pool.

90
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,560
Sir, Fernando Duque is here.

91
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,700
And you...
And what are you doing, my little love?

92
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,536
That's it. Little kicks, little kicks.
Like a little pair of scissors.

93
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,575
That's right, like a little puppy.

94
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,166
That's it, beautiful.

95
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,847
Hey, ladies.

96
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,444
My kids are in the pool.
Does someone know how to swim?

97
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:49,784
- Yeah, boss, they call me Flipper.
- Flipper?

98
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,019
You talk so much shit, Blackie. You'd sink
like a rock tied to a heavier rock.

99
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,425
Eat shit, Velasco.

100
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,895
- Velasco, I'm putting my trust in you.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,125
Not in Flipper.

102
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,796
Flipper.

103
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,901
They call me Flipper.

104
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,771
- What's the score?
- Two to zero.

105
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,075
The National team is winning.
We're killing them!

106
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,912
That's it!

107
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:37,126
Careful with that little dance.
You're starting to put ideas in my head.

108
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,402
Love, who is picking up Carlos?

109
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,465
La Quica. He's on his way.

110
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,303
Hey, that smells good.

111
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,646
Pablo, the kids love this place.

112
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,742
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

113
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,665
On your feet. Now!

114
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:19,109
I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear.
Limón lied to me.

115
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,945
No, please. When they find me,
they're going to kill me.

116
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,781
- No! No!
- Stay still!

117
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,950
Please.

118
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,148
Do you think I wanted this?

119
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,726
They used me
and they're throwing my life away.

120
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,728
You're breaking my fucking heart, baby.

121
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,363
You're all the same.

122
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,405
You don't listen. Nobody listens!

123
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,840
And all those people dying for no reason.

124
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,045
What's up, Peña?
What should we do with her?

125
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,660
She's good with kids.

126
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,361
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Carrillo.

127
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,267
I keep wondering
if it's better to know the truth.

128
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,009
I don't follow.

129
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:35,279
The things they said about my husband,
about what he did before he was killed.

130
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,384
Did he shoot a child?

131
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,253
Did he kill that boy
like they said on the news?

132
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,434
No. Absolutely not.

133
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,406
Your husband did everything in his means
to get Escobar.

134
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,777
But he did not cross the line.

135
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,821
Well, that was rough.

136
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,256
- I just kept looking at her, thinking...
- Hey.

137
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,822
It's not gonna happen to me,
it's not gonna happen to us.

138
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,235
You want me to come home?

139
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,838
Just make sure you're still you
when it's all over.

140
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,320
So three years in the jungles
fighting FARC.

141
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,626
Hugo Martinez chose his own path
a long time ago

142
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,858
and he hasn't deviated from it since.

143
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:57,436
He's methodical, favors procedure
and strict protocol.

144
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,267
Do you think you can get him to do it?

145
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:06,271
<i>How do you get a man to take a job
that nobody wants? Don't get me wrong.</i>

146
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,611
<i>There was no shortage of brave men
in the Colombian National Police.</i>

147
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,778
<i>But signing up to replace Carrillo
as the head of the Search Bloc</i>

148
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,049
<i>would take a lot more than bravery.</i>

149
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,648
<i>Gaviria couldn't count on someone
raising their hand.</i>

150
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,788
<i>It would take a certain kind of pressure
to find the right volunteer.</i>

151
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,661
Is that your father?

152
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,791
Over there with the president?

153
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,397
That's cool.

154
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:48,316
To all those present,
it is my honor to present

155
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,653
the President of the Republic...

156
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:58,525
His Excellency,
Don César Augusto Gaviria Trujillo.

157
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,365
Congratulations, Class of 1992.

158
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,609
Recent events...

159
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,115
contrast heavily with today's ceremony.

160
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:24,381
Each one of you has decided to sacrifice
your personal interests...

161
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:30,061
and dedicate your lives
to the service of the nation.

162
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,130
There is no higher honor...

163
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,304
than to serve your homeland.

164
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,048
- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

165
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,483
I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr. President.

166
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,883
I'm glad. It was also for you.

167
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:02,254
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

168
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,059
who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

169
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,994
They mentioned many names.

170
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,567
But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

171
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,669
That's an honor, Mr. President,
but at this point in my career,

172
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:21,942
- I'm sure you can find a better candidate.
- Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

173
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,646
And I know you're the man to do it.

174
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,322
The nation deserves someone
better than me.

175
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:36,358
Your son was one of the best
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.

176
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,760
He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

177
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,698
We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

178
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,837
And your son happily accepted.

179
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,040
I ask that you at least
consider my request.

180
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,706
For Colombia.

181
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,964
- Carlos!
- Tata!

182
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,305
Come on, come on. Let's see.

183
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,542
Go ahead.

184
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:29,081
- I can't believe it. Look at you.
- Slowly, slowly.

185
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,809
I don't want any more visits
to the doctor.

186
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,878
- Manuela, you're so beautiful. Look at me.
- Look how tan he is.

187
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,719
He looks like a movie star, right?

188
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,985
Yes, boss.

189
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,050
- He looks like Tom Cruise.
- Well...

190
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,356
Look at her, Pablo.

191
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,330
I can't believe you brought me from Miami
to see my sister like this.

192
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,562
No. I'm just so happy to see you.

193
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,834
Oh, my God. Carlos!

194
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,742
Welcome, sweetie.
I'm so happy to have you home.

195
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,573
Tonight, I am going to make
the best meal this family has ever had.

196
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,718
Well, then...
ready to go for a little walk?

197
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,852
It's incredible how much
the children have grown, Pablo.

198
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,722
Manuelita is a princess. She is beautiful.

199
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:17,730
She's the one who controls everything
around here. I just pay the bills.

200
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,790
I heard about Carrillo.

201
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,227
If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

202
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,263
I did the police a favor. Believe me.

203
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,276
Do you think the police agree with you?

204
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:36,645
No one wants war, Carlos.
Especially when they know they would lose.

205
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,308
But all that's in the past.

206
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:45,786
And I'm ready to get back to business.
I'm all in.

207
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,293
- Tell me about Miami.
- What can I tell you, Pablo?

208
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:53,093
The demand keeps increasing
and the merchandise keeps on coming.

209
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,100
Business hasn't been affected
by what happened at La Catedral,

210
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,795
nor by what you did.

211
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,603
Well, business can always
get better, right?

212
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,008
<i>Business was pretty good.</i>

213
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,912
<i>And a large part of that
was due to a guy they called the Lion.</i>

214
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,314
<i>You might remember him
as a Medellín hustler</i>

215
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:17,356
<i>who used to stuff bricks of cocaine into
his jacket and smuggled them into Miami.</i>

216
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:22,451
<i>Well, he stayed in Miami
and he made it his town.</i>

217
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,498
<i>He was responsible for
a smuggling network</i>

218
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,366
<i>that brought in Pablo's cocaine
by the ton. He was great at it.</i>

219
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,936
<i>But getting cocaine into the States
wasn't really the problem.</i>

220
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,946
<i>The problem was,
what do you do with all that money?</i>

221
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,776
<i>Sure, some of it could stay in the States.
And the narcos did that.</i>

222
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,378
<i>They bought crooked banks,
real estate, car dealerships,</i>

223
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,980
<i>race horses, art, you name it.</i>

224
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:57,524
<i>But if you're gonna run a cocaine empire,
you need to have a lot of cash on hand.</i>

225
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,861
<i>And getting cash back into Colombia
wasn't easy.</i>

226
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,564
<i>Let me put it this way.</i>

227
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,194
<i>This is what a ton of cocaine
looks like.</i>

228
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:12,333
<i>And here's what the same ton of cocaine
looks like when it's converted into cash.</i>

229
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,469
<i>See the problem?</i>

230
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,983
<i>Lion had to be creative
with how he got that money to Pablo.</i>

231
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,348
<i>And he was.
His shipments showed up like clockwork.</i>

232
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,225
<i>But the deeper Pablo went into his war
with the government...</i>

233
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,259
<i>the more important these shipments were.</i>

234
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,531
<i>Pablo needed more money than ever.</i>

235
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,161
<i>Without it, he was fucked.</i>

236
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,403
Let's bring the Lion over here.

237
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,775
I want to speak to him face to face,
like the old days.

238
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,506
- Okay.
- Make some new arrangements.

239
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,276
Some better ones.

240
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,341
Quica.

241
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,455
Give Velasco a call.
Tell him to find the Lion.

242
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,025
Carlos and I want to speak to him
about business.

243
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:06,421
It's time to get back
to making money, brother.

244
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,899
- Like the good old days, Pablo.
- Exactly.

245
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,905
What's up, Maritza?

246
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,376
What happened?

247
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,981
The police are looking for me.
They want to put a bullet in my head.

248
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:35,925
I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought
something good would come from all this.

249
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,463
Something good?

250
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,232
Let me come work with you.

251
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,904
No, Maritza, you're crazy.

252
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,640
I have to get this.

253
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,075
Give me one second.

254
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,574
What's up?

255
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,087
Where the fuck are you, Limón? Think you
can make me wait around for you, bitch?

256
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,282
I'm close by, man.

257
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,849
I mean, there's a lot of goddamn traffic,
but I'm on my way.

258
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,658
I don't give a fuck if there's traffic.
I need you here now!

259
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:15,462
You have to take this shit with you,
so get your ass over here. Right now.

260
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,368
Yes, I know, I know.
Forgive me. I'm on my way.

261
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,815
Maritza, I have to go.
I can't help you right now.

262
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,982
We already gave you money.
I'll call you later.

263
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,153
And we'll figure it out,
but I can't right now.

264
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,622
Okay, here we go.

265
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,270
- Search Bloc.
- It's Peña.

266
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,073
I'm here with Trujillo at the corner
of 38th and 24th streets. We need back up.

267
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,581
Sorry, but there's no authorization
to dispatch patrols.

268
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:14,085
We're watching one of Escobar's guys.
He just entered the building.

269
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:17,953
Return to base with the location.
We can ask for authorization from Bogotá.

270
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,315
Sure.

271
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,558
And you'll show up next Tuesday,
son of a bitch.

272
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,594
What time were you supposed to be here,
asshole?

273
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,003
You knew you had to make the delivery
before I pick up Lion tomorrow.

274
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,598
No, brother, don't get mad.
It's just that...

275
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,938
Limón!

276
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,174
You're going to take this goddamn bag
and get out of here now! I'm watching you.

277
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,976
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

278
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,348
This is the last time you pull shit
like this, Limón. The last time!

279
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,317
- This is the last time you make me wait.
- Come on, man...

280
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,656
- I told you. Get out of here.
- Oh, shit. That's Velasco.

281
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,629
Shit. What do we do?

282
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,326
We stick with Velasco.
The other one doesn't matter.

283
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,931
How many guys do you think are inside,
Peña?

284
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,606
Too many for just us two, no?

285
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,508
Yeah. We'd be screwed.

286
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,180
Son of a bitch.
We should call for backup, right?

287
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,181
Who are you calling?

288
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,712
- What's going on, Peña?
- I'll handle this.

289
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,932
This is Trujillo. You can trust him.

290
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,598
You're finally seeing the light.

291
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,272
Let's just see if this works.

292
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,845
You two coming?

293
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,885
Okay, then. You two, in the front with me.

294
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,944
Berna, with his men, around back.
Understood?

295
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,885
Just stay clear of the windows.

296
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,087
- Let's go then.
- Let's move.

297
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,845
- They're everywhere.
- Let's go down.

298
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,166
Hey!

299
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,454
Where were you going,
you filthy son of a bitch? Huh?

300
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,142
Here it is, Mrs. Escobar.

301
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,309
- What's that?
- It's a delivery.

302
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,976
- But who told you to buy this?
- It was me.

303
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,913
It's some clothes.

304
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,080
Hermilda.

305
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,161
Hermilda, for God's sake...
you can't send him out with so much money.

306
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,822
- Oh, Tata!
- They are going to know where we are.

307
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,956
You worry too much.

308
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:07,261
It's going to affect the children. Do you
want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?

309
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:12,907
You're right.

310
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,109
When Pablo was a little boy...

311
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:25,155
he came home from school one day,
very angry.

312
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,523
A little girl made fun of his shoes.

313
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,131
They were ragged.

314
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,994
And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

315
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:43,473
But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

316
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,977
The next day, Pablo went back to school.

317
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,150
Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

318
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,682
You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

319
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,521
And Pablo as well.

320
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,196
Mr. Ambassador,

321
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:11,031
I believe people fall
into two categories basically.

322
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,535
Those who rely on hope...

323
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,236
and those who rely on faith,

324
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,505
who see a system at work in the world
and are devoted to it.

325
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:26,481
It may be religion,
but in the case of police work, a method.

326
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,348
I'm guessing that you fall
on the faith side.

327
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,651
Correct.

328
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,223
We can catch Escobar
in any number of ways.

329
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:39,855
But if the one we choose
furthers an already strained relationship

330
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,764
between the Colombian people
and its police,

331
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:47,066
a strain caused by
years of corruption and abuse,

332
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,765
then we'll have lost.

333
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,342
Even if we catch him.

334
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,707
Your philosophy is our philosophy,
Colonel.

335
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,609
Yeah, we'll see about that.

336
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:57,910
Thank you very much.

337
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,278
- Good to sit down with you.
- Mr. Ambassador,

338
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,084
the whole world is watching
how we handle this.

339
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:10,692
I won't allow it to be corrupted
by outside interests or darker instincts.

340
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,272
It worked.

341
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,971
We're even.

342
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,314
I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellín.

343
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,581
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

344
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,985
It doesn't work like that.

345
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:41,950
I'm sorry.

346
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,153
So, then...?

347
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,154
How am I supposed to be okay?

348
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,993
Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Peña?

349
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:23,323
Don't worry about it, okay?
It won't happen again.

350
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:28,001
No. I'm not worried.

351
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,016
Leave us.

352
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,392
Life's funny, Velasco.

353
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,488
This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

354
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:59,403
Me lying there,
you and your men ready to torture me.

355
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,166
Look how everything's changed.

356
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,179
We are both loyal soldiers.

357
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,326
Serving our generals.

358
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,563
But you know what?

359
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,862
When it's time to give up your boss...

360
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,104
we give up our boss.

361
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:51,455
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but
he gave up this.

362
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:05,063
- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

363
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:09,095
He also told me Pablo
still has a large army and a lot of money.

364
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,802
Yes, but that could be complete bullshit, no?
To scare us off.

365
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,209
Or it could be true. To scare us off.

366
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,622
There lies the key.

367
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:32,091
If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

368
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,296
Something else.

369
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,493
Velasco was going to the airport tomorrow

370
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,571
because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

371
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:50,609
Excuse me, sir. It's Judy Moncada.

372
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,814
Mrs. Moncada.

373
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,454
How can I help you?

374
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:25,516
How was your trip? You must be beat.

375
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,142
Let's go. Get in.

376
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,811
Where's Velasco?

377
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,538
There he is.

378
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,373
Welcome.

379
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,641
- Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

380
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,575
This is my brother, Miguel.

381
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,348
And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

382
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:08,086
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

383
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,389
Lion. May I call you that?

384
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:15,364
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

385
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:19,834
They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

386
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:25,274
Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, or...

387
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:30,906
What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended?

388
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,441
Have a seat.

389
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,295
Tell me something, Lion.

390
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,960
Do you like working for a thug?

391
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,407
One...

392
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,243
two, three!

393
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,612
Very good.

394
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,310
Good job.

395
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,943
Look after your sister.

396
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,790
What happened?

397
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,487
Hey, boss...

398
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,993
Lion just called, sir.

399
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,626
He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

400
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:28,730
Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

401
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:33,306
Fucking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

402
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:37,609
- And where is Velasco?
- Boss, I have no idea.

403
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,645
Find him for me.

404
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,653
Right away, boss.

405
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:59,097
- I can't believe you're cooking.
- But you know I always helped my mother.

406
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,639
I helped while you ate.

407
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,772
You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

408
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,816
But I'm worried about you.

409
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,818
No. There's no reason to worry.

410
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,684
For God's sake, Tata.

411
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,849
Every cop in the country
is looking for Pablo.

412
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,722
Every drug trafficker
who's not from Medellín wants him dead.

413
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:27,321
And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don't kid yourself.

414
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,666
Today is a good day, Carlos.

415
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,706
My family is all together. You're here.

416
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:42,345
Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

417
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,381
There's no reason to change anything now.

418
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,862
I hope you're hungry.

419
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,873
Come inside, I'm packing.

420
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,506
Are you going to let me go to Medellín
or what?

421
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,340
Is that why you accepted the job?

422
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,682
You never should have volunteered.

423
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:27,055
But you can't be reassigned now,
because it would end your career, right?

424
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,856
Sure, only now I'm gonna be
the boss's son.

425
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,526
It appears to me you don't understand
what's happening.

426
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,299
I accepted because I wanted
to help my country.

427
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,297
Come here, I want to show you something.

428
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,611
I received this urn with my name.

429
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,752
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

430
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,555
It's an obituary.

431
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:08,393
Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

432
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,060
I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

433
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,273
We're polishing
this bottle off pretty fast.

434
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,781
Listen, I am not missing my flight
for anything tomorrow.

435
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,515
No.

436
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,415
You sure you can't stay?

437
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,151
I can't leave Olivia
with my sister forever, Steve.

438
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,993
Anyway, you'll be in Medellín.

439
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,433
You know,
I met the new head of Search Bloc.

440
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,335
- Yeah?
- He's an interesting guy.

441
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,673
I have a good feeling about him.

442
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,813
Before I forget, I want you...

443
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,639
I want you to give this to Olivia.

444
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,552
Meant to be good luck.

445
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,294
You keep it then.

446
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,063
I am gonna miss you.

447
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,306
From now on,

448
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,811
the Search Bloc is going to operate
in a more systematic fashion.

449
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,484
Since we unfortunately cannot
rely on the information given to us

450
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,212
by the people of Medellín...

451
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:40,484
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

452
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,059
We will position ourselves
in the neighborhoods

453
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:47,359
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

454
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:50,197
proceed to search them...

455
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:54,062
and if we don't find
what we're looking for,

456
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:57,767
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

457
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,435
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel!

458
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,576
A fucking grid search?

459
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,943
Isn't that how they caught the guy
who shot Abraham Lincoln?

460
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,614
- It's a change.
- Yeah, it's dated and conventional.

461
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,224
Well, we tried going
bullet for bullet with him,

462
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:20,128
and you saw how that ended up.

463
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,297
Oh, so that's it?

464
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,562
A week ago you volunteered
to jump into a chopper with Carrillo

465
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,071
and now it's a change?

466
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:34,735
Don't worry about it, man. We'll all
feel better once Escobar's in the ground

467
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:38,146
- one way or another, right?
- There is no other way, Javi.

468
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,946
Search Bloc is the only game in town.

469
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,619
You really think this asshole
can get it done?

470
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,953
I don't know. Maybe he'll surprise us.

471
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,589
Okay.

472
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,598
Grid search it is.

473
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,580
What did you find out from Velasco?

474
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,115
Not a fucking thing.

475
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,520
That son of a bitch turned out to be
a lot tougher than I thought.

476
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,969
Is that what I think it is?

477
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,844
Rules of the game.

478
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:50,988
We only go after armed people. Sicarios.

479
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:58,026
There won't be any information
about businesses or labs or shipments.

480
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:00,723
This isn't about helping Judy.

481
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,890
This is about killing Pablo.

482
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,535
Well, then...

483
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,972
here's to killing Pablo.

484
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:22,520
<i>Of course, Peña knew
the information he had given Berna</i>

485
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:23,918
<i>was already bearing fruit.</i>

486
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,753
For Colombia!

487
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,875
<i>The Castaños and their men
were efficient, if not always subtle.</i>

488
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:53,710
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

489
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,945
<i>What's newsworthy
about a few dead sicarios</i>

490
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,714
<i>in the murder capital of the world?</i>

491
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:06,256
<i>Of course, I'm not sure Javi knew</i>

492
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:09,231
<i>just how fucked up things
were really gonna get.</i>

493
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,796
Follow me and cover me!

494
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:20,438
<i>Hard to feel sorry for a bunch
of drug dealers getting whacked, fight?</i>

495
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:27,885
<i>These guys had sown a lot of violence
over the years... killed a lot of people.</i>

496
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,916
<i>It was about time they got some payback.</i>

497
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,053
<i>But turning a bunch
of well-armed vigilantes loose</i>

498
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,926
<i>on the streets of Medellín...</i>

499
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:45,001
<i>was like pouring gasoline on a fire
that was already out of control.</i>

500
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,282
Boss?

501
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:12,756
Sorry to bother you, but something bad
is happening in the city, boss.

502
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,164
Five of our men, dead.

503
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:18,936
Who was it?

504
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,831
I don't know, boss. If I knew,
I'd kill the son of a bitch that did it.

505
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:27,707
Boss, I'm so sorry,
but La Quica's on the phone.

506
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:44,318
- And Velasco?
- It looks like a battlefield, boss.

507
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:52,566
No one's seen Velasco
and no one knows where he is. Boss...

508
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,071
you know that if someone
grabbed Velasco...

509
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,032
Yes.

510
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,419
Start packing.

511
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,753
Your turn, let's do it again.

512
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,261
My little rock made of paper...

513
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:23,928
how much do you want to eat?

514
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,664
Show your grandmother
how you washed your hands.

515
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,778
Looks good.

516
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:43,684
Pardon me.

517
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:49,723
Should we start?

518
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,787
Dig in, dig in.

519
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,901
So good.

520
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,230
A spoon?

521
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,101
There's no spoon, love. How about a fork?

522
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:21,984
<i>Martinez was right.</i>

523
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,420
<i>We all need a method.</i>

524
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:31,059
<i>Something to cling to when the shit
around us gets so deep, we might go under.</i>

525
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:37,069
<i>Something to guide us home
when we feel we've lost our way.</i>

526
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:42,742
<i>If we're lucky, someone gives us
a method and we follow it.</i>

527
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,244
<i>If not, we find our own.</i>

528
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:50,615
<i>Pablo's enemies
had found their own method.</i>

529
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,588
<i>And it was an ugly one.</i>

530
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:58,086
<i>They had opened up a new war against him,
striking from the shadows.</i>

531
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,990
<i>Showing him that, even in his hometown,
he wasn't safe.</i>

532
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,965
The Castaños are very efficient.

533
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,166
But not very discreet.

534
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:17,104
No one can know
we had anything to do with this.

535
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,640
<i>And the moment
their method became apparent...</i>

536
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,186
Excuse me.

537
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,118
<i>the message was clear.</i>

538
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,117
<i>There was a new player in town.</i>

539
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,724
What does it say?

540
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,023
<i>And they weren't fucking around.</i>

541
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:36,032
Your days are numbered, Pablo.
No one around you is safe.

542
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,465
Signed, Los Pepes.

543
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,173
Who in the hell are Los Pepes?
