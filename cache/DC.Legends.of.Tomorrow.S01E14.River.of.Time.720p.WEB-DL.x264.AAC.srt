00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:05,737
<i>in 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,374
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:11,310
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,811
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,280
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,382
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,652
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,588
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,958
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,428
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,230
Hold on to something!

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,736
I want to marry you, Ray.

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,571
Tragedy or heartbreak...

15
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,441
that's how it always ends
if the man's not Carter.

16
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:44,844
Agh!

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,145
It's Carter!

18
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,747
He doesn't even
remember who he was.

19
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,415
Kendra,
what are you waiting for?

20
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,151
If I kill Savage,
his mind will be lost.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,487
<i>I'm so sorry, Rip.</i>

22
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,590
Who are you, Gareeb?

23
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:16,442
Ramses's men inform me
that you still refuse to speak,

24
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:20,212
to reveal your name
or why you tried to kill me.

25
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,314
Who are you?

26
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:26,385
The man who is trying
to save the world from you.

27
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,887
And how are your efforts
proceeding?

28
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,291
You can't even stand
for lack of food and water.

29
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,032
I will always rise up
against you.

30
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,136
I will never give up.

31
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,005
Soon the sky rocks
will lay waste to this kingdom,

32
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,175
and you along with it.

33
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,144
This cell will be your tomb.

34
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:59,885
What do you know of the future
that I don't, Gareeb?

35
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,058
Mission...

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,659
Almost accomplished.

37
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,894
That bottle of scotch
was given to me

38
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,030
by Rob Roy MacGregor in 1689.

39
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,599
It's not half bad.

40
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:16,268
We should be toasting
to Savage's death.

41
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,070
Apart from celebrating murder,

42
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,038
Savage still has Carter
brainwashed.

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,840
I don't know if you've been
paying attention, Professor,

44
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,543
but murdering Savage
was always the plan.

45
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,179
Besides, Carter reincarnates,

46
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,947
which is more
than I can say about us.

47
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,949
As long as he's on board
and breathing,

48
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,520
Savage is a threat
to everyone on this ship.

49
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,221
So what, we just kill Savage

50
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,457
and leave Carter
a brainless drone?

51
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,692
Yes.

52
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,928
Sorry we're late,
but we found something.

53
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,930
We've been running diagnostics
on Ray's suit

54
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,699
after his battle with Savage's
rock 'em sock 'em robot.

55
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,568
The telemetry data
included a comparative scan

56
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,903
of the robot's tech.

57
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,538
Amazing.
This neuromorphic profile

58
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,940
is astonishingly futuristic.

59
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,042
Yeah, it's from 2166.

60
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,911
Well, that's the thing.
It's not.

61
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,279
This technology's light years
more advanced

62
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,047
than anything from 2166.

63
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,583
- Who cares?
- The Time Masters.

64
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,418
They refused to take
action against Savage

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,320
because he didn't pose
a threat to the timeline.

66
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,621
But if he comes

67
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,490
into possession
of future technology...

68
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,659
It means he's been engaging
in exactly the same manipulation

69
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,128
of time that the time council
were designed to prevent.

70
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,330
So now they'll finally
sign off on undoing

71
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,065
all the damage Savage
has done to the world.

72
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,900
Last time I checked,
the time council

73
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,502
was at the edge
of the timeline,

74
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,470
and this bucket of bolts

75
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,639
can barely hold it together
as it is.

76
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,175
Gideon, what's the status
of the time drive?

77
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,510
<i>Stable, Captain.</i>

78
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,946
Plot a course
for the vanishing point.

79
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:39,151
Tonight, Vandal Savage
faces justice for his crimes.

80
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:54,700
Quite the reversal of fortune,
isn't it, Gareeb?

81
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,370
4,000 years ago it was you
who was the prisoner.

82
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,005
Ever since I met you again,

83
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,275
I've always wondered
how you managed to escape.

84
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,010
Another time, perhaps.
For the moment,

85
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,845
I'm more interested in this.

86
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,948
The brains
to your robot super-weapon.

87
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,617
At least a century more advanced

88
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,486
than anything
to be found in 2166.

89
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,722
Do you have something
to ask me?

90
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,460
How did you obtain the ability
to travel through time?

91
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,964
From you.

92
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,033
When I saw you again in 1975,

93
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:33,038
I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,074
You showed a caveman fire.

95
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,410
And I had almost 200 years

96
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,712
to figure out
how to strike the flame.

97
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,980
All this time,
I've been wondering

98
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,248
why it was so difficult

99
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,916
to locate you
throughout history.

100
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,754
Because you've been
moving through history.

101
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,889
Well, you'll come to learn

102
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,858
that this is just one
of many things

103
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,728
we have in common, Gareeb.

104
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,031
We're both doing
what we must to save the world.

105
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,868
Subjugating the world
to your rule is not saving it.

106
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,771
You would create a wasteland
and call it peace.

107
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:10,108
Do not misquote Tacitus
to me.

108
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,710
I knew him well.

109
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,512
I have lived long enough

110
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,782
to watch civilizations
rise and fall.

111
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,951
You weep for your son.

112
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,689
I have held dozens
of my children

113
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,692
as they perished from old age.

114
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,628
You might be a Time Master,

115
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,764
but I'm a master of time.

116
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,633
And I play a far deeper game

117
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,155
than you could ever hope
to comprehend.

118
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,207
Gideon, go to maximum
on the time drive.

119
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,809
<i>Inadvisable, Captain.
When Dr. Palmer siphoned power</i>

120
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,478
<i>from the auxiliary time drive,
he reduced the ship...</i>

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,146
Gideon!
Take us to maximum.

122
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,214
We need to get
to the vanishing point

123
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,882
as fast as possible.

124
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,222
- Where am I?
- Somewhere safe.

125
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,057
Safe as long
as those cuffs hold.

126
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,960
Do you know who you are?

127
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,064
I'm Scythian Torvil,

128
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,667
adjunct to Lord Savage.

129
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,901
And you will release me,

130
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,270
or I will kill you
where you stand.

131
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:16,241
Your name is Carter hall.

132
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,810
You used to be Prince Khufu
of the middle kingdom.

133
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,812
And I am...

134
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,447
Kendra Saunders.

135
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,449
Oh, you seem surprised.

136
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,652
You didn't think Lord Savage
would warn me of my enemies?

137
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,655
Let me go and I promise you
I will show mercy.

138
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,393
I will kill you without
making you suffer first.

139
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,268
Not to sound
like a six-year-old,

140
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,103
but are we there yet?

141
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,640
No, the Waverider was severely
damaged in Savage's last attack.

142
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,242
Yeah, I can tell by the way
she's flying.

143
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,980
You sure you're not
pushing her too hard?

144
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,383
The longer Savage
is on board the ship,

145
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,886
the greater the danger
to all of us.

146
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,557
To us, or your family?

147
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,492
I checked with Gideon.

148
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,061
Bringing Savage on board
didn't change the timeline,

149
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,663
and your family still dies.

150
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,498
The timeline is
always in flux.

151
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Once we get
to the vanishing point,

152
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,234
all will be well.

153
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,970
Is that why you're pushing
the ship beyond its limits?

154
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,540
This has been my ship
for the last 13 years.

155
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,408
No one knows its limits
better than I do.

156
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,743
Not even Gideon.

157
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,877
The Waverider
will hold together.

158
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,813
I promise you.

159
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,695
Bollocks.
Gideon!

160
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,164
<i>Time drive failure, Captain.
The mains are offline.</i>

161
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,066
- What happened?
- It appears the time drive

162
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,869
is in need of some repair.

163
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,571
Uh, Miss Lance,
if you wouldn't mind going,

164
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,872
checking on our guest?

165
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,273
On it.

166
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,675
Mr. Jackson.
I'm going to need

167
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,343
your assistance
in fixing the time drive.

168
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,178
What if Jefferson
can't get the ship moving again?

169
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,780
Oh, thanks for the vote
of confidence.

170
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,115
No, what I mean is
if the ship can't be repaired,

171
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,851
we're marooned
in the time stream.

172
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,586
There really is no need
to worry.

173
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,955
The jumpship is equipped
with an auxiliary time drive,

174
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:13,625
capable of a one-time jump
back to 2016.

175
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,227
Which will not be necessary,
considering

176
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,795
you are going to fix
the Waverider.

177
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,164
- I'll do my best.
- That's the spirit.

178
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,402
You look concerned, Martin.

179
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,939
I'm remembering what Mr. Snart
said about Savage's presence

180
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,109
on this ship being a danger
to us all.

181
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,615
Have you spoken
with your sister Laurel lately?

182
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,786
How do you know so much
about us?

183
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,290
Oh, I've only had 191 years
to research my enemies.

184
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,459
Well, then you'd know
I don't scare that easily.

185
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,896
You should be scared...

186
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,264
of Captain Hunter.

187
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,999
His obsession
to save his family

188
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,834
will be the death of you all.

189
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,235
Thanks for the tip.

190
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,471
Enjoy being incarcerated.

191
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,306
Captain Hunter
lied to you so often,

192
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,409
and still you persist
in believing him.

193
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:08,580
You do know why he selected
all of you for this endeavor,

194
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,648
don't you?

195
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,116
Great bone structure?

196
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,785
He chose people
he could manipulate,

197
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,854
people that would believe
his lies.

198
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:20,592
Well, the lies
I don't believe are yours.

199
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,195
Do you blame him for putting
his family's lives first?

200
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,000
I'd tell you to go to hell,
but you'd probably

201
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,869
just feel at home there.

202
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,678
<i>Okay, I've got eyes
on the time drive.</i>

203
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,980
<i>There seems to be
a large crack in it.</i>

204
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,949
Well, if the housing's intact,
we should be all right.

205
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,850
I am going to need you
to re-route the power

206
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,385
from the secondary manifold.

207
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,486
<i>Okay.
I'm on it.</i>

208
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,888
Gideon, what is the level

209
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,623
of contamination
in the engine room?

210
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,792
<i>Levels at 3% above maximum,
Captain.</i>

211
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:54,793
We have to get him
out of there.

212
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,361
Don't worry.

213
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,529
He should be able to finish
before the radiation

214
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:00,365
has any adverse effect.

215
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,744
<i>Jefferson?</i>

216
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,214
Mom?
What are you doing here?

217
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,149
Good question.
I'm supposed to be

218
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,151
meeting my son at jitters.

219
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:23,088
But clearly he misses his
old job more than his mother.

220
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,422
I am so sorry.

221
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,191
I must've lost track of time.

222
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:29,260
Well, this should help.

223
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,831
I know it's not much,
but it belonged to your father.

224
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,265
At least it was going to.

225
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,102
I bought it for him
as a birthday present

226
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,336
before he passed.

227
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,271
It's awesome.
Thanks.

228
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,008
Maybe you can use it tonight.

229
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,110
Dinner at your grandma Louise's.

230
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,078
Yes.
I will be there.

231
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,713
And I won't be late.

232
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,682
I just got to stop
by the university first.

233
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,751
- The university?
- I got to say good-bye

234
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,352
to a friend
who's leaving town.

235
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,521
But I will be there.
6:00.

236
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,589
Okay.
All right, I love you.

237
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,690
I love you too, baby.

238
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,229
<i>Jefferson?</i>

239
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,563
Jefferson?

240
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,132
I did it.
I got it working.

241
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,800
You said
he wouldn't be harmed.

242
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,968
It must be the surge
when he brought the time drive

243
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,636
back online.
Gideon?

244
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,304
<i>Mr. Jackson has suffered
an extreme amount</i>

245
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,706
of temporal radiation exposure.

246
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,708
- That sounds ominous.
<i>- Oh, it is.</i>

247
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,209
<i>And there's nothing I can do
to reverse the side effects.</i>

248
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,544
What side effects?

249
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,912
<i>Mr. Jackson's
internal organs</i>

250
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,881
<i>are aging
at an accelerated rate.</i>

251
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,083
<i>The rest of his body
will soon follow.</i>

252
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,558
Why are all the snacks
in the future sugar-free?

253
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,594
So much for progress.

254
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,496
You remember Alexa?

255
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,665
Yeah.
From the security deposit job.

256
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,933
What about it?

257
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,401
Just had a feeling
about that one,

258
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,638
a sixth sense
things would end badly.

259
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,839
And they would have,
if you hadn't

260
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:48,840
have pulled us
out of there.

261
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,275
So what?

262
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,510
I'm getting
the same feeling now.

263
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,417
Gideon, how effective were
Mr. Jackson's attempts

264
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,152
to bring the time drive
back online?

265
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,954
<i>The drive's functions
have been restored,</i>

266
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,123
<i>but the entire system
will require a master reboot</i>

267
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,492
<i>before we can continue on
to the vanishing point.</i>

268
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,260
Yes, please begin.

269
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,995
And in the meantime,
could you check the timeline

270
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,631
for any variations
in my family's future?

271
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,533
<i>I believe Miss Lance
already told you the results.</i>

272
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,868
Please.

273
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,204
<i>The timeline remains
unchanged.</i>

274
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,005
Were you expecting
something different?

275
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,041
Hope Springs eternal,
Miss Lance.

276
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,342
If it didn't,
I would've surrendered

277
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,345
to despair a long time ago.

278
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,982
I assume Mr. Savage
is still secure in his cell?

279
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:35,653
He wasn't exactly short
on opinions on you, though.

280
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,622
I'd imagine not.

281
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,825
Among them being
that you would sell us out

282
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,161
to save your family.

283
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,165
He's not wrong.

284
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,838
Mr. Jackson is currently
in the med bay

285
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,542
facing death due
to temporal radiation exposure.

286
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,210
- Wait, what?
- I sent him to fix

287
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,713
the time drive.

288
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,181
I could have gone myself.

289
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:07,252
And I'm left to wonder if...

290
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,187
In some way,

291
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,524
I did it
because of the risk.

292
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:16,995
So you sent Jax
on a suicide mission

293
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,431
so that you could stay alive
to save your family?

294
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:24,402
I don't know, Sara.

295
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,204
That's what vexes me.

296
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:29,107
You know what vexes me?

297
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,609
Thinking that we've thrown in
with a Captain

298
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,013
who cares more about himself
than he does his crew.

299
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,758
<i>Kendra,
are you sure about this?</i>

300
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,761
Do you remember him?

301
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,464
He was our son.

302
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,633
Aldus.

303
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,969
Do you really
expect me to believe that?

304
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,940
I expect you to remember
your feelings.

305
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,142
We were together.

306
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,111
And we were happy.

307
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,780
We were a family.

308
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,819
Kendra, stay back!

309
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,264
Oops.

310
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,932
Are you okay?

311
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,635
- I should've known better.
- But are you okay?

312
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,104
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Stay away from him.

313
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,472
I'll be right back.

314
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,407
- Where are you going?
- To end this.

315
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,117
Dr. Palmer.

316
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,653
To what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

317
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,788
You're gonna tell me
how to free Carter's mind.

318
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,725
Oh, well,
all you had to do was ask.

319
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,463
Are you sure you want me to?

320
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,864
Of course I'm sure.

321
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,000
Because the moment
I release him,

322
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,535
you will lose her forever.

323
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,804
You don't know Kendra.

324
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,539
I know Chay-Ara.

325
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,043
And I know the man who stands
between you and your love

326
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,280
has stood between me and mine
for millennia.

327
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,283
We're actually quite alike,
you and I.

328
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:21,019
We're nothing alike.
You're insane.

329
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,189
But yet Chay-Ara once loved me
as she professes to love you.

330
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,759
Oh, you didn't know that,
did you?

331
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,130
I don't even think
Chay-Ara remembers,

332
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,865
but 4,000 years ago

333
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,534
I discovered that my Chay-Ara
had been reborn

334
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:40,038
but with no memory
of what had happened.

335
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,173
Like you murdering her
and Carter.

336
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,142
True.

337
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,744
She had no recollection of my...

338
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,514
my crime of passion.

339
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,050
And she fell in love with me,

340
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,687
very deeply.

341
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,390
And I with her.

342
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,391
That is perverse.

343
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,328
No, that is fact.

344
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,696
That is history.

345
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:08,900
And we were happy,
Dr. Palmer, very happy.

346
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:13,871
None of us blinded
by our cursed past

347
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,274
until he came.

348
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,375
He took her away from me.

349
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,110
He poisoned her against me.

350
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,279
He stole the happiness

351
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,881
that we shared, Dr. Palmer.

352
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,519
No.

353
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,457
No.
Carter is a good man.

354
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:36,394
And you are my only enemy.

355
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,563
Am I?

356
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:41,366
Or am I just a man
experiencing the same things

357
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,769
as you are right now?

358
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:48,239
We have the same enemy.

359
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:52,477
If Carter's free,
you lose her.

360
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,148
But then she would hardly be
the first woman you've lost,

361
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,616
now, would she?

362
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,430
I am really gonna have to beef
up our security around here.

363
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,632
It was pretty easy
to bypass the system,

364
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,334
considering I designed it.

365
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,668
You like my ride?

366
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,070
Those are some
pretty hot wheels.

367
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,571
- Yeah.
- Maybe that's your new name.

368
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,474
How you feeling?

369
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,909
I'm okay.
What are you doing here?

370
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,771
- I came to drop off a note.
- Let me guess.

371
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,980
It says, "Hey, Felicity.
I hope you're well.

372
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,343
I'm off to travel through time
and fight an immortal bad guy."

373
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,852
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

374
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,154
- That was pretty good.
- Thank you.

375
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,688
So, obviously,
Oliver told you.

376
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,956
Don't let his broodiness
fool you.

377
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,759
He can be quite chatty
sometimes.

378
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,294
He also happened to mention

379
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,929
that you're going
on this suicide mission

380
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,932
because you think
there's nothing for you here.

381
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,767
You think it's
a suicide mission?

382
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,499
I don't think going after
Vandal Savage is a vacation.

383
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,105
But don't change the subject.
You have a life here, Ray.

384
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,707
Actually,
everybody thinks I'm dead.

385
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,176
Nothing puts things
in perspective

386
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,944
more than seeing yourself
become a ghost.

387
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,846
You're not a ghost.

388
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,781
You just need to come back
to the world.

389
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:07,552
And I will,
after we take out Savage.

390
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:11,122
I became the Atom to make
the world a better place.

391
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:15,893
And I'm pretty sure
that saving it counts.

392
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,795
I'm pretty sure it does too.

393
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,301
See you soon.

394
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,703
You know,
I would've stayed for you.

395
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,504
I do.
But who knows?

396
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,872
Maybe the future Mrs. Palmer

397
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:31,509
is out there somewhere
in the past,

398
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,545
the future,
some parallel universe.

399
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,149
Ah, I'm off
to save the world,

400
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,017
not fall in love.

401
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,690
"And though my soul departs
the earth,

402
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,526
"I count the days
till my rebirth.

403
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,429
"I will wait across eternity

404
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,065
for my love to come back
to me."

405
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,097
Please.

406
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,402
Come back.

407
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,841
Ray?
Ray...

408
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,081
Ray?

409
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,717
Ray, stop!
Please.

410
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,723
Just give me
a chance to explain.

411
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,125
What you saw
back there, it was...

412
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,186
What?
Wasn't what it looked like?

413
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,561
You were reciting a love poem

414
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,929
to your brainwashed
ex-boyfriend.

415
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,864
I am just trying
to help Carter remember

416
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,066
who he really is.

417
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,235
Your soul mate.

418
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,867
Yeah, that's the part
in the conversation where you're

419
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,805
supposed to say,
"No, Ray, you're my soul mate."

420
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,309
Ray, you know
that I love you.

421
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,245
Ah, I know.

422
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,414
It's just not enough.

423
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,317
I can't believe I'm saying it,
but Savage was right.

424
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,986
Loving you is like a curse.

425
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,788
Oh, Ray.

426
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,790
You have to know,
whatever he said,

427
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,660
he's just trying
to get inside your head.

428
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,395
I know that.

429
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,931
But he's right.

430
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,500
Kendra, I-I don't think
I can do this anymore.

431
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,936
What are you saying?

432
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,405
Oh, what?
You want to end things?

433
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,340
Unless you can tell me
that I'll ever be anything more

434
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,409
than just Carter's placeholder.

435
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,582
Ray.

436
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,019
Are you certain
these results are accurate?

437
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,288
Jefferson's blood chemistry
is akin to that of a...

438
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,790
<i>a 63-year-old man.</i>

439
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,858
Actually, I don't feel
a day over 60.

440
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,462
- This isn't funny.
- No, and it's all Rip's fault.

441
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,930
<i>I'm afraid he's also
suffering</i>

442
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,699
<i>from early-stage
osteoarthritis.</i>

443
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,667
The exposure
to the temporal radiation

444
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:40,037
has led to an accelerated rate
of intracellular degeneration.

445
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,307
This is what happens
when Rip goes with plan B.

446
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,477
Plan A being taking Savage's
head in with that mace.

447
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,046
We're endeavoring to resolve
this without bloodshed.

448
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,382
And how's that working out
for you, Gandhi?

449
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,517
Look, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

450
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,453
We can talk to Hunter.

451
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,022
Even if Kendra
was to kill Savage,

452
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,957
my situation's still the same.

453
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,460
We're talking
about our situation, pops.

454
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,329
We're not waiting around
for the other shoe to drop.

455
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,367
You deserve better.

456
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,472
Alexa?

457
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,940
You bet your ass.

458
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,510
We need to talk.

459
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,345
We saw what you did to Jax.

460
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,047
And we're worried
it's just the beginning.

461
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,383
- The beginning of what?
- It's like I said, Rip.

462
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,319
As long as Savage is alive
and on this ship,

463
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,820
he is dangerous.

464
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,155
The time drive is rebooting.

465
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,823
We will soon be on our way.

466
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,392
I'm asking for
a little faith, gentlemen.

467
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,928
Sorry, fresh out.

468
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,897
I take it you and Mr. Snart
are of the same mind?

469
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,999
Yes.

470
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,101
And what of you, miss Lance?

471
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,536
You're the one
who said you'd sell us out

472
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:48,039
for your family.

473
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,573
Well, if that's
how you all feel, none of you

474
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,575
is obliged to continue
on this voyage with me.

475
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,444
As I told Martin,
the jumpship

476
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,746
can make a one-time voyage
back to 2016.

477
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,448
Are you saying it's ours?

478
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,949
I'm saying
that this mission

479
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,018
has always been
a voluntary enterprise.

480
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,220
And the mission
was to kill Savage.

481
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,590
Which doesn't seem
to be on the table anymore.

482
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,858
Very well.
Leave, if that's what you...

483
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,293
it's been a blast, Rip.

484
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,262
Good luck getting
to the vanishing point.

485
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,764
Tell your pals Chronos says,

486
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,299
"Kiss my ass".

487
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,472
What about you, Sara?

488
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,210
Never been one
to run from a fight.

489
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,294
Hi.

490
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:45,096
Impossible.

491
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,465
When I saw you last...

492
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,166
I know.

493
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,074
A miracle...

494
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,643
When I thought there were
none left to be had.

495
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,149
I needed to see you.

496
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:09,120
Look, I don't know how, but I'm
gonna get you out of here.

497
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:12,282
This isn't your fight anymore,
Ta-er al-Sahfer.

498
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,258
I'm not gonna
let you rot here.

499
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,594
Not when you're in here
because of me.

500
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:20,631
I am in here
because of my choices, beloved.

501
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:24,468
I made them
ready to accept my punishment.

502
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,303
I won't leave you in here.

503
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,440
If you love me, you will.

504
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:33,444
If you love me, you will leave
this place far behind,

505
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,113
and live a life
unburdened by your past.

506
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,882
It's easier said than done.

507
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,484
Anything worth doing
always is.

508
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:53,497
Well, finally an intellect
approximate to my own.

509
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,300
My imprisonment was starting
to get dreary, Professor.

510
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:59,336
I'm not here
to play mind games with you.

511
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,505
I'm here to ask you
if you remember a night

512
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,207
in October, 1975,

513
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,075
a place called
the Greyhill building.

514
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,511
That night,
you and your acolytes...

515
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,180
were celebrating
the acquisition

516
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:11,715
of your friend
Carter hall's body.

517
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,250
Yes.

518
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,386
It's my understanding
this ritual involved

519
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:18,322
you sharing your immortality
with your followers.

520
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:22,159
And you wish for me to do
the same for someone else.

521
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:25,362
Someone dear to you.

522
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:28,499
Your nuclear counterpart,
perhaps?

523
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,668
Yes.

524
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,672
And as impertinent
as this may sound,

525
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:37,007
I need your help.

526
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,876
Well, clearly, your friends

527
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:42,546
didn't give you
the full account of the ritual.

528
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:46,584
You see, it was Carter's blood
that worked the magic.

529
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,919
Perhaps you should talk to him.

530
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,387
Or better yet, Dr. Palmer.

531
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,623
I'm sure that he would be
more than happy

532
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,458
to help you spill some.

533
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,795
And I'm certain
you would enjoy that.

534
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:01,732
Pitting me and Raymond
against Carter, against Kendra.

535
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,801
Having all of us
at each other's throats

536
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:07,538
while being stranded
in the time stream.

537
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,375
But... We're not stranded.

538
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,245
Not entirely.

539
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,247
Thank you, Mr. Savage.

540
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:20,184
As I'd hoped, you've provided me
with a solution to my problem.

541
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,957
I don't get it, grey.

542
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,559
What's in here
that's gonna fix me?

543
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,394
Well, nothing
inside the jumpship, Jefferson,

544
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,162
but rather the craft itself.

545
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,098
You see, this ship
is pre-programmed

546
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,966
to return to 2016.

547
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,102
I've made
some additional adjustments

548
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:41,171
according to the theory
of quantum-retro causality,

549
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,440
and if my math is correct,

550
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:44,642
the trip
through the time stream

551
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,744
should reverse your condition.

552
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,646
No. No.

553
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,581
I'm not leaving you
or the team.

554
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,516
Which is why
I'm not giving you a choice.

555
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,453
What did you do?

556
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,957
I've administered
a mild sedative.

557
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,992
You roofied me again?

558
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,696
When I tricked you
onto this ship the first time,

559
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:08,465
I was only thinking of myself.

560
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,034
Now I'm thinking of you.

561
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,544
You can't do this!

562
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,780
If we're separated,
you'll die!

563
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,882
I've already lived my life,
Jefferson.

564
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:28,385
Now you must live yours.
Give my love to Clarissa.

565
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,787
Tell her I'm sorry.

566
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,289
She deserved
a proper good-bye.

567
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,961
Grey!
Grey, no!

568
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,028
No!

569
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,742
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hello.

570
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,144
I hope you don't mind,
but I thought I'd see

571
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,246
if I could interest you
in a lunch date.

572
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,748
Oh, my darling.
I'm right in the middle

573
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,385
of some research
that simply cannot wait.

574
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:02,920
What's the topic?

575
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,092
As a matter of fact,
time itself.

576
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,727
The irony.
Oh!

577
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,562
Damn, I completely forgot.

578
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:14,031
I promised I'd meet
with some fellow academics

579
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,866
to help resolve
an experiment of theirs.

580
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,234
Does this experiment

581
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,336
have anything to do
with time travel?

582
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,438
Almost certainly.

583
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,741
But it won't take long.

584
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:27,244
In fact, I'll be home
before you even know it.

585
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,886
Clarissa?

586
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,922
You... you know that I love you.

587
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,558
There's nothing I do
that isn't driven

588
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,061
by that very thought.

589
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,867
Now let's get the hell
out of here.

590
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,439
- What'd you do, Poindexter?
- What do you mean?

591
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,374
The jumpship.
Where is it?

592
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,743
Well, it's really
more a question of when.

593
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,545
But, oh, yes.

594
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:05,215
You both wanted
to return to 2016.

595
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,817
Got it in one.

596
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:10,054
I did what I had to do
to save Jefferson's life.

597
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,955
Now we must do
whatever's necessary

598
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,323
to repair the Waverider

599
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,659
and deliver Savage
to the vanishing point.

600
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,264
Oh, back so soon

601
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:23,634
with the stench of defeat
written all over you.

602
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:25,936
Can't say I didn't warn you.

603
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,639
Trying to get under my skin?
Is that it?

604
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:30,074
Got your little game
figured out.

605
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,742
For all your intelligence,

606
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,978
you still didn't manage
to make Chay-Ara yours.

607
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,248
I wouldn't expect a psychopath
like you to understand.

608
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,584
Kendra is free to do
what she wants.

609
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,587
You know what I see
when I look at you?

610
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:48,158
I see weakness
masquerading as goodness.

611
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,660
I'm not the one
trapped in a cage.

612
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:51,462
Well, if it weren't
for this cage,

613
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:55,666
you wouldn't have
that arrogant look on your face.

614
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:56,967
You think I'm afraid of you?

615
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,970
No.
I know you are.

616
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:01,939
At least Carter
had the courage

617
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,607
to face me like a man.

618
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,311
No wonder she didn't
choose you.

619
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:11,882
Oh...

620
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,022
You feel better now,
Dr. Palmer?

621
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,225
Not even close.

622
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,206
And I thought
you were nothing like me.

623
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:02,566
I'll leave you
to contemplate on that.

624
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,453
<i>Time drive reinitialization
complete, Captain.</i>

625
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,023
<i>The primary systems
are back online and stable.</i>

626
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,025
Begin ignition sequence
and resume our route

627
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,693
to the vanishing point.

628
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,228
You're a fool, Professor.

629
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,897
I'm trying to save
Jefferson's life.

630
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,232
Savage has escaped.

631
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:37,601
- What?
- I'm sorry.

632
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:38,802
Pull up all the surveillance
monitors, now!

633
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,270
<i>I'm afraid Vandal Savage</i>

634
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,705
<i>has already freed
Carter hall,</i>

635
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,140
<i>and is preparing
to disengage...</i>

636
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:45,809
That can't be good.

637
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,477
Gideon's entire
operational matrix is offline.

638
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,279
And without her help...

639
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,281
We'll have to make our
approach the old-fashioned way.

640
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,116
Shouldn't we be
more worried about Savage

641
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,651
and his brainwashed crony?

642
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,221
Yes. Which is why
I need you and Dr. Palmer

643
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:58,922
to go and recapture him.

644
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,757
In the meantime, if the rest
of us can't figure out

645
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,492
how to pilot the ship
without Gideon,

646
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,262
we're never gonna be able
to leave the time stream.

647
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:07,831
If we live through this,
you bumbling idiot,

648
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,334
I might just kill you.

649
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,570
Exactly how old-fashioned
are you talking?

650
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,506
So, if the time stream
is like this vast river,

651
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,742
these maps plot
the safest course

652
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:19,977
along that river's path.

653
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,478
Exactly.

654
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,248
I keep these here
just in case of emergency.

655
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,949
Well,
this certainly qualifies.

656
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,284
What's Jurgens Ridge?

657
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,620
Pray you need never find out.

658
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,655
Martin, you're gonna be
our engineer.

659
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,457
I need you to adjust
our energy output

660
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,659
to avoid over-taxing
the Waverider.

661
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:39,129
And you, miss Lance,
you're gonna be our navigator.

662
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,431
I was league of assassins,
not NASA.

663
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,866
I need someone
who can make tough calls

664
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:44,368
under extreme pressure.

665
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,838
No one fits that description
better than you.

666
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,842
Come to join the party?

667
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:55,112
You should've left me
back in 2166!

668
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,813
Yeah, yeah,
we know that, mullethead.

669
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,783
Who are you to stand up
against me,

670
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:02,953
Vandal Savage,
destroyer of empires?

671
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,589
Leonard Snart,
robber of ATMs!

672
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,126
We need more power
to the time drive, Martin.

673
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:10,227
How much further
can we push it?

674
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:13,030
25%,
and only for a brief burst.

675
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,152
But it might be all we need.

676
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,839
It's still two against four.

677
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,743
Come on!

678
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,178
Aah!

679
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,986
What's our trajectory
looking like, miss Lance?

680
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,554
Just give me a second here.

681
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,089
Well, oddly enough,
as the vanishing point

682
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,891
is at the very end of time.

683
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,359
Yeah, and we're never gonna
make it there if you don't

684
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:45,162
lower the ship
negative 12 degrees on my mark.

685
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:48,031
Three, two, one, now!

686
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,375
- Did it work?
- Well, we're not dead.

687
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,277
I got this.

688
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,545
Handle Savage.

689
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:10,454
Haircut! Move your fat head
so I can get a clean shot!

690
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,629
They seem to be
getting closer.

691
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,531
- I'll go help them.
- No! I'm not gonna place

692
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:22,933
another one of you
in jeopardy... I'll go.

693
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:25,102
But who's
gonna pilot the ship?

694
00:33:56,769 --> 00:34:00,404
Gareeb, I was wondering
where you were hiding.

695
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:02,606
Aah!

696
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,809
Bring her to me.

697
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,815
Chay-Ara, my love.

698
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,784
I'm sorry that it has to end
like this again.

699
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:18,522
- Carter.
- Aah!

700
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:22,993
<i>I will wait for eternity.</i>

701
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,428
Come back to me.

702
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,882
Aah!

703
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,220
Kendra...

704
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,627
Aah!

705
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:08,305
He's alive.

706
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,975
You saved him.

707
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,413
You saved us all.

708
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,225
Is that...?

709
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,594
Welcome
to the vanishing point.

710
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,062
I can't believe we made it.

711
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,766
And what did you do
to your shoulder?

712
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,602
Hmm? Oh, I might have jumped
in front of a laser blast

713
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:41,505
intended for miss Saunders.

714
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:44,040
What?
I couldn't have my team thinking

715
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,276
I cared more about myself
than them, now, could I?

716
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,544
Really?

717
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,714
Uh, I think I just
lost control of the ship.

718
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:52,215
Yeah, that might have
something to do

719
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,683
with us being
the most wanted time criminals

720
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,418
in all of history.

721
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,358
<i>Timeship Waverider,</i>

722
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,860
<i>we've taken control
of your guidance systems.</i>

723
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,129
<i>Disable your weapons
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

724
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,764
Oh, it's good to be home.

725
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,466
<i>Captain Hunter.</i>

726
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,201
<i>This is unexpected.</i>

727
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,203
Well, I have a reputation
to maintain, don't I?

728
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,272
And I hereby request
an immediate assembly

729
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,540
of the time council
in accordance

730
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,375
with general order 52.

731
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,377
<i>So you've returned
to answer for your crimes?</i>

732
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,812
No. I'm here to justify them.

733
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,583
If this truly is good-bye,

734
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:29,252
would you mind answering
just one final question?

735
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,221
Well,
it seems only sporting.

736
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:34,391
How did you manage to escape
my prison all those years ago?

737
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:37,227
There were no signs of damage,

738
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,329
no clues to your tricks.

739
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,966
It left me puzzled
for centuries.

740
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,468
The best magic tricks
have the simplest solutions.

741
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,071
I bribed your guard
with a novelty pen.

742
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,439
Had a picture
of a woman on it.

743
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,074
Turn it upside down,
her top comes off.

744
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:54,010
I won it from a drunk GI
in a Philippines bar in 1944.

745
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,146
It's a tacky souvenir,

746
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:59,749
but in this case,
a lifesaver.

747
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,985
Now, unfortunate for you,

748
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,486
the guards
at the vanishing point

749
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:06,022
won't be quite so easily swayed.

750
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,163
- Hey.
- Hey.

751
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:16,600
Uh, I was making sure
that he was okay.

752
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,836
I think most guys would be

753
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,106
more inclined
to smother him with a pillow.

754
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:27,544
Just because he stole my girl
and tried to take over the ship?

755
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:31,514
But seriously,
Carter saved your life.

756
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,651
He's a part of this team.
Always has been.

757
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,553
I wish things
could be different.

758
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:38,722
Yeah, me too.

759
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,924
I need you to know
that what we had was real.

760
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,563
In a way,

761
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:50,300
a broken heart is
just what the doctor ordered.

762
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,869
- It is?
- Yeah.

763
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:56,673
When I lost Anna,
I thought that...

764
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:58,375
I could never find anybody
who I could spend

765
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:01,177
the rest of my life with.

766
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,979
You proved me wrong.

767
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:07,146
Thank you for showing me
that it's possible.

768
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,096
Rip Hunter,

769
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:22,197
on behalf of the time council,
you are hereby ordered...

770
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,566
Yeah, before you do that,
there's someone

771
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,435
I'd like you to meet.

772
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:29,939
You remember Mr. Savage?

773
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,178
Of course.

774
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,047
And we remember how you pled

775
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:41,084
for us to remove him
from the timeline once before.

776
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,687
Well, as the first Time Master
was so fond of saying,

777
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:46,289
that was then, this is now.

778
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,459
Incontrovertible proof
that Vandal Savage

779
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:52,128
has been engaged
in the manipulation of time!

780
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,364
Including a confession.

781
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,633
<i>When I saw you again
in 1975,</i>

782
00:38:56,635 --> 00:39:00,203
<i>I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.</i>

783
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,305
<i>You showed a caveman fire,</i>

784
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,574
<i>and I had almost 200 years</i>

785
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,143
<i>to figure out how
to strike the flame.</i>

786
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,648
Impressive, Captain Hunter.

787
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,283
You and your team
have accomplished

788
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:14,784
what none of us here

789
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,620
in the time council
believed you would.

790
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,489
If the prisoner
would step forward...

791
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:28,098
Vandal Savage,
by the power of this chamber,

792
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,836
it is my duty to return you
to earth immediately.

793
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,172
What?

794
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,807
This man you've brought
before us

795
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:41,444
is needed back in 2166.

796
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,279
You're in league with him.

797
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:46,182
I wouldn't expect you
to understand our reasons.

798
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,618
For all your wisdom,
you were never able to take

799
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,087
the long view of history.

800
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,122
Take him away.

801
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,326
Search their ship
for the others.

802
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:07,837
- Did you hear that?
- Don't try to distract me.

803
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,648
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

804
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,784
Why do we need
to find somewhere to hide?

805
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:22,685
Alexa.

806
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,498
Damn.

807
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,134
Ah, if you're here for Savage,

808
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,803
you're too late.

809
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:42,071
- Mick, what's going on?
- You're under arrest.

810
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:45,408
Oh.

811
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,211
If I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

812
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,250
Druce's men
have taken your ship.

813
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,186
Your friends are under arrest.

814
00:40:56,188 --> 00:41:00,657
And you are once again
my prisoner.

815
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,493
This time,
I don't plan to lose you.

816
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:08,832
Oh, and yes, I do remember
the guard very well.

817
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,234
He died.

818
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,669
Now, if you would excuse me,

819
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:16,706
I'd better be getting back
to 2166.

820
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:21,344
I've been waiting so very long
to meet your family.

821
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,612
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

822
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:27,050
No! No!

823
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,952
No!

824
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,843
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
