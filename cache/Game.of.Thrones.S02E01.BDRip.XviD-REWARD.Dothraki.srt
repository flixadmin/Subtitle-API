1
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,677
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.

2
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,181
You will ride east, you southeast,
and you northeast.

3
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,559
What do we seek, Khaleesi?

4
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:05,774
Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people.
Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.

5
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,446
Find how far the Red Waste extends
before us, and what lies on the other side.

6
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,796
You are my last hope, blood of my blood.

7
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,383
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.
