1
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,016
She looks at me every day.

2
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,977
Mary Jane Watson.

3
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,189
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

4
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,149
But she can never know.

5
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,778
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

6
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,239
A life she can never be a part of.

7
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,699
Who am I?

8
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,451
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

9
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,621
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

10
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,373
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,792
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,880
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,966
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,427
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,388
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,851
Harmattan, Burton &amp; Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,146
I told you,
I don't understand that language.

18
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,231
-Speak English.
-You can't make pizza.

19
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,275
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.

20
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,236
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

21
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,323
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

22
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,159
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

23
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,495
-Why didn't you send Saleem?
-Saleem was deported yesterday.

24
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,664
-Look-- Smiley.
-What about my cheese pizza?

25
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,834
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

26
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,172
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

27
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,382
This is your last chance.

28
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,304
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

29
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,849
Go!

30
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,540
Hey, what, are you stupid?

31
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,731
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

32
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,033
I'm gonna get it!

33
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,968
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

34
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,428
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

35
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,388
See you.

36
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,724
Way to go, Spidey!

37
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,837
Pizza time.

38
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,176
You're late.

39
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,470
I'm not paying for those.

40
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,199
Elevator.

41
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:49,553
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

42
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,224
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

43
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,351
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

44
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,021
-You're fired. Go.
-Please, I need this job.

45
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,732
-You're fired.
-Look, give me another chance.

46
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,242
You're fired.

47
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,578
-Parker, hello. You're fired.
-Why?

48
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,246
Dogs catching Frisbees?

49
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,749
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

50
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,125
-Boss.
-Not now.

51
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,045
The Buglecould show another side
of New York for a change.

52
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:26,131
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

53
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,718
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you-- Still not now!

54
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,471
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

55
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,389
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

56
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,140
You turned the whole city
against him.

57
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,808
A fact I'm very proud of.

58
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,772
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

59
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,275
-It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
-Thanks for the good news.

60
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,779
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

61
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,990
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

62
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,867
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

63
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,745
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

64
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,789
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

65
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,291
-Some food got poisoned?
-I'm a little nauseous.

66
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,293
All right, Mr. Jameson.

67
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,172
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

68
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,966
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

69
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,717
I told you, he's not a menace.

70
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,469
-I told you--
-I'll take care of it.

71
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,304
-I'll give you 150.
-Three hundred.

72
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,973
That's outrageous.

73
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,100
Done. Give this to the girl.

74
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,476
Thank you. Bye-bye.

75
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,436
Hi.

76
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,105
Hey, Pete.

77
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,903
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

78
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,197
-Right.
-Sorry.

79
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,658
Hey.

80
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,702
Chin up, okay?

81
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,300
Watch it, jerk!

82
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,937
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

83
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,647
Where were you headed, Parker?

84
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,107
To your class.

85
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,109
My class is over.

86
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,486
See me standing here?

87
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,449
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

88
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,950
Then be here.

89
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,786
Look at you, Peter.

90
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:24,666
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

91
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,711
You always appear exhausted.

92
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,215
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

93
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,551
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

94
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,888
Planning is not a major
at this university.

95
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,227
Octavius is a friend of mine.

96
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,562
Better do your research, Parker.

97
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:49,066
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

98
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,589
Surprise!

99
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,675
Well, say something.

100
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,093
What's the occasion?

101
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,846
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

102
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,182
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

103
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,853
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

104
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,938
-Hi, M.J.
-Hi.

105
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,815
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

106
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,233
Long time, no see.

107
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,279
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

108
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,114
It's going fine. It's going good.

109
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,574
She's brilliant in it.

110
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,409
Harry sent me roses.

111
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,120
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

112
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,456
I've been busy.

113
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,210
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

114
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,337
The less you see of that man,
the better.

115
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,966
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

116
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,426
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

117
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,720
So how are things going at Oscorp?

118
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,764
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

119
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,142
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

120
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,438
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

121
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,898
Thank you.

122
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:15,068
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

123
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,654
-I'm writing a paper on him.
-You want to meet him?

124
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,114
You'd introduce me?

125
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,492
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

126
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,661
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

127
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,788
M.J., could you give me a hand?

128
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,751
She's waiting for you, pal.

129
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,669
What do you mean?

130
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,339
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

131
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,216
However you want to look at it.

132
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,760
I don't have time for girls right now.

133
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,261
Why, are you dead?

134
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,013
I've been kind of busy.

135
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,806
Taking pictures of your friend?

136
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,809
Could we get off that subject?

137
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,313
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

138
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,148
Then be honest with me.

139
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,276
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

140
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,450
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?

141
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,536
I want this guy dead.

142
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,539
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.

143
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,508
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.

144
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,720
You're my buddy, you know that.

145
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,015
You're family, Pete.

146
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,270
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.

147
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,069
Thank you, Harry.

148
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,396
May.

149
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,106
Oh, what, Ben?

150
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,401
Wait.

151
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,028
-Aunt May.
-Oh, my.

152
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:26,658
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

153
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,787
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

154
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,915
Did they have a good time?

155
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,666
I'm sure they did.

156
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,339
-You okay?
-Of course. But you go home.

157
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:46,136
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

158
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,096
I'm worried about you.

159
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:53,477
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

160
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,104
Oh, my. You did?

161
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,940
Oh, well.

162
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,525
So?

163
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,777
I'm a little behind.

164
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,488
Everybody is.

165
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,158
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

166
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:12,037
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

167
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,333
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

168
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,335
You need it more than I do.

169
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,004
-No, I can't take that from you.
-Yes, you can!

170
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,215
You can take this money from me.

171
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,134
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

172
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,804
And don't you dare leave it here.

173
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,889
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,644
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

175
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:42,693
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

176
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,239
I think to myself at times...

177
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:52,703
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd....

178
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,789
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

179
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,922
Now...

180
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,552
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

181
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,818
Hey.

182
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,070
Hey. You're still here.

183
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,823
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

184
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,368
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

185
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,497
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

186
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,082
The photographer liked my face.

187
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,085
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.

188
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,756
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.

189
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,925
Your dream came true.

190
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,260
How about yours?

191
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,390
I'm fine.

192
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,811
I wish you'd come see the play.

193
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,189
You're the one who
always encouraged me.

194
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,942
I plan to.

195
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,281
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

196
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,286
Oh, boy, yeah.

197
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,873
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

198
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,046
Nothing.

199
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,261
Do you want to say something?

200
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,852
I...

201
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,067
...was...

202
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,321
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

203
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,499
You're such a mystery.

204
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,553
Peter.

205
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,514
What?

206
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,188
Happy birthday.

207
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,032
I'm seeing somebody now.

208
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,161
-Therapy.
-No.

209
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,121
A person, a man.

210
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,665
You mean, like a boyfriend?

211
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,502
Well, like I like him.

212
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,048
What?

213
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,425
Nothing.

214
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,554
That's good, you know?
Companionship....

215
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,891
May be more than that.

216
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,560
More?

217
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,729
I don't know.

218
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,316
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

219
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,322
-You're coming?
-I'll be there.

220
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,991
Don't disappoint me.

221
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,078
I won't.

222
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,844
Rent.

223
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,350
-Hi.
-Hi. What's "hi"?

224
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,060
Can I spend it?

225
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,688
I have a paycheck due this week
and--

226
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:51,191
-You're a month late again. Again.
-I promise as soon as--

227
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,862
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

228
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:59,950
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

229
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,202
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

230
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:07,207
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

231
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,795
-Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
-Hi, Pete.

232
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,226
Hello?

233
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,318
Rent?

234
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,784
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

235
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,955
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

236
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,748
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

237
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,708
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

238
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,126
Who do we have here?

239
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,045
This is my good friend
I called you about.

240
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,880
He got me through
high-school science.

241
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:40,092
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for--

242
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,718
I know what you're doing here...

243
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,054
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

244
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,890
But Oscorp pays the bills, so....

245
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,393
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

246
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,896
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

247
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:57,693
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

248
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,905
Interesting fellow, your friend.

249
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,241
I won't take much of your time.

250
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:08,745
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

251
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,623
He also tells me you're lazy.

252
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:13,876
I'm trying to do better.

253
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,629
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

254
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,133
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

255
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,302
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

256
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,013
Otto, your lunch is ready.

257
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,931
-This is my wife, Rosie.
-Hello.

258
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:31,602
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.

259
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,855
I always fell asleep in physics class.

260
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,858
-Nice to meet you, Peter.
-Good to meet you.

261
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,943
Excuse me.

262
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,322
Is that it?

263
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:47,367
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

264
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,621
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

265
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,122
Sympathetic frequencies.

266
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,333
Harmonic reinforcement?

267
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,418
Go on.

268
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,506
An exponential increase
in energy output.

269
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,341
A huge amount of energy.

270
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:06,678
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

271
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:10,015
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.

272
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,226
It is amazing, and it will work.

273
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,938
Are you sure you could stabilise
the fusion reaction?

274
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,775
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

275
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,818
This is my life's work.

276
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,155
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

277
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,574
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

278
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:31,161
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

279
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,121
You can sleep soundly tonight.

280
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,998
Otto's done his homework.

281
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,293
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

282
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,963
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

283
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,340
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

284
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,884
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

285
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,387
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

286
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:52,015
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

287
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,518
Rosie, I love this boy.

288
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:58,480
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

289
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,108
Well....

290
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,610
I don't really know.

291
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,864
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

292
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:10,075
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

293
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,286
Love should never be a secret.

294
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,706
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

295
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,958
...gonna make you sick.

296
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,544
I finally got lucky in love.

297
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,045
We both did.

298
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:25,883
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

299
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,761
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

300
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,223
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

301
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,560
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

302
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:39,062
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

303
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:43,025
Time present and time past

304
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:45,235
-Are both perhaps present
-Perhaps present

305
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,696
-In time future
-In time future

306
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,781
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

307
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,200
-Yes, you do.
-I'm serious.

308
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:54,912
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

309
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:59,416
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

310
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,418
Poetry.

311
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,546
Never fails.

312
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:11,970
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

313
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,515
Brightest green were all her garments

314
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,059
And her hair was like the sunshine

315
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,103
Day by day he gazed upon her

316
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,996
Rent!

317
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:22,583
Where is my money?!

318
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,527
You seem jittery tonight.

319
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,362
You never know who's coming.

320
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,797
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

321
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,316
How'd you do that?

322
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,696
Work out, plenty of rest.

323
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,657
You know, eat your green vegetables.

324
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:41,078
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

325
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,249
Come on. Go.

326
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,586
Keep it steady.

327
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,610
It's a web.

328
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,446
Go, Spidey, go!

329
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:25,789
We got trouble!

330
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,351
Get me down!

331
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,482
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

332
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,944
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

333
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,238
Then you think we should
forgive them?

334
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,784
Yes.

335
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,786
I mean, no.

336
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:13,337
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

337
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,339
Whatever.

338
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,551
Shoelace.

339
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,682
You might want to....

340
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:35,234
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, I've come to see the show.

341
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,279
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

342
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,699
It helps maintain the illusion.

343
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,453
I understand.

344
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:50,874
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

345
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,543
But not to come late.

346
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:58,423
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the--

347
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,726
Listen, can't you--?

348
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:27,244
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man

349
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,414
A-does whatever a spider can

350
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,584
A-spins a web, any size

351
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,128
Catches thieves a-just like flies

352
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:39,548
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

353
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,941
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

354
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,484
Yeah, I'm sure.

355
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,570
-Okay. Call me.
-I will.

356
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,447
-You were great tonight.
-Thanks.

357
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,535
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

358
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,163
What are you doing here?

359
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,554
You hungry?

360
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:28,972
Starved.

361
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,525
What was that?

362
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,739
Okay.

363
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,068
How you doing?

364
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,154
Good.

365
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:13,243
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.

366
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:16,246
-Think it's great.
-Thanks.

367
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,584
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols &amp; Knudsen...

368
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,419
...PR firm in the building...

369
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,422
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.

370
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,425
It's really put together.
The costume. The...this thing.

371
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,762
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.

372
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,141
I think you could do more
than print though.

373
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:39,061
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?

374
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:41,396
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?

375
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:44,316
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?

376
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:47,236
How about a children's book?
You could--

377
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,239
Like Charlotte's Web,
but without the pig. That kind of thing.

378
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,783
How about a line of hammocks?

379
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,285
Because it's kind of a web thing.

380
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:59,873
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.

381
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,668
Let me give you a card.

382
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:05,629
I don't have any pockets.

383
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,256
Yeah.

384
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,135
Well, we're right in the building.

385
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,190
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.

386
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:28,068
-Slow elevator.
-Yeah.

387
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:53,135
Thus, the second-order term...

388
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:56,013
...in the expansion of
the exact order...

389
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,516
...is identical to the second order...

390
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:03,187
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.

391
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:06,440
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy....

392
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,549
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

393
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,676
Hi, M.J.

394
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,136
This is Peter.

395
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,723
I was on my way to your show and....

396
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:44,478
Well, I was on my bike....

397
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,024
Are you there?

398
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:54,530
I really was planning on it all day.

399
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:57,366
And...

400
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,078
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

401
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,080
Bingo.

402
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:05,749
It's amazing, isn't it?

403
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,545
How complicated a simple thing...

404
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:14,842
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

405
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:22,599
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

406
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:26,395
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

407
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,105
Your time has expired.

408
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:32,526
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

409
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,288
I wanna tell you the truth.

410
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:47,875
Here it is.

411
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,544
I'm Spider-Man.

412
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:53,088
Weird, huh?

413
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,259
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

414
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:03,056
If my enemies found out about you...

415
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,146
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

416
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:17,988
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

417
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:30,792
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:34,796
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

419
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,632
But first, before we start...

420
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:41,178
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

421
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:43,096
Because we found the rubber band.

422
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,186
It's a terrible joke.

423
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,104
But thank you for coming.

424
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,689
Today...

425
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:57,361
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

426
00:37:57,694 --> 00:38:02,866
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

427
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:07,496
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

428
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,173
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

429
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,802
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

430
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,513
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

431
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:13,937
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

432
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:17,357
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

433
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:21,612
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

434
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,615
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

435
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,242
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

436
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,203
...is as advanced as you suggest...

437
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,413
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

438
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,831
How right you are.

439
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,083
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

440
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,628
...to protect
my higher brain function.

441
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:42,132
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

442
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,885
And now on to the main event.

443
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,970
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

444
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:10,410
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

445
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,705
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

446
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:18,627
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

447
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:20,504
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

448
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:35,853
Ladies and gentlemen...

449
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:40,357
...fasten your seat belts.

450
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,712
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

451
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:09,845
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

452
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,221
Thank you.

453
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:13,348
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

454
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,858
The power of the sun...

455
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,611
...in the palm of my hand.

456
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,801
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

457
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:51,803
It'll soon stabilise!

458
00:41:57,476 --> 00:42:00,395
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

459
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:07,402
We have a containment breach!

460
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:12,241
Otto, please get back!

461
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,078
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

462
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:19,081
It will stabilise! It's under control!

463
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:21,124
I'm in charge here!

464
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,127
It's my money! I'm in con--

465
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,800
This doesn't change anything.

466
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,472
-What are you doing?
-Pulling the plug.

467
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,140
No!

468
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,661
Rosie!

469
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,526
Watch it.

470
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:30,903
That was too close.

471
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:35,157
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

472
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:41,955
I'm ruined.

473
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:46,126
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

474
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:47,961
He saved your life, sir.

475
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,797
He humiliated me by touching me.

476
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:53,550
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

477
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:55,636
What was he doing here anyway?

478
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:14,488
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

479
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:16,782
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

480
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:19,535
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

481
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,870
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

482
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,998
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

483
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:27,543
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

484
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:30,963
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

485
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:32,548
We're ready, doctor.

486
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:37,678
Anybody here take shop class?

487
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,260
No! No! No!

488
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:23,640
Help me! Help me!

489
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:40,300
No!

490
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:34,730
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumours.

491
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:37,065
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

492
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:40,027
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

493
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:43,197
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

494
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:48,327
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

495
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:49,745
Hoffman!

496
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,248
What are we gonna call this guy?

497
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:55,626
-"Dr. Octopus."
-That's crap.

498
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,377
-"Science Squid"?
-Crap!

499
00:47:57,961 --> 00:47:59,630
-"Dr. Strange."
-That's pretty good.

500
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:04,635
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

501
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:07,137
-I like it.
-Of course you do.

502
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:11,099
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

503
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:13,185
-Genius.
-What, are you looking for a raise?

504
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:15,020
Get out.

505
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:16,980
Chief, I found Parker.

506
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,358
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

507
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:21,860
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

508
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:23,320
I heard Spider-Man was there.

509
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:27,115
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

510
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:28,617
Chief, the planetarium party.

511
00:48:28,784 --> 00:48:30,452
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

512
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:32,162
What do you know
about high society?

513
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:34,665
-Oh. Well, I--
-Don't answer that.

514
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:38,252
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

515
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:41,380
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

516
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:43,340
Could you pay me in advance?

517
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,852
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

518
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:57,646
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

519
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,454
My Rosie's dead.

520
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,375
My dream is dead.

521
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:23,380
And these...

522
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:28,886
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

523
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:33,098
...along with me.

524
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:43,692
Something...

525
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:46,653
...in my head.

526
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:51,909
Something talking.

527
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:57,414
The inhibitor chip!

528
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,377
Gone.

529
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,425
Rebuild.

530
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:13,514
No.

531
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,141
Peter was right.

532
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,103
I miscalculated.

533
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:28,737
I couldn't have miscalculated.

534
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:31,782
It was working, wasn't it?

535
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:38,080
Yes.

536
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:42,125
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

537
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,586
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

538
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:47,297
But we need money.

539
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,384
Steal it?

540
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:52,302
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

541
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:56,306
That's right.

542
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:01,478
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

543
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:06,733
We'll do it here.

544
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:10,779
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

545
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,574
Nothing will stand in our way.

546
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,075
Nothing!

547
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:23,166
-That's the social security.
-Yes, I see.

548
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,085
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

549
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:27,504
Yes, but I'm afraid...

550
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:30,757
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

551
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:34,553
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

552
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,096
You are?

553
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:44,396
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

554
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:47,191
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

555
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:48,609
But the fact is...

556
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:53,113
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

557
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:55,324
Well....

558
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:58,911
At least we get the toaster.

559
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:03,123
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

560
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,294
Oh, yes, I see.

561
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:10,380
Okay.

562
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:15,552
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

563
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:34,238
Peter?

564
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:38,033
Don't leave me.

565
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:41,245
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

566
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:42,996
Hold it!

567
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:46,416
Put your arms up! All of them!

568
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,108
Here's your change!

569
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:22,536
Oh, no. Come on!

570
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:38,135
-You're getting on my nerves.
-I have a knack for that.

571
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,928
Not anymore.

572
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,460
-Freeze! Don't move!
-Freeze!

573
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,216
-Hold your fire!
-Don't follow me.

574
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:22,888
Wait a second.

575
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:42,866
-Hand her over.
-Of course.

576
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:44,910
Easy, now.

577
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,330
Butterfingers.

578
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:01,885
Look out!

579
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:06,014
Help me!

580
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,727
-Help me!
-I'm coming!

581
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:17,860
Hang on!

582
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,018
Help!

583
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,794
Thank you.

584
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:22,382
Aunt May.

585
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:25,552
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

586
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:28,764
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

587
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:35,938
Come on.

588
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,027
Shame on you.

589
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:15,978
There you go.

590
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:20,274
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

591
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,692
We sure showed him.

592
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,694
What do you mean, "we"?

593
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:30,200
-Take me with you, Spider-Man.
-Take me.

594
00:57:57,728 --> 00:58:00,397
-May I?
-Sure. Go ahead.

595
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:03,275
Penny! Over here!

596
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:10,199
Leave it.

597
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:16,747
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

598
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:18,248
Why? It's a party.

599
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:21,335
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

600
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:24,838
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

601
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:26,882
Not to mention your friend the bug.

602
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:28,675
Not tonight, Harry.

603
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:32,387
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24/7.

604
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:34,264
Parker!

605
00:58:34,932 --> 00:58:36,183
Parker!

606
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:39,770
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

607
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:41,939
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

608
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:44,066
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

609
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:45,776
Beautiful tie.

610
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:48,195
Get a shot of us with the DA.

611
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,113
Beautiful dress.

612
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:53,283
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

613
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,203
Wife.

614
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:00,457
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

615
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:03,710
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

616
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,088
...is pleased to present
our guest of honour.

617
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:10,008
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

618
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:14,304
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

619
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:16,306
...Captain John Jameson.

620
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:02,519
Hi.

621
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:08,192
-You.
-Listen, I'm sorry.

622
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:10,611
But there was a disturbance.

623
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:12,070
I don't know you.

624
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:17,951
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

625
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,537
I've been reading poetry lately.

626
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:22,039
Whatever that means.

627
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:26,043
Day by day he gazed upon her

628
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:29,338
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day--

629
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:31,381
Don't start.

630
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:34,635
Can I get you a drink?

631
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:36,553
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

632
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:38,847
John.

633
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:42,893
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

634
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:46,063
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

635
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,732
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

636
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:50,108
Even my father.

637
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,071
He came backstage to borrow cash.

638
01:00:55,697 --> 01:01:00,077
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

639
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:02,412
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

640
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,666
After all these years...

641
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:09,586
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

642
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:38,448
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

643
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:41,869
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

644
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:44,121
-Take it easy.
-Don't push me.

645
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,081
Don't act like you're my friend.

646
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:48,792
You stole M.J. from me.

647
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:51,128
You stole my father's love.

648
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:56,800
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

649
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,262
Huh? Isn't that right?

650
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:02,222
Huh, brother?

651
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:15,944
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

652
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:21,116
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

653
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:33,086
What a surprise.

654
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:36,173
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

655
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:05,577
Oh, no. No!

656
01:03:16,588 --> 01:03:18,757
Why is this happening to me?

657
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:44,635
You told him yes? Just that fast?

658
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:46,261
It felt right.

659
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:49,139
Well, you might congratulate me.

660
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:51,225
Congratulations.

661
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:53,477
Good luck in the world.

662
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:56,647
John loves me.

663
01:04:56,813 --> 01:05:00,526
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.

664
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,319
No man will ever want you."

665
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:04,821
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...

666
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:08,200
...trying to prove something
to your father?

667
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:10,410
Do you really love this guy?

668
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:13,705
-Very much.
-"Very much"?

669
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:15,374
That just doesn't fly.

670
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:18,001
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:

671
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:20,045
"Do I love him? I adore him.

672
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:22,714
He's my comfortable afghan.

673
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:25,092
He's all I can think about.

674
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:29,346
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...

675
01:05:29,513 --> 01:05:34,601
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.

676
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:38,856
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...

677
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:42,025
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."

678
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:44,945
That's the answer I need.

679
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:47,948
Not just "I love him very much."

680
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:52,452
You read too many love stories.

681
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,913
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?

682
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,583
-The guy you believed in?
-That was a fantasy.

683
01:05:57,749 --> 01:05:59,126
That's all he is.

684
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:01,795
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?

685
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:14,308
You seem very okay to me.

686
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,393
My diagnosis?

687
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:18,353
It's up here.

688
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:25,068
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

689
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:28,989
There is one dream where...

690
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:30,908
...in my dream...

691
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,410
...I'm Spider-Man.

692
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:38,415
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

693
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,587
So you're Spider-Man.

694
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:44,963
In my dream.

695
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,551
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

696
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:51,845
So it's somebody else's dream.

697
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:56,934
-What's your major? Theatre Arts?
-Science.

698
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,352
Connors?

699
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,103
He flunking you?

700
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,772
He says he might.

701
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:03,857
There you go.

702
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:14,451
What about this friend?

703
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:18,455
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

704
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:22,918
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

705
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:27,297
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

706
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:29,258
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

707
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:33,095
I've been there. Who was I?

708
01:07:35,806 --> 01:07:38,392
Identity. Big one.

709
01:07:39,518 --> 01:07:41,854
Me, I go to my shrink.

710
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,481
What does he tell you?

711
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:49,319
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.

712
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:54,074
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...

713
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:59,997
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me....

714
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:04,001
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.

715
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,671
Listen...

716
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:12,092
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

717
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:14,219
That's why you keep falling.

718
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,640
You always have a choice, Peter.

719
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,560
I have a choice.

720
01:08:31,694 --> 01:08:34,698
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

721
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,201
...make me sad.

722
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:40,662
Can't you understand?

723
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:43,540
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

724
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:46,710
You know I understand.

725
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:51,465
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.

726
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:55,886
Oh, you don't know how it feels.

727
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:01,058
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

728
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:05,229
...fairness, justice....

729
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:10,274
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

730
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:14,404
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

731
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:18,075
I can't live your dreams anymore.

732
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:21,078
I want a life of my own.

733
01:09:21,245 --> 01:09:23,372
You've been given a gift, Peter.

734
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:27,917
With great power
comes great responsibility.

735
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:34,174
Take my hand, son.

736
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:49,106
No, Uncle Ben.

737
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:53,443
I'm just Peter Parker.

738
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:56,947
I'm Spider-Man...

739
01:09:57,781 --> 01:09:59,408
...no more.

740
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:01,910
No more.

741
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:11,628
No more.

742
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:42,886
-You punk!
-Sorry.

743
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,347
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

744
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:54,022
Hurry up!

745
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:07,494
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

746
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:09,538
Someone, please?

747
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:13,876
.23 electron volts.

748
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:22,009
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

749
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:35,522
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

750
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:38,525
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

751
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,652
...in a very inexcusable manner.

752
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:42,988
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

753
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:46,366
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

754
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:48,285
That would be hypocrisy.

755
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:51,747
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

756
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,046
"I am glad."

757
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,798
"I am glad."

758
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:03,926
"I am glad."

759
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:07,971
Are you glad to hear it?

760
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,476
I am glad...

761
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:14,102
...to hear it.

762
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:15,979
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

763
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:19,816
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

764
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:24,696
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

765
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:26,907
You could've told me
you were coming.

766
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:29,409
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

767
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:34,831
You look different.

768
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:40,504
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

769
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:42,506
I do my homework now.

770
01:13:44,675 --> 01:13:46,510
You wanna get some chow mein?

771
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,053
Peter...

772
01:13:48,512 --> 01:13:50,097
...I'm getting married.

773
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:57,855
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

774
01:13:58,188 --> 01:13:59,857
And who's the groom?

775
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,900
You hadn't decided yet.

776
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:06,446
You think just because
you saw my play...

777
01:14:06,613 --> 01:14:09,032
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

778
01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:12,494
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

779
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:16,164
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

780
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:18,208
You're too late.

781
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:20,669
Will you think about it?

782
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,171
Think about what?

783
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,339
Picking up where we left off.

784
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:25,841
Where was that?

785
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:28,510
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

786
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,053
I don't think it's that simple.

787
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,514
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

788
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:34,308
You don't understand.

789
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:37,227
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

790
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:39,229
I'm different.

791
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:41,815
Punch me, I bleed.

792
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:50,574
I have to go.

793
01:14:57,664 --> 01:14:59,917
I'm getting married in a church.

794
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:09,218
You are different.

795
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:27,277
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

796
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:30,572
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

797
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:33,784
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

798
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:37,120
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

799
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:40,958
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

800
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,337
Where the hell did you get that?

801
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:47,047
In the garbage.

802
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:48,632
In the garbage?

803
01:15:50,634 --> 01:15:52,302
He must've given up.

804
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,474
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

805
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:01,436
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

806
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:06,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

807
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:09,653
-Give you 50 bucks.
-I could get more than that on eBay.

808
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:12,906
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

809
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:15,659
Your wife is still on that line.

810
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:18,829
Flowers? How much?

811
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:22,666
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

812
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,084
Get plastic.

813
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,837
Gotta go, big story.

814
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:41,185
Spider-Man
Spider-Man

815
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:44,354
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

816
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:47,941
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

817
01:17:19,723 --> 01:17:22,059
Come on, man. Get the money.

818
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:25,562
Come on, come on.

819
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,441
Help!

820
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:34,613
Come on!

821
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:43,413
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

822
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,749
He was a peaceful man.

823
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:50,045
And it was all my doing.

824
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:26,290
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

825
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:28,500
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

826
01:18:28,876 --> 01:18:32,087
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

827
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,423
...and he wanted to drive you.

828
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:37,301
If only I had stopped him.

829
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:40,929
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

830
01:18:56,653 --> 01:18:58,197
I'm responsible.

831
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:03,368
For what?

832
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,580
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

833
01:19:06,747 --> 01:19:08,999
But you were at the library.

834
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:11,168
You were doing your homework.

835
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:14,463
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

836
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:16,924
What do you mean?

837
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,343
I went someplace else.

838
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:22,513
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

839
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,433
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

840
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,603
...to impress Mary Jane.

841
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,774
It happened so fast.

842
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,779
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

843
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,698
The thief...

844
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:44,701
...was running towards me.

845
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:49,081
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

846
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:51,375
...revenge.

847
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:54,878
I let him go.

848
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:59,716
I let him get away.

849
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:07,391
He wanted a car.

850
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,810
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

851
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:14,314
Uncle Ben said no...

852
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:17,985
...and then he shot him.

853
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:25,242
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

854
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:29,955
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

855
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,418
And I....

856
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,923
I held his hand...

857
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:42,092
...when he died.

858
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,644
I've tried to tell you so many times.

859
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:51,328
Just one more little chore.

860
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:00,337
Where are you?

861
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:06,385
-I'm leaving for the night, sir.
-Fine.

862
01:22:06,552 --> 01:22:09,304
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

863
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:11,056
Good night, Bernard.

864
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:05,694
Hello, Harry.

865
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:08,071
Otto. What do you want?

866
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:10,240
That precious tritium.

867
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:12,826
But I need more of it this time.

868
01:23:14,578 --> 01:23:18,582
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

869
01:23:22,461 --> 01:23:24,505
Hey! Hey!

870
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:27,674
Stop! Stop! All right!

871
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:31,845
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

872
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:44,942
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

873
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:49,696
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

874
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:51,114
How do I find him?

875
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:54,117
-Peter Parker.
-Parker?

876
01:23:54,284 --> 01:23:56,537
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

877
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:58,205
Make him tell you where he is.

878
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:05,295
Have it ready.

879
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:10,717
Don't hurt Peter!

880
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:26,358
Somebody, help!

881
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:28,902
Fire!

882
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:40,080
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

883
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:44,084
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

884
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:47,171
-Help!
-Is anybody in that building?

885
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:49,923
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

886
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:51,842
Hey, where you going?!

887
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,406
I'm coming!

888
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:41,808
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

889
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:44,394
Come on. Come on.

890
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:46,623
Mama.

891
01:26:58,635 --> 01:27:00,220
You got some guts, kid.

892
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:04,975
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

893
01:27:05,267 --> 01:27:06,727
Oh, man.

894
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:13,108
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

895
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:17,154
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

896
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:25,829
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

897
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,332
What I need?

898
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:33,086
What am I supposed to do?

899
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,428
I shouldn't have without...

900
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:43,180
...knocking.

901
01:27:47,768 --> 01:27:49,353
Come in.

902
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:54,942
-Hi.
-Hi.

903
01:27:58,612 --> 01:28:01,198
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

904
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,660
Okay.

905
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:08,163
And a glass of milk?

906
01:28:10,874 --> 01:28:12,501
That would be nice.

907
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:16,713
Okay.

908
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,735
Thank you.

909
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:45,075
You got a message.

910
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:47,744
It's your aunt.

911
01:28:47,911 --> 01:28:49,663
Thanks.

912
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:06,930
What's going on?

913
01:29:07,097 --> 01:29:10,934
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

914
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:14,771
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

915
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,398
Why didn't you tell me?

916
01:29:16,565 --> 01:29:19,860
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

917
01:29:20,027 --> 01:29:23,447
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

918
01:29:23,614 --> 01:29:25,115
...and I'm giving him $5.

919
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:26,867
That's Henry Jackson?

920
01:29:27,534 --> 01:29:29,620
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

921
01:29:29,953 --> 01:29:33,373
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

922
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:38,295
Listen, about my last visit....

923
01:29:38,462 --> 01:29:40,839
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

924
01:29:41,006 --> 01:29:45,594
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

925
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,851
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

926
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:54,978
And I'm proud of you.

927
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:58,440
And I thank you, and I....

928
01:29:59,691 --> 01:30:02,027
I love you, Peter.

929
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:05,822
So very, very much.

930
01:30:25,259 --> 01:30:28,262
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

931
01:30:28,428 --> 01:30:31,306
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

932
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:37,646
-I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
-Thank you, Henry.

933
01:30:37,813 --> 01:30:39,356
-Hi, Peter.
-Hey, Henry.

934
01:30:39,523 --> 01:30:40,858
You're getting tall.

935
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:45,153
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

936
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,365
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

937
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:50,617
I used to.

938
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:52,035
Where is he?

939
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:56,456
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

940
01:30:58,417 --> 01:30:59,960
He...

941
01:31:02,004 --> 01:31:04,506
-...quit.
-Why?

942
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:07,259
Wanted to try other things.

943
01:31:07,426 --> 01:31:09,052
He'll be back, right?

944
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:11,597
I don't know.

945
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:16,059
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

946
01:31:16,435 --> 01:31:18,228
Spider-Man.

947
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:22,274
-Why?
-He knows a hero when he sees one.

948
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:26,195
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

949
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:28,405
...saving old girls like me.

950
01:31:28,572 --> 01:31:32,367
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

951
01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:35,412
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

952
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:37,915
...setting examples for all of us.

953
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:40,751
Everybody loves a hero.

954
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:44,505
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

955
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:48,842
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

956
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:50,719
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

957
01:31:50,886 --> 01:31:54,348
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

958
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:58,936
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

959
01:31:59,686 --> 01:32:01,522
...that keeps us honest...

960
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:03,857
...gives us strength...

961
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:06,068
...makes us noble...

962
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:10,697
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

963
01:32:11,865 --> 01:32:15,994
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

964
01:32:16,161 --> 01:32:18,956
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

965
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:22,626
Even our dreams.

966
01:32:24,503 --> 01:32:27,256
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

967
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:29,842
...and he wonders where he's gone.

968
01:32:31,009 --> 01:32:32,928
He needs him.

969
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:42,020
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

970
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:44,648
But don't strain yourself.

971
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:46,483
Okay.

972
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:07,421
Strong focus on what I want.

973
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:39,036
I'm back!

974
01:33:39,203 --> 01:33:40,537
I'm back!

975
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:59,556
My back.

976
01:34:00,516 --> 01:34:01,892
My back.

977
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:30,379
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

978
01:34:30,921 --> 01:34:32,172
Peter Parker?

979
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:35,592
Positive.

980
01:34:35,884 --> 01:34:37,052
Thought he was your pal.

981
01:34:37,386 --> 01:34:39,721
-Peter Parker?
-Yeah.

982
01:34:40,597 --> 01:34:43,225
He's just a great big jerk.

983
01:34:43,559 --> 01:34:45,352
The world's full of great big jerks.

984
01:34:46,854 --> 01:34:48,605
You're adorable.

985
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:50,607
It's just the uniform.

986
01:34:53,944 --> 01:34:56,029
Lean your head back for me.

987
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:58,782
-Put my head back?
-Yeah, just do it.

988
01:35:00,784 --> 01:35:02,452
Just put my head back?

989
01:35:03,203 --> 01:35:04,788
Okay.

990
01:35:23,891 --> 01:35:25,392
Wow.

991
01:35:26,143 --> 01:35:27,936
I'm back on the moon.

992
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:34,067
You up there with me?

993
01:35:54,838 --> 01:35:57,007
-Hiya.
-Surprised?

994
01:35:57,174 --> 01:35:58,675
Very.

995
01:35:58,842 --> 01:36:00,427
Thanks for coming.

996
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:02,679
Everything okay?

997
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,432
You might say so.

998
01:36:06,767 --> 01:36:10,521
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

999
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:15,651
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

1000
01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:19,947
-Tell me about it.
-Well, mine did a real number on me.

1001
01:36:21,532 --> 01:36:25,202
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

1002
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:28,997
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

1003
01:36:29,831 --> 01:36:31,834
I was afraid to trust you.

1004
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:36,547
But I've been thinking about it--

1005
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:40,384
Listen, there's more for me to say.

1006
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:48,225
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought--

1007
01:36:48,392 --> 01:36:51,061
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1008
01:36:51,728 --> 01:36:53,564
I'm saying....

1009
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:02,739
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

1010
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,741
...but I can't.

1011
01:37:08,161 --> 01:37:11,415
My mind was playing tricks too.

1012
01:37:16,086 --> 01:37:18,714
Do you love me, or not?

1013
01:37:25,762 --> 01:37:27,389
I...

1014
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:31,935
...don't.

1015
01:37:36,773 --> 01:37:38,692
You don't.

1016
01:37:48,243 --> 01:37:49,453
Kiss me.

1017
01:37:51,663 --> 01:37:53,165
Kiss you?

1018
01:37:53,332 --> 01:37:55,250
I need to know something.

1019
01:37:57,794 --> 01:37:59,379
Just one kiss.

1020
01:38:46,718 --> 01:38:48,679
What's happening?

1021
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:00,524
Peter Parker...

1022
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,193
...and the girlfriend.

1023
01:39:03,527 --> 01:39:05,362
What do you want?

1024
01:39:08,198 --> 01:39:10,367
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

1025
01:39:10,534 --> 01:39:13,203
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

1026
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:15,539
I don't know where he is.

1027
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,625
Find him.

1028
01:39:20,878 --> 01:39:23,714
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

1029
01:39:23,881 --> 01:39:25,883
If you lay one finger on her....

1030
01:39:26,049 --> 01:39:27,384
You'll do what?

1031
01:40:41,124 --> 01:40:44,878
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

1032
01:40:45,045 --> 01:40:46,630
Sorry, Jonah.

1033
01:40:47,714 --> 01:40:49,216
It's all my fault.

1034
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:53,303
I drove Spider-Man away.

1035
01:40:53,595 --> 01:40:56,765
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

1036
01:40:58,267 --> 01:40:59,476
Yes.

1037
01:41:01,144 --> 01:41:04,481
Spider-Man was a hero.

1038
01:41:05,649 --> 01:41:07,651
I just couldn't see it.

1039
01:41:09,236 --> 01:41:10,654
He was a--

1040
01:41:10,821 --> 01:41:13,574
A thief! A criminal!

1041
01:41:15,075 --> 01:41:17,369
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

1042
01:41:17,536 --> 01:41:20,581
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

1043
01:41:20,747 --> 01:41:22,916
I want him strung up by his web!

1044
01:41:24,334 --> 01:41:27,004
I want Spider-Man!

1045
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:56,867
Where is she?

1046
01:41:57,034 --> 01:41:59,620
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

1047
01:42:50,879 --> 01:42:52,089
What the hell?

1048
01:45:44,178 --> 01:45:46,263
You have a train to catch.

1049
01:45:48,807 --> 01:45:50,642
Help!

1050
01:45:50,809 --> 01:45:55,189
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

1051
01:46:13,957 --> 01:46:16,502
-It's Spider-Man.
-Oh, my God, this is it!

1052
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:18,086
Tell everyone to hang on!

1053
01:46:18,253 --> 01:46:20,130
Brace yourselves!

1054
01:46:41,318 --> 01:46:43,654
Any more bright ideas?

1055
01:46:43,946 --> 01:46:46,323
I got a few, yeah!

1056
01:47:07,678 --> 01:47:09,513
Whoa, watch out!

1057
01:47:40,127 --> 01:47:41,378
We're slowing down.

1058
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,361
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

1059
01:48:48,362 --> 01:48:49,863
Slower. Gently.

1060
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:56,453
Is he alive?

1061
01:49:00,123 --> 01:49:01,458
He's...

1062
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:03,210
...just a kid.

1063
01:49:04,378 --> 01:49:06,213
No older than my son.

1064
01:49:25,566 --> 01:49:27,359
It's all right.

1065
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:33,615
We found something.

1066
01:49:42,875 --> 01:49:45,043
We won't tell nobody.

1067
01:49:58,515 --> 01:50:01,226
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

1068
01:50:21,038 --> 01:50:22,873
He's mine!

1069
01:50:23,707 --> 01:50:26,418
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

1070
01:50:26,752 --> 01:50:28,086
And me.

1071
01:50:28,712 --> 01:50:30,047
Me too.

1072
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:36,553
Very well.

1073
01:51:05,582 --> 01:51:07,543
Where do you want him?

1074
01:51:15,342 --> 01:51:16,844
And the tritium?

1075
01:51:31,358 --> 01:51:32,818
Yes.

1076
01:52:02,848 --> 01:52:05,976
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

1077
01:52:08,645 --> 01:52:11,148
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

1078
01:52:11,315 --> 01:52:13,817
I can look into your eyes as you die.

1079
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:18,113
Pete.

1080
01:52:18,488 --> 01:52:20,157
No.

1081
01:52:20,782 --> 01:52:22,159
It can't be.

1082
01:52:28,749 --> 01:52:30,042
Harry.

1083
01:52:31,585 --> 01:52:35,005
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

1084
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:40,344
-He's got M.J.
-No. All he wanted was the tritium.

1085
01:52:41,094 --> 01:52:42,346
Tritium?

1086
01:52:44,348 --> 01:52:46,350
He's making the machine again.

1087
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:51,438
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

1088
01:52:51,605 --> 01:52:54,358
-Now, where is he?
-Peter...

1089
01:52:55,526 --> 01:52:57,361
...you killed my father.

1090
01:53:02,533 --> 01:53:06,662
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

1091
01:53:07,371 --> 01:53:10,165
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

1092
01:53:20,759 --> 01:53:22,469
Hey!

1093
01:53:23,554 --> 01:53:25,222
Hey!

1094
01:53:26,598 --> 01:53:28,392
I'm talking to you!

1095
01:53:28,725 --> 01:53:32,229
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

1096
01:53:32,396 --> 01:53:34,231
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1097
01:53:34,398 --> 01:53:36,984
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1098
01:53:37,943 --> 01:53:39,403
He's not dead.

1099
01:53:39,653 --> 01:53:42,281
-I don't believe you.
-Believe it.

1100
01:54:00,048 --> 01:54:01,383
Surprise.

1101
01:54:05,804 --> 01:54:07,431
As soon as you get free--

1102
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:13,604
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1103
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:16,857
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1104
01:54:17,024 --> 01:54:19,359
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1105
01:54:20,485 --> 01:54:22,362
Well, I'm not.

1106
01:54:54,895 --> 01:54:56,146
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1107
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:13,330
Run!

1108
01:55:37,855 --> 01:55:40,190
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1109
01:56:04,047 --> 01:56:06,300
Now what?

1110
01:56:36,413 --> 01:56:38,540
Dr. Octavius.

1111
01:56:41,710 --> 01:56:42,920
We have to shut it down.

1112
01:56:43,795 --> 01:56:45,380
Please tell me how.

1113
01:56:45,547 --> 01:56:46,965
Peter Parker?

1114
01:56:50,552 --> 01:56:52,596
"Brilliant but lazy."

1115
01:56:52,930 --> 01:56:54,306
Look at what's happening.

1116
01:56:55,307 --> 01:56:57,267
We must destroy it.

1117
01:57:02,814 --> 01:57:04,441
I can't destroy it.

1118
01:57:09,696 --> 01:57:11,031
I won't.

1119
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,747
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1120
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:24,378
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1121
01:57:26,088 --> 01:57:27,464
A privilege.

1122
01:57:28,131 --> 01:57:31,218
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1123
01:57:32,261 --> 01:57:34,137
Don't listen to them.

1124
01:57:39,977 --> 01:57:41,562
It was my dream.

1125
01:57:41,728 --> 01:57:46,233
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1126
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,902
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1127
01:57:49,736 --> 01:57:51,405
Even our dreams.

1128
01:57:57,411 --> 01:57:59,037
You're right.

1129
01:58:06,461 --> 01:58:08,338
He's right.

1130
01:58:10,048 --> 01:58:11,675
Listen.

1131
01:58:13,844 --> 01:58:16,138
Listen to me now.

1132
01:58:19,016 --> 01:58:21,351
Listen to me now.

1133
01:58:25,063 --> 01:58:28,025
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1134
01:58:29,151 --> 01:58:30,819
It can't be stopped.

1135
01:58:32,196 --> 01:58:34,323
It's self-sustaining now.

1136
01:58:34,489 --> 01:58:36,533
-Think!
-Unless....

1137
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:39,870
The river.

1138
01:58:41,205 --> 01:58:42,831
Drown it.

1139
01:58:44,791 --> 01:58:46,126
I'll do it.

1140
01:59:31,421 --> 01:59:34,174
No!

1141
01:59:46,186 --> 01:59:47,771
Hi.

1142
01:59:48,438 --> 01:59:50,107
Hi.

1143
01:59:50,899 --> 01:59:52,276
This is really heavy.

1144
02:00:16,925 --> 02:00:18,886
M.J.

1145
02:00:19,761 --> 02:00:21,555
In case we die....

1146
02:00:21,722 --> 02:00:23,307
You do love me.

1147
02:00:23,849 --> 02:00:25,100
I do.

1148
02:00:26,059 --> 02:00:28,145
Even though you said you didn't.

1149
02:00:31,064 --> 02:00:33,525
I will not die a monster.

1150
02:01:38,841 --> 02:01:40,884
I think I always knew...

1151
02:01:41,969 --> 02:01:43,595
...all this time...

1152
02:01:44,763 --> 02:01:46,557
...who you really were.

1153
02:01:47,182 --> 02:01:49,726
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1154
02:01:50,936 --> 02:01:53,897
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1155
02:01:55,732 --> 02:01:58,443
I can't let you take that risk.

1156
02:02:03,156 --> 02:02:04,533
I will...

1157
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:08,453
...always be Spider-Man.

1158
02:02:11,248 --> 02:02:13,709
You and I can never be.

1159
02:03:01,965 --> 02:03:03,967
Mary Jane!

1160
02:04:07,072 --> 02:04:08,740
Hello?

1161
02:04:24,756 --> 02:04:26,091
Who's that?

1162
02:04:26,258 --> 02:04:28,218
Son.

1163
02:04:29,303 --> 02:04:30,846
I'm here.

1164
02:04:31,972 --> 02:04:33,599
Dad?

1165
02:04:34,683 --> 02:04:36,894
-I thought you were--
-No.

1166
02:04:37,394 --> 02:04:39,479
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1167
02:04:39,646 --> 02:04:41,023
Now it's your turn.

1168
02:04:42,566 --> 02:04:45,235
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1169
02:04:45,611 --> 02:04:47,279
Now make him pay.

1170
02:04:47,571 --> 02:04:49,239
But Pete's my best friend.

1171
02:04:49,406 --> 02:04:51,033
And I'm your father.

1172
02:04:51,992 --> 02:04:53,410
You're weak.

1173
02:04:54,411 --> 02:04:58,749
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1174
02:04:59,833 --> 02:05:02,669
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1175
02:05:03,587 --> 02:05:05,088
Be strong, Harry.

1176
02:05:06,131 --> 02:05:07,549
Avenge me.

1177
02:05:10,344 --> 02:05:12,387
-Avenge me!
-No!

1178
02:07:37,074 --> 02:07:38,450
Call Deborah.

1179
02:07:38,617 --> 02:07:40,452
The caterer?

1180
02:07:41,453 --> 02:07:43,580
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1181
02:08:24,955 --> 02:08:27,124
Had to do what I had to do.

1182
02:08:28,792 --> 02:08:30,127
Mary Jane.

1183
02:08:31,295 --> 02:08:32,546
Peter.

1184
02:08:33,797 --> 02:08:36,216
I can't survive without you.

1185
02:08:46,226 --> 02:08:48,061
You shouldn't be here.

1186
02:08:49,146 --> 02:08:52,232
I know you think we can't be together.

1187
02:08:53,317 --> 02:08:56,987
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1188
02:08:58,280 --> 02:08:59,990
I know there'll be risks.

1189
02:09:00,949 --> 02:09:03,493
But I want to face them with you.

1190
02:09:04,661 --> 02:09:08,040
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1191
02:09:08,207 --> 02:09:10,000
...half of ourselves.

1192
02:09:12,461 --> 02:09:14,046
I love you.

1193
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:19,301
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1194
02:09:21,011 --> 02:09:24,139
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1195
02:09:31,188 --> 02:09:34,691
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1196
02:09:40,656 --> 02:09:42,491
Well, say something.

1197
02:09:44,993 --> 02:09:47,496
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1198
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:05,430
Go get them, tiger.
