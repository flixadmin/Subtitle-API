1
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,641
Is this your plan, old boy?

2
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,602
Force me to watch you
smack your lips together

3
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,729
like some sort of blond ape

4
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,441
until I tell you where I stashed
the map to the Fountain of Imperium?

5
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:28,363
It won't work.
I offered to be your partner once

6
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,824
and you locked me
in a ruddy chest with that witch.

7
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:33,284
That's right.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,328
Mmm...

9
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,836
Ugh! You filthy, uncouth scoundrel!

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,340
Now you're gonna tell me
where the map is,

11
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,761
or I'm gonna desecrate your painting
with my bodily fluids.

12
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:55,390
- Just get this lump off my face!
- Okay.

13
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,643
I entrusted the map to a banker,

14
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,397
to hold on to
until my eventual resurrection.

15
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,691
All right then, partner.

16
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,569
What's this banker's name, eh?

17
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,073
Noelle, I presume.

18
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:13,783
Constantine.

19
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,705
Aren't you going to invite me in?

20
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,666
You're a vampire.

21
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,337
It's best you come in then.

22
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,051
Where is Aleister?

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,097
Don't worry about him.
From now on, you'll deal with me.

24
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,599
You have my two million pounds.

25
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,517
Two million quid?

26
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,184
Bloody hell.

27
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,479
How much interest
have you been charging, Vampy?

28
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,025
All right, calm down.

29
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,693
Don't get your knickers all in a knot.

30
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,906
See, I'm offering something
far more valuable than dosh, love.

31
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:56,909
A favor.

32
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,040
What could you possibly do for me?

33
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,043
Spare your immortal life, for one.

34
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,424
One word and sunshine
will turn you to ashes.

35
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,679
Clever.

36
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,015
Mmm. I'm John Constantine, love.

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,767
Clever doesn't even
begin to describe me.

38
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,769
Now hand over
what you were holding for Crowley

39
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,896
and you can be on your merry little way.

40
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,869
Go on, set it on the table.

41
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,751
Now that you've invited me in, <i>mon cher,</i>

42
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:51,339
I can come back any time I want.

43
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,259
I have magical rooms powerful enough

44
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:58,388
to keep out worse
than the likes of you, sweetheart.

45
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,229
Aleister's as well.

46
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,899
A little potion I procured for him.

47
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,237
One day, you might get a taste for it.

48
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:19,909
One day, you might be
positively gagging for the stuff.

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,263
Crowley, you sneaky wank.

50
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,906
<i>Lullaby and good night</i>

51
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:02,952
<i>With roses bedight</i>

52
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:06,205
<i>With lilies overspread</i>

53
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,251
<i>Is Gussie's wee bed</i>

54
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,547
<i>Lay thee down now and rest</i>

55
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:17,884
<i>Let thy slumber be blessed</i>

56
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:22,180
<i>Lay thee down now and rest</i>

57
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,519
<i>Let thy slumber be blessed</i>

58
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,732
Sleep tight, little buddy.

59
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,571
A superhero, a totem bearer
and an alien named Gary

60
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,031
become singing mannies.

61
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,741
Did I just invent our spin-off?

62
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,870
Are you recording because Sara
and Ava asked for constant updates?

63
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:49,832
They don't think we can survive
one weekend without them, do they?

64
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,251
Listen, I just want them to look
for their wedding venue

65
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,420
without dealing with these dummies.

66
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,843
<i>Lullaby and...</i>

67
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:03,721
No more singing.
I can't take it anymore.

68
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,059
That little snot's not crying
because it's tired.

69
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,061
It's got growing pains.

70
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,896
He does not look any bigger.

71
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,820
Well, he said the Gusarax
life cycle's only 38 rotations.

72
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,154
Uh, what does that mean?

73
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:22,323
Yeah, I can see
where this is going, New Zari.

74
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,492
Well, technically,
I'm the original Zari.

75
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,576
The OZ.

76
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,786
The one and only.

77
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,583
Yeah, I'm not translating for Gary
just because he lost his glasses.

78
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:36,337
And I'm definitely not helping y'all
parse Gus's every gurgle.

79
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,756
If I wanted to take care of a baby,

80
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,134
I would have stayed in Texas
and married the first jerk I kissed.

81
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,555
Yeah, she's really got
that new-girl-on-the-ship vibes.

82
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,602
Leeching human souls
wasn't quite enough for you,

83
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,105
was it, Master Crowley?
No, no, no, no.

84
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,775
- You were juicing.
- What a crass term.

85
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:01,153
I was reaching for new mystical heights,

86
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,865
aided by a rare cocktail of blood.

87
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,908
You absolute tosspot.

88
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,369
You know as well as I do
that magic this powerful,

89
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,079
it comes at a terrible, terrible price.

90
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,748
It's because of that potion
that you have the map.

91
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:17,503
In 1939, I took a rather large dose
and fell into a trance

92
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,882
where an extraterrestrial
dictated the map to me.

93
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,174
Pity he didn't speak English.

94
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:24,051
I might have discovered
where in the heavens

95
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,013
- the Fountain was hidden.
- Yes, the heavens.

96
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,848
You see, that's where
you were going wrong.

97
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,267
My alien mate, Gary,

98
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,270
he reckons
that the Fountain of Imperium

99
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,815
is somewhere here on Earth,
lost to history.

100
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:42,486
And this cut-out is the key.

101
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,488
Let's see.

102
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,910
It should fit exactly... Spain.

103
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,954
That's where the Fountain was in 1939.

104
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:55,374
Take me with you, John.
We're partners now, right?

105
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,669
Skip it.
I've got a new partner in mind.

106
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,882
You know, I have other skills
besides being an alien telepath.

107
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,217
Couldn't literally anyone else help you

108
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,844
with Rory's brood pooch instead?

109
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,471
Please? It'll just take a second.

110
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,434
Okay, amazing.
Um, I should warn you, though.

111
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,562
My dad hasn't really wrapped his head
around the whole pregnancy thing.

112
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,191
Men can't get pregnant.

113
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,821
Or didn't they
teach you that at college?

114
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,824
Dad, a-year-and-a-half ago
in my past, which is your future,

115
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:30,159
you ceased all contact.

116
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,537
Okay, if you really have Kayla's eggs
in your skull,

117
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,706
then maybe they'll give a clue
to what will happen.

118
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,291
Ever seen the movie <i>Alien?</i>

119
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,418
Yeah, I think we know what will happen.

120
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,212
Spooner, please,

121
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,631
just look at the protrusion.

122
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,593
Have a seat.

123
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,565
<i>Ay, dios mío.</i>

124
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,235
Oh, oh, oh...

125
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,655
What sordid scene have I interrupted?
Never mind. Don't care.

126
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,824
Spooner, join me for a shot
and a chinwag?

127
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,537
Good luck with that.

128
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,962
Long story short,
I have been stripped of my magic

129
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:25,673
in service of transforming you
back from a fork, I might add.

130
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,717
What do you want me to translate, John?

131
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,386
A map to the Fountain of Imperium,

132
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,764
which, according to my research,
is a wellspring of magic

133
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,977
gifted to humans by aliens long ago,
and last seen in Spain.

134
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,772
Oh. This is... This is cool.

135
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,776
"Only those whom are worthy
may drink from this Fountain."

136
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,279
It's typical prophecy malarkey.
I need a location.

137
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:51,532
Well, this main star here is Albacete.

138
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,450
- Albacete?
- Mmm-hmm.

139
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,870
That's a city in the southeast of Spain.

140
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,173
Well, seeing as
we're in Spain, February, 1939,

141
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,942
there's a few things
you ought to understand.

142
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,260
Now, first and foremost,
this country has just suffered

143
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,596
three years of a brutal
and bloody civil war.

144
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,348
Civil war! When were you planning
on telling me that?

145
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,143
I just did.
And a class war is more like it.

146
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,520
You see, on one side
you have the rich and the military

147
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,772
backed by Nazi Germany.

148
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,899
On the other side,
you have the trade unions

149
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,068
and the democratically elected
government of Spain.

150
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,170
And don't even get me started

151
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,154
on the devious little role
of the Catholic Church.

152
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,447
I'm Catholic, John.

153
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:34,511
Yeah, well, then you'll understand
my attitude towards priests.

154
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,244
I'd sooner rather break bread
with a bloody demon.

155
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,581
Okay, well,
nothing on here says "Fountain."

156
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,250
- What about El Gato?
- The cat?

157
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,252
No, no, no.

158
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,855
It's the code name for a leftist leader

159
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,079
that I've heard stories about.

160
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,633
Apparently, he survived
seven assassination attempts

161
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,259
and one actual crucifixion.

162
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,719
So? Maybe he was lucky.

163
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:56,847
Lucky? Nobody's that lucky.
That's magic.

164
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,433
My guess?
El Gato drank from the Fountain.

165
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,310
Yeah, well, if you want to find a man,

166
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,437
why don't we just ask
at the local watering hole?

167
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,857
Hmm.

168
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,709
The bar is closed to outsiders,

169
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,267
especially fascist spies.

170
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,196
Are you taking the mickey?

171
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,073
Do I look like a bloody fascist?

172
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,993
You look like a German.

173
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,162
- He has a point.
- No, he doesn't.

174
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,792
I'll have you know that I served
with the POUM militia at Jarama.

175
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,086
You were in the trenches of Jarama?

176
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,839
I was.

177
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,049
What did you grease your rifle with?

178
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,178
Oh, you mean the rusted antique
that they supplied me with?

179
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,804
Had to grease it with olive oil.

180
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,725
Water was in such short supply
that we had to shave with wine,

181
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,228
which is a bloody shame if you ask me
but the worst part was the lice.

182
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:30,232
- Those evil buggers, they were as...
- As big as boils.

183
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,357
As boils, yes.

184
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,943
<i>Compadre.</i>

185
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,200
Let us toast
to our fallen brothers in arms.

186
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,452
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,625
Gideon said John and Spooner
took the Jumpship to Spain.

188
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,460
So I thought, theme nights.

189
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,421
One slice of tortilla española
for the <i>señorita.</i>

190
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,007
Are you sure you should be drinking?

191
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,926
Yeah. Why?

192
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:00,471
Hey, I, for one, think it's really
cool that you're pregnant.

193
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:06,185
The next person that says "pregnant,"
I'm taking them with me

194
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,146
on a nose dive
outside the emergency hatch.

195
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,608
Hmm, wow. Real mature, Dad.

196
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,151
So what's your plan?

197
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,672
Are you just gonna pretend
this isn't happening?

198
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,530
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

199
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,532
I'm going to pretend Kayla didn't do

200
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,160
this ear stuff to me
without warning me first.

201
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,039
Well, you didn't give Mom a warning.

202
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,794
Niko and I didn't plan our baby,
but we're dealing with it.

203
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:37,967
Oh, guys, Gussie is aging rapidly.
He's like a teenager now.

204
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,927
- Okay.
- No, no, no. Uh...

205
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,304
A hormonal giant teenager.

206
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,684
Come on. <i>Vámonos.</i>

207
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,896
Pregnant people stay!
You're pregnant.

208
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,444
<i>Amigos,</i> the International Brigade
has already left.

209
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,196
Why are you still here?

210
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,284
We heard of a man who continues
to fight the fascist bastards.

211
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:08,372
He goes by the name of El Gato.
They say he can't be killed.

212
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,083
I also have heard of this man.

213
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,877
El Gato. Very mysterious.

214
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,798
- Do you know his secret?
<i>- Mañana. Mañana.</i>

215
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,050
It's late. I have to turn in.

216
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,552
Oh, come on, mate.

217
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,387
Indulge me, yeah?

218
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:35,691
My cousin told me El Gato
has drunk from a magical source.

219
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,111
What kind of source?

220
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,239
In the village over...

221
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,034
there's a donkey...

222
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,496
with great big, how do you say...

223
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,831
Udders.

224
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,541
Uh! <i>Sí.</i>

225
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,918
- Magical udders.
- Oh...

226
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,672
The milk makes El Gato impervious
to even a hail of bullets

227
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,966
- from the fascist scum.
- Well...

228
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,385
To the donkey.

229
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:05,762
<i>Salud!</i>

230
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:10,601
<i>- Adiós</i>. Magical donkey?
- Yeah, I don't know.

231
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,912
You don't hear a lot of crap
like that these days, do you?

232
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,456
Agreed.
And that man we were talking to,

233
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,398
- he was El Gato.
- Undoubtedly.

234
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,501
He probably came down from
the mountains to get some supplies.

235
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,586
Yeah. You clocked the old farmer?

236
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,962
Yeah.
Looks like he was guarding something.

237
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,048
- Perhaps his exit.
- The door to the cellar around back.

238
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,948
- And with the Fountain below. Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

239
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,838
Something alien is down here, all right.

240
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,967
And it's powerful.

241
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,910
Hey, hey, hey. It's all right.

242
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,746
It's okay. It's okay.

243
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,293
Ah, <i>la torera.</i>

244
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,713
- Yeah, yeah, it looks like you, love.
- Very funny, John.

245
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,382
What's your name, lad?

246
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,639
<i>Fernando.</i>

247
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:31,932
Fernando?

248
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,811
The alien power's coming from the kid.

249
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,439
He's mute,
but I can hear what he's thinking.

250
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,065
He must have drunk from the Fountain.

251
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,360
John.

252
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,123
Good evening.

253
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,546
My name is <i>Capitán</i> Noriega.

254
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,466
I have news from the front.

255
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,759
Madrid has fallen.

256
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,345
The Republic is done.

257
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,854
I've been sent
not just by <i>General</i> Franco...

258
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,193
but by the great <i>Herr</i> Hitler himself...

259
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:31,492
to hunt down a man known as El Gato.

260
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,415
You see, this man has drunk

261
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,670
from an occult relic
of immense interest to <i>Herr</i> Hitler,

262
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,132
the Fountain of Imperium.

263
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,102
Sounds like <i>Herr</i> Hitler
believes in fairytales.

264
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:03,315
You could say
my specialty is fairytales.

265
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,400
The Spear of Destiny.

266
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,027
The Loom of Fate.

267
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,238
I've studied them all.

268
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:16,828
Before the night is over,
I will know El Gato's secrets.

269
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,539
Hmm...

270
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,041
I don't know where this El Gato is,

271
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,418
but I have a lead on a magical donkey.

272
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,630
Search him.

273
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:32,094
Line everyone up and shoot them,
one by one, until he talks.

274
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,026
I'm the one you're looking for, eh.

275
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,615
Spooner. Spooner, no. Bollocks.

276
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,660
Oh, I know exactly who you are...

277
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,498
El Gato.

278
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,462
Fernando.

279
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,786
<i>Gracias.</i>

280
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,665
At last.

281
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,337
- Here is the key to the Fountain.
- No.

282
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:53,634
Search the rest of the tavern.
Arrest everyone.

283
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,894
Bollocks and bloody bollocks!
Come on, Johnny, think.

284
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,647
Think, think, think.
You can't leave her there.

285
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,977
That's it, Gus.
The gloves are coming off.

286
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,211
Watch out!

287
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,091
Gus-Gus has continued
to age at a rapid rate.

288
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,259
I'm afraid the Legends
are quite outmatched.

289
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,304
Should we do something?

290
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,140
They'll be fine.

291
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,269
What is it?

292
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,438
Nothing.

293
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,232
Is it your head?

294
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,943
- So?
- So what if this is it?

295
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,654
What if Kayla's eggs
burst out of that thing

296
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,090
on the back of your neck and kill you?

297
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,424
We need to get you to the MedBay now.

298
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,158
- Not gonna happen.
- Why the hell not?

299
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,494
Because I deserve it.

300
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,871
What are you talking about?

301
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:14,923
Dad...

302
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,260
what are you talking about?

303
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,137
Kayla didn't disappear.

304
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,931
I left her on a planet
full of lizard-people to die.

305
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,851
Oh...

306
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,897
Well, you must have had a reason, right?

307
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,192
To get back to you.

308
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,572
But in my line of work, there's a code,

309
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,200
you never leave your partner behind,
and I did.

310
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,994
Ooh!

311
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,206
I deserve everything
that's coming my way.

312
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,333
Oh, Dad, I'm going into labor.

313
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,710
- What?
- Yeah.

314
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,374
El Gato
has become quite chatty.

315
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,798
He tells me you're his nephew.

316
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,220
Fernando.

317
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,847
It's your turn to talk.

318
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,391
He can't, he's mute.

319
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,186
We'll see about that.

320
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,777
Tell me the location of the Fountain,

321
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,988
or I slash her throat.

322
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,867
Hmm?

323
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,252
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

324
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,970
Ciao, <i>señores.</i>

325
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:30,267
I am Father Constantine
and I have orders from the Vatican.

326
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,568
<i>Mi scusi, mi scusi.</i>

327
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:49,786
I have been sent
by several senior cardinals of <i>Roma</i>

328
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,123
to track down an ancient
and powerful relic.

329
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,042
The Fountain of Imperium?

330
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,546
You know of this relic?

331
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,965
<i>Herr</i> Hitler is also after the Fountain.

332
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,133
<i>Eccellente.</i>

333
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,135
Then we will work together.

334
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,640
I was just about to question the boy.

335
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,476
Please, <i>Capitán,</i> allow me.

336
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,252
Mick, what are you doing?
You gotta get Lita back in there.

337
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,276
She's having a baby!

338
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,862
Oh, baby!

339
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,614
I need to get her to the MedBay.

340
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,991
- Tarazi siblings.
- Activate.

341
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,913
Come and get it!

342
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Gus.

343
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,386
Blast again! Blast!

344
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,731
Oh...

345
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:05,612
Gideon!

346
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,156
Okay. Dad, wait.

347
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,159
- I'm so sorry.
- For what?

348
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,161
I'm not actually in labor.

349
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,764
I just needed to get us to the MedBay
in case you were in labor.

350
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,585
But I might have misjudged a little bit.

351
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,087
So sorry.

352
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,171
You tricked me.

353
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,215
It's because she loves you, Mick.

354
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,425
- We all do.
- No, debatable.

355
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,509
Everyone out.

356
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,781
We'll see you at the next
doctor's appointment, okay?

357
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:32,805
Out.

358
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,899
I'm conducting a sacred ceremony

359
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:48,029
creating a telepathic gateway
between this child and this virgin.

360
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,158
Your methods are extraordinary.

361
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,661
Indeed. <i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>

362
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,537
Now...

363
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,625
where is the Fountain of Imperium?

364
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,264
One day, last year,

365
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,101
my mom left me with my uncle
to go to the front.

366
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:20,687
That night, the planes came.

367
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:26,109
Suddenly, everything was burning
and full of smoke and dust.

368
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,571
I'd never seen so much blood.

369
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,199
A bomb had exploded next to me.

370
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:37,203
So I ran as far and as fast as I could.

371
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,456
I hid in a cave.

372
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,500
and prayed for some way
to save my uncle.

373
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,754
He was next to me when the bomb blew up.

374
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,592
A beautiful angel appeared

375
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,804
and told me to drink from the Fountain,

376
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:57,849
and that's when I felt it,

377
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,268
the power.

378
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:05,106
I returned to my uncle
and healed his wounds.

379
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,491
Yes. <i>Sì. Sì.</i>

380
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:19,788
And he has been bringing his uncle
back to life ever since.

381
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,457
Where is this cave?

382
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,543
Some water, <i>per favore.</i>

383
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,214
Forget the water, the cave.

384
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,299
But, Captain, I am parched.

385
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,559
<i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>

386
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:54,531
And now, you can ask him...

387
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,251
I don't know.

388
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,212
I was lost for days.

389
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,555
Unacceptable.

390
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,640
You know, there is one thing

391
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,726
that I never understood about fascists.

392
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,480
What is it that you see in <i>Herr</i> Hitler?

393
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,441
Is it that...

394
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,945
...he's a pissant with one ball?

395
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,376
<i>Viva la revolución!</i>

396
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,015
Take Fernando.

397
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:04,475
Come on, let's go.

398
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,354
Spooner, let's move, the door.

399
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,450
- John, we have to go back.
- What?

400
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,745
- Are you mental? Why?
- The fascists will kill everyone.

401
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,456
You know what happened
in the Spanish Civil War, right?

402
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,208
The moral side, it didn't win.

403
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,433
Now, get the boy to lead us to the cave.

404
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,213
Oh, come on, I know you were
bloody lying, all right?

405
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,940
Yeah, well, I'm not helping you finish

406
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,299
your ridiculous, selfish quest.

407
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,844
Quest? This is real.
My connection to magic is lost.

408
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:43,306
Boo-hoo!
What's so bad about being normal?

409
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,159
You don't think that kid
would give just about anything

410
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,435
to have a normal life again?
I know I would.

411
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,647
Yeah, well, some people want
picket fences and ponies, don't they?

412
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,065
Oh, yeah. And what do you want?

413
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,500
You want me to stay here
and risk my life

414
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,153
so I can help you get your magic back?

415
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,404
Give me a reason.

416
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:04,118
You know where I'm from, being normal...

417
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,330
is being crushed
by the boot of capitalism

418
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,707
and then blaming it on anyone
with brown skin.

419
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,711
It's being told that only degenerates
can fancy men.

420
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:16,547
And women, it's your old man
coming home drunk every night

421
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:17,632
and beating you to a pulp

422
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,401
because that's what his old man
done to him.

423
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,469
But magic, Spooner,

424
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,763
the ability to break the rules,

425
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,157
to stick it to the rich
and the powerful,

426
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,224
that's who I am.

427
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:32,230
And I'm nothing without it, Spooner.
I'm nothing.

428
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,577
I can't believe I'm saying this.

429
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,415
All right, John.

430
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,667
You win.

431
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,947
The fountain's dried up.

432
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,093
He said that's where
the water came from

433
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,118
that the angel gave him.

434
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,620
This is just a bunch of bloody rocks.

435
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,748
- Bollocks!
- Ease up, John.

436
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,583
All right, all right, just...

437
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,209
Just give me a second, all right?

438
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,759
All right.

439
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,844
Now, here's what we do.

440
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,739
Now, I told the Captain
that I was forging a connection

441
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:47,679
between the two of you.

442
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,808
Now that connection is very,
very real.

443
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:53,227
Now, you can use it
to push Fernando's magic into me.

444
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,663
All you need is a clear intention.

445
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,106
Okay, wait. So you want me
to help steal Fernando's magic?

446
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,106
What happens to him?

447
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:01,319
No... This is a way
to protect Fernando, yeah?

448
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,570
It'll give him a normal life,

449
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,948
away from all the Nazis chasing him
and the alien powers.

450
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,785
Don't pretend for an instant
you care about Fernando.

451
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
<i>Vete al diablo.</i>

452
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:14,248
All right, okay, yes,
I am the wankiest of all wankers,

453
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,934
but do me a favor
while I go and check to see

454
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,294
that no one has followed us,
you talk to Fernando.

455
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,254
He can give his magic to me
or he can keep it.

456
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,881
Now, that's his choice, innit?

457
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,938
<i>Hombres, mas rápido.</i>

458
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,066
<i>Rápido! Rápido!</i>

459
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,235
They can't be far off.

460
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,965
<i>- ¿Estás seguro?
- Sí. Sí.</i>

461
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,491
- Anyone?
- No, No.

462
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,158
All clear.

463
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,120
Fernando wants to make a deal.

464
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,831
Smart play, kid. What's your price?

465
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,708
He gives you his powers,
you use them to help find his mom.

466
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,128
She was supposed to return
to the tavern.

467
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,980
I told him she's probably
not gonna come back,

468
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,190
but he doesn't want to believe me.

469
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,424
- Done.
- Okay...

470
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:05,987
John, I hope
you thought this through.

471
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,886
Look, he's made his choice.
Sit down, yeah? Good boy.

472
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,053
Right, what do I do?

473
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:14,225
Now all you need to do is focus
your alien connection on the boy,

474
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,477
and you focus quickly, yeah?

475
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,645
Yeah. I'm no wizard, John.

476
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,398
Oh, aren't you? So I haven't seen you
stop a giant sand worm

477
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,775
- with your mind, have I? Exactly.
- Mmm.

478
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:32,743
I can't.

479
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:35,454
Look...

480
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,417
magic, you know,
is all about connection.

481
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,252
All right?
Now I use words to focus my mind.

482
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,503
You know any quotes?

483
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,189
I mean, there's a stupid song
stuck in my head.

484
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,024
Yeah, that will do.
It's not about the words per se.

485
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,248
It's more about the intention.

486
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,635
Now, remember,
you're giving this kid an opportunity

487
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,722
that you never had,
the chance at a normal life.

488
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,016
All right, you can do this.

489
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:08,988
<i>Lullaby and good night</i>

490
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:14,619
<i>Red roses bedight</i>

491
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:21,751
<i>With lilies overspread</i>

492
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:25,463
<i>Is Gussie's wee bed</i>

493
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,050
<i>Lay thee down now and rest</i>

494
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:35,306
<i>May thy slumber be blessed</i>

495
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:41,020
<i>Lay thee down now and rest</i>

496
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:44,732
<i>May thy slumber be blessed</i>

497
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,838
Whoa, whoa! Where's it gone?
Where's it gone? I can feel it.

498
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,182
I can feel it. It was right here.

499
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:54,075
It was right...
You give it back, my bloody magic!

500
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,838
- Give me my magic.
- Stop, John.

501
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:59,747
The prophecy. The prophecy said...

502
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:06,170
Only the worthy
may drink from the Fountain.

503
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,174
You take the boy and hide.

504
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:12,760
What are you gonna do, John?

505
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,473
Only a bastard can vanquish a monster.

506
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,267
Go.

507
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,154
Bottoms up, Mr. Crowley.

508
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:38,995
Father Constantine.

509
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,207
Where is the Fountain?

510
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,336
I won't ask you again.

511
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,144
<i>Dios mío.</i>

512
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:52,942
John.

513
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:39,907
I'm relieved to announce
Mr. Rory is not in labor.

514
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,451
Okay, so what about
the pain in his head?

515
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:45,413
Perfectly normal,
considering 48 Necrian eggs

516
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:47,498
are rattling around Mr. Rory's skull.

517
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:48,666
Forty-eight?

518
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:00,761
Tough little guppies, aren't they?

519
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,113
Yeah, but they get that from you.

520
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,934
Their mom is gone.

521
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,414
I'm sure Kayla
would be really happy to know

522
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:11,856
you're taking care of her babies.

523
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,649
- She would?
- Yeah.

524
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,737
Because they need you to survive,
just like I do.

525
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,364
Ah! I found my glasses.

526
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,742
And Sara and Ava are back.

527
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:23,868
What did we miss?

528
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:29,206
Look at their itty bitty tentacles.

529
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:34,545
Oh, Micky.

530
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:36,130
Are those...

531
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:39,717
Mine.

532
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:46,891
John, what happened back there?

533
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,392
I saw you drink something.

534
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:49,870
Yeah, it's just a nifty little trick

535
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:52,271
to stop a Nazi numpty
from getting the better of us.

536
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,732
Don't worry, Texas,
I won't be drinking it again.

537
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:58,652
Truth be told,
it scared the living hell out of me.

538
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,446
Good. I mean, me, too.

539
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:02,406
Look, wait.

540
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,325
We don't know
what we'll find in there.

541
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,333
Fernando.

542
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:19,965
<i>Tío.</i>

543
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:23,593
Thank you.

544
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,185
No, Spoons, listen.

545
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,480
We failed, all right?

546
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:38,651
Spain is not gonna be safe
for Fernando, not for a long time.

547
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:43,948
And I was just as ineffectual
as my dear old granddad

548
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,117
at fighting bloody fascism.

549
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,204
That's not true.

550
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,374
You killed a lot of Franco soldiers.

551
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:54,624
Yeah, I did.

552
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,753
And I bet at least one of them
wasn't a bad bloke,

553
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:00,047
and, once again, my soul is damned.

554
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,509
Okay, you know,
for someone who hates church,

555
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,845
you sound an awful lot like a Catholic.

556
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,765
What, just because I'm, like,
full of guilt and self-loathing?

557
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,642
My mama used to say...

558
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,396
- Never mind.
- No...

559
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,273
What about your mama? Tell me.

560
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:22,862
She used to say...

561
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,116
<i>Somos salvos solo por la fe.</i>

562
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,300
We're saved by faith alone.

563
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:30,911
Ah...

564
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,913
It's funny.

565
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,540
I've forgotten her face,

566
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,750
but I can still remember
the sound of her voice.

567
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,714
We were both abducted
and only I returned.

568
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:46,760
I should have been more like Fernando
and refused to give up on her, but...

569
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,804
I lost faith.

570
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:51,724
Spoons...

571
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,768
you live on a Timeship.

572
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,062
It's never too late, love.

573
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,110
Listen.

574
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:05,112
The painting of Crowley's snoring.

575
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,489
Shh...

576
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:15,831
Wakey, wakey, Crowley.

577
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,300
John.

578
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,350
To have magic back, Spooner,
is worth it.

579
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:36,434
It's worth the risk.

580
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:40,064
Don't do it. I'll tell Zari.

581
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,190
No, you won't.

582
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,530
You'll go upstairs
and you'll sleep it off.

583
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,091
Tomorrow, you'll return to the Legends.

584
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,992
You'll tell them we were successful.

585
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:53,243
You'll tell them...

586
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:57,247
how I drank
from the Fountain of Imperium.

587
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,124
Yes, John.

588
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,921
My stars.

589
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:07,132
I take it you didn't find the Fountain.

590
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,928
Are you, uh... Are you juicing, John?

591
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,347
Joke's on you, dickweed.

592
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,640
Is that so?

593
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,226
<i>Bonsoir,</i> gentlemen.

594
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,812
You brought what I asked for?

595
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,779
You can take him. He's yours.

596
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,990
John, what have you done?

597
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,242
No. Please, John.

598
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,911
You don't know
who she'll trade my soul to.

599
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:39,164
What a lucrative trade it will be.

600
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,294
Get him out of my sight, will you?

601
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,045
Until next time.

602
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,839
No!

603
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,883
Damn you, John.

604
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,762
Remember,
all your trials and tribulations,

605
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:56,390
you only have yourself to blame.
