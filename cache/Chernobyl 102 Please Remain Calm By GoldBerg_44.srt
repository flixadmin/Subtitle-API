00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,250
- Of what importance...?
- There's only one place in the entire facility

151
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,540
where you will find
graphite:{\c} inside the core.

152
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,290
If there's graphite
on the ground outside,

153
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,680
it means it wasn't a control
system tank that exploded.

154
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,080
It was the reactor core.
It's open! <font color="#ff00ff">(INHALES)</font>

Comrade General
Secretary, I can assure you

157
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,000
that Professor Legasov is mistaken.

158
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,460
Bryukhanov reports that
the reactor core is intact.

159
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,960
- And as for the radiation...
- Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

160
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,710
which, by the way, is not the
equivalent of one chest X-ray,

161
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,040
but rather 400 chest X-rays.

162
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,740
That number's been bothering me
for a different reason, though.

163
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,410
It's also the maximum reading
on low-limit dosimeters.

164
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,250
They gave us the number they had.

165
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,080
I think the true number
is much, much higher.

166
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,870
If I'm right, this fireman
was holding the equivalent

167
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,000
of four million chest
X-rays in his hand.

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,460
Professor Legasov, there's no
place for alarmist hysteria...

169
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,300
It's not alarmist if it's a fact!

170
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,870
Well, I don't hear any facts at all.

<font color="#138ce9">LEGASOV:</font> Um...

181

An RBMK reactor

182
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,210
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

183
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,080
Every atom of U-235 is like a bullet

184
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,290
traveling at nearly the speed of light,

185
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,870
penetrating everything in its path:{\c}

186
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,080
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

187
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,250
Every gram of U-235 holds

188
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,460
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

189
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,860
That's in one gram.

190
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,120
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

191
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,830
and right now, it is on fire.

192
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,250

194
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,610
That's three million

the water we drink, the food we eat.

197
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,790
Most of these bullets will
not stop firing for 100 years.

198
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,160
Some of them, not for 50,000 years.

Yes, and, uh, this concern

stems entirely from the

216
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,080
How does a nuclear reactor work?

217
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,040
- What?
- <font color="#138ce9">SHCHERBINA:</font> It's a simple question.

218
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,290
It's hardly a simple answer.

219
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,290
Of course, you presume I'm
too stupid to understand.

220
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,660
So I'll restate:{\c} Tell me
how a nuclear reactor works,

221
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,540
or I'll have one of these soldiers
throw you out of the helicopter.

222
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,580
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

223
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,210
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

224
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,250
Where a typical power plant

225
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,210
makes steam by burning coal,

226
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,540
a nuclear plant...

227
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,370
In a nuclear plant, we use
something called fission.

228
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:30,410
We take an unstable
element like uranium 235,

229
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,560
which has too many neutrons.

230
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,290
- A neutron is, uh...
- The bullet.

231
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,910
Yes, the bullet.

232
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,830
So, bullets are flying
off of the uranium.

233
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,250
Now...

234
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,160
if we put enough uranium
atoms close together,

235
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,620
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

236
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,790
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

237
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,160
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

238
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,000
- And the graphite?
- Ah, yes.

239
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,960
The neutrons are actually traveling
so fast... we call this "flux"...

240
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,830
it's relatively unlikely that the
uranium atoms will ever hit one another.

241
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:16,870
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

242
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,870
to moderate, slow
down, the neutron flux.

243
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,890
Good.

<font color="#138ce9">GARANIN:</font> I must tell you, this
is why no one likes scientists.

303
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,790
When we have a disease
to cure, where are they?

304
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,350
In a lab, noses in their
books, and so Grandma dies.

305
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,730
But when there isn't a problem,

306
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,500
they're everywhere, spreading fear.

307
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,960
- I know about Chernobyl.
- Oh?

308
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,910
I know that the core is either
partially or completely exposed.

309
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,410
- Whatever that means.
- And that if you don't immediately

310
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,250
issue iodine tablets and
then evacuate this city,

311
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,960
hundreds of thousands of
people are going to get cancer,

312
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,160
and God knows how many more will die.

313
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,930
Yes, very good.

314
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,290
There has been an accident at Chernobyl,

315
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,500
but I've been assured
there is no problem.

316
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
I'm telling you that there is.

317
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,540
I prefer my opinion to yours.

318
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,910
I'm a nuclear physicist.

319
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,580
Before you were Deputy Secretary,

320
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,250
you worked in a shoe factory.

321
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,960
Yes, I worked in a shoe factory.

322
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,980
And now I'm in charge.

323
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,120
"To the workers of the world."

324
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,450
Stable iodine will keep your thyroid

325
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,830
from absorbing radioactive iodine.

326
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,870
Take one a day for as long as they last.

327
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,660
And go east.

328
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,120
Get as far from Minsk as you can.

333
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,040
as stupid as he is pigheaded.

334
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,460
We'll tell him the truth in
the simplest terms possible.

335

We'll be fine.

337
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,540
Comrade Shcherbina,
Chief Engineer Fomin,

338
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,580
Colonel General Pikalov, and I

339
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,910
are honored at your arrival.

340
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,250
Deeply, deeply honored.

341
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,290
Naturally, we regret the
circumstances of your visit,

342
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,540
but, as you can see, we are
making excellent progress

343
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,160
in containing the damage.

344
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,410
We have begun our own inquiry
into the cause of the accident,

345
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,500
and I have a list of individuals

346
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,290
who we believe are accountable.

349
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,210
<font color="#138ce9">FOMIN:</font> Very dangerous things.

350
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,540
Apparently, our reactor core exploded.

351
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,460
Please, tell me how an
RBMK reactor core explodes.

352
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,750
I'm not prepared to
explain it at this time.

353
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,710
As I presumed, he has no answer.

354
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,290
It's disgraceful, really.

355
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,790
To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

356
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,620
Why did I see graphite on the roof?

357
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,830
Graphite is only found in the core,

358
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,370
where it's used as a
neutron flux moderator.

359
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,790
Correct?

360
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,210
Fomin, why did the Deputy
Chairman see graphite on the roof?

361
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,250
Well, that... that can't be.

362
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,870
Comrade Shcherbina, my
apologies, but graphite...

363
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,160
that's not possible.

364
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,350
Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

365
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,370
Now there you made a mistake,

366
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,080
because I may not know
much about nuclear reactors,

367
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,710
but I know a lot about concrete.

368
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,040
- Comrade, I assure you...
- I understand.

369
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,580
You think Legasov is wrong.

370
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,540
How shall we prove it?

371
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,160
Our high-range dosimeter just arrived.

372
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,210
We could cover one of our
trucks with lead shielding,

373
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,540
mount the dosimeter on the front.

374
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,620
Have one of your men get as
close to the fire as he can.

375
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,370
Give him every bit of
protection you have.

376
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,750
But understand that
even with lead shielding,

377
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,750
it may not be enough.

378
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,460
Then I'll do it myself.

379
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,080

It means the fire we're

released by the bomb in Hiroshima.

And that's every single hour.

hours since the explosion,

And it will not stop. Not
in a week, not in a month.

397

610
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,750
Of course.

Comrades...

612
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,080
The guards arrested this
woman at the south checkpoint.

613
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,410
- I'd have put her in a cell...
- But he thought you should know that I know.

614
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,490
I know that your
reactor core is exposed.

615
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,290
I know the graphite is on
fire, the fuel is melting,

616
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,290
and you're dropping
sand and boron on it,

617
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,620
which you probably thought was
smart, but you've made a mistake.

And you are Valery Alexeyevich Legasov?

621
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,120
Smothering the core
will put the fire out,

622
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,000

eventually increase...

I'm perfectly aware.

624
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,750
But I estimate at least a month

625
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,750
before it melts through
the lower concrete pad,

626
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,750
- which gives us time...
- No, you don't have a month.

627
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,460
You have approximately two days.

628
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,660
Yes, the fuel would take a month

629
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,790
to reach the concrete pad here.

630
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:50,370
But first... it's going to burn through

631
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,830
the biological shield here by Tuesday.

632
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,910
And when it does, it's
going to hit these tanks...

633
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,290
bubbler pools, reservoirs...

634
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,540
Reservoirs for the ECS.
I understand your concern,

635
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,540
but I confirmed it with plant personnel.

636
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,210
- The tanks are nearly empty.
- No, they were nearly empty.

637
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,750
Each of these points
here, here, and here

638
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,830
all drain to the bubbler pools.

639
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,460
I'm guessing that every pipe
in the building ruptured.

640
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,500
And then there are those fire
engines that I saw on the way in.

641
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,710
The fire hoses are still connected.

642
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:22,830
They've been gushing water into
the structure this whole time.

643
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,790
The tanks are full.

644

Professor Legasov will
deliver our briefing.

660
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,000
There is some good news.

661
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,750
The air drops are
working to douse the fire.

662
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,580
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

663
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,500
but the fire will not be extinguished

664
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,370
for at least another two weeks.

665
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,290
There is also an additional problem.

666
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,660
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

667
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,410
simply because it is not on fire.

668
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,120
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

669
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,910
as a result of the blanket
of sand we've dropped.

670
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,790
The uranium will melt the sand,

671
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,580
creating a kind of lava

672
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,960
which will begin to melt
down through the shield below.

673
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,500
You have made lava?

674
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,290
I anticipated this.

675
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,160
I believed there was time to reinforce

676
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,290
this lower concrete pad

677
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,830
before the lava reached the earth

678
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,460
and contaminated the groundwater.

679
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,620
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

680
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,580
Uh, um...

681
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,250
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

682
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,910
under the reactor
were essentially empty.

683
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,080
This is Ulana Khomyuk of
the Byelorussian Institute.

684
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,460
Thanks to her insight, we are now aware

685
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,830
that the tanks are, in fact, full.

686
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:56,710
Of water. Why is that
a problem, professor?

<font color="#ff00ff">(CLEARS THROAT)</font>

688
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,750
When the lava enters these tanks,

689
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,480
it will instantly superheat and vaporize

690
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,910
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

691
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,500
causing a significant thermal explosion.

692
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,540
How significant?

693
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,500
We estimate between
two and four megatons.

694
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,870
Everything within a 30-kilometer radius

695
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,620
will be completely destroyed,

696
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,040
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

697
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,620
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

698
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,790
will be ejected at force

699
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,910
and dispersed by a massive shock wave,

700
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,210
which will extend
approximately 200 kilometers

701
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:45,580
and likely be fatal to the
entire population of Kiev

702
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,710
as well as a portion of Minsk.

703
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,710
The release of radiation will be severe

704
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,040
and will impact all of Soviet Ukraine,

705
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,750
Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia,

706
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:01,080
as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

707
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,750
Romania, and most of East Germany.

708
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,290
What do you mean "impact"?

709
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,710
For much of the area, a
nearly permanent disruption

710
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,330
of the food and water supply,

711
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,410
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

712

there will be, but many.

713
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,910
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

714
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,330
"impact" means completely uninhabitable

715
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,750
for a minimum of 100 years.

716
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,080
There are more than 50 million people

717
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,910
living in Byelorussia and Ukraine.

718
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,750
Sixty, yes.

719
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,960
And how long before this happens?

720
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,830
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

721
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,790
But we may have a solution.

722
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,660
We can pump the water from the tanks.

723
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,160
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

724
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,370
and the gate can only be opened manually

725
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,000
from within the duct system itself.

726
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,250
So we need to find three plant workers

727
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,910
who know the facility well enough

728
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,620
to enter the basement here,

729
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,960
find their way through
all these duct ways,

730
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,120
get to the sluice gate valve here,

731
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,660
and give us the access we
need to pump out the tanks.

732
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,500
Of course, we will need your permission.

733
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,620
My permission for what?

734
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,160
Uh, the water in these ducts,

the level of radioactive
contamination...

736

00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,710
A thousand years of
sacrifice in our veins.

768
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,330
And every generation must
know its own suffering.

769
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,210
I spit on the people who did this,

770
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,830
and I curse the price I have to pay.

771
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,460
But I'm making my peace with it,

772
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,290
and now you make yours.

773
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:19,040
And go into that water.

774
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,870
Because it must be done.
