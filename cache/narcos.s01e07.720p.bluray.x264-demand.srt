1
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,690
This is one of the
largest and most mysterious plane crashes

2
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,232
in Colombian history.

3
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,652
It may have been a bomb
that blew up a plane in Colombia today.

4
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,780
The Boeing 727 of Avianca Airlines...

5
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,161
In his unsuccessful attempt

6
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,332
to assassinate presidential candidate
César Gaviria,

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,502
Pablo Escobar murdered
107 innocent people.

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,256
The "Paisa Robin Hood"...
had become a terrorist.

9
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,844
But American intelligence authorities

10
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,515
say the drug bosses in Colombia
have to be considered prime suspects.

11
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,816
You know where Jaime is?

12
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,862
No, sir.
I don't know where he is.

13
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,614
He left home and hasn't returned.

14
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:17,116
- Have Pablo and his men come by here?
- No.

15
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:19,494
- Your name is Natalie?
- Yes, sir.

16
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:23,499
Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime,
was he with Pablo's sicarios?

17
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,252
- No.
- Are you sure?

18
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,169
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,549
Well, then, why do you have
this picture of Pablo in your house?

20
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:36,429
Nothing wrong with that.
Everyone in the comuna has one.

21
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:39,724
You think those thugs
are going to protect you?

22
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:44,353
You don't understand...
that you represent a big problem for them.

23
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,065
We can help you.

24
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,402
We can protect you.
But you have to tell us the truth.

25
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,288
She's lying.

26
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,332
He's got this poor sucker to carry a bomb
without him even knowing it.

27
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:10,462
- Well, maybe he knew.
- I don't care if he knew or not.

28
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,465
It's time we put a bullet in Escobar.

29
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,597
I don't want
to leave, my love. I don't want to leave.

30
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,599
But I must, for all our safety.

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,477
Did you do something wrong?

32
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:30,399
Your dad did nothing wrong.

33
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:39,283
These are people who are jealous of us,
who are trying to take what we have.

34
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,869
You have to be strong.

35
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:46,205
I want you to be strong.

36
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:49,876
You have to be strong
and never show weakness.

37
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:51,754
I promise I'll never be weak.

38
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,342
And watch out for your sister.

39
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:05,059
I love you very much.

40
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,438
I love you all very much.

41
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:12,482
- Mama.
- Pablo?

42
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:16,277
- Do not spoil this boy.
- But... what do you mean?

43
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:21,408
- Watch her.
- Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.

44
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,336
Be careful, son. Be careful.

45
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,518
- I love you.
- Me, too.

46
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,604
Take care.

47
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,192
And what about you?

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,402
Come on.
I'm going to take you with me.

49
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,114
I'm going to take you with me...
I'm going to take you with me.

50
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,464
Take care.

51
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,098
You think he did it?

52
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,142
Surely not.

53
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:32,563
Blow up that plane?

54
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,650
Of course he did it, Hermilda.

55
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:39,612
But he had his reasons.

56
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:47,745
We've got everyone looking
for Jaime's wife throughout the comunas.

57
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:52,083
I want you to find her and kill her.

58
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,796
And kill any motherfucker that
can connect me with that fucking plane.

59
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,423
Yes, sir.

60
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,607
the functions
of President of Colombia?

61
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,027
I swear.

62
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,407
The Avianca bombing created
a tidal wave of support for César Gaviria.

63
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:55,956
He became the 28th President of Colombia
by a landslide.

64
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,089
Well, César, congratulations.

65
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,965
Not César... I mean, Mr. President.

66
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,550
Salud.

67
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,885
- Salud.
- Salud.

68
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,054
Excuse us.

69
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,809
- As a former president to a new one...
- Mm-hm?

70
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,062
What advice would you give?

71
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:24,817
Well... you'll be asked
to make many difficult decisions.

72
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:28,113
I would say one thing...
do what your wife says.

73
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,532
I always do.

74
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:40,125
Trust your instincts,
and be confident in your decisions.

75
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,501
Yes...

76
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:45,422
but that's easier said than done.

77
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,757
You'll never be able to please everyone,

78
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,343
so find the solution
that rings true in your heart.

79
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,594
Thank you.

80
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:54,347
Another thing I did want to tell you,
about the Americans...

81
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,309
What about the Americans?

82
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,354
This will have to be off the record,
my dear.

83
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:05,317
I can't have my opinions
broadcast on your television show.

84
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,320
No, no, no.
You have my word.

85
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,864
- The Americans...
- Yes?

86
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,284
Be careful.

87
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,496
We killed José Rodríguez
Gacha with a minimal loss of life.

88
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:22,250
Bringing Escobar to justice
is my number one priority.

89
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,587
But we will do so
on our own terms and own resources.

90
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:28,340
We wanna help you catch Escobar.

91
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,427
I have enormous gratitude to you,
especially with Agent Murphy,

92
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,180
whose warnings kept me off that plane.

93
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,350
You, sir, yes. Unfortunately,
not the rest of the passengers.

94
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:41,769
The people in Colombia are horrified
about the bombing of Avianca's plane.

95
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,232
But they're also against
American soldiers on our soil

96
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,819
and spy planes intercepting calls, so...

97
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,071
America doesn't intercept
civilian phone calls. That's absurd.

98
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:55,575
Presidente, you need
additional resources to get this man.

99
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,120
Well...

100
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,914
your government's research says...

101
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:08,339
660 tons of cocaine were consumed
in the United States last year.

102
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,760
Perhaps if your resources
were focused at home,

103
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,096
we'd all be better off.

104
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,851
Gaviria made good
on his promise to go after Escobar.

105
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,484
Colonel Carrillo's Search Bloc
was set loose with a vengeance.

106
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,320
Carrillo mounted dozens of raids.

107
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:38,536
But with an army of informants,
Escobar somehow always got away.

108
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,707
We sat on the sidelines,
hands tied by bureaucracy.

109
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:50,129
In response, Pablo took
his narco-terrorism to a whole new level

110
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,093
with a bombing campaign that would
shake the country to its foundations.

111
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:59,932
In doing his best to avoid war,
that's exactly what Gaviria got.

112
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,477
And the toll on both sides
was devastating.

113
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,357
The thing about war is...
it's just bad for business.

114
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:13,986
And when you got a bull's-eye
on your back... your rivals get bold.

115
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,866
- Pablo.
- What's up, Pacho?

116
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,410
That's right.

117
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,455
Pablo and the Medellín cartel
weren't the only game in town.

118
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,165
Thank you.

119
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:30,170
This is Helmer "Pacho" Herrera, one
of the four leaders of the Cali cartel.

120
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,466
While Pablo left a trail of bodies
and chaos in his wake,

121
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,512
Cali made problems disappear with an army
of lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs.

122
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,932
The Medellín cartel was Miami:

123
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,103
swimming pools, bikini girls...
tacky as a two-tone Cadillac.

124
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,188
The Cali cartel was New York:

125
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,150
elegant, smooth, subtle.

126
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,278
Where they could fuel
the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine,

127
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,741
and still make sure everybody showed up
for work on Wall Street the next morning.

128
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,162
At first, Medellín and Cali
worked side by side.

129
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,292
But in Colombia, when money's involved,
blood inevitably flows.

130
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,545
There had been violence
between Medellín and Cali before.

131
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,341
But right now, a war on two fronts
was not something Pablo could afford.

132
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:21,678
We have Miami...
and have left you alone in New York.

133
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,350
- Yes, for a price.
- Certainly.

134
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:30,772
Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would
share the Los Angeles territory...

135
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,442
and that hasn't been happening.

136
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,237
It seems you are not
holding up our agreement.

137
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,949
- How's that?
- Exactly what I'm saying, Pacho.

138
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,998
Look, Pablo...

139
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:53,169
you know that our partners
sometimes operate independently.

140
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,422
If Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada are correct,

141
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,634
then you have my assurance
that it will be rectified.

142
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,011
Thanks a lot, Pacho.

143
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,306
Disputes between us
cause needless bloodshed.

144
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:11,021
Then fix it. A war between our groups
is the last thing we need right now.

145
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,234
It would seem you already have a war.

146
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:18,862
Maybe bombing that plane
was a step too far.

147
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,574
Careful, Pacho.

148
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,450
Careful.
The only difference between us

149
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:27,036
is our little misunderstanding
with the government.

150
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,830
And that will be resolved soon.

151
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,082
Besides, that's the business,
for all of us.

152
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,959
- Yes, it's true for all of us.
- Mm-hm.

153
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,255
The only war we are really fighting
is the war against extradition.

154
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:38,881
And the outcome of that
is something we're all interested in.

155
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:42,301
It's true, Gustavo.
Gustavo is right.

156
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:45,723
We have a common goal,
and that is to get rid of extradition.

157
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,393
The United States is big enough
for all of us to operate in.

158
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:55,399
Let's figure out Los Angeles
once you take care of your business here.

159
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,405
You know what bothers me?

160
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,284
Your arrogance.

161
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,579
Your attitude, your air of superiority.

162
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:16,336
Careful, Pacho... that you don't
get yourself killed for that.

163
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,805
Thank you for coming.

164
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,492
- I'm gonna kill that homo bastard.
- Pablo, let me kill him.

165
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,744
Stop talking shit, Moncada.

166
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:52,955
We'll kill that fag later.
Right now, we can't be out in the open.

167
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:56,751
If that son of a bitch
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,

168
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:02,882
I'm personally gonna put a gun up his ass
and pull the trigger. I swear.

169
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,511
That will make him fall in love with you.

170
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,182
We got Escobar's most trusted soldiers:

171
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,185
Poison, La Quica, Sure Shot, Blackie.

172
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,104
Cocky, careless motherfuckers.

173
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,191
Now we're hearing about two new guys:

174
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,941
Fernando Galeano and Kiko Moncada,

175
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,235
basically picking up
where Carlos Lehder left off.

176
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,363
Kill the body, the head will die.

177
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,084
Without Colombian permission
to put assets in the air, we can't help.

178
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:31,995
In terms of intercepts, yeah,
but what do you guys got on ground intel?

179
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,331
- You mean spies?
- Yes.

180
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,293
We don't have any narco assets.

181
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:42,380
Our human intelligence
is limited to communists.

182
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,926
Besides, Gaviria doesn't want you
chasing Escobar with CIA spies.

183
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:48,735
But you got satellites
in the sky, right?

184
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:52,682
Yes, but to use them in pursuit of narcos
would be a direct violation

185
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,476
- of the order of our host country.
- Man, you're CIA.

186
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,936
You break rules all the time.

187
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:03,443
These are aerial photographs of comunas
controlled by Escobar and his associates.

188
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,653
- We'll use them to track his men.
- These are aerials.

189
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,699
- We can't track individuals with these.
- Take a look.

190
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,077
The Los Priscos gang controls El Poblado.

191
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,414
Here in Santa Cruz, we got the comuna
where they recruited the Avianca bomber.

192
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,709
And both places more densely packed
than a Marrakesh bazaar.

193
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,712
So let's take a tip from the Colombians.

194
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:25,674
You notice anything special about these?

195
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,969
Search Bloc follows vehicle traffic
in the comunas. You've got...

196
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,601
Japanese imports... four-by-fours.
Cars over 40 grand.

197
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,895
Narcos are the only ones
who can afford these cars.

198
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,524
Whenever aerials see these cars,
we know sicarios are inside.

199
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,485
- That's right.
- We start tracking these rice rockets,

200
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,738
we might be able to get to Escobar.

201
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,794
I think it's up this way.

202
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,171
I don't want to shoot her.

203
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:08,841
Kill that cute girl?
And the baby, too?

204
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,554
I don't know why the boss
wants us to kill that girl.

205
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,226
- What does she know about Avianca anyway?
- Just shut up and follow orders!

206
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,355
Does he think
putting a bomb on every corner

207
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:25,076
is gonna get the police
to quit chasing him?

208
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,903
Gustavo, we need to get away,
out of this country.

209
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,199
And go where?

210
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,370
We'll be treated like criminals
wherever we go.

211
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,709
They'll kill him, and you know it.

212
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,838
I just hope he doesn't
take you down with him.

213
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,008
This isn't our war.

214
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,430
This isn't war. It's negotiation.

215
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:03,729
Don't you understand
what an opportunity this is?

216
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,941
He's willing to consider
terms of surrender...

217
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,568
Under what conditions?

218
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,821
My God, he just blew up a plane!

219
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,239
Eduardo, calm down.
Let the man speak.

220
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,787
We can end this violence
with dignity. It's good for both sides...

221
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,999
Do you realize
how stupid you sound right now?

222
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,291
César, this is absurd.

223
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,210
- Eduardo, please...
- This is a farce.

224
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,546
Please.

225
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,341
Let me deal with this. Please.

226
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,594
Fine. Whatever you want.

227
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:42,185
We can at least begin a discussion, right?

228
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,187
Even though you never stated it,

229
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:49,359
surely you'd like
to see the bombings stop.

230
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,821
- Yes. Yes, I would.
- Exactly.

231
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,241
So if we begin a dialogue,
they will cease.

232
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:02,288
That affords us all some time,
including the Search Bloc.

233
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,750
Fernando...

234
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:10,504
you saw his money,
and it blinded you to his soul.

235
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,674
That son of a bitch has no soul.

236
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,305
If telling him we're negotiating

237
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:23,309
allows the bombs to stop
while we find him...

238
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,271
then be my guest.

239
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:35,238
Thank you.
Really, thank you.

240
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,789
Look, man,
Pablo's turned into a saint.

241
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,206
Of course.

242
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:32,337
He sends people straight to heaven.

243
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,657
She's not here.
She might have just left.

244
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:03,702
Let's search the comuna.

245
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,496
Look, Poison, I'm telling you
Pablo is being paranoid.

246
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,541
Careful what you say, son.

247
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,211
One day,
he is going to ask me to kill you.

248
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:17,255
Would you do it?

249
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:19,968
If he asks me... of course.

250
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,512
There is no way around it.

251
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,891
Wouldn't you?

252
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,440
All right, all right,
let's just go find this girl.

253
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,694
We'll look around
and see where she's hiding.

254
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:41,739
What's wrong?

255
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,158
Here you go.

256
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,784
It's OK, Natalie.
Don't worry.

257
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:50,706
Before you know it, we'll get you
some food. Right? Isn't that right?

258
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,875
Thank you.

259
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,140
What then, Fernando?

260
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,977
Has the Colombian government
offered a truce?

261
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,606
The government
hasn't been willing to offer anything

262
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,275
I would consider acceptable.

263
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:19,069
What did they offer?

264
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:22,948
They want you to admit...

265
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,408
that you're responsible for Avianca.

266
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:29,537
And of course, I told them that...
That we can't even...

267
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,455
Is it that you're not negotiating a thing?

268
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,749
No, no, of course I'm negotiating...

269
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,962
Then why is Carrillo
stopping every car in the comunas

270
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,632
and killing my boys
with the help of the gringos?!

271
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,638
Why are the Americans helping them if we
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?

272
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:53,728
Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know
he's willing to negotiate with you.

273
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:57,523
That's it.

274
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,364
Be very careful, Fernando.

275
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Yes, Pablo.

276
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,499
Yes.

277
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:39,232
You've got to stop the bombing, Pablo.

278
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,780
I don't know what you're thinking anymore.

279
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,660
I think we should...

280
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,331
reorganize a bit...

281
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:02,046
and start sending our boys out to burn
some houses down and do some damage

282
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,966
to politicians and senators
all over the country.

283
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:09,720
And to the soldiers and cops in our way,
the judges who annoy us

284
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,263
and the reporters that watch us,

285
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:15,268
basically, we have to create a presence so
disruptive they'll want nothing but peace.

286
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:18,729
That's the only way
we're going to get there.

287
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,318
Is that it? Is that what you want?
A civil war?

288
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:28,656
- You've gone crazy, asshole.
- We have to fight, brother.

289
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:32,160
Let's put our hearts into this.

290
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,873
And if we all must die, so be it.

291
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,169
Well, yes...

292
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:47,133
The thing is,
I don't want to die yet, Pablo.

293
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,270
Nor do I.

294
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,649
But the bombs make the public want peace.

295
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:06,403
And that will influence the politicians.

296
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:21,793
You're the one who says the politicians
don't give a shit about the public.

297
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:27,340
If you want to influence politicians,
you'll have to narrow your focus.

298
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,426
You know what I mean?

299
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,845
Gustavo was right.

300
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,889
They needed a new strategy,

301
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,475
one that brought terror directly
to the people that mattered the most.

302
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:41,145
What about her?

303
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,439
No, she is way too much of a princess.

304
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,000
Surely we would have problems with her.

305
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,068
My God, look at that face.

306
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:51,155
The media is going to love that fox,
right?

307
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,199
Sure they will,
but so will our boys.

308
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,827
Just think what
they're gonna do to her.

309
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:57,911
Well...

310
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,540
I say let's start with her...

311
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,883
and this fag.

312
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,723
Let's go!

313
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,269
And this cute couple.

314
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:29,444
When you kill someone, you lose
all your leverage the moment they're dead.

315
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,197
Now, you take someone's children
away from them,

316
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,366
you'd be amazed
what they'd do to get them back.

317
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,244
Family members of
the most influential people in the country

318
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:43,041
have been kidnapped
on the very streets they call home.

319
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,960
What does Pablo Escobar want?

320
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,798
I'll see you tomorrow on the same channel
for a special report.

321
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,890
Is everything all right?

322
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:03,978
All the victims are my friends.

323
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:21,787
Excuse me.

324
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,752
The kidnapping of Francisco Santos,

325
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,338
the editor in chief of the most important
newspaper in the nation,

326
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,383
is the latest and most shocking
in a string of kidnappings

327
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,718
orchestrated by the Medellín cartel.

328
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,430
Reporting to you, I'm Valeria Velez.

329
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:43,935
- All right.
- First on the scene, right? As always.

330
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:49,314
Maybe if you actually
had to work for a living,

331
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:51,901
you'd be hungry enough to get here first.

332
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,028
I found out from Santos' wife...

333
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:57,949
a half hour after
he didn't show up for dinner.

334
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,867
You?

335
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:01,953
Who tipped you off?

336
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,290
It's a pleasure to see you,
as always.

337
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,814
These are Pablo's conditions
for the release of the hostages.

338
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:33,900
You've read them,
you can see they're very reasonable.

339
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:35,320
"Very reasonable," he says.

340
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,365
You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando.

341
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,533
And I'm going to tell you something.

342
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:45,746
You will get what you deserve very soon,
I assure you.

343
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,798
I'm also one of those hostages.

344
00:27:56,715 --> 00:28:03,222
I myself could be walking around calmly...
but like them, I am not free.

345
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:11,855
Escobar is asking us to surrender,
but that will never happen.

346
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:17,027
If he releases the hostages
and turns himself in,

347
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,489
we will take this into account.

348
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:24,369
Gaviria isn't going to bend.

349
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,541
Then I'm going to break him.

350
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:39,800
You, get up from there.

351
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:54,148
The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found
dumped next to the Presidential Palace.

352
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,402
One must admire President Gaviria.
I'm sure it can't be easy for him

353
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,613
to stand by his decision
to not negotiate with Escobar.

354
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,033
What's the plan?

355
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:09,330
A few more hostages and they will give in.

356
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:14,459
Their time is running out.

357
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,254
I'm talking about us.

358
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,466
What about us, Valeria?

359
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,807
I don't have time
for that pussy shit right now.

360
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,898
Colombia's sweetheart.

361
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,318
You know the only reason
this hag has any fame

362
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,447
is because her father was president.

363
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,908
I despise her.

364
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,537
And why do you care so much?

365
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,083
Your ratings are through the roof, right?

366
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,253
Hers are higher.

367
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:28,867
Open the door, quick!

368
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,037
Move!

369
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,415
Let's go!

370
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,542
Hurry up!

371
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,961
Where am I?

372
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:25,049
Hello!

373
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,302
Tell me where I am.

374
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:32,305
Does my family know I'm alive?

375
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:33,808
How would I know?

376
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,937
Who are you?

377
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,983
You work for Escobar?

378
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,153
You can call me Gorilla.

379
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,865
Gorilla.

380
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,328
Very well... Gorilla.

381
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,122
Where's my crew?

382
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,501
Did you bring them here as well?

383
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:06,465
I'm here to guard you. That's it.

384
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,285
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.

385
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:38,413
We understand the frustration and pain
you must be feeling for your children,

386
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:42,292
but believe me,
we are doing everything we can

387
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,586
to make sure your children get home soon.

388
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,464
Our daughter was kidnapped
on her way to an interview.

389
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,842
They killed the bodyguard.
No one is safe.

390
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:56,139
As a former president, I understand
the terrible position you're in.

391
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,936
But we're here to find a solution.

392
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,939
I understand your frustration,
Dr. Turbay.

393
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:09,861
But if we give in now, any criminal
can hold our government hostage.

394
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:14,157
This isn't "any criminal."
This is the worst criminal in the world.

395
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,618
- And he is laughing at all of us.
- Mr. President,

396
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:22,081
you're proceeding as you must, but we must
act as the parents of our children.

397
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:24,961
Let's pray you find a solution.

398
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,214
A good president
can stand up to external pressure.

399
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:33,051
It's the internal pressure
that can wear you down.

400
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,724
We knew the clock was ticking before
Gaviria had to cave in to Escobar...

401
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:44,021
but hopefully not before
our unauthorized operation struck gold.

402
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:49,025
Catching a top sicario could be the break
we needed in leading us to Pablo.

403
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,026
Here.

404
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,947
We'd continue to join
in an "observational capacity."

405
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,699
Hands up!

406
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,950
Up!

407
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,952
Why are you driving this car?

408
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,664
I don't know. Someone paid me 50,000 pesos
to drive it around the city.

409
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,458
The sicarios had figured out
we were tracking their rides.

410
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:09,004
So they traded down to junkers
to avoid our eye in the sky.

411
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,131
But we weren't the only ones
that had Pablo in the gun sights.

412
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:14,009
Pablo came to see me.

413
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,176
Why?

414
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:17,721
He wants to settle
the dispute we have in the US.

415
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,222
The Los Angeles problems.

416
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,183
He has bigger issues
than that right now.

417
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:24,728
He'll make a deal with the government.

418
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,982
He's managed to secure
some very effective bargaining chips.

419
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,943
Of course,
he'll look after you guys, right?

420
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:35,406
We haven't talked to Pablo in weeks.
He's in hiding.

421
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,576
Look at that.
What a beautiful animal, Jorge.

422
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,619
You like it?

423
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,829
Yes, of course.

424
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,625
I'm sure he'll look after you.
After all, you're partners.

425
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,544
Yes, of course. Partners.

426
00:34:53,298 --> 00:34:57,928
You could always have your sister
put in a good word with Gustavo.

427
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,805
What do you mean?

428
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,059
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

429
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,021
It could be gossip.
You know how people like to talk.

430
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,697
You should eat,
because you're going to be here a while.

431
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,575
You're going to get very hungry.

432
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,869
I don't feel well.

433
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,623
What's wrong? Are you sick?

434
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,626
I can get you some medicine.

435
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:32,713
It's not that kind of illness.

436
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:40,137
I want to congratulate you.
I know you're a very good reporter.

437
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,765
Thank you.

438
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:47,728
Gorilla, how long have you been
working for Escobar?

439
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,606
Oh, it's been a while.

440
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,068
So you know what's going on out there,
don't you?

441
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,740
The truth is, I don't go out,
so I have no idea what's happening.

442
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:04,535
What the fuck are you doing, Gorilla?
Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?

443
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:05,954
I didn't know you were coming.

444
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,166
Put it on, man!
We have to take her.

445
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:10,417
Put that on.

446
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:15,713
- Says who?
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?

447
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:17,466
Just put it on.

448
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:34,150
Pleasure to finally meet you,
Ms. Turbay.

449
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,277
Sit down, please.

450
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,854
I suppose you want me to interview you?

451
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,481
No, even better.

452
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:18,110
I'm going to interview you.

453
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:22,698
So you can tell the world about
the humane treatment you've received here.

454
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,372
Don't you want your parents
to know you're well?

455
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:33,417
That you're alive?

456
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,967
I don't want to become
a piece of propaganda for you.

457
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,303
Who do you think you are?

458
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,480
So what's necessary, miss,
to have your cooperation?

459
00:38:03,488 --> 00:38:05,532
Let one of the hostages go.

460
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,623
You and I know that
I'm the one you really want.

461
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,055
You see?

462
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:32,392
Two reasonable people
coming to an agreement.

463
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:39,316
Maybe we can convince President Gaviria
to do the same. Right?

464
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,657
Mr. Escobar has shown
a willingness to negotiate.

465
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:51,286
This afternoon,
he let one of the hostages go.

466
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,371
President Gaviria...

467
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:59,086
I ask you to at least
consider discussions with Mr. Escobar.

468
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:05,883
I don't understand.

469
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:08,846
I thought you said he wouldn't bend,
but now he's let one go.

470
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:11,264
Because he has your daughter.

471
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,101
And she's worth more to him
than the rest of them combined.

472
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,982
If you knew all I know, you'd understand
it's nothing more than a stunt.

473
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,774
Give him what he wants.

474
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:24,236
What he wants is an insult to us
and to this country.

475
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:26,155
I don't care. I want my child!

476
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,740
What I believe
my wife is trying to say is,

477
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,661
we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.

478
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:37,041
If you refuse,
we'll have to take certain measures.

479
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:43,671
Financially, by robbing you of donors...
and politically,

480
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:49,094
by robbing you of whatever support
your legislative agenda needs.

481
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:53,682
Are you threatening me?

482
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,060
We all use the tools at our disposal.

483
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,273
You as a politician, me as a father.
I'm sorry.

484
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:04,026
Doctor...

485
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,113
you told me to follow my instincts...

486
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:12,617
and they tell me
not to give in to this criminal.

487
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:15,162
That was before they took my daughter.

488
00:41:00,498 --> 00:41:04,335
I came over as quickly as I could.
I was told you needed me urgently.

489
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,712
What's up?

490
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,132
You OK?

491
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,808
Tell Fernando...
I'm willing to open negotiations.

492
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:22,646
We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.

493
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,399
I thought you weren't going to negotiate.

494
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:33,240
I have to stop this madness, Eduardo.

495
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,787
But God willing,
we can catch him first.

496
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,753
Tell the Americans
they can put their planes in the air.

497
00:41:50,924 --> 00:41:52,883
And there it was.

498
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:56,596
Negotiate with a terrorist while
trying to catch him at the same time.

499
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,187
Hammer, we have calls
originating in Comuna 3,

500
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,730
Manrique, from known
sicario satellite phones.

501
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:08,484
Do you have a location?

502
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,777
What?

503
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,322
Yes, we're here in Campo Valdés.

504
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:16,282
Campo Valdés.

505
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,494
That's in the central eastern area,
bordered by the Comuna Popular.

506
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,037
Roger that.

507
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,497
Campo Valdés.

508
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,500
Going into the comunas
without Colombian backup,

509
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,877
that's about the most dangerous
thing you can do.

510
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,838
We're gonna
score a quick goal and then come back out.

511
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,966
All right, all right. All right.

512
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,760
That's how bad
we wanted to catch these guys.

513
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:39,055
Don't kill me, please!

514
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:43,017
I swear I didn't hear anything!
I'm not going to say anything!

515
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,395
Please, don't kill me.

516
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,147
- I'm not...
- Hey! Hey!

517
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,816
- Please, don't kill me!
- What?

518
00:42:50,817 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm begging you, please...

519
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:03,204
You could have at least waited till
I got her off me. Look at me now! Huh?

520
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,415
You got blood all over my new shoes.

521
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,626
I don't give a shit about your shoes.
Stop bitching.

522
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:11,129
I'm not.

523
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,464
What about her?

524
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:21,390
Put a bullet in her.

525
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,565
What? The baby's not a witness, man.

526
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,899
I don't give a shit.

527
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,735
- Pablo told us to kill everyone.
- Yeah, but it's a baby.

528
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:36,988
She won't say shit in court.

529
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:40,616
If she grows up and talks?

530
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,995
Really? Do you remember
what your mom told you when you were two?

531
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:50,043
Why is it so fucking difficult
for you to follow Pablo's orders? Huh?

532
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,372
Drop the gun.

533
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:52,790
Now!

534
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,051
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

535
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,302
Let him go!

536
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,606
Let him go!

537
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:18,066
- Put the gun down.
- You put yours down.

538
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:21,236
I don't want to have to kill you.

539
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,571
I will.

540
00:46:47,845 --> 00:46:49,889
Fuck.

541
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:00,150
Fuck!

542
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,319
Hey.

543
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,364
Hey...

544
00:48:08,884 --> 00:48:12,389
So those fags want to sit and negotiate.

545
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:15,392
Well...

546
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,562
we have to spend some time in jail, right?

547
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,356
So what the fuck.

548
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,442
You won, Pablo. They gave in.

549
00:48:25,443 --> 00:48:30,823
But that faggot president has yet
to accept our most important demand

550
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,492
before we turn ourselves in.

551
00:48:33,284 --> 00:48:34,910
Which demand is that?

552
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,334
It's been a while
since we've been up here, right?

553
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:43,378
Yeah.

554
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,092
We used to come up here
with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.

555
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:53,555
What does that have to do with anything?

556
00:48:59,352 --> 00:49:02,980
I know every centimeter
of these mountains.

557
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:08,402
From here,
we can see anything coming.

558
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:12,031
And we have enough space
to build whatever we want.

559
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,578
We're going to design it...

560
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,707
we're going to build it...

561
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,961
and we will be protected
from all our enemies.

562
00:49:28,214 --> 00:49:31,760
- You want to build a jail?
- Not a jail, cousin.

563
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,472
A castle.
