1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:04,244
<i>Ever since you began
to build your empire,</i>

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:06,364
you've had a crutch to lean on.

3
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:09,404
<i>Mum, I swear
in the name of Almighty God,</i>

4
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:10,900
<i>I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.</i>

5
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:14,444
That, my friend, is the finest
opium in the world.

6
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:16,084
Perhaps we can meet
after you've spoken

7
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:17,924
<i>to your wife's uncle,
Jack Nelson.</i>

8
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:20,324
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

9
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:22,804
So speak to your uncle
and get me out of here.

10
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:24,284
If he doesn't want to buy
my opium,

11
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,244
I will sell
to the East Boston Jews.

12
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:28,004
It's Ruby. She's not well.

13
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:29,204
I'm coming home.

14
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:38,004
<i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

15
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:39,924
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

16
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:42,284
<i>You've been too busy</i>

17
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:44,364
<i>to punish the people
who killed her.</i>

18
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:46,164
<i>How is the family?</i>

19
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,644
Daddy!

20
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:04,404
Hello, Ruby.

21
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:06,884
Come here.

22
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:08,244
Let me see you.

23
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:09,684
I missed you.

24
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,004
I missed you.

25
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:14,844
There's the Black Madonna.

26
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:16,284
What presents did you get us,
Dad?

27
00:01:16,404 --> 00:01:17,604
Son.

28
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:19,644
She's all better, Tommy.

29
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:21,604
You came back for nothing.

30
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:26,844
But I'm glad you're back.

31
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:30,804
Right,
before we do anything else,

32
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,284
we're going to go for a drive,
OK?

33
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:34,804
- Let's go.
- What about me?

34
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:36,324
Yeah, you can come too, come on.

35
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:38,204
A drive where?

36
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:40,844
I've asked the driver
to take us to see Dr Robert.

37
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:42,684
I want him to have
a look at Ruby.

38
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:43,804
Why, love?

39
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:45,164
The appointment is in one hour.

40
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:46,604
You can stay here
or you can come.

41
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:49,684
Right.

42
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,404
Right, let's go.

43
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:43,364
Tommy?

44
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:44,924
Yeah?

45
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:49,684
It was all good.
Everything was clear.

46
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:52,284
That is a relief.

47
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:54,204
That's a relief.

48
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,324
Yeah.

49
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:57,124
Driver's bringing the car round.

50
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,404
Daddy.

51
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,644
Hiya.

52
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:06,044
Come here.

53
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:14,084
When did you last sleep?

54
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:18,404
Not much since we last spoke
on the phone.

55
00:03:19,684 --> 00:03:22,444
Well, now you know Ruby's
all clear, you can sleep.

56
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:23,804
Yeah.

57
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:29,564
Lizzie, I am very happy
that Ruby's results are clear.

58
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:31,324
But still you won't sleep.

59
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:36,044
I will speak to Johnny
and I will speak to Esmeralda.

60
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,484
We could be on holiday.

61
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:46,964
We could be up a mountain
in America.

62
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:49,444
That wouldn't have been
possible.

63
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,924
The man I'm dealing with
is coming to London.

64
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:54,204
I need to be there.

65
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:56,164
No escape.

66
00:03:58,044 --> 00:03:59,764
We will escape, Lizzie.

67
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:01,684
One last deal to be done.

68
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,244
It'll be difficult.

69
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:04,764
Difficulties are to be expected.

70
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:08,084
This is why I must move
from item to item.

71
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,444
Do you feel that?

72
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:16,924
Do you feel anything?

73
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:20,404
You know, you talk as if
you're watching everything

74
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,684
on a screen.

75
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:27,604
When we go home...
When we go home,

76
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:29,124
we'll give the kids to Frances,

77
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:31,284
and then you and me
will go to bed.

78
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:34,724
And I will be the next item.

79
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:36,764
That's how it feels now, Tommy.

80
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:37,924
Yeah.

81
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,564
Everything on a list.

82
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:47,884
- Hey, baby.
- When are we going home?

83
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:49,204
Soon.

84
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:09,764
Tommy? Tommy!

85
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,524
Tommy? Tommy,
tell me what's happening!

86
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,684
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

87
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:31,124
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

88
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:33,724
Tommy, come here. Come here.

89
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:35,804
What's happening?

90
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,044
<i>Tommy!</i>

91
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,604
It is four years...

92
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,484
...one month and six days
since I had a drink.

93
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:10,804
My head is clear.

94
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:13,884
I am myself.

95
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,164
Is this the first time?

96
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:22,604
Once on the ship back.
Not as bad.

97
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,364
Tommy...

98
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:29,844
...you need to see a doctor.

99
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:33,204
I've work to do.

100
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:37,564
It's the work that's to blame.

101
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:40,364
The people you meet,
the lies that you tell.

102
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:45,644
We're going to keep going until
the Boston business is done.

103
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,204
Then we rest.

104
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:52,124
Then we Peaky Blinders
fucking rest.

105
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:59,844
<i>Comrades, before we end
this planning meeting</i>

106
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,324
and send you out
into the rain...

107
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,044
...we have a surprise.

108
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:08,204
He just arrived back from
a trade mission to America.

109
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:10,884
He came back early
and he has insisted

110
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,204
on addressing you volunteers
in person.

111
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,004
Comrades,

112
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:17,524
your Labour representative
for South Birmingham,

113
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:20,964
Mr Thomas Shelby MP, OBE.

114
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:38,444
Silence, please!

115
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,564
I bring with me...

116
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,524
...on the train from London...

117
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:53,204
...a message from Westminster.

118
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:57,284
No. No, no, no, not a message.

119
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:58,924
Not a message.

120
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:02,524
An instruction, in fact.

121
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:05,924
You must be silent.

122
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:13,364
You must say nothing.

123
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,044
Say nothing

124
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:18,404
about the present situation
in this city.

125
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:21,924
Say nothing about hunger.

126
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,004
Say nothing about jobs.

127
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:26,524
Say nothing about pay.

128
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:29,404
But those in greener pastures,

129
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:32,324
they may speak.

130
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:35,524
They may raise their voices.

131
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:37,644
But here in the smoke,
you men and women,

132
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,804
Irish and Italian

133
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:43,644
and English, who support
the socialist cause...

134
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:46,324
And your socialist cats
and dogs and canaries.

135
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:50,524
...you must hush,

136
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:54,324
because the King
and all the King's horses

137
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:56,324
and all the King's men...

138
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:57,764
...want you to be silent.

139
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:02,004
But it is you, my friends,
who must suffer

140
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:06,164
the cuts in wages
and in welfare and in dignity!

141
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,644
And you must not complain,

142
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,324
because that would be
unpatriotic.

143
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:13,284
You soldiers
who have fought in France,

144
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,644
you are traitors
if you speak up.

145
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,724
You veterans of their wars

146
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:20,124
and their booms and their busts,

147
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,444
it is you
who must take the blows,

148
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:25,164
and carry the burdens
for the sake of

149
00:09:25,284 --> 00:09:28,084
those in greener pastures
who bellow at you...

150
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:31,444
..."Silence!"

151
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,844
Well, watch this, comrades.

152
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,844
I will not be silent.

153
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:38,044
Never!

154
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:39,484
Not this Englishman.

155
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:49,244
No silence from me.

156
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:50,964
No silence from me,

157
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:53,044
because I have heard your voices

158
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:54,644
when you come to me

159
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:58,084
and tell me about the cries
of your hungry children,

160
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:02,044
and I will gather up
every single one of those cries

161
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,444
and I will take 'em with me
on the train

162
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,044
back to Westminster...

163
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:09,060
...and I will let them
out of the bag

164
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:10,444
in the House of Commons,

165
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,724
and let them
try to silence that, eh?

166
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:32,484
Shouldn't<i> that</i> involve
some sharing of the burden?

167
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,244
All of us taking a smaller
slice of the cake, eh?

168
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:40,084
After all, it's bloody us
who bakes the cake

169
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,604
and makes the cars
and melts the metal.

170
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:46,724
And the King, remember him?

171
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,444
The man who ordered all of this.

172
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:51,604
Shouldn't he be taking
some of the cuts?

173
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,444
Eh? Some of the blows?

174
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:57,564
Some of the pain? No or yes?

175
00:10:57,684 --> 00:10:59,164
Yes!

176
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,524
Sh.

177
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:13,884
Hush, you working men and women.

178
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:15,484
Silence.

179
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,684
Good.

180
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,724
Save your voices.

181
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:24,284
You're going to need 'em

182
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:26,684
on Saturday
when we rally together

183
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,764
at the Bull Ring Market...

184
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:30,364
...and together,

185
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:32,524
we'll raise the roof,

186
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:34,724
we'll break
the damned silence...

187
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:39,804
...and bring down
this broken government.

188
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,764
Tommy! Tommy!
Tommy! Tommy!

189
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,084
Thank you.

190
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:01,244
Laura McKee.

191
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:05,364
Battalion Commander,
Fermanagh IRA.

192
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:07,324
You missed the first
and second act.

193
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:09,004
Thank you for coming, Mr Shelby.

194
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:10,284
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:11,724
The third act was enough.

196
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:16,844
You both have reasons to hate me

197
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:18,844
and to want to seek revenge
for the killing...

198
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:20,444
Sh!

199
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:23,804
Gypsy tradition.

200
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:29,644
We do not mention the name
of the dead in company.

201
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:36,364
Laura McKee,

202
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:37,964
in the Shelby family,

203
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:41,444
business comes
before issues of vengeance.

204
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:45,364
Our beloved departed
would understand and approve.

205
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:48,004
Let's go, boys.

206
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:50,244
Our agreement was we meet
in a crowded place.

207
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:51,604
No need for crowds.

208
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,644
We need you alive.

209
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,764
After you.

210
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:22,964
You know, Mr Shelby,

211
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,564
even though we've been doing
business for a while,

212
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:28,244
we've never met in person.

213
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:30,364
You spoke with passion...

214
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:32,644
...and compassion.

215
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,164
You understand forgiveness

216
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,364
and you drink water.

217
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:44,004
Yet I heard
from many reliable sources

218
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:48,284
that you have a reputation
for moral turpitude.

219
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:53,004
Moral turpitude...

220
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:56,644
It's a good name
for a racehorse.

221
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:58,884
You don't know what it means?

222
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:00,204
I know what it means.

223
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:02,364
It means you fuck people.

224
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:06,324
Fuck people over.
Don't give a fuck.

225
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:07,924
It means you covet and steal

226
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:11,044
and burn all principles
for the sake of self-interest.

227
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:16,164
Well, I'm changing, Laura McKee,

228
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,364
and my organisation
is also changing.

229
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:24,964
So, what happened in Boston?

230
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:28,244
Jack Nelson said no.

231
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:31,204
Are we accepting no
as an answer?

232
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:35,484
These are letters...

233
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:37,764
...written to and by
Jack Nelson

234
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:39,444
over the last three months.

235
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:53,724
This...

236
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:55,964
This is a private letter

237
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:58,244
from the President
of the United States.

238
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,884
Where the fuck did you get this?

239
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,124
My racehorse, Moral Turpitude,

240
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:06,764
is just one of many
in my stables.

241
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:10,284
Sometimes, even now,
I'll take her out for a run

242
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:13,964
if there is a good cause
that requires her services.

243
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:20,444
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

244
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:24,684
Officially, he's coming
to buy liquor import licences.

245
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:27,564
Unofficially, he's on
a fact-finding mission.

246
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,044
He's come to measure

247
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,484
the strength of support
for fascism in Britain.

248
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:35,044
He'll report back
to the President.

249
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:38,564
And how does that help us?

250
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,444
In this letter to his son,

251
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:47,964
Jack Nelson expresses
strong support for fascism.

252
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,524
In this letter
to a friend in Berlin,

253
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:55,964
he says some, erm,
interesting things about Jews.

254
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,564
He's not coming to Europe
to find facts.

255
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:03,324
He's coming to find proof
that fascism will prevail.

256
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:05,804
And you and I...

257
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,244
...are going
to help him in that task.

258
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:16,244
I thought you were a socialist.

259
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,044
Well...

260
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:21,564
...since I've entered politics,

261
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,764
I've learned that
the line doesn't go out

262
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,164
from the middle to the left
and the right.

263
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,284
It goes in a circle.

264
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,804
I'll show you.

265
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,804
You go far enough left,

266
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:39,164
eventually you'll meet someone
who has gone far enough right

267
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:40,884
to get to the same place.

268
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:45,404
Working-class socialists
like me,

269
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:47,644
working-class nationalists
like you.

270
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:48,964
The result?

271
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:50,644
National Socialism.

272
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:54,284
And that's me...

273
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:57,124
...in the middle.

274
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:01,004
Just a man trying to make
an honest living

275
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:03,444
in a very dark world.

276
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:09,404
You have friends in Dublin,
Laura McKee,

277
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:13,404
who are actively fighting
for a fascist Ireland,

278
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:16,804
and you are acting
on their behalf, ain't you?

279
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:21,124
When Jack Nelson
comes to London,

280
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:25,084
I can give him access
to Oswald Mosley

281
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:26,924
and to fascist sympathisers

282
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:29,684
in the House of Commons
and the House of Lords,

283
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:31,844
on both sides of the divide.

284
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:34,164
Fascism is quite the thing...

285
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:37,924
...among the very best people.

286
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:43,044
And with your help,
I can also offer him Dublin.

287
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:49,844
And you think this will allow
us to ship our merchandise

288
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,564
to Boston?

289
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,364
Perhaps.

290
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:56,324
There may be other benefits
for your cause.

291
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:01,804
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

292
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:04,964
and talk to him about
a new golden age,

293
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,684
and let him put a pin
in the map of Ireland

294
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:10,124
for the President
of the United States.

295
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:22,964
I came to collect Arthur
and put him to bed.

296
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:27,044
I found him in Garrison Lane
with a syringe in his hand.

297
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:34,724
A friend loves at all time.

298
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,884
A brother is born for adversity.

299
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,284
Proverbs 17:17.

300
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:46,084
I have two brothers in need,

301
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:47,884
but yours is the more urgent,
Tommy.

302
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,644
Will you come with me?

303
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,604
So, Laura McKee...

304
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:57,004
...are you going to help me
change the world?

305
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:03,204
Mr Shelby, this meeting
is not what I expected.

306
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:04,564
Never is.

307
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,684
Is that a yes or a no?

308
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,444
My answer's yes.

309
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:14,444
The answer's always yes.

310
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:19,684
The back door is unlocked.
You can let yourself out.

311
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:22,884
And tell your friends
back home -

312
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:24,764
Tommy Shelby has changed.

313
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,724
Where is he?

314
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:34,604
When I found him,
the syringe was empty.

315
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:36,564
He's sleeping it off
on the cobbles.

316
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:39,044
Shit, Tommy. Shit.

317
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:40,484
It's all under control, Ada.

318
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:42,884
Well, <i>I'm</i> not under
fucking control!

319
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:47,204
I'm not you, Tommy,
and I'm not Polly either.

320
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:49,164
Even though I'm trying to be.

321
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:50,524
She would have stopped this.

322
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:52,284
We will pull Arthur
through this.

323
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:54,764
I'm not talking about Arthur,
I'm talking about you!

324
00:19:54,884 --> 00:19:57,684
I heard everything
you were saying in there.

325
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:00,324
Ada, this will be the end
of it, do you hear me?

326
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:01,884
This is the way out
for all of us,

327
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,564
and along the way,
I will be doing good.

328
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:04,644
No, along the way,

329
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:06,460
you're going to make yourself
a lot of fucking money.

330
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:08,004
All right, fair enough.

331
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,124
Any incidental rewards for
my good work will be welcome.

332
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,844
But you will get
your fair share, sister.

333
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:14,860
And by being among the fascists,

334
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:17,364
by being among 'em,
I can undermine them.

335
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:19,844
Polly would approve.

336
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:22,724
Beneath all the gold
and diamonds

337
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:24,964
and fucking... fucking mink
and lace,

338
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,844
she was a solid socialist.

339
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:35,724
Look, I know it's too late
for this, Tom, but...

340
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,564
This doorway.

341
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,444
This same fucking doorway.

342
00:20:42,244 --> 00:20:44,604
We used to come here
for Dad's beer.

343
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:48,164
And we were so little, it took
two of us carry one bucket.

344
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:52,244
Yeah, I remember.

345
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:58,004
Look at us now, eh?

346
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,124
Yeah. Fucking look at us.

347
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:02,724
Take a good look, Tom,

348
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,604
cos one of us isn't going
to be here for long.

349
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,484
Fuck! Opium and presidents!

350
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:19,324
Ada, if you don't want
to help me carry the bucket...

351
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,324
...then I wouldn't blame you.

352
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:27,804
But this is my mission.

353
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:30,404
And I will have no limitations.

354
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:35,564
Where are you, Tom?

355
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:38,204
Hmm?

356
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:39,844
My big brother?

357
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:44,764
You know, you used to stop
sometimes and laugh.

358
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:48,444
Do you even remember this place?

359
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:52,084
You walk into The Garrison
like a stranger

360
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:54,204
and you sip fucking water.

361
00:21:58,644 --> 00:21:59,964
But I'm alive, Ada.

362
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:04,484
Yeah.

363
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:07,604
And you're still looking for
trouble big enough to kill you.

364
00:22:10,244 --> 00:22:11,284
Well...

365
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:14,364
...I think
you might have found it.

366
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,884
I have children, Tommy.

367
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:23,724
You have to carry
this bucket on your own.

368
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:30,404
One brother half-dead in
the rain in Garrison alley,

369
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:32,804
and the other
has no limitations.

370
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:07,124
I'm expected.

371
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:29,284
Oh, and Mr Solomons
no longer tolerates

372
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:31,724
the smoking of tobacco
in his presence.

373
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:18,164
I always thought that opera

374
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:20,684
was just fat people
fucking shouting.

375
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:23,404
Yeah? What do you think now?

376
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:29,844
I think the sound of a tenor
in full passion

377
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:33,364
reminds me of the crying out
of Italian soldiers

378
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:35,444
when they had my bayonet
inside them.

379
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:38,764
Ever since my own death,

380
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:42,124
I have been somewhat
haunted by it.

381
00:24:43,164 --> 00:24:45,004
Dear me.

382
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:49,684
But instead of fighting
these voices,

383
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:51,844
I decided to write
their songs down,

384
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:54,124
you know, and turn them
into an opera of my own.

385
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,444
Do not light that.

386
00:24:55,564 --> 00:24:59,404
No. No. Were you not told?
I have a condition.

387
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:01,844
What I was told, Alfie...

388
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:08,644
...is that you have withdrawn

389
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:11,244
and that you spend your days
alone...

390
00:25:14,124 --> 00:25:16,484
...obsessing
about opera singers.

391
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:18,364
Opera's not fucking singing,
is it?

392
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:21,804
It's not singing.

393
00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:23,804
It is the sound
that people make...

394
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:26,564
...before words.

395
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,564
And I do not allow smoking

396
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:31,484
because I do need to see
fucking clearly,

397
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:32,804
all right?

398
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:42,084
What, do you sense weakness
in the Israelite?

399
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:43,884
Not a sense of weakness,
no, Alfie.

400
00:25:44,004 --> 00:25:46,364
- Huh?
- A certain knowledge of it.

401
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:51,404
Since you've been sat here,
writing your opera...

402
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:57,484
...a member of your family
has died.

403
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,204
Charles Solomons. Your uncle.

404
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:03,764
He ran all the narcotics,
bootlegging,

405
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:05,564
prostitution,
gambling syndicates

406
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:07,084
out of East Boston.

407
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:10,524
But last January,
poor old Charlie, well...

408
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:14,884
...he was shot
in the Cotton Club,

409
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:16,324
in the lavatory,

410
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:18,964
by men that you know,

411
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,644
and yet you did nothing, Alfie.

412
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:30,124
Now, my opera is called <i>America.</i>

413
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:33,524
<i>America</i> is my fucking
masterpiece!

414
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:37,524
The truth is,
your uncle is dead...

415
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,964
...Boston is gone...

416
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:42,564
...and you,

417
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,284
once the big man
who ran Camden Town...

418
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:51,644
...now can't even extinguish
another man's cigarette...

419
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:55,804
...let alone his fucking life.

420
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:57,404
You need favours,

421
00:26:57,524 --> 00:26:59,124
- Alfie.
- I need

422
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,964
a fucking final act, right?

423
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:04,804
Just a final fucking act
for my opera.

424
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,164
Yeah?

425
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:09,004
Alfie...

426
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:13,444
I think I may have
written your final act.

427
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:18,124
Why don't you sit down
and have a listen, eh?

428
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:47,764
I have five tons of pure,
refined opium

429
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:51,044
sitting in one of my warehouses
in Liverpool.

430
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:56,404
I have safe storage
off the coast of Canada.

431
00:27:56,524 --> 00:28:02,084
I have men willing
to distribute it in Toronto,

432
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:05,044
Quebec, New York and Boston.

433
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:07,924
The income would be immediate

434
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:10,284
and would shift the balance
of power in Boston

435
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:12,844
back in the favour
of the Solomons family.

436
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:24,004
In the final act
that I am giving you, Alfie,

437
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:26,684
it is you who takes the revenge.

438
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:30,604
Why would you sell?

439
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:34,044
The Irish are being difficult.

440
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:35,484
The Italians are not an option.

441
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:38,524
Also, Alfie, you are my friend.

442
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:40,164
Pay you with credit?

443
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,284
- No.
- Oh...

444
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:43,844
I will take property.

445
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:46,924
You own half the warehouses
in Camden.

446
00:28:47,044 --> 00:28:49,204
I'll take 'em
and knock 'em down,

447
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:52,164
build houses for the needy
and the deserving.

448
00:28:52,284 --> 00:28:53,604
Oh.

449
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,604
Yeah, well, the, erm...

450
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:04,604
The Irish have always been
difficult, Tommy, ain't they?

451
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:07,324
For about fucking 700 years.

452
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:11,924
You know that I once saw
an Irishman

453
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:15,604
arguing with the statue
of Oliver Cromwell

454
00:29:15,724 --> 00:29:17,164
in Parliament Square.

455
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,204
The argument went on
for quite a while, actually.

456
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,324
It went into the night,

457
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:22,404
as his little voice echoed
all around

458
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:24,004
the Houses of Parliament

459
00:29:24,124 --> 00:29:26,564
as he got more and more angered

460
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:29,204
Oliver Cromwell
was reluctant somewhat

461
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:31,884
to answer
his legitimate questions,

462
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,884
so angered, in fact,
that eventually he punched

463
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:38,204
the statue on the nose

464
00:29:38,324 --> 00:29:41,684
and broke his fucking hand.

465
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:46,204
And there it is, you know,
the Irish question, innit?

466
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:50,164
How come
you can remember so much

467
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:52,564
about what happened
200 years ago,

468
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:54,084
but you just can't remember

469
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:56,004
what fucking happened
last night?

470
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:05,124
How much is a ton?

471
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:08,044
Johnny.

472
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:13,004
Only me today.

473
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:18,444
Jack says a few more weeks...

474
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:23,484
...then you'll be free.

475
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,404
When do you travel to London?

476
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:33,204
Tomorrow.

477
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:36,764
I came to say goodbye.

478
00:30:48,924 --> 00:30:53,764
When you go to London,
stay away from the devil.

479
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:56,364
Block your fucking ears,
if you have to.

480
00:30:56,484 --> 00:30:59,164
I'll be with you, Michael.

481
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:02,404
I've been thinking about you.

482
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,764
Only you.

483
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:14,484
And don't worry
about Tommy Shelby.

484
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:19,644
I have no interest
in a dead man.

485
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,364
Jack says he has to die.

486
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,084
Well, you tell Jack to wait.

487
00:31:28,284 --> 00:31:29,964
If anyone's going to kill
Tommy Shelby...

488
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:31,404
It will be you.

489
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:33,524
I know.

490
00:31:34,564 --> 00:31:35,564
I told Jack.

491
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:39,284
And Jack said, "OK.

492
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:41,364
"Let the kid do it."

493
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:47,284
And in return, he can collect
the cash that Tommy won't.

494
00:31:48,964 --> 00:31:52,644
$5 million.

495
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:56,164
The devil will be dead.

496
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:59,444
The future belongs to us.

497
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:03,364
Oh, and, uh, Michael...

498
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:07,604
Every night...

499
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:11,564
...midnight in Boston,
5am in London...

500
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:16,844
...I'll be wide awake
in my big, wide bed,

501
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:19,884
and you'll be wide awake
in this prison cell.

502
00:32:22,284 --> 00:32:24,484
And our souls
will come together...

503
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:26,124
...and we'll fuck.

504
00:32:28,164 --> 00:32:29,964
I won't need an alarm clock.

505
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,324
And you won't sleep
until I'm done.

506
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:37,164
Midnight fucks 5am.

507
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,164
Every day.

508
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:48,924
Because we trust each other.

509
00:32:50,124 --> 00:32:51,644
Hmm?

510
00:33:27,564 --> 00:33:30,884
You're a fucking traitor,
Shelby! You're a fucking...

511
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:47,284
Darker.

512
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,924
Bluer.

513
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:52,764
Sharper.

514
00:33:53,884 --> 00:33:55,244
I want to see it from below.

515
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,604
Darling, how's that?

516
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:02,684
You look absolutely terrifying,
my love.

517
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:15,244
Fuck lipstick.

518
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,324
Fun.

519
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:24,604
To launch the ship.

520
00:34:33,644 --> 00:34:36,324
A long and terrible journey,
Diana.

521
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:40,764
Don't fucking let me down.

522
00:34:46,924 --> 00:34:48,764
Mr Shelby!

523
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:49,884
Mr Shelby!

524
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,364
<i>Daily Mirror.</i>

525
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:52,804
- Mr Shelby!
- Off!

526
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,444
May I ask why a socialist MP

527
00:34:54,564 --> 00:34:56,724
would attend a fascist rally,
sir?

528
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,284
Let him in,
let me answer the question.

529
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:01,844
Mr Mosley's constituency
borders my own.

530
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:03,844
We have worked together
in the past.

531
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:05,524
He was once a socialist himself.

532
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:07,324
My role here tonight

533
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:10,084
is to... to act as a bridge

534
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:11,964
between ideologies.

535
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,244
I'm in the middle.

536
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:17,564
Mr Shelby, you once shared
a platform with Mr Mosley.

537
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:20,084
Will you be sharing the stage
with him tonight?

538
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:23,324
No. I am simply here
to remind my friend, Mr Mosley,

539
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:25,364
that the way of the British
people is compromise.

540
00:35:26,484 --> 00:35:28,204
And you can print that, pal.

541
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:31,004
Fucking rag.

542
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:40,124
Lizzie, you should know

543
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:42,604
that Mosley's wife died
six months ago.

544
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,204
So give him your condolences,
will you?

545
00:35:45,324 --> 00:35:48,124
Tonight,
he will be with his mistress,

546
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:51,044
who is apparently
a lady of some standing...

547
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:55,764
...and has given him great
comfort in his time of grief.

548
00:35:56,964 --> 00:36:00,164
Fuck off, you dozy bastard!

549
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:02,284
Move out my fucking way.

550
00:36:02,404 --> 00:36:04,084
What is Arthur doing here?

551
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,284
Mosley invited him. I agreed.

552
00:36:06,404 --> 00:36:08,124
Arthur made me a promise,

553
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,564
which he appears to have broken.

554
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,844
Move! I said fucking move.

555
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:20,164
I tried my best.
He's hid some junk in his sock.

556
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:22,084
- OK.
- Move along.

557
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:24,764
Oi!

558
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:26,324
- Oi, Tommy!
- Come on!

559
00:36:26,444 --> 00:36:28,484
- Tommy!
- You're in! You're in.

560
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,204
- Come on, you're in.
- My brother.

561
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:31,484
- Tommy!
- Yeah.

562
00:36:31,604 --> 00:36:33,164
Johnny Dogs.

563
00:36:33,284 --> 00:36:34,684
Mosley invited me.

564
00:36:34,804 --> 00:36:37,044
He said,
"Wear a black fucking shirt."

565
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:38,204
Here you are.

566
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:40,404
I said, "I'd look like
every other bastard."

567
00:36:40,524 --> 00:36:41,724
Lizzie!

568
00:36:41,844 --> 00:36:43,164
- Come on.
- For fuck's sake.

569
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,764
You're an angel. I know
I've fucking let you down.

570
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:48,964
I've fucking let you down,
I know I have. All right?

571
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,364
I've fucking said sorry
a million times

572
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:53,100
and I'll say it again.
I'm sorry, all right?

573
00:36:53,124 --> 00:36:54,884
- Yeah.
- I'm fucking sorry.

574
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,204
Look at Johnny Dogs.

575
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:58,484
Fucking look
at the state of him.

576
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:00,884
He looks like a fucking waiter.

577
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:03,244
- Oh, shut up.
- Get me a fucking drink.

578
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:05,884
Johnny, take your shirt off
and give it to me.

579
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,324
For fuck's sake, Tommy.

580
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:09,684
Take your fucking shirt off
and give it me now.

581
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:11,084
Get it off!

582
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:13,764
Arthur, this is my fault.

583
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:16,564
- This is my fault.
- Yeah.

584
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:20,124
Remember, we voted on getting
involved in the opium trade?

585
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:22,004
- You voted no.
- I said no.

586
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:24,124
Remember? I overruled you.

587
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,484
I've not been here,
I've been away.

588
00:37:26,604 --> 00:37:27,604
Where you been, Tom?

589
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:29,340
And Ada tells me you've been
hanging out with Mosley.

590
00:37:29,364 --> 00:37:30,764
- Yeah, he's...
- Yeah?

591
00:37:30,884 --> 00:37:33,124
In his big, beautiful
fucking house.

592
00:37:33,244 --> 00:37:35,404
And they have parties there,
in Belgravia.

593
00:37:35,524 --> 00:37:38,044
And they give me
fucking respect.

594
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:39,444
Yeah?
And what do you give them?

595
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:40,804
Snow and junk from the company.

596
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:41,924
Hang on.

597
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:43,204
Look at you, brother.

598
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:45,764
Half of you's gone.
Half of you's gone.

599
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:49,404
- What the fuck?
- Rag and bone.

600
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:53,164
You fucking slapped me.

601
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:56,684
You slapped me.

602
00:37:56,804 --> 00:37:59,884
I have to remain unresolved.
Do you understand?

603
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:03,164
Unresolved.
Unresolved in everything.

604
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:05,644
I have to move between left
and right, light and shade,

605
00:38:05,764 --> 00:38:07,684
and maintain the trust of both.

606
00:38:07,804 --> 00:38:10,364
And I cannot have my brother
wearing a fucking black shirt

607
00:38:10,484 --> 00:38:12,084
on the cover
of the <i>Daily Mirror.</i>

608
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:14,084
If anyone takes my picture
in this,

609
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:17,324
they'll find their fucking
camera under my heel, Tom.

610
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:19,324
They are throwing petrol bombs
out there, Tommy.

611
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:21,244
I thought Ada was
taking care of you.

612
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:23,924
Ada's got decisions to make
about working with us.

613
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:25,964
She doesn't know what she wants.

614
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,804
I'll speak to Ada.

615
00:38:27,924 --> 00:38:29,724
Listen, I'm going home,
all right?

616
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:31,164
No, you stay there.

617
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:33,084
I have something for you.

618
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:34,524
Lizzie, you can go in
with Johnny.

619
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:36,044
Johnny, take Lizzie to her seat.

620
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:37,724
But I don't have an invitation,
Tom.

621
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:39,460
Johnny, you're wearing
a fucking black shirt,

622
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,804
you can do what you like.
Go on. I'll follow you. Go on.

623
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:45,404
Go on, Dogs.

624
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,844
And get me a fucking drink
while you're there.

625
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:54,244
I know, Tom. Look at me.

626
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:57,764
Arthur, before I went
to America,

627
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,284
I wrote a letter.

628
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:00,924
Yeah? Who to?

629
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:02,524
To Linda.

630
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:07,284
And in that letter, I wrote,

631
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:11,044
"Linda, as a Christian woman,

632
00:39:11,164 --> 00:39:13,244
"do you believe
in forgiveness?"

633
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,244
And this is what I got back.

634
00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:20,484
Two days ago. Have a look.

635
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:33,004
"As a Christian woman,

636
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:34,844
"I do believe in forgiveness."

637
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:37,524
Yeah, and the word do
is underlined.

638
00:39:41,284 --> 00:39:42,844
Arthur, I'm no Christian.

639
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:46,164
But I also believe
in forgiveness.

640
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:50,404
So, get yourself clean,

641
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:51,964
stay clean for two weeks,

642
00:39:52,084 --> 00:39:54,124
I'll write Linda another letter.

643
00:39:57,364 --> 00:39:59,164
Cos I know where she is.

644
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:04,524
First, I need you back.

645
00:40:05,844 --> 00:40:07,284
I need my brother.

646
00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:10,444
I have a lot to do.

647
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:12,724
Need someone
to do the real work.

648
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,444
Yeah.

649
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:16,444
Yeah. Look at your smile, Tom.

650
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:18,444
Look at your smile, brother.

651
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:19,724
It's been so long.

652
00:40:19,844 --> 00:40:22,764
Come on. Let's see what this
bastard has to say. Come on.

653
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:25,484
- All right. All right.
- Come on.

654
00:40:25,604 --> 00:40:26,924
Yeah, I'm coming.

655
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:29,324
He is a bastard an' all, Tommy.

656
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:33,044
Black shirts and Jews.
Here we go. Here we fucking go.

657
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,684
Stay in the middle
and do nothing, Tommy.

658
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:39,684
But not fucking me.

659
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,364
Come here, you,
you Nazi bastard!

660
00:40:58,324 --> 00:41:00,844
Come here, man,
I'll take your fucking eye.

661
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,444
Not here! <i>Not</i> here!

662
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,604
Come here. You've had your fun,
now let's go home.

663
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:10,924
We have business.

664
00:41:13,524 --> 00:41:15,724
Johnny, you get him home.

665
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:18,244
This time,
check his fucking socks.

666
00:41:23,924 --> 00:41:25,124
For fuck's sake!

667
00:41:31,484 --> 00:41:32,884
Tommy, we should get out now.

668
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:35,964
Forget this American business.
We've got enough.

669
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:38,404
Not near enough.
Here she comes.

670
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:40,484
Remember to smile. Come on.

671
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:41,924
Shit.

672
00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:53,524
Ladies and gentlemen,

673
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,444
tonight, he has truly earned
your adulation.

674
00:41:56,564 --> 00:42:00,004
The future Prime Minister
of this great country,

675
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:01,404
Sir Oswald Mosley!

676
00:42:05,244 --> 00:42:06,524
Fuck you, Mosley!

677
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:40,164
Fuck. I look terrible.

678
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:43,044
You look beautiful, Lizzie.
I need to impress this woman,

679
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:45,484
so I will act
as if she is beautiful as well.

680
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,244
Mosley.

681
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:51,244
Diana,

682
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:55,964
this is Tommy Shelby MP, OBE.

683
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:58,124
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

684
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:01,044
Oswald's most recent
and last-ever mistress.

685
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:03,284
This is my wife, Lizzie Shelby.

686
00:43:03,404 --> 00:43:04,444
Beautiful earrings.

687
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:06,044
Oh, I stole them from Tiffany's.

688
00:43:06,164 --> 00:43:08,644
Actually, he bought
the earrings in Paris.

689
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:10,484
We were in Paris
on our honeymoon.

690
00:43:10,604 --> 00:43:12,044
- God, I hate Paris.
- Hmm.

691
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:13,324
I hear you prefer Berlin.

692
00:43:13,444 --> 00:43:16,164
Oswald and I are going to marry
there, aren't we, Oswald?

693
00:43:16,284 --> 00:43:17,444
Hmm.

694
00:43:17,564 --> 00:43:20,244
Mosley, I have business
to discuss.

695
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,804
Perhaps you and I could find
somewhere a bit quieter, eh?

696
00:43:23,924 --> 00:43:27,684
Darling, Mr Shelby just made
the astonishing suggestion

697
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:30,004
that we men go off
and discuss business

698
00:43:30,124 --> 00:43:32,364
while you women wait around
looking glamorous.

699
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,244
Goodness.

700
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:37,484
What year do you think this is,
Mr Shelby? 1807?

701
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:41,404
In Birmingham, the centuries
grind by quite slowly.

702
00:43:41,524 --> 00:43:43,684
But, Mr Shelby,
if it's business,

703
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:46,164
Diana is the engine
of my enterprise.

704
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:48,204
It's the modern way, Mr Shelby.

705
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:51,404
Yes, we know.
I am company director.

706
00:43:51,524 --> 00:43:52,924
I will join the meeting as well.

707
00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:55,284
But of course, you <i>must</i> come
as well, Elizabeth.

708
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:57,444
By the way,
I really don't like "Lizzie".

709
00:43:57,564 --> 00:43:59,724
I prefer liberated "Elizabeth".

710
00:43:59,844 --> 00:44:01,404
She must be part of this.

711
00:44:01,524 --> 00:44:03,004
She's been all the way to Paris,

712
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:04,764
so she is a woman of the world.
Bravo.

713
00:44:04,884 --> 00:44:08,124
Do you know, Oswald has told me
everything about you...

714
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,764
Only three...

715
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:25,684
...because I know
these days Mr Shelby doesn't.

716
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:27,564
Our friend in Berlin
doesn't either.

717
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:29,404
Well, they have <i>that</i> in common,
at least.

718
00:44:29,524 --> 00:44:31,844
Oh, I imagine
they have lots in common.

719
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:33,124
Hmm.

720
00:44:34,764 --> 00:44:36,324
Report to me, Shelby.

721
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:39,564
Officially,
Jack Nelson is in London

722
00:44:39,684 --> 00:44:41,124
to buy import licences.

723
00:44:44,044 --> 00:44:47,124
And unofficially,
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

724
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:50,364
Well, as you can see
from this private letter...

725
00:44:51,844 --> 00:44:54,604
...he is far
from a neutral point of view.

726
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,324
Look at the bottom
of the second paragraph.

727
00:45:00,444 --> 00:45:04,164
"Individually Jews are fine,
but as a race they stink."

728
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,724
Hmm.

729
00:45:05,844 --> 00:45:09,484
Elizabeth, do you even know
why the bridge

730
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,964
to President Roosevelt
is so important?

731
00:45:14,524 --> 00:45:16,564
Actually, no.

732
00:45:16,684 --> 00:45:19,844
I don't really know much
about this business at all.

733
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:26,724
But I have fucked
your future husband,

734
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:29,124
so I know lots of things
about him.

735
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,204
Tommy, I'll be outside.

736
00:45:34,684 --> 00:45:36,524
Well done, Elizabeth.

737
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,484
Do you people want
to meet Nelson or no?

738
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:47,524
Mr Shelby, from now on,
can I call you Thomas?

739
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,084
If you like.

740
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,564
Of course we would.

741
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:53,404
And we are very grateful
for your efforts.

742
00:45:53,524 --> 00:45:55,324
But, Mr Shelby,

743
00:45:55,444 --> 00:45:58,204
before this <i>enterprise</i>
goes any further,

744
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:01,284
you really must do
something about your wife.

745
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:30,244
Mr Shelby.

746
00:46:30,364 --> 00:46:31,644
Yes.

747
00:46:31,764 --> 00:46:34,044
Mr Nelson.

748
00:46:34,164 --> 00:46:35,524
I came early.

749
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,124
I wanted to come and take a look

750
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:40,284
around this beautiful church.

751
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:44,004
You're Catholic, Mr Shelby.

752
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:47,724
I hoped that by suggesting
we meet in church,

753
00:46:47,844 --> 00:46:51,084
it might make us both
more... cautious

754
00:46:51,204 --> 00:46:52,964
with lies and truth.

755
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:55,404
Well, your hope
would be forlorn.

756
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:59,124
There ain't no-one listening
here.

757
00:46:59,244 --> 00:47:00,924
You don't believe in God?

758
00:47:01,044 --> 00:47:02,204
No.

759
00:47:04,924 --> 00:47:07,644
It was the way Catholics
were treated in my country

760
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:09,564
that made me angry.

761
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:12,524
Made me what I became.

762
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:18,284
What made you angry?

763
00:47:20,764 --> 00:47:24,124
Slowness... in anything.

764
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,804
I wanted to have everything
already.

765
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:34,844
Two working-class Catholic boys.

766
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:40,044
Did they mess with you
when you were small?

767
00:47:41,364 --> 00:47:43,244
Some man in the shadows.

768
00:47:44,724 --> 00:47:47,124
I carried a screwdriver
and a blade,

769
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:50,844
and everyone believed
I had the power to lay curses.

770
00:47:50,964 --> 00:47:52,524
And do you?

771
00:47:52,644 --> 00:47:54,444
Yes, I do.

772
00:47:57,164 --> 00:47:59,604
First man I killed was a priest.

773
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:02,764
You?

774
00:48:03,844 --> 00:48:05,924
A Prussian boy with green eyes.

775
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:08,004
He was already underground.

776
00:48:08,124 --> 00:48:10,684
When did you last kill a man,
Mr Shelby?

777
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:16,644
Four years ago.

778
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:20,964
His name was Thomas Shelby.

779
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,884
He drank whiskey.

780
00:48:26,484 --> 00:48:30,644
You want me to allow you
to enter my city

781
00:48:30,764 --> 00:48:33,324
and deal narcotics
that'll kill people?

782
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:40,044
You deal in whiskey, Mr Nelson.

783
00:48:41,644 --> 00:48:44,564
I recently read a report
by the Vatican, actually,

784
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:47,244
which said that whiskey
disproportionately kills

785
00:48:47,364 --> 00:48:50,044
more of our Catholic brothers
and sisters,

786
00:48:50,164 --> 00:48:53,404
whereas opium is the sedative

787
00:48:53,524 --> 00:48:57,404
more often chosen
by Protestants and atheists.

788
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:02,244
In return,
there are people in England

789
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:03,564
who you think I should meet?

790
00:49:03,684 --> 00:49:05,164
Yes.

791
00:49:05,284 --> 00:49:06,604
Yes, like minds.

792
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:13,564
I'm here to buy import licences
for booze.

793
00:49:14,844 --> 00:49:17,004
The booze
of the blue blood elite.

794
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:23,204
In America, we... we like
labels and aspiration.

795
00:49:23,324 --> 00:49:27,684
Well, I have a brand of my own
vodka and gin.

796
00:49:27,804 --> 00:49:29,764
You can add that
to your portfolio.

797
00:49:30,964 --> 00:49:34,164
I hear Shelby labels are
favoured by the working class.

798
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:37,204
Indeed.
A fact of which I'm very proud.

799
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:40,684
They say you are a poet, too.

800
00:49:40,804 --> 00:49:43,764
No, I only read it.

801
00:49:45,044 --> 00:49:49,004
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

802
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:53,724
Fascists.

803
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:56,404
Not the ones in boots
and black shirts.

804
00:49:56,524 --> 00:49:58,484
The ones in tuxedos.

805
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:02,004
I know men who are friends
of the cause.

806
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:05,684
I also know men who are enemies
of the cause.

807
00:50:05,804 --> 00:50:07,724
For many years now,

808
00:50:07,844 --> 00:50:09,820
I have been working closely
with Winston Churchill,

809
00:50:09,844 --> 00:50:11,604
in many different capacities.

810
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:13,924
I have his trust.

811
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,324
He's opposed
to the rise of fascism.

812
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:19,564
You, I believe,
see it as inevitable.

813
00:50:21,124 --> 00:50:23,244
Well, I can give you
men of influence

814
00:50:23,364 --> 00:50:25,164
who support your cause.

815
00:50:25,284 --> 00:50:27,484
I can also offer you
a full report

816
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:29,844
on Churchill's strategies.

817
00:50:33,004 --> 00:50:36,244
All this in return for access
to South Boston?

818
00:50:36,364 --> 00:50:37,884
Alternatively,

819
00:50:38,004 --> 00:50:41,084
you can take on Churchill
on your own,

820
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,884
without my intelligence,

821
00:50:43,004 --> 00:50:45,524
and I can sell my opium
to the Jews.

822
00:50:50,324 --> 00:50:52,924
You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.

823
00:50:54,524 --> 00:50:57,324
A war hero, I hear.

824
00:50:57,444 --> 00:50:59,684
Every war hero I ever met,

825
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:02,364
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

826
00:51:06,084 --> 00:51:09,284
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

827
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:15,964
I'll think a great deal
about what you've said.

828
00:51:29,364 --> 00:51:32,924
Ruby, have you finished
your spelling, love?

829
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:48,684
Ruby?

830
00:51:49,884 --> 00:51:51,524
Ruby?

831
00:51:56,924 --> 00:51:58,804
Ruby?

832
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:04,164
Ruby?

833
00:52:05,524 --> 00:52:07,604
What are you doing, love?

834
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:09,604
I can hear voices...

835
00:52:10,924 --> 00:52:12,684
...coming from up the chimney.

836
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:17,164
What voices?

837
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:18,724
The grey man.

838
00:52:23,004 --> 00:52:24,364
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

839
00:52:24,484 --> 00:52:26,444
Mr Thomas Shelby.

840
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:28,564
Birmingham South.

841
00:52:30,684 --> 00:52:33,764
Mr Speaker.
I was raised in a family

842
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,684
that endured living conditions
that would test

843
00:52:36,804 --> 00:52:39,724
the morality of
even the most virtuous.

844
00:52:39,844 --> 00:52:41,004
Indeed...

845
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:44,564
Indeed, even the best of us
would have our virtues trounced

846
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:47,044
and thwarted by life
in the meanness

847
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,124
and the bitterness of
an overcrowded British slum.

848
00:52:50,244 --> 00:52:52,844
What would you know
about virtue?

849
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:00,364
Quickly, please.

850
00:53:02,604 --> 00:53:06,084
Therefore, Mr Speaker, I intend
to put before this House

851
00:53:06,204 --> 00:53:08,844
a bill which will offer
radical reform

852
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:11,684
in housing policy
in this country,

853
00:53:11,804 --> 00:53:13,724
in which slums are cleared,

854
00:53:13,844 --> 00:53:15,924
new houses are built

855
00:53:16,044 --> 00:53:19,364
with new standards
in health and hygiene.

856
00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:26,484
Westminster 245.
House of Commons.

857
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:34,844
The time has come for change,
the people have had enough.

858
00:53:34,964 --> 00:53:37,724
Let's open the windows,
let in new light,

859
00:53:37,844 --> 00:53:39,804
build a new Jerusalem

860
00:53:39,924 --> 00:53:42,764
brick by Government-owned brick.

861
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:50,204
Into there.

862
00:53:53,924 --> 00:53:55,364
Good.

863
00:53:59,524 --> 00:54:01,284
Doctor?

864
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:06,644
Yeah, Westminster 245.

865
00:54:10,884 --> 00:54:12,804
Mr Shelby.

866
00:54:30,564 --> 00:54:34,604
<i>"Tickner maura, o beng,
o beng" over and over again.</i>

867
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:35,804
<i>How is the family?</i>

868
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:37,444
<i>And one of you will die.</i>

869
00:54:37,564 --> 00:54:38,844
<i>He's staring at me, Daddy.</i>

870
00:54:38,964 --> 00:54:40,724
<i>A man with green eyes.</i>

871
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,004
Can you stop the voices?

872
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:47,284
There are no voices, my love.

873
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:49,844
It's the grey man.

874
00:54:49,964 --> 00:54:51,844
He says he's coming for me...

875
00:54:53,404 --> 00:54:56,044
...and he's coming
for Daddy as well.

876
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:05,044
Sh...

877
00:56:09,924 --> 00:56:11,564
Mr Shelby?

878
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:13,564
Is everything all right
in there?

879
00:56:16,204 --> 00:56:18,444
Mr Shelby?

880
00:56:18,564 --> 00:56:20,004
Everything's fine.

881
00:56:21,284 --> 00:56:22,684
Everything's fine.

882
00:56:34,964 --> 00:56:36,764
- Hello?
<i>- Tommy.</i>

883
00:56:36,884 --> 00:56:39,764
Tommy, she has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

884
00:56:39,884 --> 00:56:41,644
- Just get here now.
<i>- Lizzie?</i>

885
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:43,884
- Please.
- Lizzie?

886
00:57:07,364 --> 00:57:08,364
Where is she?

887
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:10,324
She's with the doctor upstairs.

888
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:14,284
Listen, Tommy.

889
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:16,764
He said we shouldn't come close
to her, in case...

890
00:57:16,884 --> 00:57:18,524
In case of what?

891
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,764
When she coughs, there's blood.

892
00:57:38,844 --> 00:57:40,644
Madonna,

893
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:45,404
put me through to the number
I gave you for Esme Shelby Lee.
