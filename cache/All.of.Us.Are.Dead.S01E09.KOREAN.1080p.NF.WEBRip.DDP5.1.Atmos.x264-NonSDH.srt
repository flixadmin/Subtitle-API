1
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,848
Cheong-san!

2
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,524
On-jo.

3
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,874
Su-hyeok!

4
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,001
Su-hyeok, are you, are you okay?

5
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,965
{\an8}Shit.

6
00:00:59,017 --> 00:00:59,934
Who are you?

7
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,021
What the hell are you?
You come from the One Heart club?

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,691
ONE HEART

9
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,026
It's me.

10
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,195
Yeah.

11
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,447
You don't know?

12
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,825
How the fuck do you not know me?

13
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,286
I know you. I said it many times before.

14
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,371
You're the bullies' gopher.

15
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,712
If you call me that again, I'll kill you.

16
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,048
You weren't a gangster
and you weren't a good student.

17
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,884
And now you're not a human
and you're not a zombie either.

18
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,304
No matter the time or place…

19
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,224
you're nothing.

20
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,977
I won't just kill you.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,776
I'll gouge out both of your eyes
and feed your blind ass to the zombies.

22
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,735
Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,281
Everyone but Cheong-san, can go.

24
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,575
Unless you wanna die with him.

25
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,834
You're all dead.

26
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,128
Let's go tie him.

27
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,673
Move.

28
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,126
Let go.

29
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,794
Let go!

30
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,320
You smell nice, huh.

31
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,994
You and me are on the same side.

32
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:06,996
Smell me.

33
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,123
Yeah, come on.

34
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,541
Fuck off.

35
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,653
Your shirt's ripped.

36
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,946
It's okay, now.

37
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,616
Damn it.

38
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,159
Ooh.

39
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,917
What the hell was this?

40
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,752
He was so strong.

41
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,381
Does anything else hurt?

42
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,924
Did your glasses break?

43
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,635
You're bleeding.

44
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,887
-So he's Gwi-nam?
-What? Damn it.

45
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,890
-What about me?
-Let me see.

46
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,518
You're okay.

47
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,853
It hurts like hell.

48
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,050
Shit!

49
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,636
We are on the same side.

50
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:06,449
EXAMINATION ROOM

51
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,917
Here you go.

52
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,918
Thank you.

53
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,021
They can't find
the homologous sequence of the virus.

54
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,272
What does that mean?

55
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,984
All living organisms have a root system,

56
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,530
if you follow a specific route,
you can trace it back to its origin.

57
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,242
Sort of like a genealogy for viruses.

58
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,035
But we can't figure it out.

59
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,580
Are you saying it's a brand new virus?

60
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,501
The KDCA is analyzing it too
but so far they can't identify it either.

61
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,339
We need to identify it
so we can start creating treatments.

62
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,262
You are supposed to be the experts.

63
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,432
How the hell could you not
have identified it by now?

64
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,560
It's strange.

65
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,230
The RNA structure changes
every time we test it.

66
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,985
It's almost like the virus
is evolving on its own.

67
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,244
We rescued a detective
from Hyosan Police Station.

68
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,705
And he seems to know
a lot about the virus, sir.

69
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,669
There's a laptop
in Hyosan High School that has--

70
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,087
Hey.

71
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,298
You need to start from the very beginning.

72
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,591
But we don't have much time.

73
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,763
The disease spreading in Hyosan
is called the Jonas Virus.

74
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,808
Lee Byeong-chan, a science teacher
at Hyosan High School, created it.

75
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,644
He left his laptop
in the school science lab.

76
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,607
He said it has everything we need in order
to get ourselves out of this catastrophe.

77
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,025
In his computer?

78
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,153
-Do you think his story is credible?
-Yes.

79
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,822
The research says
the initial reports of the outbreak

80
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,283
were from Hyosan Hospital's ER
and the high school.

81
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,870
And says the girl that was taken
to the ER was a student there.

82
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,539
I'm positive that Hyosan High School
was ground zero.

83
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,593
Keep questioning the detective.

84
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,428
Send Special Mission to the school.

85
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,680
Retrieve the laptop.

86
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,599
Yes, sir.

87
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,398
Eun-ji.

88
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,525
Eun-ji!

89
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,151
WAITING STATION

90
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,038
Are you doing okay?

91
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,874
I thought for sure you were dead.

92
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,417
You let me go knowing I'd die.

93
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,629
Uh, I'm sorry.

94
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,965
-I was just--
-It's fine.

95
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,051
That's just how you are.

96
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:14,971
Hey.

97
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,348
You wanna hear some good news?

98
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,642
I set the school on fire.

99
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,311
It's should be burned
to the ground by now.

100
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,398
You set fire to the school?

101
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,025
Yeah. It's great, right?

102
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,778
Are you all right?

103
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,614
I'm doing okay.

104
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,366
Why?

105
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,619
You don't seem like yourself.

106
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,248
I'm hungry.

107
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,917
And I get worked up when I'm hungry.

108
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,964
Do you want this then?

109
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,508
They're giving them out
but the line's crazy long.

110
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,552
You should eat first.

111
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,679
No, I don't want that.

112
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,308
But I think this is all they have.

113
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,311
I don't want that. I want something else.

114
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,730
Like what?

115
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,024
Mmm…

116
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,360
You?

117
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,070
Me?

118
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,115
Yeah.

119
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,992
I wanna eat you.

120
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,047
Damn, it stings.

121
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,886
What the hell is with that Gwi-nam kid?

122
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,305
You said he got bitten.

123
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,350
I don't know.

124
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,519
It looks like he became
something totally different.

125
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,104
I don't think he can die.

126
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,773
What if he climbs back up here?

127
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,818
He's bad enough…

128
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,656
but to be honest,
I'm scared of Nam-ra too.

129
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,741
You saw her fighting before.

130
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,618
Well…

131
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,038
I think it's reasonable to assume
they're both half-bies--

132
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,749
What?

133
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,544
Are you really okay, Nam-ra?

134
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,839
You won't do that to us, right?

135
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,636
Would you believe me
if I said that I wouldn't?

136
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,888
Why do you have to say it that way?

137
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,724
Can you at least try
to make us believe you?

138
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,229
We're going to be together anyway.

139
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,117
I…

140
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,870
I've never done anything but study.

141
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,418
I don't think I was naive,
I think I was a coward.

142
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,131
I was too scared my grades would drop
and my mom would get mad.

143
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,674
So I didn't do anything.

144
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,677
I was too scared to make friends.

145
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,725
My mom would always ask me
what rank they were in class,

146
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,394
what their parents did,
how big their house was…

147
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,903
I never thought I'd get a chance

148
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,698
to sit around a fire
with all of you like this.

149
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,329
It's really nice.

150
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,416
It's my first time.

151
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,045
If we somehow manage to get out of here.

152
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,465
I really hope we could make a fire…

153
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,759
and hang out like this again.

154
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,806
I really hope we can do that.

155
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,185
Sure, let's do it.

156
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,481
If anyone wants to make a fire…

157
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,027
we can all get together.

158
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,574
Sorry, Nam-ra.

159
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,915
Ooh. Did you just smile?

160
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,583
Super awkward.

161
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,836
God, come on.

162
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,505
What now? What?

163
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,715
Why don't you two just date already?

164
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,091
You guys are so annoying.

165
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,259
-Are you crazy?
-Psycho.

166
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,595
Hold on.

167
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,682
Did you hear that?

168
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,100
No, what is it?

169
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,478
What? Is someone out there?

170
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,400
Listen.

171
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,778
Huh?

172
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,574
What's happening?

173
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,829
What is it?

174
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,166
I don't see anything.

175
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,672
Hold on.

176
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,881
I hear a helicopter.

177
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,191
<i>Command, do you copy?</i>
<i>We've entered Hyosan airspace.</i>

178
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,318
<i>Approaching the school from the west.</i>

179
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,278
Hey.

180
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,738
-Fire!
-Yeah, yeah. They see us.

181
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,240
-They're coming.
-This way. It's this way.

182
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,449
-Hey, right here!
-Here, here!

183
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,326
-Here. Hey, hey!
-Over here!

184
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,871
-Come on!
-Please help!

185
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,373
-Over here! Come on!
-Hey! Over here!

186
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,041
-We're here!
-Here!

187
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,085
-This way. This way. Look over here.
-Look at us, will you?

188
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,211
-Come save us!
-Here!

189
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,713
-Come save us.
-Can't you see us?

190
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,631
-We're here!
-Over here!

191
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,716
-Right here!
-Here!

192
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,050
-Hey!
-Look at us!

193
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,011
-Here! Help!
-Over here!

194
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,432
<i>We've entered the airspace</i>
<i>above Hyosan High School</i>.

195
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,892
<i>Ready for landing.</i>

196
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,357
-Down here!
-Here! Over here!

197
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,151
-Over here!
-Come on!

198
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,029
-Hey!
-Over here! Right here!

199
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,911
-Hey!
-Hey, over here!

200
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,546
Over here! Over here!

201
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,073
-Hey, hey.
-Whoa!

202
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,126
Get down.

203
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,753
All of you.

204
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:05,673
Sir.

205
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,299
Can you please help us?

206
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,636
Face down on the ground! Get down!

207
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,100
<i>Clear the area. Over.</i>

208
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,394
<i>High school roof.</i>

209
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,688
Nine survivors confirmed.

210
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,314
Their condition?

211
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,608
<i>Checking temperatures now.</i>

212
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,610
Clear.

213
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,445
I think they're checking if we're zombies.

214
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,947
-Clear.
-Don't worry.

215
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,864
Clear.

216
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,574
Clear.

217
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,788
Clear.

218
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,457
Clear.

219
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,921
Clear.

220
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,849
Temperature is 34.5.

221
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,102
Providing a warming blanket.

222
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,193
<i>One has hypothermia.</i>
<i>The rest are normal.</i>

223
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,780
Rescue them after you complete
the objective.

224
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,408
We'll rescue after
the mission's complete. Over.

225
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,870
It's okay. They're gonna rescue us.

226
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,705
It's over now.

227
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,459
You can get up now.

228
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,964
Are you the only survivors?

229
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,466
We don't really know.

230
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,801
There are probably others.

231
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,720
We're going down
for a few minutes.

232
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,013
Wait right here.

233
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,806
Aren't you not gonna rescue us?

234
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,016
Yes, we will.

235
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,851
So don't go anywhere.

236
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,603
Don't do anything. Just wait here.

237
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,313
-Understand?
-Mm-hm. Yes.

238
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,272
Let's go.

239
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,830
<i>Three men, standing by.</i>

240
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,831
<i>Chopper, report.</i>

241
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,218
<i>Copy that.</i>

242
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,888
<i>Inbound. Spotlight hot.</i>

243
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,016
<i>Roger that.</i>
<i>We're all set. Over.</i>

244
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,351
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

245
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,602
<i>Let's just go.</i>

246
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,395
The zombies went toward the chopper.

247
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,855
Let's just get up to the roof, okay?

248
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,741
Let's go.

249
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,455
How about him?

250
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,461
We bring him.

251
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,882
Be gentle.

252
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,091
-So, slower.
-Seriously.

253
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,177
-How's that? Comfy?
-It's good.

254
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,803
Don't put any straps…

255
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,638
-…on my stomach.
-Okay, don't worry.

256
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,855
<i>The infected are converging</i>
<i>on the field and the front gate.</i>

257
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,982
<i>What's your status? Do you copy?</i>

258
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,152
We're clear. Moving in.

259
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,872
Report. What's the situation?

260
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,587
Hey.

261
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,924
Are they gonna kill all the zombies
before they take us?

262
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,176
I don't think so.
There's only four of them.

263
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,137
But they're Special Mission, right?

264
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,973
Are they looking for something?

265
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,435
Are they heading to the science lab?

266
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,737
-<i>We're in.</i>
-Do you have the package?

267
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>Checking now.</i>

268
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,831
<i>The infected are getting</i>
<i>in your position. Do you read?</i>

269
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,208
<i>Prepare for extraction.</i>

270
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,795
<i>I still don't have the file.</i>
<i>Unlocking device.</i>

271
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,047
We have to get out.
Speed it up.

272
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,383
DECRYPTION COMPLETE, SUCCESS

273
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,218
File obtained. Heading out.

274
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,775
Moving out!

275
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,491
<i>Report your evac status</i>
<i>and the situation in the school.</i>

276
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,787
<i>The infected</i>
<i>are moving quickly to the science lab.</i>

277
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,581
Rescue the students and return to base.

278
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,166
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

279
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,336
Commander…

280
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,713
…we had an incident
in the quarantine camp.

281
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,131
What is it? What happened?

282
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,675
-Connect monitor 34.
-Yes, sir.

283
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,181
Rewind about ten minutes.

284
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,478
Where's the package?

285
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,028
-Ready for extraction.
-Coming down. Over.

286
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,409
Master Sergeant.
You go up first.

287
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,410
Yes, sir.

288
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,912
We'll pull you up
one at a time.

289
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,414
Stay still even if you're scared.

290
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,334
-Okay?
-You're not landing the chopper?

291
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,546
We can't. It can get unstable.
He's gonna pull you up, so don't worry.

292
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,310
You can't go all at once,
so let's go one by one.

293
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,478
We can't all go?

294
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,439
We can take all of you,
but it has to be one by one.

295
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:43,362
-Ji-min. You go first.
-You go first. Go first.

296
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,574
You go first.

297
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:04,758
Grab her!

298
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,718
Back off!

299
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,470
Calm down!

300
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,490
Stop! Calm down, calm down!

301
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,123
What the hell is that?

302
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,252
I believe she's infected but asymptomatic.

303
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,716
So she has a disease but…

304
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,344
there was no way to tell she was infected?

305
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,333
You're saying
we can't differentiate between

306
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,502
the healthy and the infected?

307
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,006
Connect to the team at Hyosan High!

308
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,092
-Yes, sir.
-Where's team bravo?

309
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,636
Don't rescue anyone.

310
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,681
Say again.
Did you mean everyone?

311
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,225
We just discovered a case as asymptomatic.

312
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,810
But their temperatures
are fine.

313
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,563
It was the same thing
with the girl we brought here.

314
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,857
<i>No one will be safe if one</i>
<i>of them gets sick in the chopper.</i>

315
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,193
If they resist… shoot them.

316
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,111
They're just children.

317
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,655
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>Soldiers are dying here!</i>

318
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,450
<i>Four men were attacked by one girl!</i>
<i>So do as I say.</i>

319
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,120
Understood. Over.

320
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,832
Cancel the operation.

321
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,210
We'll take just the package and pull out!

322
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,671
-Darn it!
-I think I'm going back down.

323
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,423
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
-I'm coming down.

324
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,633
Wait a second.

325
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,968
-She's coming down!
-She's-- she's coming down!

326
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,178
-Why is she coming down?
-What's wrong?

327
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,804
-What's going on?
-I don't know!

328
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,516
Why did you take that off?
Wait a minute. What?

329
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,813
-What operation is this?
-What are you doing? What is this?

330
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,065
Please just pull me back up.

331
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,567
Pull me back up! God, damn it!
I'm not going back.

332
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,903
I'm not going. I'm not going.

333
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,614
Take me with you! I'm not going.
Sir. Please.

334
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,783
I wanna get out of here!

335
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,952
Please, take me with you!

336
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,330
Come on, sir!

337
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,540
W-- Wait a second.

338
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,084
What's wrong with you? We're fine.

339
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,418
<i>We're not zombies.</i>

340
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,921
Go ahead. Shoot.

341
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,381
Please, just take me with you!

342
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,550
Stand back.

343
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,801
Stand back, or we'll shoot.

344
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,302
Stand back!

345
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,846
All right team, get in the chopper.

346
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,431
I said shoot.

347
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:04,187
<i>Do you not hear me?</i>
<i>Shoot them. That's an order!</i>

348
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,856
Wait a minute.
You can't even take a few of us with you?

349
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,109
Shoot, you bastard. Shoot them now!

350
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,036
Be quiet.

351
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,712
-Quiet down.
-Damn it.

352
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,132
To the roof, right?

353
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,134
You think we'll make it?

354
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,220
We won't get up there in time.
Let's just try this building.

355
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,597
Let's go.

356
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,181
Wrong way.

357
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,476
-What? Okay. Let's go.
-Hey. Help me out.

358
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,811
Oh, shit.

359
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,065
I'm begging.
Please take just a few of us with you.

360
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,874
Rescue us.

361
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,424
I'm sorry.

362
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,461
We have the package.
All agents pulling out.

363
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,587
Return to the base.

364
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,383
Hey. Why is it coming this way?

365
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,467
Did you think they saw us?

366
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,527
Over here! Here! Look! Over here!

367
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,113
Look, right here!

368
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,367
Shit.

369
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,496
Oh, we're screwed. Shit!

370
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,081
-Run! Run, run!
-Oh, shit.

371
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,304
They abandoned us.

372
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,014
Didn't they?

373
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,225
No one's come to save us now?

374
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,146
But why did they do that?

375
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,939
Maybe…

376
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,443
they thought that all of us
were already fucking zombies.

377
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,862
They would have killed us.

378
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,531
They wouldn't have left us…

379
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,367
here alive if they thought that.

380
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,211
What are you doing?

381
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,088
It's pointless.

382
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,759
No one's coming. No one else is coming.

383
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,121
A witness stated that you
and your aide were accomplices

384
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,835
in Kim U-sin and Nam So-ju's escape
and result in an attack on our men.

385
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,963
He kept denying your involvement

386
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,091
so we asked you to come here
and answer some questions.

387
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,805
Are you recording this?

388
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,057
-Yes, we are.
-Wait a minute.

389
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,060
Aren't you supposed to tell us
if you're gonna record the investigation?

390
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,438
We're gonna record
this conversation. Give your consent.

391
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,816
Would you please point
the camera at me directly?

392
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,985
Go ahead.

393
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,199
Is it set?

394
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,367
Yes.

395
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,584
I'm Assemblywoman Park Eun-hee.

396
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:22,589
I've been accused of aiding and abetting
firefighters Nam So-ju and Kim U-sin,

397
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,300
who had saved my life,
and their escape from the camp.

398
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,885
I am being interrogated.

399
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,722
But I was not an accomplice.

400
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,933
I was the true offender.

401
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,519
Ma'am, are you kidding me?

402
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,438
That's not true. Stop recording, huh!

403
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:39,898
Stay back.

404
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,985
I don't understand why you're doing this?

405
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,153
What are you doing ma'am?

406
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,620
Do whatever you think is best.

407
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,080
I won't get involved anymore.

408
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:05,340
Firefighter Nam So-ju saved us,
and he did this despite the fact

409
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,966
that his daughter was nearby.

410
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,679
He tried to go save his daughter
after he saved us

411
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,973
but The Martial Law Units stopped him.

412
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,727
His daughter was everything to him.

413
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,730
I said I'd take responsibility,

414
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,901
and that he should escape by any means
necessary to save his daughter.

415
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,571
Even if it's not allowed
under martial law,

416
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,992
no one can ever stop
a father's love for his daughter.

417
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,164
Regardless of the punishment
imposed on me…

418
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,834
I will always stand with…

419
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,504
the powerless citizens.

420
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,165
On-jo.

421
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,125
Hey, Dad.

422
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,017
Please help us.

423
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,314
My wife and baby…

424
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,095
I can't do it alone.

425
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,182
We need equipment
in order to cut through the frame.

426
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,851
Please. Please help us.

427
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,144
I'm sorry.

428
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,439
I need to go find my daughter now.

429
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,940
I'm really sorry.

430
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,610
Please, sir. I'm begging you.

431
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,529
Our baby…

432
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,449
Please, sir. Save them.

433
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,493
Please, sir.

434
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,164
Listen to me.
They'll start sending rescuers soon.

435
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,707
You have to hang in there until then.

436
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,876
But those monsters,
they could have come first.

437
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,673
Shit.

438
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,558
Here.

439
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,937
Here. Take this.

440
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,898
You have to hang in there. You understand?

441
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,619
You have to help me.

442
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,455
Get back here.

443
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,290
Right now.

444
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,419
<i>There's no more hope left.</i>

445
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,842
{\an8}It's like every sin entered the human body
in concentrated form.

446
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,344
{\an8}Even if we can conquer this virus,

447
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,515
{\an8}I worried that a world ruled by humanity
will never return.

448
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,434
{\an8}Can we still believe people are beautiful

449
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,147
{\an8}after seeing them
become the worst possible creatures?

450
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,149
If you shoot me now,

451
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,234
they'll come running right away.

452
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,153
We're gonna die anyway.

453
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,156
Whether I do or I don't.

454
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,826
My daughter is waiting for me.

455
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,542
I'm begging you…

456
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,087
Please don't go.

457
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,468
Don't go.

458
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,140
<i>There was something we'd say</i>

459
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,519
at the pharmaceutical company
whenever we hit a wall.

460
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:33,608
{\an8}"Science begins with imagination
and ends as a mystery."

461
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,696
{\an8}I went to see a shaman on my way home.

462
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,291
He told me this right here
would immediately fix everything.

463
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,341
<i>Please help me. Help me!</i>

464
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,843
I'm human.

465
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,553
I'm not a zombie!

466
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,726
You idiot.

467
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,611
She's either positive or negative
depending on when we test her.

468
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,613
What does that mean?

469
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,658
We have to assume it's a fusion
or some kind of evolution.

470
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,452
Like a mutation?

471
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,371
Yes, that's correct.

472
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,083
The virus is hiding
in the RNA of the cells.

473
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,085
We can only detect it when it manifests.

474
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,544
If it's dormant, it won't show up.

475
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,093
That means tests don't tell us
whether or not the subject is infected.

476
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,052
That's right.

477
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,264
It's like the human and the monster
are fighting inside the patient.

478
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,559
Is it at all possible…

479
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,145
that there are others like her?

480
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,901
As per KDCA's recommendation,

481
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,279
it's best to presume

482
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,699
that they're infected
even if they show no symptoms.

483
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,959
Going forward,

484
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,253
separate everyone from Hyosan

485
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,797
and considered them infected
but asymptomatic.

486
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,510
And monitor later rescues
separately and more closely.

487
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,514
Oh, I know.

488
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,975
Yeah. You really are amazing.

489
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,895
To use us in that situation.

490
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,442
She didn't use you at all
she just made the best of the situation.

491
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,320
When it rains,
you set up your barrels.

492
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,239
And when it's windy,
you set up the turbine, right?

493
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,532
That's politics.

494
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:50,161
You'll use that video
for your campaign, won't you?

495
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,999
Even though you didn't save anyone,
you'll get lots of votes

496
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,501
like you did something huge.

497
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,295
Hey, she did.

498
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,883
She took full responsibility
just to get you out of this mess, okay?

499
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,097
She never told our captain
he should try to run and escape.

500
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,518
Listen, U-sin.

501
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,939
Disasters usually create heroes. Huh?

502
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,691
Whether or not he saves his daughter,

503
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,861
Mr. Nam will come out of this a hero.

504
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,365
That's what we're gonna be
working on right now.

505
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,701
Don't you want your captain to be a hero?

506
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,704
-That's not what I--
-And we're all on the same page.

507
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,082
Let's look at the big picture here.

508
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,919
From this moment on,
we are on the same team.

509
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,756
We just have to stick together.

510
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,718
What the hell?

511
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,345
In the interest
of stopping this spread,

512
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,222
we're taking you to a special quarantine.

513
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,266
For safety reasons,
you'll be handcuffed during transport.

514
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,643
Do we look like criminals to you?

515
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,062
Why are you suddenly
imprisoning all of us?

516
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,357
Also, how dare you try to put handcuffs
on an assemblywoman, huh?

517
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,192
Please obey the rules.

518
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,488
Don't test my patience.

519
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,864
It's martial law,

520
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,492
-not a military dictatorship.
-Please obey the rules.

521
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,037
Listen, we won't follow
unprincipled rules.

522
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,208
Kill me first
if you're gonna take her away, huh!

523
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,669
-Come on. Make a shield.
-Yes, sir.

524
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,129
Hold on.

525
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,302
Make a shield.

526
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,733
<i>Attention,</i>
<i>all citizens in the quarantine camp.</i>

527
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,236
<i>In order to find those who are infected</i>
<i>but asymptomatic,</i>

528
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,531
<i>we are separating Hyosan citizens</i>
<i>from those of you from other regions,</i>

529
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,742
<i>as per the KDCA's recent</i>
<i>safety recommendation.</i>

530
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,412
I'm fine. It's okay.

531
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,666
<i>Until a reliable testing method is created</i>

532
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,334
<i>and the situation is resolved,</i>

533
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:07,298
<i>stricter quarantine rules will be put</i>
<i>in place effective immediately.</i>

534
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,342
<i>We apologize for the inconvenience</i>
<i>and encouraging to cooperate.</i>

535
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,306
What the hell's happening?
You said we'd be treated like heroes.

536
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,599
You shut up for once.

537
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,268
Did you find the laptop? What happened?

538
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,771
Come on, move. Let's go.

539
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,648
Hey, what about the laptop?

540
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,109
Can you at least tell us about that?

541
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,249
You okay?

542
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,084
My ears hurt so bad.

543
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,516
This should help.

544
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,121
It's raining.

545
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,250
It's raining.

546
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,964
Yes, it's raining!

547
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,382
It's pouring!

548
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,998
Ahh, it's so nice.

549
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,152
What the fuck.

550
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,160
Joon-yeong.

551
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,163
You know how zombies follow us
if they hear us?

552
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,166
Maybe if we move every time
there's thunder, they won't be able to.

553
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,640
I don't think anyone is coming to save us.

554
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,563
Wouldn't you rather die trying
to get out than die here?

555
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,983
All right then. What do you have in mind?

556
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,736
If we take the back door
of the auditorium to the tennis courts

557
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,489
and then go right through
the English center,

558
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,032
we can get to the mountain.

559
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,973
If we manage to reach the mountain,

560
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,142
we can make it all the way to Yangdong.

561
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,896
I've been hiking there
a few times before with my dad.

562
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,817
Even still, isn't this suicide?

563
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,028
I'm not going. I'm scared.

564
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,656
What are we gonna do
if the zombies catch us?

565
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,243
It's not like anyone
is going to save us if we stay here.

566
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,245
We're the only ones
who can save ourselves.

567
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,546
Let's go.

568
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,511
If anything goes wrong,
I'll scream and lead the zombies away.

569
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,806
That way none of you will get hurt, okay?

570
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:50,891
So let's do this.

571
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,976
Don't say that.

572
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,815
We're all gonna make it.

573
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,527
If anyone has to die tonight,

574
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,821
it will be me.

575
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,741
Because of the rain,
all the scents came to me at once.

576
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,951
They got mixed up.

577
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,538
The rain is really loud too.

578
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,168
I'm sure the zombies' senses are dulled.

579
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,796
If that's what a half-bie says,
it should be reliable.

580
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,339
What's a half-bie?

581
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,799
A half zomb…

582
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,095
someone you can rely on.

583
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,430
You guys ready?

584
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,225
Nam-ra is strong. She'll keep up.

585
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,310
Let's take her word and go.

586
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,020
I'm not strong right now.

587
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,021
Why not?

588
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,525
I don't know.

589
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,448
I think some of us
might not be able to keep pace.

590
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,535
We can't have anyone fall behind,
let's pair up and hold hands.

591
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,536
For protection.

592
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,288
Okay!

593
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,790
Hey.

594
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,642
-Wu-jin. Let's go.
-Okay.

595
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:21,690
Hey.

596
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,943
Stay close behind me.

597
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,365
Let's survive tonight.

598
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,993
We'll talk about us later.

599
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,008
Okay!

600
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,906
-Careful. Careful.
-Okay.

601
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,951
Don't let go of my hand.

602
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:24,920
Okay.

603
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,981
Damn it!

604
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,945
What are you doing?

605
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,029
My bad. My bad.

606
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,117
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

607
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,326
We trust you.

608
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,290
Be careful.

609
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,712
Careful.

610
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,653
-What's wrong?
-Hold on.

611
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,159
Can you see them?

612
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,423
It's gone.

613
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,150
Ready?

614
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,152
Let's go.

615
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,246
Hey.

616
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,915
They look so weird.

617
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,041
Can you just be quiet now?

618
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,210
Hey, come here and look.
Come here and look.

619
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,795
They look like total morons.

620
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,172
Hey.

621
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,174
I'm seriously freezing.

622
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,551
It must be the rain.

623
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,136
Hey, let's go.

624
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,763
It's our best chance to escape.

625
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,265
Let's go behind that building
and head up the mountain.

626
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,773
{\an8}I'll lure that zombie
and go over that way.

627
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,608
{\an8}Then you run.

628
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,777
{\an8}No way.

629
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,405
{\an8}I'll lure that zombie over and you can…

630
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,163
{\an8}We'll go right along
the wall here and cross over there.

631
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,481
Get down. Quiet.

632
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,317
Hey. Stay low.

633
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,699
{\an8}We have to go
along the wall.

634
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,617
{\an8}Okay.

635
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,118
Go along the wall over there.

636
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,620
-Why?
-Back there?

637
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,706
I'll go first.

638
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,502
This way.

639
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,889
Cheong-san.

640
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,283
Is that you, Mom?

641
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,524
ALL CHARACTERS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

642
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,734
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
