I'm the director and the writer of this film.

Hello, this is Rodo Sayagues.
I'm the writer.

00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,692
And this is Stephen Lang,
and I play the Blind Man in this film.

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,608
And we've gathered to
a screening of the film...

5
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,868
...with our commentary.

6
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,904
It's a bunch of logos.

7
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,451
But there's definitely something
that I think it's--

8
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,087
It's the only interesting part
about the logos, is we always--

9
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:51,591
We start-- The movie starts right away--
Like the soundtrack--

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,298
That eerie soundtrack starts on the first
image of the movie, there's no--

11
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,713
That's hopefully when the audience
gets hooked...

12
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,179
...and we never really let them go
until the end.

...down the street for real. Ha, ha.

-That was a-- That was a day.
-Ha, ha.

18
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,038
She was a...

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,449
She's-- She's a-- You know--

20
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,085
She doesn't look like she's too big...

21
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,623
...but she got real heavy
that day, somehow. Heh, heh.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,713
Well, we did this shot I think
two or three times.

23
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,800
And-- And I demanded
you do all the dragging.

24
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,716
There was no help.
It was just you, all muscle...

25
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,134
...dragging her like three times
down the street.

26
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,146
-Right.
-And this one is the third shot.

27
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,900
And I remember at the end of this one
you were like, "Okay. Hope you got it."

Cool. It used to be called
Man in the Dark.

we loved Man in the Dark...

But we got to love
Don't Breathe as well.

Yeah. Actually I think it changed names
more than twice.

-Yeah.

He's swag.

58
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,643
So most of the movie was shot in...

59
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,655
We did Detroit, and we did Budapest.
And this is actually...

60
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:24,069
Actually in Budapest, like a house
outside a city.

61
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,364
Yeah, I think it's the only location stuff
we did in the city.

62
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,953
Then the rest in Budapest
was all inside a studio.

63
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,334
Except remember, we did shoot
the train station.

64
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,710
True. The train station.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,541
-Which I thought was just great.
-I loved that.

66
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:40,131
Yeah, it used to be
an old airport, I think.

67
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,968
But here we're definitely in Detroit. Back
flying with the drone around the city.

68
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,306
How many days did we shoot
in Detroit?

69
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,598
We spent like a week there.
But we shot like a couple days, I guess.

70
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,518
And this was an entire day of just,
you know--

71
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,528
Is that ladybug real?

72
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,030
-Yes, it is. Heh, heh.
-Did you get--

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,032
Did you have like
a lady bug wrangler...

74
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,863
-...when you were doing that?
-We did.

75
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,119
We had an animal wrangler
that took care of--

76
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,204
From, you know-- From everything--
From the dogs to the ladybug.

77
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,962
But that's one of the strange things of
filmmaking that, of course everybody--

78
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,418
When--

79
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:23,302
When the page says ladybug, everybody
goes for CG ladybug right away.

80
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:27,010
And I didn't want to use CG, ha, ha,
if I could help it...

81
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,767
...because it's a movie that
doesn't need it or have it.

82
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,895
So to just have suddenly a CG ladybug
could have been a problem.

83
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,478
And we really went for it,
and we had a couple of them.

84
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:42,692
It was very, very hot, so ladybugs
don't survive under extreme heat.

85
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:47,155
So you cannot-- You actually can't
put the disclaimer that no ladybugs...

86
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,366
-...were harmed.
-None of them were harmed...

87
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,156
...it was just the fact that
we couldn't find them...

88
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,452
...and some of them just died
before they arrived on set.

89
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,621
But, yeah, we ended up doing it
with a real ladybug.

90
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,211
-We laugh now about this.
-Heh, heh.

91
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,500
We'll hear about it.

92
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,341
This is Detroit.

93
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,097
The family of Alex.

94
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,054
Actually, you were saying there's no...

95
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,718
There's no CGI in this.

96
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,355
And we never-- I don't recall
any green screen either.

97
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,391
-Did we?
-No. No, no, no.

98
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,731
-That's a rarity these days, my friend.
-Yeah.

99
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,148
But I guess-- You know, I like when--
If you can pull it off...

100
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,737
...I think it's good, make it more classy.

101
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,778
But that was the whole approach
of this movie, since day one...

102
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,950
...I was trying to do this, you know,
in a very classy way.

103
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,710
Not doing anything that was,
you know, top of the line...

104
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,793
...CG or visual effects,
because stuff like that gets old.

105
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,550
And a good story, I think,
will never get old.

106
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:51,341
Was this script inspired by any events
you read about in the paper?

107
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,304
I think it was life, right?

108
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,599
Rodo and I were actually driving back
from San Diego one day and thought...

109
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,604
We kind of created the character
of the Blind Man.

110
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,066
And all the story kind of
came out of that.

111
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,652
But-- Yeah, but there
were stories, right?

112
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,069
Yeah, with that case,
I remember exactly where it happened.

113
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:15,456
This guy that kept a girl
in a basement...

114
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,081
...for many, many years.

115
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,995
Yeah, there was one in Switzerland,
I think ages ago.

116
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,004
Unfortunately, there's been
many others.

117
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,792
And probably there's others we don't
know about. Those are the scary ones...

118
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,132
-...the ones that are ongoing.
-So we thought what if burglars...

119
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,263
-...break into that guy's house?
-Right.

120
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,391
And find this-- This...

121
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,514
Crime going on.

122
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,726
So we thought that would be cool.

123
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,102
Which is kind of the fun of this movie,
like, nobody is good.

124
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,943
So you were in the car and you just sort
of spun the story out to each other?

125
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,027
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Something like that, yeah.

126
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:54,069
Something like that.
I mean, we knew that--

127
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,612
That we wanted to...

128
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,873
Because the whole girl in the cellar thing
kind of came later.

129
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,082
I think the first part of the idea was...

130
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,419
...to tell the story from
the point of view of robbers.

131
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,301
Because it's something that you
don't see often and--

132
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,838
And as far as real life goes...

133
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:16,680
...like, house robbers,
they do have scary and--

134
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,433
And very particular adventures every day.
Regardless of the judgment...

135
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:24,191
...of what they're doing, whether it's
a bad thing, at the end of the day...

136
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,103
...they're kids that enter a house,
and try to get away with things...

137
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,567
...and they might get shot,
and might get killed.

138
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,698
And that happens every day.

139
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,862
And it's kind of a strange world
that we don't really see often in movies.

140
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,873
This kind of down and dirty,
greedy group of kids...

141
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,831
...that are breaking into peoples' houses
and taking stuff.

142
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,959
And the challenge was obviously getting
the audience to care about them.

143
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,047
So that's why once we learn more about
what's going on in the house...

144
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,134
...it becomes that thing of
they might be bad but there's--

145
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,516
Perhaps there's even more evil stuff
happening inside the house.

146
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,895
But at that point, I mean, that comes--

147
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,352
We've gone a substantial
way in the film...

148
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,267
...at that point and...

149
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,228
Before you turn everything on
its ear.

150
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,695
Because to have these kids
be the perpetrators...

151
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,155
...and my character
essentially be a victim...

152
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,865
...you establish that.

153
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,408
-Yeah.
-And it works beautifully, I mean, then...

154
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:28,874
And then the way you just
kind of turn that on its ear...

155
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,508
-...Is pretty fascinating, I think.
-Heh, heh.

156
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,842
It's good to see how the audience
empathy switches...

157
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,677
...from one side to the other.

158
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,344
And kind of constantly does that
throughout the movie.

159
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,479
Which is really fascinating,
but it's just-- There I am.

160
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,563
I don't know if you spot me there.
That was me in that newspaper.

161
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:52,105
-I was an illegal immigrant.
-Your Hitchcock moment.

162
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,695
It said something like, "Illegal immigrant
was blamed for two murders."

163
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,078
Something like that.
That's my face in there, blurred out.

164
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,323
This scene is all about that, right?
The empathy.

165
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,708
-Why she does what she's doing.
-Sure.

166
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,627
MOTHER: It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

167
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,882
COMMENTARY: I remember
this scene used to be different.

168
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,051
She used to live with his father.

169
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,888
And his father was an abusive father...

170
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,265
-...a violent guy.
-Mm-hm.

171
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,144
But then we thought that
it would have been even better...

172
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,273
...if she lived with a mother,
just negligent.

173
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,983
And-- And then we added that
character sitting next to her.

174
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,482
Doing nothing.
Just being very menacing.

175
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,946
Well, he's got a swastika
on his right hand.

176
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,283
-Yeah.
-So if it was not clear enough...

177
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,784
-Yeah.
-Right.

178
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,747
And she's such a sweet, you know...

179
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,038
-...charming little beauty.
-Yeah.

180
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,584
She doesn't do a lot in the movie,
but does everything she needs to do...

181
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,755
...just by being there, showing someone
that really represents innocence.

182
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,345
And in that environment, you know
that's not gonna last long.

183
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,480
And so we felt it was a good
clock ticking for her life.

184
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,767
Everything is a little bit extreme
in this scene...

185
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,855
...but I think it works.

186
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,023
We needed to set this up
in like two minutes.

187
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,611
-And I think it worked.
-It's--

188
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,198
I don't know-- I don't know that
I would've called it extreme.

189
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,704
I think everything is on the nose...

190
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,490
-...but it kind of has to be.
-Yeah.

191
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,878
It's a way of delivering
exposition quickly.

192
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,415
Yeah, that's the thing with TV,
the difference between TV and films.

193
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,084
In TV, you have a lot of time to develop
these things.

194
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,674
And in this kind of movie,
you have to hit it hard...

195
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,967
...and you need the audience to get it
right away and have those few minutes...

196
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,306
-...to get a point across.
-Mm-hm.

197
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,095
I think it helped, I mean...

198
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,983
At least then from that point on,
the audience hopefully will understand...

199
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,272
...that it's very unlikely that she's gonna
back away from her goal...

200
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,689
...which is take the money
from the Blind Man.

201
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,077
And I think it's a really interesting choice
that you've made...

202
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,955
...because we're kind of approaching
the end of when we're gonna be outside.

203
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,335
And we have not encountered
one other person.

204
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,869
-Yeah. It's true.
-You know...

205
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,505
...no one on the streets at all.

206
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,884
It was kind of to give that
sense of desolation...

207
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,671
...that Detroit might have in places,
in particular this kind of neighborhood.

208
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:27,935
So, yeah, it's true that you don't really see
anybody else except for the characters.

209
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,267
Even when they're at the restaurant,
nobody's there. It's just that--

210
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,309
That sense of, "They have to get out.
They have to go to someplace else.”

211
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,436
ALEX:;
Is that a new tattoo?

212
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,695
Yeah.

213
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,026
I got it last night.

214
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,195
ALEX: Is it a...?
-Ladybug.

215
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,445
COMMENTARY:
The ladybug again.

216
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,319
Of course, it's the--

217
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,287
I don't know what we thought. But I think
it was always representing that idea.

218
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,919
Kind of the freedom
that she's looking for...

219
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,453
...and she's desperate to get.

220
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,875
ROCKY: --my mom started drinking
and she told me that...

221
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,128
COMMENTARY:
Also, they're...

222
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,797
I've always associated them with luck.

223
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,466
Yeah. In the folklore I think it's--

224
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,636
Ladybug-- You see a ladybug,
it's always a happy moment.

225
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,804
"Oh, look, a ladybug."
So it's good.

226
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,476
And, yeah, I think in Uruguay folklore
it's always something...

227
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,613
...that you associate with good fortune.
Which is not really coming her way now.

228
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,275
But I think eventually in the movie
it comes around...

229
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,910
...when she sees it
at the right moment.

230
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,499
I think this back story as well
used to be longer in the script, right?

231
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,034
Yeah.

232
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,294
ROCKY: When I reach California,
I'll color this tat...

233
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,297
...and that's the last time
I will mark my body.

234
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,625
COMMENTARY: Yeah, and this is
the last time in the movie...

235
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,134
...they will have a moment of peace.

236
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,218
I think from this point on
it's gonna be nonstop.

237
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:51,511
There used to be actually a shot here,
a short insert that--

238
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:56,398
That you'll find on the extras
of the DVD on the deleted scenes. But I--

239
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,185
But I love it. You should check it out.
Which is when we get a glimpse...

240
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,445
...of what the Blind Man is doing.

241
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,198
Not right at this moment,
but right before this moment.

242
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,780
And we get to know that he's a gard--

243
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,490
-He does gardening.
-The gardening scene.

244
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,951
-Yeah, remember?
-I enjoyed the gardening scenes.

245
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,413
-Yeah.
-I saw the deleted scene.

246
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,918
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

247
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,713
Oh, that dog.

248
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,749
The dog--

249
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,045
-The dog gets an award. Ha, ha.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

250
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,052
Particularly for the one day
we were on set and we know...

251
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,762
...that he wasn't hitting his marks
all the time.

252
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,645
-Yeah.
-But in the movie he really, you know--

253
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,431
He does what he has to do.

254
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,942
He's very menacing and it's that
extension of the will of the Blind Man.

255
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,238
Yeah, I think the first draft that we wrote
didn't have the dog.

256
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,742
-Uh-uh.
-And-- And I think it was Fede's idea...

257
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,619
...this guy should have a dog.
How come he doesn't have a dog?

258
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,281
-Right.
-The dog turned out to be one of the...

259
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,084
A really important element
in the movie.

260
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,049
That's it. That's it for daytime.
Now we go into nighttime.

261
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,381
For good.

262
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,424
[♪♪♪]

263
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,971
-I love this shot here.
-Mm.

264
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,310
It almost looks like they're in space.
Ha, ha.

265
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,392
There's something very strange about it.

266
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,981
I just read the silhouettes. It looks like
three cosmonauts somewhere.

267
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,236
In the middle of nowhere.

268
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,359
Which is what I love about that house,
that it's--

269
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,244
Usually in a scary movie...

270
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,997
...every time you wanna portray
the house as creepy...

271
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,707
...you have a bunch of nice houses and
you have a scary house in the middle.

272
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,293
And the one that is run down
and not well-kept, that's the scary one.

273
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,380
-Here it's the other way around.
-Kind of the opposite.

274
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,046
It's the house that is in good shape,
in a bad neighborhood.

275
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,343
And ends up for that reason
being the one that is unsettling.

276
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,852
-Now we're in studio here.
-Yeah.

277
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,012
-But--
-Just like that.

278
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,648
And the fact that the house
is well-maintained...

279
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,526
...that was an important thing
for my character.

280
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,936
It says an awful lot about the--

281
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,198
You know, the order
that he maintains in his life.

282
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,824
Yeah.

283
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,236
-That was CGI, right?
-That was CG.

284
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,950
Yeah. That was the only--

285
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,333
Well, not the only, I think there's a couple
of CG moments in the movie.

286
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:24,918
That's probably the fanciest CG effect
in the whole movie, ironically.

287
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,880
The piece of treat, of hot dog,
that is thrown to the dog.

288
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,091
It had to fly over the fence and land.

289
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,802
All that was done actually in Uruguay,
in our country.

290
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,341
MONEY:
Because the money's in there...

291
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,476
...and the paranoid fuck
doesn't trust nobody.

292
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,353
ROCKY:
Let's check for a side door.

293
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,402
COMMENTARY: All this, like here,
I think this is the moment...

294
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,031
...when they cross that gate
is when the real tension starts.

295
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,693
And it's really what inspired
the whole movie, I guess...

296
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:59,331
...was that idea that there's something
very scary about...

297
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,740
...not just having people--

298
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,161
Seeing scenes about people breaking
into someone's house.

299
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,456
But even if you're with them,
and you're with the house breaker...

300
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,295
...it's always something very tense...

301
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,757
...because for us,
and I think for everybody...

302
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,214
...the private space
and the private property...

303
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,760
...is something that we value
so much in the idea that, you know...

304
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,178
...we feel safe inside our house
and there's a--

305
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,973
There's a common
agreement in society...

306
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,768
...that you don't walk into
someone else's property.

307
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,435
And so when you see it happen...

308
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,949
...it's fascinating how we all collectively,
and in theaters...

309
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,361
...and everybody watching,
as soon as they cross that line...

310
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,155
...and they walk into a space
that is not theirs...

311
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,496
...it puts everybody
in a very, very tense mode.

312
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,708
And that's something that we knew. And
actually what started the conversation...

313
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,795
...when we started talking
about this movie.

314
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,630
When we were thinking about
what to write after Evil Dead.

315
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,342
And-- And based on that feeling,
we thought:

316
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:02,307
"Okay. What would be a story
that would take place in that space?

317
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,520
And that could have you on that edge
all the time."

318
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,526
And that's when we thought
about this group of kids...

319
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,063
...and who they were
gonna break into...

320
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,731
...and the character
of the Blind Man came out.

321
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,991
MONEY:
There's a bolt here. I can feel it.

322
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,366
COMMENTARY:
And they're all in their own way...

323
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,410
-...extremely likable kids.
-Mm-hm.

324
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,454
I think-- I mean you
kind of understand...

325
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,383
...where they're coming from...

326
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,043
...their needs and everything.

327
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,260
But when they go--
When they go over that fence...

328
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,219
...they kind of...

329
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,101
It's all bets are off, in a way.

330
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,013
They put themselves in a--

331
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,149
A morally indefensible position,
it seems to me.

332
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,976
It's, you know, so--

333
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,613
In other words, "Well, you're
gonna get what you deserve."

334
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,990
-Even though you like them.
-Yeah.

335
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,620
Yeah, that's what is strange
and fascinating about the film as well.

336
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,499
And so far, today, we're doing
this commentary...

337
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,751
...and the movie hasn't come out yet.

338
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,539
But so far just the reaction of the world
based on the trailers...

339
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,674
...and what the concept of the movie is...

340
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,962
...It's very interesting to see
how much debate it caused...

341
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,177
...based on what you said.
They're gonna get what they deserve.

342
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,842
And a lot of people see
the trailer and they go like:

343
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,603
"Well, they get what they deserve."
Now people say:

344
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:32,893
"Well, but the Blind Man was doing
his own things as well there."

345
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,938
But that doesn't mean it's legal for him
to chase them and kill them.

346
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,902
If you feel threatened,
and he definitely does.

347
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,659
Particularly because,
as we're gonna see now they--

348
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,411
They brought a gun into the house.

349
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:48,667
Which the Blind Man's not gonna--
Not gonna stop to argue with them...

350
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,329
...and ask them if they plan
to shoot him with that gun.

351
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,007
So that's why we think it makes for a--

352
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,340
For a very morally conflictive
story to see.

353
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,424
Which is the kind of story that we like.

354
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,843
We don't like to spoon-feed the audience
with the answer, the moral answer.

355
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,309
This sequence here is kind of classic...

356
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,648
...almost James Bond stuff.

357
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,560
You know-- Ha, ha. You know
you have to kind of--

358
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,106
The clock is ticking down
before the bomb goes off.

359
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,820
Before the alarm goes off or whatever.

360
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,406
So it's a nice piece of suspense.

361
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,912
And here for me is one of the--

362
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,370
It's the first time that,
I think in the movie...

363
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,581
...when Pedro Luque, the DP,
starts showing off. Heh, heh.

364
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,247
-He's showing off big time here. Beautiful.
-I say that in a good way.

365
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,167
Because it's one of the most beautiful
shots. How the light from the street...

366
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,712
...hits her eyes as she's realizing that...

367
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,052
...there's something in this house
that's more than what you think.

368
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,514
-This was a really interesting beat.
-I love that beat.

369
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,350
-The picture upside down.
-Upside down.

370
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,937
It really tells you that, yeah,
the guy is really, really blind for sure.

371
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,193
But it's also heartbreaking
in its way too.

372
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,526
Because in some weird way,
it makes him vulnerable.

373
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,032
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you think, "Oh, he did that."

374
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,494
It also tells you
that he doesn't have many friends.

375
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,577
Like there's no people coming
to the house and telling him:

376
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,366
"You put that picture upside down.

377
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,700
You should fix that."

378
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,619
He's a very lonely man right now.

379
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,458
Right. Right.

380
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,713
Yeah, I found that shot,
when I saw the film, to be really moving.

381
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,044
[♪♪♪]

382
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,760
Here, of course, is our long hero shot.

383
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:32,183
That's gonna-- Basically the goal,
obviously, is to get from the start--

384
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,474
It's basically a shot that switches
points of view in the movie...

385
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,234
...and shows you the story
from their point of view.

386
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,773
And it's gonna end up
over the shoulder of the Blind Man.

387
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:48,616
Showing how scary it is for him to be
home-invaded without him knowing it.

388
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:53,040
Obviously, it's showing all the pieces
that are gonna play a part in the movie.

389
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,451
But, I mean, you know,
it's fascinating...

390
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,371
...because what you just
showed there was a tool room.

391
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,131
An orderly tool room.

392
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:04,590
And there's nothing intrinsically
threatening about that.

393
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,004
-Mm-hm. Yeah.
-You know?

394
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,425
I mean, it's tools that he's laid out
to do jobs around the house.

395
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,717
But the audience knows.

396
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,976
Of course, in context.

397
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,013
The audience can see the hammer.
We push into that like we did.

398
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,432
These are all pieces
that are gonna come back.

399
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,444
The bell, that is the alarm system
that the Blind Man has...

400
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,400
...for what's happening in the cellar.

401
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,908
-We're still in one shot here?
-It's one shot that starts at the door...

402
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,445
-Amazing.
-...and ends up upstairs.

403
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:36,744
Of course, we'll know that the money
is right somewhere there. Closet.

404
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,417
And the door to the cellar.

405
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,581
It's all the pieces.

406
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,342
Remember that we always
talked about this movie being...

407
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,630
...kind of a chess game
between these two parts.

408
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,516
So this is a moment
where we show kind of the rules...

409
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,143
...and who are the players.

410
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,224
What door is locked,
what door is not.

411
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,639
-Right.
-Before the game starts.

412
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,981
Right. Stake out the terrain a little bit.

413
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,568
Also, here you start--

414
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:14,785
I think also this is the first time
that you start feeling Roque Banos.

415
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,918
A magnificent soundtrack
which is, like he said...

416
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:23,298
...the whole music
was actually done through...

417
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,923
...not classical instruments...

418
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:31,215
...but mostly pipes
and weird instruments that he found...

419
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:36,683
...made by a guy in Tucson that created
his own instruments in his back yard...

420
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,893
...and called it an orchestra.

421
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:43,276
And in this whole shot,
we really get to enjoy that soundtrack.

422
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:49,236
And like Roque said, "It's like if the house
was singing this unsettling song."

423
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,026
Right.

424
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,829
And you get a glimpse of the daughter.

425
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,208
Which is curious. Of course the TV's
there, but he doesn't watch the TV.

426
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,245
So I thought it was interesting
to have it pointed in a strange way.

427
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,505
Not towards the bed.

428
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,633
But he uses it just to fall asleep
to the sound of his daughter.

429
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,465
Sure, it provides the soundtrack
for his life, I think.

430
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,800
Yeah.

431
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,557
And it's like a lullaby for him.

432
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,013
Here we are.

433
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:21,397
Just like that, we switch point of view
and now we're with him.

434
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,733
As he's the main character
of his movie, right?

435
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,360
He's the hero of his movie.

436
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,942
He's just sleeping,
not bothering anybody...

437
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,108
...and there's a guy walking
into his room.

his moment of bravery, right?

and cool cut you did there.

Not even seeing the rise up, you know?

447
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,191
I think this moment
is kind of setting the tone...

448
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,275
...and the dynamics
of the whole movie.

at first his reaction, of course...

how much they know.

-And you can see it.
- think a lot of that fear--

602
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,985
Because as a rule, I was
just pretty quiet in between takes.

603
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,365
-Just sitting there quietly.
-Yeah.

604
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,447
I think that it was them
doing their work.

605
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,785
That they were projecting an awful lot
of intimidation from me.

606
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,953
And I was just sitting there.
They were doing my work for me.

607
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,838
They were just wonderful, I thought.
So game.

The physicality in the way
that you guys play those scenes...

611
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,256
...IS very important.

612
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,971
One of the things that
we were kind of nervous about...

613
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,807
...when we came up
with the idea is that...

614
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,480
...if this guy is a blind guy...

615
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,143
...and there's three kids, people will think,
"Why don't they take on him?

616
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,944
Why don't they fight him?"

617
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,276
Why don't they just jump on him
and that's it?

618
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,988
But in that scene
where you fight Money...

619
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,739
-...and start punching the wall...
-Mm-hm.

620
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,405
...then it's clear
that it's not an easy task.

621
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,245
So that makes
the whole premise work.

622
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,128
Otherwise, I think
it would have collapsed.

623
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,422
There's not a single moment
of this movie when you feel--

624
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,927
When you think as an audience,
"Oh, they should just jump on him."

625
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,302
Heh. There's no way.

626
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:59,179
Like, this kind of shot,
it establishes dominance.

627
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,516
Even though he doesn't know he's here,
he's dominating the house in a way.

628
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,557
And they're just cowering in corners.

629
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,521
I was gonna say, look at that...

630
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,853
-...how small he is right there.
-That's a great shot.

00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,445
COMMENTARY: And also,
let's not forget that part of the thing...

633
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,749
...that makes your presence so menacing
and makes all this so real...

634
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,128
...were the contact lenses
that you were wearing.

635
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,789
How much could you see?
You couldn't see a lot, right?

636
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,958
So remember that somebody
would bring you to the set?

637
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,011
And you were really becoming
that character on so many levels.

638
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,843
Just the fact that you
got to know that house pretty well.

639
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,011
I don't remember seeing you
bumping against anything...

640
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,062
...during the whole making
of the movie.

641
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,599
-And you could barely see with those.
-Right. Right.

642
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,314
The lenses were extremely helpful...

643
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:58,277
...because they're
a constant obstacle...

644
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,865
...and a constant reminder.

645
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:05,791
Because it cuts
your vision down by 70 percent.

646
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,711
And the rest of it, that other 30 percent,
you kind of just let go.

647
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,044
-You just sort of glaze out, I think.
-Yeah.

648
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,300
So it was extremely helpful.

649
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:22,850
But so much of the blindness,
when I watch the film...

650
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:28,480
...Is really sold by the direction
that you would give me...

651
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:34,612
...when you would say,
"Slang, just tilt your head that way more."

652
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,866
And it all had to do with
how the camera was perceiving me...

653
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,198
...and perceiving my relationship
with whoever was in the room...

654
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,079
...or what I was listening to.

655
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:48,994
So that was a good duet,
I thought, between actor and director.

656
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,334
Or trio really, between actor,
director, and the camera itself.

657
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,172
One of the things
that I loved that you brought...

658
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,337
...is the idea of those marks in the wall.

659
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,678
That was not on the script, obviously.

660
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,760
The fact that the guy...

661
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,680
...he gets around the house
touching the wall.

662
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,021
-Touching the wall all the time.
-There should be stains on the wall.

663

Those marks that have been happening
for a long, long time.

That's the production designer.

...moment of Alex
trying to do the right thing.

They might go to jail perhaps,
but at least they're not gonna die.

to get her alive out of here.

But she has different plans.

She's the boss.
She really is the boss.

how things went south.

-Money got shot.
-Ha, ha.

681

But at the same time,
they find the money.

682
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,959
And it's even a lot more money
than they thought it would be.

683
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,746
-So that raises the stakes.
-It's good we never show it.

684
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,333
Watching I realize the camera...

685
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,338
...never shows you like,
"Look, money."

686
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,090
It never pushes inside the box.

687
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,174
It never shows you the bag.
You just see the blocks of money.

688
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,969
And they're even blurry
in most of the shots.

689
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,639
Because the story
was never really about the cash.

690
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,520
But you know they have
something that they want.

691
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,941
Well, her movie is about the money.

692
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,191
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Yeah, of course.

693
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,653
But the way it's played over there...

694
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,700
...It's so much more about...

695
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,908
...what she wants to do against
what he wants to do at some point.

696
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,916
That was-- Why did you go outside
there? Why were we on that door?

697
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,327
Oh, because he said--
I love this moment.

698
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,497
He said out loud
that that's the way out.

699
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,918
And he says the storm door cellar.

700
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:06,381
It was a brief reminder to the audience,
what was that door?

701
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:10,222
And I think it really helps the audience
to know where we're going...

702
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,261
...and what they're trying to achieve.

703
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,602
I don't like when in stories like this
the audience gets confused...

704
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,063
...about where they're heading.
Where they're going. What's their plan?

705
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:25,116
I wanted be very clear and precise about,
what's the plan here for these kids?

706
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,617
That makes a lot of sense.

707
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,951
I think this scene is kind of like
the spirit of the whole movie.

708
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,492
This is where we wanted
to get with the idea of...

-This is one of my favorite moments.
-...the guy being blind.

710
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,216
It's when we start thinking about
the movie and the idea of the movie.

711
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,467
Thinking about these moments
is when we thought:

00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,465
"Oh, it's gonna be special.

713
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,596
This is worth making.

it's almost like a ghost story.

It's almost like for you, right,
the Blind Man, it's a ghost story.

There is a presence in his house...

...that even though he can't see it...

719
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,355
...he suspects it might be there.

720

But it's such a strange thing.
And it works so well.

I think it made complete sense
that if he went after them...

00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:38,210
...that might have gone wrong.
He was expect--

That's how smart he is.

841

He knows that if they took the money
out of his safe upstairs...

842
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,097
...they know the code.
If they know the code...

00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,391
...he knows
it's the same as downstairs...

...which means they might
have the keys already.

845
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,184
Which means if he decides
to go after them...

846
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,975
...and maybe he doesn't manage to get
to them and block a door or something...

847
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:00,441
...they will get to this door before he does
and they will be out.

And that's not good for him.

849
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,409
So that's why I think he very quickly
put all that together.

850
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:10,619
Turns around and decides
to wait for them on the other side.

Absolutely.

852

Since they've gone
down the rabbit hole...

853
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,662
...he knows they're coming out.

854
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,375
There's only one way to come out.

855
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,048
And he's doing more than that.

856
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,677
By this point he already--
We'll find out later.

857
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,713
But at this point,
he already took the dog.

858
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,427
He put him inside the house.

859
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,348
And he went after them probably.

860
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,227
Because now he's gonna
go after them.

861
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,979
But we'll see that the dog
is already inside the house.

862
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,985
So he's done all that very quickly.

863
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,815
He ran out, took the dog inside,
closed the door...

864
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,609
...and went after them.
So it's incredible.

I would love to see
this movie over again...

...from his point of view.

867
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,577
And realizing the clever things
he's doing...

868
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,542
...one after the other.

869
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:00,289

gonna be able to save the girl?"

873
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,885

of Money is quick, and it's early.

are capable of anything.

And that was
one of the first ideas that we got.

882

The Blind Man didn't even--

887
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,562
He asked one question.

888
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:06,355
The only relevant question was
"How many people in the house?"

889
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,773
And hoping that he might
or might not be honest.

890
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,569

caught him lying.

00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,356
I was so excited.

904
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:50,865
Just an emotional transformation
from being in hunter mode...

905
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:55,245
...and realize what they just did,
and, oh, man, now it's personal.

906
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,039
Before it wasn't.
It was like, I don't care who you are.

907
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,576
You're just gonna die
because you know my secret...

908
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,869
...and I cannot let you go.

909
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,706
-Now I think it's personal.
-Right.

910
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,925
I mean, the thing that--
The prevailing thing that goes on...

911
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,846
...when he knows who it is...

912
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:19,056
...is this feeling of being
bereft immediately, you know?

913
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,690
But there's no time for that.
There's no time for grief at all.

914
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,188
Because he's in a war zone here.
You know?

915
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:31,440
Yeah. Because his feelings
about that girl are rather complex.

916
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,403
-Yeah.
-They are.

917
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:38,913
Because mostly-- I mean, he
definitely has-- I'm sure he has feelings.

918
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:44,578
And he's not a guy
that is taken by hate.

919
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,962
I don't think he's in that place right now.

920
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,380
He's past that probably.

921
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,087
But he definitely--

922
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,795
You know, we'll find out later
she was pregnant.

923
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:58,308
So that scene there
is his daughter dying again.

924
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,138
-Right.
-That's why it's so powerful.

925
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,303
Because he's
been through that already...

926
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,394
...when he found out
about his daughter dying.

927
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,276
And we always imagine
that he was actually on that day...

928
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,188
...when his daughter got run over...

929
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,944
...he was right there in his house
and ran to her body.

930
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,370
So I think that for him,
it's just going through that pain again.

931
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,406
So that's why
he makes it so determined.

932
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,702
Because from this point on
there's no hesitation.

933
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,997
There's no fear whatsoever
from the point of view of the Blind Man.

934
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:31,542
He's completely,
full-on in hunter mode.

935
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,300
But you know if he had the moment
to think about it...

936
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,007
-...he wouldn't have been surprised.
-Yeah.

937
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,144
Because everything that life's given him
has just been a kick in the ass.

And this scene,
it's one of my favorites in the movie.

942
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:54,857
But it's sort of whimsical in a way
because he could just touch the fan...

-Heh-heh-heh.

This scene was also
one of the earliest ideas that we got.

We knew that we were gonna
kill one of them pretty quick.

We knew that we were gonna have
this full dark scene.

This took so much
preparing and thinking.

948
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:21,053
Just in the early stages of preproduction
with Pedro, the DP.

949
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,060
We were like, "There are many things
we need to solve here.

950
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:28,014
But the main one is how are we
gonna do the darkness scene?"

951
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,601
On the page it says,
"Well, he flips a switch...

952
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,145
-...and everything goes completely dark."
-Mm-hm.

953
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:36,565
Which of course gives us moments
like this one we're looking at now.

954
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:37,899
Which are unique.

955
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,239
But look at the way she's--

956
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,786
She's just selling it beautifully there,
isn't she?

957
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:46,040
Totally.
You really believe what she's doing.

958
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,121
You see? I don't know if you notice...

959
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,583
...but every time you shoot the gun,
there's color pumped into the shot.

960
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,508
Of course, the logic is, if there's no light,
there's no color. Right?

961
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:59,046
And so that's why I think
the audience buys it so well.

962
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,881
Black and white and no shadows...

963
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,935
...that indicates that there's no light.

964
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,564
But every time we shoot the gun,
there's a muzzle flash.

965

By the way, for anybody that's thinking,
"Conveniently he ran out of bullets."

966
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,857
We actually counted them.

967

It's precisely how many bullets
there are in that gun.

968
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,945
The ones that he shot
are exactly the gun's--

969

The bullets that you have in that gun.

-Ha-ha-ha.

We counted all of them,
particularly when we were editing...

00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,622
...because you might have shot
more shots like in the shooting itself.

973
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,461
But then when we cut the movie,
we made sure...

in that gun.

and the whole treatment.

making their eyes look dilated.

00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,120
In fact, she's been very unlucky
with the life that she got.

1052
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:47,007
And she's, in a way,
trying to bring justice on her own terms.

1053
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,511
And she feels entitled to do this,
to go get that money.

1054
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,173
She feels like she deserves that.

1055
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,139
I think all the characters are trying
to bring justice...

1056
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,303
-...in their own way.
-Mm.

1057
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,313
That's the moral of the story, I think.

1058
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:05,651
It's like if all of us
just decide to violate all the rules...

1059

...and just go and get whatever we want
and feel that we deserve...

1060
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,987
...like, you get these scenarios, right?

1061
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,119
Like, because she will find out--
She basically finds someone that thinks...

1062
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,875
...ironically, just like her. The Blind Man
and Rocky have a lot in common.

1063
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,957
Just the Blind Man's
been through a lot more than she did.

1064
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:27,499
But they both believe
that they have the right...

1065
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,839
...to break the rules
just to get what they feel...

1066
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,378
...they deserve and--

1067
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,594
We'll leave to the audience
to believe if that's right or not.

1068
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:40,307
But that was definitely the--
Thematically was the strong, you know--

1069
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,348
Just the way-- I just wanna cut in
and say the way that the dog, Athos...

1070
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,188
...the way he has to crouch
his way through there...

1071
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,228
...and everything like that, it just--

1072
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,615
That in and of itself,
it's in two shots, is just so alarming.

1073
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,196
He sort of looks like
a gigantic rat in a way.

-Yeah. Heh, heh.
-You know?

1075
00:56:56,914 --> 00:57:02,080
I remember we were writing the script,
we had this experience on Evil Dead...

1076
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,040
...with the dog
that we used in that movie.

1077
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,296
And it was so hard
to get that dog to do anything.

1078
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:12,210
Like, the smallest things, like,
"Hey, come here," he wouldn't do it.

1079
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,800
And then we wrote
all the scenes with the dog.

1080
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,716
And we were like, "We're never gonna
find a dog that's gonna do that.”

1081
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:22,474
-Ha-ha-ha.
-And fortunately this amazing dog--

1082
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,855
-Oh, the Hungarian dogs are very, very--
-Yeah.

-They're the best.
-Yeah, the best.

1084

That's a great twist as well.

1085
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,313

the Blind Man's gone...

and fools him again.

in places that you don't think he will.

"Well, that was just bad luck."”

that is just gonna be constant darkness.

He shot love scenes
like death scenes...

1195
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,825
...and death scenes
like love scenes.

1196
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:17,492
And this definitely looks
more like a love scene...

1197
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:22,960
...on the setting and there's no cuts.
It's just like this long agony, right?

1198
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:26,342
And I particularly like what--

1199
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,219
Using those short punches.

1200
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:30,629
You know, there's nothing--

1201
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,640
Many times in movies,
you have these long loping punches.

1202
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,019
I mean, these are just--
Those are little-- Three short punches.

1203
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,428
Yeah, they look so painful.

1204
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:42,019
What's interesting about that moment
is that I'm not exactly sure when...

1205
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,026
...he realized that this--
That there was a girl...

1206
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,528
...in this pack of thieves.

1207
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:52,239
And he made the choice,
"Okay, this is--

1208
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,779
-This is actually good."
-Mm-hm.

1209
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,742
- I might need that girl.
-Well, yeah--

1210
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,658
I don't know when exactly it happens
but it could have happened...

1211
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,167
...also when he found the shoes.

1212
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,290
When he smelled her shoes,
I think he knows.

1213
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,172
We were joking,
he knows there's a girl.

1214
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,503
And he knows that.
He maybe even knows...

1215
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:10,965
...that she's having her period, ha, ha,
like, stuff like that. Like, "Hm..."

1216
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,631
I don't think she has her period.
That would have save her, actually.

1217
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,846
Yeah, but I mean, the idea
that he can use her...

1218
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,057
...because the other girl is dead--

1219
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,720
-When does that happen?
-Yeah.

1220
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,607
I mean, I think if you wanna
project it into that...

1221
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,189
...into the kind of weird
love scene upstairs...

1222
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,321
...that we just saw, you can do that.
You know, but that's for--

-Nobody's said anything for 40 minutes.

ROCKY:
You wanted her to pay.

1227
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,494
I understand that.

1228
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,333
I won't tell anyone.

1229
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,293
You understand nothing.

1230
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,673
COMMENTARY:
And the audience...

1231
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,880
...doesn't understand.
It's one of those moments...

1232
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,591
...that you'll find out the truth
about who he is.

BLIND MAN:
--between a father and his child.

1234
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,977
COMMENTARY: Yeah,
I love this speech. It used to be longer.

1235
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,138
And we ended up cutting a bit out of it.

1236
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,557
I think on the deleted scenes
you hear more about it.

1237
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,102
Which it was, of course,
not because it wasn't great...

1238
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,362
...I think it was amazing,
but it was one of the things...

1239
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,944
...that less was more.

1240
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,200
The more mystery
we could keep around him--

1241
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,236
And we'd never wanna do the villain...

1242
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,122
...that just over-explains
his life and his plans.

1243
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,330
So I think we do have the exact amount
that we needed there, I guess, for--

1244
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,917
That's what I thought when I saw it.
I couldn't remember exactly...

1245
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,799
...what was not there,
but I knew there was something.

1246
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,427
But it didn't seem
that it was missing anything.

1247
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,428
-Yeah.
-And then I saw the deleted scene.

1248
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,760
And I went, "Oh, yeah,
that stuff. That was good too."

1249
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,641
It was great.
But at the end of the day...

1250
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,768
...it's like that thing. He doesn't have--

1251
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,555
He doesn't need to talk with her.
He's past all that...

1252
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,815
...like, he explains himself or like...

1253
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:53,777
I think part of him wants to feel human
and less evil about what he's doing.

1254
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,112
That deep inside
he knows that it's a bad thing.

1255
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,651
But he's trying to be--

1256
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:02,244
He's just, of course, turning a blind eye
on what he's doing.

1257
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,533
That's why I think
he explains himself a bit:

1258
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,917
"Hey, I'm not a monster.

1259
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,704
If you could see
the things that happened to me...

1260
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,498
...like, you'll understand, right?"

1261
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:13,884
I love Jane's reaction, her acting here...

1262
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,341
...where she kind of, like,
starts putting the pieces together...

1263
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,847
...and realizing what's coming.

1264
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:21,804
It's really good.

1265
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,265
I like this reveal as well.

1266
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,897
That's almost kind of silly
but it kind of makes sense, right?

1267
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:33,028
He was laying right on top of the body,
and the Blind Man just struck down and--

1268
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,565
And actually if he--

1269
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:38,700
There was a longer version of the shot
where you could see that the--

1270
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:45,708
The blade actually scratch his cheek
and his ear and so he missed by nothing.

1271
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,371
Here's the moment
of, obviously, Alex...

1272
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,256
...starting to turn into, you know...

1273
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:58,387
...the different person, like really--
He started doubting himself so much...

1274
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,672
...and being so scared
of everything. And now he's, like--

1275
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,600
He's been through so much that--
Again, like, moral of this character...

1276
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,808
...Is he's, like,
ready to do something about it...

1277
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:11,350
...and not just be
cowering behind shelves.

1278
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,561
He takes a hammer
and he's gonna do something about it.

1279
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,571
-Ah, yes--
-Oh, the tar.

1280
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:19,358
-This famous scene.
-Heh, heh.

1281
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,162
Franciska,
the girl that played that character...

1282
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,699
...she really took it.
She had to stay there still.

1283
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,460
It was really a black thick paint to the--

1284
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,997
It was harmless
but still, it was terrible.

1285
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,338
And had to just stay there
and let the paint go up...

1286
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,628
...and not breathe and--

1287
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:40,967
Because if she blew it...

1288
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,598
...doing the whole thing again
was impossible.

1289
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:47,102
-Yeah, no, she did a yeoman job.
-Yeah.

1290
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:52,016
I love that the Blind Man has everything
kind of planned ahead of--

1291
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,606
Like, he knew that
if she died, he wasn't gonna go...

1292
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,487
...and bury her in the backyard.

1293
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:00,490
And risking someone
seeing him do that.

1294
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,742
So he had this plan
to bury her in the cellar.

1295
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,370
Or maybe
you could even think that once the--

1296
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,781
She gave birth to the child--

1297
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,496
-He'd get rid of the body.
-That's what I thought...

1298
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,660
Yeah.

1299
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,626
...it was gonna be
because he really couldn't release her.

1300
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,961
But you never know
what would happen by then...

1301
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,625
...you know? I mean...

1302
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,588
Probably he didn't know. I think that--

1303
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,097
In that aspect, I think,
because he's such a--

1304
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:29,057
Emotion is so complex for him,
I think he was trying, you know...

1305
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,847
...on the plan to do with her,
trying to figure out...

1306
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:34,266
...he will cross that bridge
when he gets there.

1307

BLIND MAN:

Once again, that--

The audience thinks they know

1312

They think it's gonna be a rape scene

Just gonna be there.

...all the weirdness,
is that this is gonna follow.

1316

It was that
it was all for the sake of the character.

1317
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,879
Like, we knew
that the Blind Man being who he was...

1318
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:07,675
...and having the codes
that he had-- Like he says now...

1319
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:12,016
...I love the line that, "I'm not a rapist."

COMMENTARY:
Like I said, what follows that...

1325
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,911
...really was for the sake
of not just being perverted...

1326
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:30,914
...or doing something super twisty.

1327
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:34,748
It was just that being who he was...

1328
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,037
...we needed to protect him,
and we didn't wanna have a scene...

1329
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,082
...where he puts his pants down.
He's gonna be an animal.

1330
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,170
He would still have his morals.

1331
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:45,178
And he was gonna do it
in a way that didn't require that.

1332
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,713
Right.

...they don't wanna go
through the sperm bank and--

1339
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,816
It's still pretty twisted.

is the way you do it. It's not--

01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,375
And actually if you take a close look--

1487
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:02,213
Oh, there you go. That's your
first moment he has in the movie.

1488
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:05,420
I think this one here's actually,
the punch.

1489
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,048
And the cut to this moment here.

1490
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,184
And, uh--

1491
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:16,105
-And back at the beginning.
-Back at the beginning of the film.

1492
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:19,476
Which is one of those strange things
where, you know...

1493
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:22,187
...even though you start there...

1494
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,023
...the audience tends to forget about
those openings.

1495
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:28,990
But they've been through so much,
the ones that are overthinking it...

1496
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,154
...maybe they remember,
but a lot forget.

1497
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,831
Then suddenly, you're back there.
And you go, "Yeah.

1498
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,912
-Right, exactly.
-They told me about it.

1499
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:38,703
I should have known better.
She was gonna get caught.”

1500
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:40,087
It's elegant.

1501
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,466
And this,
this is definitely one of those...

1502
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:47,511
...moments that we got so lucky
on the shooting.

1503
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,469
Like, again, very hot day.

1504
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:54,136
The wrangler showed up,
and he had just one ladybug.

1505
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,179
Just literally one ladybug and I--

1506
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:59,395
And completely determined
to not do a CG ladybug...

1507
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,731
...because I didn't do it at the beginning,
I wasn't gonna do it now.

1508
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:06,318
And he puts the ladybug on her hand,
and does the perfect thing...

1509
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:08,233
...that spread the wings...

1510
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,447
...and flies away like right in front of us.

1511
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,077
But the first time he did it...

1512
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,205
...the ladybug did it, we weren't rolling.

1513
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:17,493
Did it so fast, and we didn't roll on it,
and we lost the ladybug.

1514
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:20,794
And then it was everybody in the room
trying to find the ladybug.

1515
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,956
And someone finds it on the drapes...

1516
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,379
...takes it, put it back in the hand,
and it happens.

1517
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,920
And we managed to get
that beautiful shot.

COMMENTARY: Again, I can't help
but feel pity for the Blind Man now.

1523
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:48,152
Like, it's one of those,
you know he's done.

1524
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:52,452
If he cannot hear anything,
like, that'd be very hard for him...

1525
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,702
...to get her.

And Rogue music,
Roque Banos' score like starts--

1527
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,628
Now this is all--
This was all pretty freewheeling here.

1528
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:02,829
This was all--

1529
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,749
Remember the camera.
We didn't have a--

1530
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,333
Yeah.

1531
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,175
We had a blueprint,
but, uh, kind of making it up...

1532
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:14,340
-Yeah.
-...as we went into shooting.

1533
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,350
-Here she comes.
-Yeah.

1534
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:24,142
There was again, I think in the script,
there was many versions of this ending.

1535
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,780
Because it was hard for us morally
to understand what was--

1536
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,780
To really find an answer to
what was the right thing to do...

1537
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,318
...and how the movie should end.

1538
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:38,289
Because we thought that if he died,
the audience might feel bad about it...

1539
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:40,416
...like strangely being such a--
You know...

1540
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:44,250
...being a guy that did something
so terrible. Still, just dying like that...

1541
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:47,207
...in his house
was something that felt wrong.

1542
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:52,425
But most importantly what was
the thing that we really changed...

1543
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,677
...in the script many times,
and it was...

1544
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,969
-...if she was gonna get away with it or not.
-Mm.

1545
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:02,935
I don't know if you notice that, but I love
how you can see the glare in his eyes.

1546
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:07,443
You can see a couple spots of light that
kind of tells you he might not be dead.

1547
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,229
It's gorgeous.

1548
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:12,023
-Little pin pricks of light.
-Yeah.

1549
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,993
And here in this moment,
there used to be--

1550
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:18,951
One of the endings
that I still like was that she--

1551
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:22,082
That was in the script
that we never shot that she heard...

1552
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:25,335
...the sirens of the cars, of the cops,
but they were gonna be closer.

1553
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,918
You're gonna see lights
coming through the windows.

1554
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,716
I mean, not the lights.
You will notice the cars outside.

1555
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,880
And what she would do is she will take
the money, and put it back in the safe.

1556
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:38,387
And that was the only way to get saved.
She wasn't taking the money.

1557
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,518
There was no way to prove
that she was trying to steal anything.

1558
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,679
And she was trying to
get away with that.

1559
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:46,690
But it was one of those
that we felt it wasn't realistic...

1560
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,148
...or even if that happened,
it would have been very complicated.

1561
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,484
So at the end,
we said, like, "Okay, she's gonna--

1562
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:56,071
We're not gonna do a Hollywood ending
where she gives back the money."

1563
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,909
Which was in the script. There was
a version where she went to the police...

1564
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,993
...and gave back the money. Yeah.

1565
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:06,126
I think at the end, we decided that
this was gonna be some sort of pact...

1566
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,453
...between criminals...

1567
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:11,169
...when she learns that the guy is--
The Blind Man is still alive.

1568
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,881
And the Blind Man
is not saying anything about the money.

1569
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,298
And she got away with the money,
it's like a pact between them.

1570
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,715
They're gonna be--

1571
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:23,477
They're gonna keep that secret,
and they're gonna be safe.

1572
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:28,858
Well, it would be a huge disappointment
if she didn't keep the money.

1573
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,142
Heh. Yeah, of course.

1574
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:32,603
I mean, for everyone.

1575
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,990
-I mean, including the viewer, I think.
-Yeah.

1576
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,650
You know. I-- Yeah, the money.

1577
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:41,488
I mean, everything would have been
completely meaningless...

1578
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:44,828
...if she didn't have the money,
because it becomes about her sister.

1579
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:48,370
It becomes about
the dream of California.

1580
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,037
-Yeah.
-And it becomes--

1581
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:54,129
Now becomes about
the possibility of the sequel.

1582
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:57,462
Yeah, but here I love this moment.
They're like so eerie.

1583
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:00,927
Like, you don't-- Even though
it looks like a happy ending...

1584
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:04,184
...like, story-wise. It definitely doesn't
look like a happy ending.

1585
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,641
-We thought that--
-She's leaving with the money.

1586
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,772
And with her sister.
Everything seems well.

1587
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:13,186
But, oh, you know
she's never gonna sleep well anymore.

1588
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,400
Yeah, she knows
she's a criminal from now on.

1589
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,407
Remember when we shot the, um--

1590
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,619
-The Blind Man in the train station?
-Yeah, yeah.

1591
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:24,246
Actually that shot, if that continued...

1592
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:28,284
...you were gonna show up in there,
you'd see the Blind Man behind her.

1593
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,794
You were never gonna see the face.
It was one of the things...

1594
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,376
...you might think it was him or not.

1595
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:37,293
But I'm happy with the end
the way it is that you know there--

1596
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:42,716
There's a price she's gonna pay
that she's never gonna be at peace.

1597
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:46,223
And she knows that
that guy is alive, and who knows?

1598
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,137
He might go after her someday.

1599
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:53,100
This is the title sequence
I personally designed.

1600
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,360
-I love it.
-I did it, I just--

1601
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:59,274
I didn't wanna have black titles against--
You know, white titles against black.

1602
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:03,536
-And I created this sequence.
-No, it's totally cool.

1603
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:08,620
Just to revisit the places in the house
that we spent so much time in.

1604
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,917
Well, and that concludes
this commentary.

1605
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:17,004
-Thanks so much, guys.
-Thanks for watching.
