1
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,252
It's time to go.

2
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:45,672
Did you hear me?

3
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:48,758
This is an evacuation. You understand?

4
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,469
You have to come with me.

5
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:53,263
Why?

6
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,890
Because they told me,
so now I'm telling you.

7
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,852
Everyone in this village, everyone.

8
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,706
It's not safe here.
There's radiation in the air.

9
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,731
What's wrong with you?

10
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,191
Do you know how old I am?

11
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,070
I don't know. Old.

12
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,156
I'm 82.

13
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,992
I've lived here my whole life.

14
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,579
Right here, that house, this place.

15
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:20,457
<i>What do I care about safe?</i>

16
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,334
<i>I have a job.</i>

17
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,128
<i>Don't cause trouble.</i>

18
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:26,963
<i>Trouble?</i>

19
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,134
<i>You're not the first soldier
to stand here with a gun.</i>

20
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:34,596
<i>When I was 12, the revolution came.</i>

21
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:38,099
<i>Czar's men. Then Bolsheviks.</i>

22
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:41,060
<i>Boys like you marching in lines.</i>

23
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,938
<i>They told us to leave. No.</i>

24
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,108
<i>Then there was Stalin and his famine,</i>

25
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,902
<i>the Holodomor.</i>

26
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,156
<i>My parents died.
Two of my sisters died.</i>

27
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:55,950
<i>They told the rest of us to leave.</i>

28
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:57,786
No.

29
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,871
Then the Great War.

30
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,874
German boys. Russian boys.

31
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,878
More soldiers,
more famine, more bodies.

32
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,006
My brothers never came home.

33
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,426
But I stayed, and I'm still here.

34
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,429
After all that I have seen,

35
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,599
so I should leave now,

36
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,393
because of something
I cannot see at all?

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,521
No.

38
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,329
Just one moment!

39
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,340
It's time to go.

40
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:01,140
Please stand up now.

41
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,486
This is your last warning.

42
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:31,754
It's time to go.

43
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:46,996
Come on.

44
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:52,270
Point four.

45
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,199
Point six.

46
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,331
Fifteen.

47
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:11,224
Legasov.

48
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,852
I'll meet him there.

49
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:15,913
The atom is a humbling thing.

50
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,293
It's not humbling, it's humiliating.

51
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,130
Why is the core still exposed
to the air?

52
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,798
Why have we not already covered it up?

53
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:29,719
We want to,
but we can't get close enough.

54
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,681
The debris on the roof is graphite
from the core itself.

55
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:37,977
Until we can push it off the roof
back into the reactor,

56
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,313
it'll kill anyone who gets near it.

57
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,775
You can see
the roof is in three levels.

58
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,737
We've named them.
The small one here is Katya.

59
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,281
1,000 roentgen per hour.

60
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,367
Presume two hours of exposure
is fatal.

61
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,119
The one on the side, Nina.

62
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,538
2,000 roentgen. One hour, fatal.

63
00:08:57,622 --> 00:09:00,666
We used remote-control bulldozers
in Afghanistan.

64
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,044
Too heavy. They'd fall right through.

65
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,046
So then...

66
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,797
Moon rovers.

67
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,675
Lunokhod STR-1's. They're light.

68
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,428
And if we line them with lead,
they can withstand the radiation.

69
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,180
We couldn't put a man on the moon.

70
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,974
At least we can keep a man off a roof.

71
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,477
That is the most
important thing, General.

72
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,396
Under no circumstances
can men go up there.

73
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,315
Robots only.

74
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:27,109
What about this large section here?

75
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:29,737
Masha.

76
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,740
12,000 roentgen.

77
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,827
If you were to stand there
in full protective gear

78
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,663
head-to-toe for two minutes,

79
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,539
your life expectancy
would be cut in half.

80
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,750
By three minutes,
you're dead within months.

81
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,920
Even our lunar rovers
won't work on Masha.

82
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:49,215
That amount of gamma radiation
penetrates everything.

83
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:53,135
The particles literally shred
the circuits in microchips apart.

84
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:55,513
If it's more complicated
than a light switch,

85
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,306
Masha will destroy it.

86
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,975
It would be fair to say that

87
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,769
that piece of roof
is the most dangerous place on Earth.

88
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,903
So, what do we do?

89
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,866
That's what we wanted to ask you.

90
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,172
Tent 181?

91
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,522
It's all right. It's free.

92
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:53,941
It's a little early.

93
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,581
Bacho.

94
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,959
Pavel.

95
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,545
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

96
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:20,718
What unit were you in?

97
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,597
They had me in motor pool in Kiev,
but then they...

98
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,808
Not this bullshit. In Afghanistan.

99
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,268
Oh. Oh, I am

100
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,020
I wasn't in Afghanistan.

101
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:34,982
I'm not in the military.

102
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,233
They're running out of men.

103
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,584
Showers. Food.

104
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,337
Those guys, they dig up the ground.

105
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,339
Those guys, they cut down trees.

106
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:03,928
Those guys, they evacuate people,
I think, like villagers.

107
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:06,847
What about them?

108
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,558
I don't know them. Fuck them.

109
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,062
Janek!

110
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,441
- What do you want?
- Give me an egg basket.

111
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,010
- No. I've only got the one...
- Give me the fucking basket!

112
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:27,660
He's with me. You understand?
Nobody fucks with him.

113
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,248
We make these from lead scrap.

114
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,959
- Put it on under your balls.
- Now?

115
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,795
No, no. You can wait
until the radiation gives you a cunt.

116
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,547
Yes, now.

117
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,260
Over your clothes. Fucking shit.

118
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,728
- You ever go hunting?
- No.

119
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,899
Well, today's your lucky day.

120
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:04,196
You, me, that ugly Armenian
in the tent, Garo,

121
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:05,573
we do animal control.

122
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,075
Animal control?

123
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,453
Yeah, they're radioactive,
so they have to go.

124
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,517
But it's not hard.
They're mostly pets.

125
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,085
They're happy to see you.
They run right up to you.

126
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:19,587
Bang!

127
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,171
You load the bodies on a truck,

128
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,674
dump them in a pit,
bury them in concrete,

129
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,842
and then we drink.

130
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:27,177
As much vodka as you want,

131
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,388
plus 1,000 rubles.

132
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,267
Let's go get you a gun.

133
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:43,879
Yes?

134
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,508
I need to see the following documents.
They're listed as "permission only."

135
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,451
I'm working for the Central Committee.

136
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,238
Comrade?

137
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,069
She can have that one.

138
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,079
Thank you, Comrade.

139
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,389
- <i>All clear.</i>
- Bring up the cameras.

140
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,980
- Signal?
- Acceptable.

141
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,690
Running on board diagnostics.

142
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,817
Tell me when we're
ready to move it.

143
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,279
To think that's what we put
on the moon.

144
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,032
Well, not that one.

145
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,536
I know not that one.

146
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,704
This rover was in storage.
They can build two more.

147
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,166
That should cover Nina and Katya.

148
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,878
And Masha?

149
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,088
The Central Committee
have informed me

150
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,091
that they may have found something
that could work up there.

151
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,093
- From the outside.
- American?

152
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,304
Of course not.

153
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,639
It's a German police robot.

154
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,392
But West German,
so, as you can imagine,

155
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,519
that wasn't
an easy conversation to have.

156
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,231
Diagnostics complete.
Ready to engage main power and motor.

157
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,483
Begin.

158
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,657
Can we move it?

159
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,673
Valery, what's that? A smile?

160
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,487
I see your condition has
improved, Comrade Dyatlov.

161
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,780
No. Leave.

162
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,081
I need your help.

163
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,175
Akimov initiated AZ-5.

164
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,679
- When you gave the order...
- Order? What order?

165
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,517
Toptunov called it out,
Akimov pressed it.

166
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,353
It was the only
good decision they made.

167
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:52,437
Incompetent morons.

168
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,858
Can you confirm
that the reactor exploded

169
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,694
after they attempted to shut it down?

170
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,738
How do I even know it exploded, huh?

171
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,578
I found this in the state archive.

172
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,223
Written in 1976.

173
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,142
It's about the operation

174
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,853
of RBMK reactors
under extreme conditions.

175
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:33,937
So?

176
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,440
The names of the authors
have been redacted,

177
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,567
and two pages have been removed.

178
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,612
Well, the State must protect
its secrets, Comrade.

179
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,781
Do you dare suggest otherwise?

180
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,743
They made a mistake.

181
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,456
They didn't redact
the table of contents.

182
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,177
The missing pages apparently refer

183
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,805
to a positive void coefficient
and AZ-5.

184
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,308
Does that mean anything to you?

185
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,019
What are you after here?
Why are you asking me this?

186
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,372
You worked with this reactor.
You know it better than I do.

187
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,356
So everything's my fault, then?

188
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:20,609
Is that what this is?

189
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,695
I'm not here to blame you.
I'm here to find out what happened.

190
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,215
And whether you realize it or not,

191
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,325
I'm your best chance
to avoid a bullet.

192
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,496
Can you help me or not?

193
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,757
I have no idea
what would have gone here.

194
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,760
Void coefficients
have nothing to do with AZ-5.

195
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,137
There. Now you can go.

196
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,140
- You're not even curious?
- What for?

197
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,520
You think the right question
will get you the truth?

198
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,689
There's no truth.

199
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:03,527
Ask the bosses whatever you want
and you'll get the lie.

200
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,738
And I will get the bullet.

201
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,333
I only have two rules.

202
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:42,918
One.

203
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,338
Don't point this gun at me.
That's easy, right?

204
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,673
You can point it
at this piece of shit.

205
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,425
I don't give a fuck. Never me.

206
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:52,886
Two.

207
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,139
If you hit an animal
and it doesn't die,

208
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,933
keep shooting until it does.

209
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,602
Don't let them suffer,

210
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,022
or I'll kill you. Understand?

211
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,399
I mean it.

212
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,152
I've killed a lot of people.

213
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,160
Good. Then we're ready.

214
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,953
Once we start, they'll run inside
where they feel safe.

215
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,455
So we go door to door.

216
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:04,624
Okay?

217
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,251
Good.

218
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,761
Hey!

219
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,722
Do your job. Door to door.

220
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,778
Go. Go.

221
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,863
Go away. Go!

222
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,754
Don't let them suffer.

223
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,548
Sorry. Sorry.

224
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:03,136
You're dragging that to the truck.

225
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:41,883
You gonna eat?

226
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:53,853
Drink.

227
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:58,900
Again.

228
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,330
Look...

229
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,293
This happens to everyone
their first time.

230
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,129
Normally when you kill a man.

231
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:23,675
But for you, a dog.

232
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,219
So what? There's no shame in it.

233
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,348
You remember your first time, Garo?

234
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:34,310
My first time, Afghanistan.

235
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,565
We were moving through a house,

236
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:42,694
and suddenly a man was there
and I shot him in the stomach.

237
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,864
Yeah, that's a real war story.

238
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,160
There are never any good stories
like in the movies. They're shit.

239
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:56,207
A man was there, boom, stomach.

240
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,878
I was so scared,
I didn't pull the trigger again

241
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,380
for the rest of the day.

242
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:07,260
I thought, "Well, that's it, Bacho."

243
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,555
"You put a bullet in someone."

244
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,016
"You're not you anymore."

245
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,101
"You'll never be you again."

246
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:21,441
But then you wake up the next morning,
and you're still you.

247
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,110
And you realize

248
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,196
that was you all along.

249
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,866
You just didn't know.

250
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:43,004
"The happiness of all mankind."

251
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:47,759
What?

252
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,305
"Our goal is the happiness
of all mankind."

253
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,147
Yeah.

254
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:07,236
I'm happy.

255
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,197
I'm happy every day.

256
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:12,617
All right.

257
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,078
Back to work.

258
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,330
Come on.

259
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,243
It's here.

260
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:07,607
All right.

261
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,694
Get over. Right, hang on.

262
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:15,865
Easy now. Careful.

263
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:17,867
Hold it!

264
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,418
Joker.

265
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,506
It's what the Germans
named it. "Joker."

266
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:32,924
Is it ready?

267
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:34,592
It's ready.

268
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,140
Good signal.

269
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,601
Cameras.

270
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,104
Motors.

271
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,608
Motors, good. Signals, good.

272
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,736
All right, let's take this easy.

273
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,531
Forward one meter, reverse one meter.

274
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:41,826
Forward one.

275
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:47,415
Germans.

276
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,126
Reverse one.

277
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:04,348
Did you lose the signal?

278
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,916
It's not the signal. It's the vehicle.

279
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:14,859
It's dead.

280
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,366
Shit.

281
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,165
Of course, I know they're listening!

282
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,375
I want them to hear!
I want them to hear it all!

283
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,194
Do you know what we're doing here?

284
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,963
Tell those idiots what they have done!

285
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,717
I don't give a fuck!

286
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:43,846
Tell them! Go tell them! Ryzhkov!

287
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,139
Go tell them he's a joke!

288
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,183
Tell fucking Gorbachev!

289
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,267
Tell them!

290
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,417
The official position of the State

291
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:18,589
is that a global nuclear catastrophe
is not possible in the Soviet Union.

292
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,591
They told the Germans

293
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:25,304
that the highest detected level
of radiation was 2,000 roentgen.

294
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,849
They gave them the propaganda number.

295
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:33,396
That robot was never going to work.

296
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:39,360
We need a new phone.

297
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:22,778
What if we don't clear it?

298
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,613
We have to clear it.

299
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:29,326
If we don't clear the roof,
we can't build a cover over it.

300
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:34,290
If we can't cover it,
that's 12,000 roentgen.

301
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,627
Nearly twice the radiation
from the Hiroshima bomb.

302
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,423
- Every hour, hour after hour...
- I know, I know, I know.

303
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:44,550
What about lead?

304
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,678
We could... I don't know.

305
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:51,015
We could melt it and pour it
from above, like a coating.

306
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,558
First of all, we've already used

307
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:54,101
most of the lead we had...

308
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:56,270
There's lead sheeting
around the instruments

309
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,147
in the other reactor buildings.

310
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,900
The soldiers are stripping it
for their armor.

311
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,151
Are you serious?

312
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:09,575
Even if, we're still talking
about boiling metal in a helicopter.

313
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:12,036
And it's lead, Boris.
It'll weigh a ton.

314
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:18,000
What if we shoot the graphite
into the hole?

315
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,961
We've got high-caliber bullets,
exploding bullets.

316
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:23,130
They wouldn't just ricochet,
they'd push...

317
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:27,343
You wanna shoot exploding bullets
at an exposed nuclear reactor?

318
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,011
- Well...
- No, no.

319
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,472
Let's go light that roof back on fire.

320
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,058
It was so easy
to put out the first time.

321
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,853
What are we talking about here?

322
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,482
We need another robot.

323
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:45,277
One that can withstand the radiation.

324
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:47,905
I've asked. There is nothing.

325
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,616
The Americans?

326
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,285
If the Americans had
that kind of technology,

327
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,969
do you really think
they'd give it to us?

328
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:56,038
And even if they would,

329
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,933
the Central Committee
would never stoop to ask.

330
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,291
You know it, I know it.

331
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,128
There are no robots.

332
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,344
Biorobots.

333
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,680
What was that?

334
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:21,021
We use bio robots.

335
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,192
Men.

336
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:55,324
A lot today.

337
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:01,997
Where do they get their food?

338
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,210
They eat the chickens.

339
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:09,213
Then they eat each other.

340
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,267
Door to door.

341
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:34,715
Pavel?

342
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:41,138
Pavel!

343
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,733
You don't hear me? I'm talking to you.

344
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:56,320
Fuck.

345
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:02,826
Just go outside.

346
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:10,918
Go.

347
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:06,093
<i>Comrade soldiers,</i>

348
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:09,096
the Soviet people have had
enough of this accident.

349
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:11,056
They want us to clean it up,

350
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:13,559
and we have entrusted you
with this serious task.

351
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:15,866
<i>Because of the nature
of the working area,</i>

352
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:19,606
<i>you will each have no more
than 90 seconds to solve this problem.</i>

353
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:23,026
<i>Listen carefully
to each of my instructions,</i>

354
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,696
<i>and do exactly as you have been told.</i>

355
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:29,741
<i>This is for your own safety
and the safety of your comrades.</i>

356
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,369
<i>You will enter Reactor Building Three.</i>

357
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,498
<i>Climb the stairs, but do not
immediately proceed to the roof.</i>

358
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:38,834
<i>When you get to the top, wait inside,</i>

359
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,253
<i>behind the entrance to the roof
and catch your breath.</i>

360
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:44,047
<i>You will need it for what comes next.</i>

361
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:47,634
<i>This is the working area.
We must clear the graphite.</i>

362
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:48,927
<i>Some of it is in blocks,</i>

363
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:51,138
weighing approximately
40 to 50 kilograms.

364
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:53,390
They all must be thrown
over the edge here.

365
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:57,144
Watch your comrades
moving fast from this opening,

366
00:48:57,227 --> 00:49:00,814
then turning to the left,
and entering the workspace here.

367
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,774
<i>Take care not to stumble.</i>

368
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:05,444
<i>There's a hole in the roof.
Take care not to fall.</i>

369
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:10,198
<i>You will need to move quickly,
and you will need to move carefully.</i>

370
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,827
<i>Do you understand your mission
as I have described it?</i>

371
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,579
<i>Yes, Comrade General.</i>

372
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:19,041
<i>These are the most important
90 seconds of your lives.</i>

373
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:22,711
<i>Commit your task to memory,
then do your job.</i>

374
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:08,757
It's time to go.
After 90 seconds, I will ring a bell.

375
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:11,635
When you hear it, return immediately,
drop your shovels in the bin,

376
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,513
and proceed down the hallway
for decontamination.

377
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:18,266
Above all, while on the roof,
throw your debris over the rail.

378
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,976
Do not look over the rail.
Is that clear?

379
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:25,315
Very well. On my mark. Ready. Go.

380
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:06,666
Whoa!

381
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:39,324
Comrade soldier.

382
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:42,202
You're done.

383
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:55,757
Time to go.

384
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:10,480
Oi! Your glove!

385
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:32,419
Mommy! Mommy!

386
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:38,443
Sorry for all this.

387
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,072
But we needed to speak to you
somewhere without...

388
00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:45,784
They're going to put
Dyatlov on trial,

389
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,495
and Bryukhanov and Fomin.

390
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:52,415
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony,

391
00:54:52,624 --> 00:54:53,708
all three of us.

392
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,293
But that's...

393
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:56,670
Before that happens...

394
00:54:57,045 --> 00:55:00,382
The Central Committee
is sending Legasov to Vienna.

395
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:02,505
It's the headquarters
of the International Atomic...

396
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,553
Atomic Energy Agency.
Yeah, I know what's in Vienna.

397
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:09,349
What are they asking you to do?

398
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,601
Tell the world what happened.

399
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,828
Well, then you'd better
know what happened.

400
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:22,570
I've constructed a timeline,
minute by minute.

401
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,407
Second by second in some places.

402
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:29,661
Every decision, every button push,
every turn of a switch.

403
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:32,414
And? Are they guilty?

404
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:34,290
Yes.

405
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,795
Of gross incompetence,
violation of safety regulations,

406
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,505
recklessness beyond belief.

407
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:43,758
But the explosion? I'm not sure.

408
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:45,427
What do you mean, you're not sure?

409
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,513
I've analyzed the data.

410
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,932
Toptunov was telling the truth.

411
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,436
They shut the reactor down,
and then it exploded.

412
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,648
I think
this article may have the answer,

413
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:02,068
but two pages have been removed.

414
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:09,993
You've seen this before.

415
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,246
Please, believe me when I tell you

416
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:15,832
that I had no idea
it could cause an explosion.

417
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:18,918
- None of us knew.
- None of you knew what?

418
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:23,173
In 1975, at an RBMK reactor
in Leningrad,

419
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:27,510
a fuel channel ruptured.
The operators pressed AZ-5,

420
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:30,096
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

421
00:56:30,472 --> 00:56:33,141
for a brief moment, it went up.

422
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,143
How is that possible?

423
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:38,688
Well, this was the very question posed
by a colleague of mine named Volkov.

424
00:56:38,772 --> 00:56:40,273
He's the one who wrote this article.

425
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,859
When an RBMK reactor runs
at low power,

426
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:44,569
it's notoriously unstable.

427
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:46,738
Prone to swings in reactivity.

428
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,116
Under normal circumstances,
the control rods

429
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,702
- can compensate for that.
- Under normal circumstances.

430
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:56,206
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

431
00:56:56,623 --> 00:56:58,303
They pulled
almost all the control rods out

432
00:56:58,374 --> 00:56:59,454
to bring the power back up.

433
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:01,920
This is what Volkov learned
from Leningrad.

434
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:05,131
If the boron control rods
are completely withdrawn

435
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:07,634
from the reactor,
when they're put back in,

436
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:11,012
the first thing
that enters the core isn't boron.

437
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:13,056
It's graphite.

438
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:20,688
The control rods have graphite tips
that displace water and steam.

439
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:25,360
So the reactivity doesn't go down.
It goes up dramatically.

440
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,197
Why on earth
would they press that button?

441
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:30,907
They didn't know.

442
00:57:33,243 --> 00:57:34,869
Volkov warned the Kremlin,

443
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,955
10 years ago.

444
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:42,752
But there could be no doubt
about the supremacy

445
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:44,921
of the Soviet nuclear industry.

446
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,631
Oh.

447
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:50,176
The KGB classified it
as a state secret.

448
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:54,264
When I saw the
reactor blown open,

449
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:57,183
I still didn't think
it could be this flaw in AZ-5.

450
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:01,187
Because the flaw will not lead
to an explosion

451
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:06,067
unless the operators have pushed
the reactor to the edge of disaster.

452
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:08,486
- So it is their fault?
- Yes.

453
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:10,655
But not only their fault.

454
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:13,616
No.

455
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:17,370
Is that
what you're going to say in Vienna?

456
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,626
You can't possibly be that naive.

457
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:30,175
There are 16 RBMK reactors
running in the Soviet Union right now.

458
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:31,843
We have to fix them.

459
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:35,138
The only way to do that
is to go public,

460
00:58:35,305 --> 00:58:37,265
force the Central Committee
to take action.

461
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:40,268
What you're proposing
is that Legasov humiliate a nation

462
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:43,271
that is obsessed
with not being humiliated.

463
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:45,106
We can make a deal with the KGB.

464
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:48,151
You'll leave this information out
in Vienna,

465
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,112
and they quietly
let us fix the remaining reactors.

466
00:58:51,196 --> 00:58:54,782
A deal with the KGB? And I'm naive.

467
00:58:56,826 --> 00:59:00,246
They'll go after your family,
they'll go after your friends.

468
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,874
You have a chance to talk
to the world, Valery.

469
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,043
If that chance was mine...

470
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:06,377
But it isn't, is it?

471
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:10,465
I've known braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

472
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:13,259
Men who had their moment
and did nothing.

473
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,596
Because when it's your life
and the lives of everyone you love,

474
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:19,807
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

475
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:21,392
It leaves you.

476
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:26,481
And all you want at that moment
is not to be shot.

477
00:59:31,236 --> 00:59:33,529
Do you know the name Vasily Ignatenko?

478
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:35,448
No.

479
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:37,617
He was a fireman.

480
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:41,537
He died two weeks after the accident.

481
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:44,207
I've been looking in on his widow.

482
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,794
She gave birth. A girl.

483
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,588
The baby lived for four hours.

484
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:54,109
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

485
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,969
but the baby absorbed it instead.

486
00:59:56,886 --> 00:59:57,887
Her baby.

487
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,266
We live in a country

488
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,018
