1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,322
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,605
For five years, I was stranded on an island
with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,607
Survive.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,411
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,881
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish...

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,168
...to use the list of names he left me...

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,641
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,642
To do this, I must become someone else.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,047
I must become something else.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,920
Previously on Arrow:

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,289
Looking for Detective Hall.
I was told he works in Vice.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,011
- Oliver?
- McKenna Hall.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,401
I live to surprise.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,364
- I want to find Walter.
- My stepfather.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,881
I'll help you rescue him, but that's it.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,485
That's my offer.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,321
Okay.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,766
Jerry.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,606
Jerry, you okay?

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,485
- You look a little piqued, man.
- I'm fine, it's, uh...

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,166
Ms. Hill wants us to move the Sherwood
into the vault.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,885
Now? It's midday.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,203
I know. She says it's a security threat.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,886
It's all the robberies lately. Heh.

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,487
That way.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,849
Take this thing off me, all right?
I got it like you asked. Here.

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,922
Take it off me.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,403
Were you...? Were you bluffing?
Would that thing have detonated?

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,568
Violently. Don't worry, though.

30
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,724
You did exactly as I asked,
so it's just unconsciousness for you.

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,207
Unconscious?

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,843
Might wanna take it easy if you plan
on taking someone off that list.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,571
This is me taking it easy.

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,690
So who's the unlucky guy tonight?

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,326
Ken Williams.

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,562
His pyramid scheme stole millions.

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,167
People didn't just lose their homes,
their lives were ruined.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,324
Why don't you call it in early?
I'm not expecting much trouble.

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,607
Felicity. Did you just...?

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,082
Computer-override your lock?
Maybe a little.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,084
- What are you doing?
- I pulled up information on Mr. Williams.

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,483
Did you know he's a widowed father
of a 10-year-old boy?

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,043
I told you, I'm only in this to help Walter, not
to be an accessory to orphaning little kids.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,406
I'm giving him a warning.

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,404
Has it occurred to you
you could do some good in the city?

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,689
Beyond recovering people's
stock portfolios and saving accounts.

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,166
You're not the only one who knows
how to reboot my system.

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,527
I made a mistake.

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,720
- Getting in my way? I don't disagree.
- No.

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,561
Signing on with you. Even provisionally.

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,688
Hey. Hey. Drink.

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,370
Tastes like dirt.

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,090
You gotta stay hydrated, okay?

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,163
Hydration is not my problem.

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,802
My problem is getting a bullet
dug out of my arm with a dull blade.

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,883
Let me take a look.

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,291
- Oh. Ugh.
- Is it infected?

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,568
Go figure.

59
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,404
Yeah. Uh...

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,963
I gotta stop that before it spreads.

61
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,724
When you swing past the drugstore
for those antibiotics...

62
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,930
...you wanna get me a copy of Maxim
or maybe a Sports Illustrated?

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,330
Yao Fei had these super herbs back
in the cave that would heal anything.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,207
All right?

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,203
I'm gonna go get them.

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,562
You're not gonna last an hour out there.

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,410
Well, I guess you better hope
I get back in 45 minutes, then.

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,605
Oh. Thank you for coming.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,162
It is so good to see you, Frank. Mm.

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,207
- It's been far too long.
- Yes.

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,207
My interests in China
have kept me away more than I'd like.

72
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,770
But with the Undertaking approaching, I felt
a return to Starling City was in order.

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,647
Actually, Frank, it's the Undertaking
that I wanted to talk to you about.

74
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,121
I wanna get out.

75
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,247
Is this because of
what happened to Walter?

76
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,171
With Walter. With Robert.

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,689
Last week, the vigilante
nearly made my children orphans.

78
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,649
I've reached my limit, Frank.

79
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,000
That's, uh...

80
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,251
...a lot to confide in me, Moira.

81
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,006
Robert did.

82
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,248
I know he reached out to you,
whether I was supposed to know it or not.

83
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,925
He had misgivings.

84
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,731
He sought you out
because he knew you did too.

85
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,167
But then he was murdered.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,844
And that should be a cautionary tale
for both of us.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,449
Yes, I know. And I've gone along with this
for as long as I can stomach it.

88
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,049
We started this to fix the Glades, Frank.

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,527
To cure the city, not lay it to waste.

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,802
You got into this because of
what happened to your daughter.

91
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,451
Frank...

92
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,682
...what would Amanda want you to do?

93
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,328
Well, maybe we should come back later.

94
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,807
No, maybe we should wait.
This is really serious.

95
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,804
What if her next attack of conscience
leads her to the police?

96
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,166
No, she won't say anything.

97
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,840
I had to make the same calculation
when you found out about me.

98
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,850
Mm-hm. What would you have done
if you were wrong...

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,651
...and I decided to make a call
to Detective Lance?

100
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,685
I would've put an arrow in you.

101
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,489
Really? You really would have done that?
Really?

102
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,440
Hmm. I had a bet going with myself
on how quickly you would visit...

103
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,285
...tell me not to reveal your secret.
Looks like I won.

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,171
Actually, I was hoping that
I could get you to change your mind.

105
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,320
I was worked up on adrenaline last night, and
I didn't exactly put my best foot forward.

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,569
I was hoping you'd give me the opportunity
to do that now.

107
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,488
How about you start with Ken Williams?

108
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,041
Did he also enjoy your adrenaline
last night?

109
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,369
No. He returned the money he stole
in time to put his son to bed.

110
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,921
Like I said, Felicity, just a warning.

111
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,126
We'd like to remind the public
we are coordinating efforts with Interpol...

112
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,442
...as the Dodger operates
primarily in Europe.

113
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,366
They have advised us to warn the public
he is considered armed and extremely...

114
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,000
I heard about this guy.
They call him the Dodger...

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,802
...because he avoids getting his hands dirty.
He uses hostages to do his stealing for him.

116
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,009
- How?
- Puts a bomb collar around their necks.

117
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,529
Last year, a guy in Madrid didn't steal what
the Dodger told him to. It took his head off.

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,200
Now this
psycho's in Starling City?

119
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,169
Too bad his name's
not in your notebook.

120
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,962
Not all people that I target are on the list.
Every once in a while, I make an exception.

121
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,930
Hostage-taking jewel thief, for example.

122
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,368
So why don't you help us take him down?

123
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,925
He's late.

124
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,167
Never.

125
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,726
I maintain a Swiss account
for financial transactions.

126
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,004
Here's the number.

127
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,247
Thanks.

128
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,688
I'll wire you the money.

129
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,406
Assuming I don't misplace the numbers.

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,968
My bookkeeping method is a little sloppy.

131
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,044
Really? Heh.

132
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,524
Clearly, you're under the impression that
you can have the Sherwood ruby for a steal.

133
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,968
Well, you're new here in town.

134
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,125
We're not as refined in Starling City.

135
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,362
I am getting that impression.

136
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,807
Don't worry...

137
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,804
...your men are merely unconscious.

138
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,168
In about 17 minutes, they'll wake up with the
ability to tell every other fence in this town...

139
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,086
...that I am not to be trifled with.

140
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,961
What about me?

141
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,846
Uh...

142
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,449
What about you, indeed.

143
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,610
Soto catch this guy we need to either figure
out where he is or where he's gonna be.

144
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,924
This really how you guys figure out how to
get your target? Over burgers and shakes?

145
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,210
Sorry it took me so long. I'm waiting on
a bunch of particularly rowdy customers.

146
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,170
You need me to handle that?

147
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,971
I appreciate it, but I'm a pro by now.

148
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,929
I'll be here if you need me.

149
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,410
Girlfriend?

150
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,449
No, no, that's my sister-in-law.

151
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,122
- Sort of.
- Carly was married to Dig's brother.

152
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,930
And he passed away.

153
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,847
- Well, looks like she's hot for you.
- Ah. Can we get back to crime-fighting?

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,651
Actually, I was thinking
you probably should ask her out.

155
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,847
- Really?
Mm-hm.

156
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,168
I'll do that five minutes
after you ask out McKenna.

157
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,608
Ooh, the detective on the Dodger case.
You have a thing for her?

158
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,683
- Uh...
- Yes.

159
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,962
This is way too hard

160
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,804
I don't see you asking Carly out.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,050
Felicity, this guy, he's targeting
a very specific type of jewel.

162
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,168
We figure out why...

163
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,402
...and that'll give us
the how to catch him.

164
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,800
- I have an idea.
Mm-hm.

165
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,249
Your crush object with a badge said
they were working with Interpol.

166
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,520
Why don't
I work up a little tech...

167
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,440
...you distract her with a little flirty-flirt,
slip said tech onto her phone...

168
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,082
...it'll turn it into a microtransmitter
and, boom, we'll learn everything she knows.

169
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,366
Hmm.

170
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,487
- It's not how I typically get my information.
- How do you typically do it?

171
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,281
I find the person and then I put
the fear of God into them until they talk.

172
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,090
But we can try your way.

173
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,325
You know, Carly, I don't
want this to, um...

174
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,844
You know, to come off weird or anything,
it's just...

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,005
I never wanted to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over

176
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,844
Would you like to have dinner?

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,604
How about tonight?

178
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,091
- Tonight?
- What...

179
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,205
...we haven't waited long enough?

180
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,008
All that I Want All that I Want

181
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,851
Mm. Who knew street meat
could taste so good?

182
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,441
I had a feeling you needed a break
from the office.

183
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,730
Hank was my first client.

184
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,402
I kept his son from being sent away
for a mugging that he didn't commit.

185
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,962
Then how did that not score you
free hot dogs for life?

186
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,169
CNRI gives low-income people
access to the legal system.

187
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,847
Without them,
his son could have gone to prison forever.

188
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,281
I could've gone to prison too.

189
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,922
He couldn't afford a dream team
of super-lawyers.

190
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,085
So I'm supposed to feel guilty because
I'm lucky enough to have a rich family?

191
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,321
No.

192
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
You are lucky.

193
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,962
And hopefully, CNRI will show you that.

194
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,170
Hey!

195
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,965
Give us the purse
and we won't press any charges.

196
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,167
Yeah, you're right.

197
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,607
I really do feel lucky.

198
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,725
This got snagged as
he vaulted over the fence.

199
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,530
Looks like a chain from his wallet.

200
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,851
- I thought you gave up crime-fighting.
- What?

201
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,611
Well, the business with your sister.
I figured...

202
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,127
- Oh.
- ...you'd stay out of police precincts.

203
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,964
Yeah, I... I saw you on the news
and realized that I never thanked you...

204
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
...for everything that you did, so...

205
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,848
Thank you.

206
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,681
So you got promoted.

207
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,441
- Major Crimes.
- Wow.

208
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,642
And they assigned me to the Dodger case.

209
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,768
He extorts people into stealing for him.

210
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,044
- How's that going?
- Slow.

211
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,684
It was nice seeing you
the last time that I saw you.

212
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,644
Yeah. It was good seeing you too.

213
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,490
It was like old times.

214
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,404
Except the PG version.

215
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,765
- How do you mean?
- Ha, ha.

216
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,009
Well, you and I always knew
how to have a fun time.

217
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,208
Something that's been
missing from my life.

218
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,646
So how about a drink?

219
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,881
Not now.

220
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,930
Would you maybe...? I'll take you for a...

221
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,923
Would you like to have dinner with me,
McKenna?

222
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,970
- Ha, ha.
- I was on a deserted island for five years...

223
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,280
...and I am totally out of practice
with this whole...

224
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,530
Mm. Well, dinner would be nice.

225
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,127
In fact, I can make myself free tonight.

226
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,565
- Yeah.
- Great.

227
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,131
So I'll grab you at 8?

228
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,930
That's perfect.

229
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,005
- Okay.
- Okay.

230
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,044
- I'm lingering. I'm gonna go.
- Ha, ha. Okay.

231
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,769
Who's there?

232
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,764
Help me.

233
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,082
Lance. MCKENNA
: It's Detective Hall.

234
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,083
I have an update on the Dodger case.

235
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,641
A body was found at an art gallery
shot point-blank.

236
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,280
There were three other men,
all rendered unconscious...

237
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,369
...by a highly focused electric current.

238
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,403
Same MO as that guard at the museum.

239
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,846
You got an ID on the vic?

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,650
His name is Cass Derenick.

241
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,165
Pause.

242
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,446
Who's Cass Derenick?

243
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,568
Arrest, possession of stolen goods.

244
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,001
Arrest, conspiracy.

245
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,567
Conviction, attempted sale of stolen goods.

246
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,446
This guy's a fence. The Dodger's looking
to unload the Sherwood ruby.

247
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,967
Which means he'll be in the market
for a new fence.

248
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,361
One he hasn't, you know, killed.

249
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,490
So we find the fence
and we find the Dodger.

250
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,004
Anyway, I saw online
that you sell a chain wallet...

251
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,083
...with an eight ball on the chain.

252
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,046
I was wondering if you could give me
a name of one of your customers...

253
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,804
...if I gave you a description.

254
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,166
Yeah, sure, you can call me back.

255
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,848
You and every other used-clothing
and leather-goods store I've called today.

256
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,481
What was that about?

257
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,886
- What's up with the fancy-fancy?
- What...? Oh, um... Heh.

258
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,647
I have a date. Contrary to popular opinion,
I do have a life.

259
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,610
Then why do you seem so nervous?

260
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,527
Is it obvious?

261
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,001
Just be your charming and brooding self.

262
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,969
I mean, girls seem to dig that.

263
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,169
This girl's different.

264
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,847
She knew me before the island,
before I was...

265
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,288
It's CNRI. I've gotta take this. I'm working
on a very important purse-snatching case.

266
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,130
Yeah.

267
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,524
Hello?

268
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,931
Yeah, he might have been wearing
a red hoodie.

269
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,481
Kind of Abercrombie-looking.

270
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,291
His face, not the hoodie.

271
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,566
Really?
You wouldn't happen to have his name?

272
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,285
You had to sell your gold

273
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,442
Thank you so much.

274
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,881
Hey, Laurel.
Does your dad still, like, arrest people?

275
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,124
I found the dirtbag.

276
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,886
His name is Roy Harper.

277
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,367
I can't remember the last time I was here.

278
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,368
It's so beautiful.

279
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,963
Yeah, this was the place
to take a girl in high school.

280
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,329
Hmm, I was never lucky enough
to experience that.

281
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,484
I had braces and terrible bangs back then.

282
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,282
I'm sure you looked amazing.

283
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,681
I'm glad we finally got
around to doing this.

284
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,609
Me too.

285
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,124
You know, Andy set a pretty high bar
when it came to first dates.

286
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,327
Hmm.

287
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,448
He faced down armed gunmen for a living...

288
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,446
...but I've never seen him as scared
as he was before that first date with you.

289
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,889
Carly, I'm sorry, that wasn't good
first-date etiquette, was it?

290
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,601
To bring up Andy
when we are having a romantic night?

291
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,287
- Probably not.
- Carly, this is difficult and complicated.

292
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,963
It's not like there's a manual, you know?

293
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,044
You know, for a moment...

294
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,847
...I felt like a girl who likes a boy
and nothing else mattered.

295
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,731
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

296
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,810
If this is too hard for you
or too complicated...

297
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,800
...then please, you know, just get out now
because I've already been hurt too much.

298
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,287
- I'm sorry...
- Can you just please take me home?

299
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,208
In these little moments

300
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,125
Get your cards out

301
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,645
lam waiting

302
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,850
Mm. No, no, no, it is not possible
for something to be this good.

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,650
- Right?
on.

304
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,321
- You must have missed soufﬂés.
- What do you mean?

305
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,687
Five years on an island
away from civilization.

306
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,169
What did you do? What did you eat?

307
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,003
- Where'd you sleep? How did you make it?
- McKenna.

308
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,004
Sorry.

309
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,089
- Didn't mean to drill you.
- It's okay.

310
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,766
I haven't had a conversation
with a guy in a while...

311
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,367
...without it resulting in
me reading him his rights.

312
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,171
Heh.So ""

313
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,085
Yeah, but those years,
they must have changed you.

314
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,367
From the guy I used to party with
to who you are now.

315
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,647
Yeah.

316
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,969
I had to make some tough choices.

317
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,360
Help me.

318
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,570
You're right.

319
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,401
It changed me.

320
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,687
I am waiting

321
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,004
- What kind of tough choices?
- I don't wanna talk about those experiences.

322
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,482
In these little moments

323
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,090
Saved by the cell.

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,643
Hall. Ahem.

325
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,006
Okay, put what the Cl told you in the
warrant application. I'll be right there.

326
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,764
It's work. I gotta go.

327
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,769
Okay.

328
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,123
Felicity, listen. I need you to activate
the bug in McKenna's phone.

329
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,800
I think the police just
got a lead on the Dodger.

330
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,485
Okay.

331
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,360
Who are you?

332
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,450
My name's Alan Durand.
I'm an exchange student.

333
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,728
I was on a fishing excursion with my class.

334
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,564
We got lost and our boat caught fire.

335
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,604
It was some mechanic malfunction.
We had to jump ship.

336
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,883
- When?
- Two days ago.

337
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,802
It was awful. I thought I was gonna die.

338
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,683
Where are the other students?
Where's the boat's crew? Huh?

339
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,682
I think I'm the only one who made it.

340
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,920
I managed to get to shore.
I thought I was lucky.

341
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,051
What? Somebody found you?
Soldiers or...

342
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,810
Yes!

343
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,763
Yes. They had these masks on.

344
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,124
They attacked me and beat me!
They left me here!

345
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,123
Who are they?

346
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,121
You can untie me at any point, by the way.

347
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,965
- Nice place you have here.
- Thank you.

348
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,488
Tell me, does every fence
in this town hire muscle?

349
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,446
Heh. I did as soon as I heard
about what you did to Cass Derenick.

350
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,440
Ah, yes, Cass. God rest his soul.

351
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,889
He wasn't a very nice man.

352
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,447
- He tried to steal from me.
- Oh.

353
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,410
I've heard that you have
a better sense of judgment.

354
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,849
And that you'd have no trouble
in moving this.

355
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,251
Well, it's only a recession
for some people.

356
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,847
I take a 15 percent commission
off the top.

357
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,931
Let's call it 12, shall we?

358
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,369
I don't have to remind you
what happened to the last person...

359
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,449
...who tried to screw me over.

360
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,406
S.C.P.D. Grab the floor!

361
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,887
- Come quietly.
- I'm afraid I'll have to decline.

362
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,651
Then I'm afraid
you won't be going to jail.

363
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,642
I heard on the news the Dodger got away.

364
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,406
Hopefully the night
wasn't a complete waste.

365
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,568
Your dates. How'd they go?

366
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,489
- Great.
- Awesome.

367
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,409
You two suck at lying.

368
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,962
The police and I busted it up
before the Dodger could get himself paid.

369
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,961
- Don't change the subject.
- ls your hacker chip still working?

370
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,644
You two are no fun.

371
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,324
Yeah. Still getting a strong signal.

372
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,123
You should pull up the police records.

373
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,124
- Everything the Dodger's stolen so far.
- What're you thinking?

374
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,649
We know the Dodger has a taste
for a very specific type of antiquity.

375
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,131
Yeah. These all look like
they're from the ominous decade.

376
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,327
The last ten years
of King Ferdinand's reign.

377
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,644
- And she says we have no lives.
- Are there any other places...

378
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,730
...that sell or display items
from the ominous thing?

379
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,962
Decade. Not really.

380
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,007
People in Starling City
prefer the Elizabethan era.

381
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,770
Starling City Cancer Society.

382
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,440
It says they're holding
a fundraising auction tomorrow.

383
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,128
- We could lure him out into the open.
- With what, a fake?

384
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,005
No. The Dodger has a trained eye
for this sort of thing.

385
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,761
He's not gonna fall for anything
less than the genuine article.

386
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,321
Where are we gonna get
a rare Spanish antiquity?

387
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,603
You really have no idea
how rich his family is, do you?

388
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,725
Roy William Harper Jr.

389
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,364
- Where's senior?
- Norris Cemetery.

390
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,566
- Sorry to hear that.
- You and an army of bookies.

391
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,130
- Can I go?
- No.

392
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,487
You've been ID'd as a suspect
in a purse snatching.

393
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,410
Quite a resume you've compiled here.

394
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,361
Petty theft, B and E, robbery, petty theft.

395
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,211
Stolen car. It's nice to change things up
once in a while.

396
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,011
And petty theft.
You got something against banks?

397
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,124
Well, it is hard to run
with one under your arm.

398
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,005
Well, maybe you'll learn
a few new skills in prison.

399
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,324
Look, I don't wanna steal, okay?
I don't have any other choice.

400
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,171
My mother, she has a problem.

401
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,925
Yeah, her son's a moron.

402
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,685
No.

403
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,766
Vertigo.

404
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,171
She got hooked on Vertigo last year.

405
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,165
She kicked it,
but I guess she'd done enough that...

406
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,769
...it messed her up.

407
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,047
Hmm.

408
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,764
She hasn't been the same.

409
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,767
And her medical bills... Look, I'm just
trying to help her get out from under.

410
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,606
Look, we're not privileged enough
to have as much as other people, okay?

411
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,484
Fine.

412
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,205
Let him go. It's just a damn purse, right?

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,447
They'll meet with you.
It has been arranged.

414
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,006
Thank you for this. There's one more thing
I need you to do for me.

415
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,488
Malcolm's the only one who knows
where Walter's being kept.

416
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,087
I just need a clue.

417
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,208
Some lead to follow.

418
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,690
If our plan works,
I can't let it damn Walter to hell.

419
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,287
No, that's the fate that's in store for us,
I'm afraid.

420
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,882
The police are here too.
Your bait's attracted them, at least.

421
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,560
That's not exactly who
I'm looking to catch.

422
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,447
So I'm getting a good signal
from the GPS I put in your family's brooch.

423
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,045
I can track it on my phone.

424
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,131
Speaking of, have you given any thought to
what might happen if this doesn't work...

425
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,443
...and the Dodger absconds
with your family jewels?

426
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,322
I'm sorry, that came out very wrong.

427
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,561
Let's just keep our eyes open, Felicity.

428
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,409
Hey, isn't that...?

429
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,081
Mm-hm.

430
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,323
I would rather take my chances
with a deadly jewel thief.

431
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,971
Right.

432
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,641
Hey, that brooch was donated
by the Queen family.

433
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,087
If you want it,
you're gonna have to bid.

434
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,767
Actually, love, I thought I'd just take it.

435
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,251
I should see if
the security guard's having problems.

436
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,727
Good idea.
I'm gonna go check on the bait.

437
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,010
I think I have a problem.

438
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,809
Get away from me.
If this thing blows...

439
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,846
That's not gonna happen.

440
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,885
The Dodger said if I called the police, he'd...
I'm gonna get decapitated, aren't I?

441
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,090
All right, tracker's on the move.
If I find him, I can get him to disarm it.

442
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,130
- Talk me in. Stay calm.
- Too late.

443
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,127
You can go. Just go, go, go.

444
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,806
Talk to me, Felicity. Talk to me.

445
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,523
Ahem. Heading towards Adams and O'Neil.
He's gotta be in a vehicle.

446
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,441
Hey, I need your bike.

447
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,085
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

448
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,969
I'm mobile. Where is he?

449
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,610
Talk to me, Felicity.

450
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,849
First time anyone's ever been
grateful for traffic cameras.

451
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,362
One block from you. If you cut through
Harris Plaza, you'll end up behind him.

452
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,005
Where is he now?

453
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,964
I got him, I got him.

454
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,122
Gray sedan driving north
at the light ahead of you.

455
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,884
Dead ahead. Good. Okay, hard right.

456
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,481
Got him.

457
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,570
Don't do anything stupid.

458
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,004
I had the foresight to collar up
a particularly inquisitive blond.

459
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,804
I assume she's a friend of yours.

460
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,651
Touch one hair on my head
and she loses hers.

461
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,002
You've got quite the choice to make,
don't you?

462
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,770
Not this time.

463
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,206
Your median nerve's been severed.

464
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,966
You couldn't push that button
if you tried.

465
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,245
- Oh, thank God.
- Why are you doing this?

466
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,848
I'm exactly like you.
I only steal from the rich.

467
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,164
I'm not Robin Hood.

468
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,248
I don't know when
these men are coming back.

469
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,971
You have to believe me.
Untie me, please.

470
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,087
What? Do you think these men,
they planted me here?

471
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,362
Some kind of trap or something?

472
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,640
Well, Why'd they tie you up like that
and then just leave you?

473
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,365
Huh? Why not just kill you?

474
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,689
They were going to.
They got called away at some altercation...

475
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,922
...somewhere else on the island.

476
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,361
If they come back, they
will kill both of us.

477
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,040
Please, you have to believe me. Please.

478
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,367
All right, turn around.

479
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,210
Thank you.

480
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,925
Thank you.

481
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,850
I'm sorry...

482
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,280
...but I can't.

483
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,290
What? Why? Why not?

484
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,762
Because I don't know you.

485
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,762
Are you out of your mind?

486
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,170
Please! You can't do this!
You can't just leave me here!

487
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,162
Last night, all I could think about
was how pissed off Andy would be.

488
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,762
How hurt he would be
if he saw us together.

489
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,050
But that's nothing compared to how he'd be
if I did something to hurt you, Carly.

490
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,323
Believe me when I tell you
that war is easier than dating.

491
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,009
In a war, you act or you die.

492
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,804
No time to think,
no time to second-guess yourself.

493
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,840
Maybe that's your problem.
With me, you're thinking. Not feeling.

494
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,130
You're right.

495
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,728
How'd you know where I live?

496
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,008
A little thing called the Internet.

497
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,684
Look, can we not do this
with a door between us?

498
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,409
I guess you're not pressing charges...

499
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,927
...because you feel like
you can change my life?

500
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,482
So you can tell your rich prep-school
friends what a saint you are...

501
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,804
- ...and how you're helping the disadvantaged?
- You don't know a thing about me.

502
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,286
Thea Queen, trust-fund brat.

503
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,842
Totaled her car,
which she got as a birthday present.

504
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,123
Loves designer labels and is in the
tabloids for partying too much.

505
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,641
Did I leave anything out?

506
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,885
Yeah.

507
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,011
Dead father, missing stepdad,
damaged brother...

508
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,323
...and almost served jail time
for that car accident.

509
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,042
Plus, she really wants her purse back.

510
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,562
You showed some real sack
coming down here...

511
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,041
...the Glades in the middle of the night.

512
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,084
You must not know
the value of a vintage purse.

513
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,931
Don't worry, it's all
there, except for these.

514
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,084
- That's a really filthy habit you got there.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

515
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,605
Hey, can I give you some advice?

516
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,331
First, stay out of the Glades.

517
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,010
And second?

518
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,489
Don't fall for every sob story
a guy like me tells the police.

519
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,810
You have a great evening, now.

520
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,928
Do you ever take time off?

521
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,485
I do.

522
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,928
In fact, last night, I went on a date.

523
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,802
The guy was kind of a jerk.

524
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,126
Really?

525
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,971
He might've had a reason.

526
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,165
McKenna, I didn't just lose
five years on the island.

527
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,888
I lost the part of me
that enjoyed being alive.

528
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,521
Listening to music and, uh...

529
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,803
...eating a soufflé with a beautiful girl.

530
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,923
It's the easy things.

531
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,571
But when you asked me about the island,
it reminded me of all the hard things.

532
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,005
And the hard choices that I had to make
that still stay with me.

533
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,367
Made me question how I can trust...

534
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,002
...and even if I'm worthy of being
with anyone.

535
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,762
You are.

536
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,083
Can I take you to a dinner
that I promise not to cut short?

537
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,129
Um...

538
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,329
- Throw in a soufﬂé and you're on.
- McKenna.

539
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,966
I'm glad you're still here. Queen.

540
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,801
- Mr. Lance.
- I was just leaving.

541
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,887
Is everything okay, sir?

542
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,802
Yeah. I'd like you to work with me
on the vigilante investigation.

543
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,964
Yes, sir. Well, don't worry.
We'll bring him in...

544
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,480
Oh, yeah.

545
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,605
- Uh, ready to go?
- Yep.

546
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,245
Okay.

547
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,682
Tastes like an ashtray,
but does the job.

548
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,921
I owe you one.

549
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,001
You didn't get into any trouble
out there, did you?

550
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,766
Hmm?

551
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,844
No. Not a bit.

552
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,448
Frank Chen recommended you.

553
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,046
He said you could help us
with our problem.

554
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,809
He appreciates you agreeing
to meet with me.

555
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,927
Anything for a friend.

556
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,323
So how can we be of assistance?

557
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,130
Malcolm Merlyn.

558
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,122
I want you to kill him for me.
