1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,868
- Previously on Gotham...
- Oh, no.

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,823
Help me, help me! Somebody help!

3
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:10,002
They think she might've
fallen asleep at the wheel.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,360
Her brake lines were cut!

5
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:13,374
Which leaves one conclusion: murder.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,943
And I know who did it.

7
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:18,112
Hold on, Butch.

8
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:20,415
I might be in trouble.
I stole a necklace.

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,016
Why is this necklace so important?

10
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,484
What makes someone kill for it?

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,286
- What is it?
- A key.

12
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:26,754
We need to go somewhere.

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,855
Go to my house.

14
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:29,290
You two are a couple now?

15
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:30,958
- No.
- Yes.

16
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:33,060
My engagement announcement is

17
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:34,395
coming out in The Gazette tomorrow,

18
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:37,398
and it will feature Mario's
name, his family name.

19
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:40,301
You mean Falcone?

20
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,704
Such a beautiful space
for a rehearsal dinner.

21
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,373
We can't thank you enough.

22
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:48,509
And did Roberto's food
live up to all my hype?

23
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:49,911
Are you kidding?

24
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:51,913
Ugh, any more burrata,
and I wouldn't fit

25
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,782
into my wedding dress.

26
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:56,651
Can't believe we're getting
married in two days.

27
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:57,885
Have you two settled on a, uh,

28
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,831
honeymoon destination?

29
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:00,777
Uh, no.

30
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,424
But Lee finally agreed to
take some time off of work.

31
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,992
With everything going on, I
didn't want to leave anybody

32
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:06,260
in the lurch.

33
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:08,896
I was very sorry to hear
about Captain Barnes.

34
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:10,331
He's a good man.

35
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:13,434
What he did was due
entirely to the virus.

36
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,137
What's truly frightening
is that nobody knew.

37
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:17,371
Nobody could see it.

38
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:18,806
There aren't any symptoms?

39
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,875
Well, looking back
now, there were signs.

40
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,444
Increased strength,
emotional instability...

41
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,012
Nothing he couldn't hide.

42
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:26,647
The lab analyzing

43
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:28,282
Alice Tetch's blood has developed a test

44
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:29,417
to see if someone's infected.

45
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:30,818
You're kidding? When?

46
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:32,153
They just finished.

47
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:34,188
It's a step toward finding a cure.

48
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,324
How are we? Good?

49
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,458
Wonderful, Roberto.

50
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:39,293
We can't wait for tomorrow night.

51
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,196
Oh, your rehearsal dinner's
gonna be fantastico.

52
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:43,931
We're gonna take care of everything.

53
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,299
It's a privilege to serve you again,

54
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:46,934
Don Falcone.

55
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,946
Don Falcone, please.

56
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:00,414
We'll pull your car around.

57
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,682
Ah, okay.

58
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:03,584
Wonderful evening, Roberto.

59
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,219
You betcha.

60
00:02:07,323 --> 00:02:09,223
I love you.

61
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,858
I love you too.

62
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,676
You don't understand anything, okay?

63
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,545
My friend got blown up.

64
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,346
And I want to know what happened?

65
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:33,714
Can you explain that to me?

66
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,527
We need to talk.

67
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:49,263
Is everyone okay?

68
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,865
A few first degree burns, but that's it.

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,066
They're lucky.

70
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,634
Any idea who might've done this?

71
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,070
I've made my share of
enemies over the years.

72
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:57,538
Could be anyone.

73
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:59,540
Why come after you now?

74
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,142
My oldest son is getting married.

75
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:03,144
When better to settle an old score

76
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:04,278
and hurt me and my family?

77
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:05,279
Maybe.

78
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,981
Or maybe someone thinks

79
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,549
you're coming out of retirement?

80
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:10,084
I'm not.

81
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,619
Good.

82
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:14,455
Doesn't mean I'm gonna stand
by after something like this.

83
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,692
The captain of police was
just indicted for murder

84
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:18,759
and sent to Arkham.

85
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:20,828
The last thing I need
is you and your men

86
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:23,464
tearing up Gotham looking for revenge.

87
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:26,334
I didn't start this.

88
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:28,769
I'll get to the bottom of it.

89
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,105
You have my word.

90
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:35,142
I'll give you one day.

91
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:47,521
As members of the Five Families,

92
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:48,789
you are well aware that

93
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,626
with the tragic downfall
of Captain Barnes,

94
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:53,761
people are frightened.

95
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:56,964
They will be looking
to us for stability.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,200
To feel safe.

97
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:00,935
So...

98
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,439
how does a 50% increase
on protection fees sound?

99
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:07,875
Sounds a little steep to me.

100
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,944
What do we have here?

101
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,712
Little family reunion?

102
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:14,048
- My invitation get lost in the mail?
- No.

103
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,816
This meeting is for grown-ups,

104
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:18,052
so I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

105
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:19,620
Hmm. Quick question.

106
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,158
Is it, "How do I commit suicide?"

107
00:04:24,193 --> 00:04:26,327
Because that answer is coming.

108
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:28,729
Tabitha and Butch are
missing. Where are they?

109
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:30,631
I have no idea.

110
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,267
I have not seen Butch since his little

111
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:35,903
summer stock revival
of the Red Hood Gang.

112
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,838
Let's cut the crap, shall we?

113
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:39,340
Tabitha has been helping Butch hide

114
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,741
since your little victory celebration.

115
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:42,443
They're an item now.

116
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:44,045
Barf. She's supposed to
check in every night,

117
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,179
and she hasn't.

118
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,380
She's not answering her phone

119
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,349
and no one has seen her.

120
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:49,917
And you think I took them?

121
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:51,152
Obviously.

122
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:55,189
How about this?

123
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:56,724
You lower your gun

124
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,560
and beg my forgiveness

125
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:01,829
for this gross insubordination,

126
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:04,398
and I might let you
walk out of here alive.

127
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,946
My apologies.

128
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:22,049
They must've run off
somewhere without telling me.

129
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,119
Love...

130
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:27,588
makes people do crazy
things, doesn't it?

131
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,358
We have a history,

132
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:32,960
you and I.

133
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:36,030
But if you ever point a gun at me again,

134
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:39,400
Olga will be cleaning
your brains off the floor.

135
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,138
She's a real whiz with stains.

136
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:46,173
Bye, Pengy.

137
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:50,344
Everyone out.

138
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:52,613
Now.

139
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:58,819
Are you checking up on me?

140
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,921
What? No.

141
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:02,456
Barbara Kean was just here.

142
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:03,824
She's looking for them.

143
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,825
So?

144
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:05,826
So...

145
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:07,728
are you finished yet?

146
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:08,829
We've talked about this.

147
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:10,564
I need to work through my grief,

148
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,866
my way.

149
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:12,867
Of course.

150
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:14,735
And I support you.

151
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:18,706
Any chance you could work
through it a smidge faster?

152
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,442
I am swamped today.

153
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,283
Sorry you had to hear that.

154
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:33,087
He can just be so self-centered.

155
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:34,155
What were we talking about?

156
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,289
I'm gonna kill you!

157
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:36,524
Oh, right, how I found you.

158
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:40,361
Well...

159
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:42,229
it wasn't hard.

160
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:44,365
The next time you want to disappear,

161
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,033
consider taking a sabbatical
from your favorite restaurant.

162
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:47,668
Your love of Gusto's eggplant parmesan

163
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:49,203
isn't exactly a state secret.

164
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:51,772
Come here.

165
00:06:51,808 --> 00:06:54,775
That, with a healthy amount
of Midazolam in your food

166
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:56,043
to knock you out, 100 bucks

167
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:57,945
to your delivery boy, who by the way,

168
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,415
I get the feeling hasn't been
being tipped very well, Butch.

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
I'm sorry, what was that?

170
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:09,790
You're gonna regret this.

171
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:11,492
You touch one hair

172
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:13,394
on her head, I swear I'll kill you.

173
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:14,595
Save your strength, big guy.

174
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,330
You're gonna need it.

175
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:19,233
You tell Penguin he's a coward!

176
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:21,435
If he wants me dead, he should come here

177
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,404
and do it like a man.

178
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:29,310
This has nothing to do with Penguin.

179
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,611
And you...

180
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,913
are the coward.

181
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,249
Killing an innocent woman.

182
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:36,250
What?

183
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:37,251
Who?

184
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,587
Isabella.

185
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:42,456
She was my everything,
and you took her from me.

186
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:45,726
What in the hell are you talking about?

187
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,632
I was hoping you'd be difficult.

188
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:06,947
Hey. You okay?

189
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,082
Stomach.

190
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:09,450
If being acting captain

191
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,285
is such of a strain, why do it?

192
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,587
I'm the senior guy around here.

193
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:14,955
- What about Tuttle?
- Tuttle?

194
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,291
Guy shot a cat last week.

195
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:18,392
On purpose?

196
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:19,960
Does it matter?

197
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:22,029
Look, I might not have always
seen eye-to-eye with Barnes,

198
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:24,198
but he was a good captain.

199
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,633
Least I can do is keep his seat warm

200
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,302
until they find some kind
of cure for this virus.

201
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:29,470
Detective Gordon.

202
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:30,938
Car bomb used a mercury switch

203
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:32,706
with military-grade plastic.

204
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:36,310
That's kind of high-end for a mob hit.

205
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:37,678
That's not all.

206
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:39,880
The explosive was laced with
some sort of accelerant.

207
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,883
Made the explosion burn at ten
times the heat of standard C-4.

208
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,586
Whoever set this bomb didn't
want anything left behind.

209
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:46,720
Only one guy I know with

210
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:48,188
that level of expertise.

211
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:49,857
Ex-military nut job.

212
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:52,326
Goes by the name of "Fuse".

213
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,435
- This is our guy.
- Not for nothing,

214
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,703
but ensuring Don Falcone's safety

215
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:05,072
is not why I wear the badge.

216
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,374
- Well, it's not just about him.
- You mean Lee.

217
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,209
If you're worried, you
could tell her not to marry

218
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:12,146
the son of a former crime boss.

219
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:17,819
GCPD!

220
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:29,630
Dead but still warm.

221
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:32,266
Whoever did this must've just left.

222
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:33,867
So whoever hired Fuse to plant the bomb

223
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:35,369
doesn't want any loose ends?

224
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:38,372
Looks like he was on
his way out of town.

225
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,641
Must've figured his employers
weren't that forgiving.

226
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:42,176
Guy can pack,

227
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,677
I'll give him that much.

228
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,412
Once a soldier, always a soldier.

229
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:49,283
Bed sheets aren't tucked in.

230
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:57,958
Times,

231
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:02,229
locations, surveillance photos.

232
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:03,931
This doesn't make any sense.

233
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:05,099
What?

234
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:08,402
Carmine's not the target.

235
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:31,692
Down!

236
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:41,835
What the hell's going on?

237
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:43,670
Carmine's not the target.

238
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,706
You are.

239
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:55,314
There you are. Voila.

240
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:56,949
Thank you very much, Master Bruce.

241
00:10:56,984 --> 00:10:58,116
What is this?

242
00:10:58,152 --> 00:10:59,117
That is a

243
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:01,153
Pennyworth signature frittata.

244
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:03,956
It's a crustless quiche.

245
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:06,191
It's eggs, miss. Just...

246
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:07,693
Just eat it, will you?

247
00:11:07,728 --> 00:11:10,462
Where's your mate, anyway?

248
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:11,697
Conservatory.

249
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,465
Girl loves it there.

250
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,100
Well, she's hardly what you call

251
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:16,335
a girl,

252
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,869
- is she?
- Yeah.

253
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:21,273
Well, thanks for the crustless

254
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,375
egg thing, but I got errands to run.

255
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,710
Uh no, sorry, miss. No one is to

256
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,211
leave the house, until we find exactly

257
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,980
who is following you.

258
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,115
It's been days, I can't take it anymore.

259
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,451
I'm sorry, what is it
exactly that you object to?

260
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:33,652
Is it the gourmet food
or the king-sized,

261
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:35,087
double bed with the Egyptian linen?

262
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:36,288
Would you tell the help here

263
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:38,457
that I can come and go
as I please, please?

264
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:39,858
Alfred's right.

265
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:41,727
It's not safe for you
to be in Gotham alone.

266
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:45,097
I've been in Gotham,
alone, my whole life.

267
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:48,600
I can take care of
myself. Nothing's changed.

268
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,603
Yeah. You've made that clear.

269
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,372
What's that supposed to mean?

270
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:55,374
Nothing.

271
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:56,541
Those men were willing
to kill for this key.

272
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:58,543
We need to know why.
I'll be in the study.

273
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,013
There's more books I
haven't gone through.

274
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:02,848
There has to be a reference
to the key somewhere.

275
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:05,917
And have you stopped to consider
that maybe it's just an old key?

276
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:07,619
No.

277
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,168
I'll get you some breakfast, miss.

278
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:25,570
You know, some of these plants would do

279
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,306
much better in direct sunlight.

280
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:29,741
Could you turn off the alarm

281
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,410
so I can put them outside?

282
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,911
Well, maybe later.

283
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:34,646
I'd rather not you be walking
around the grounds on your own.

284
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:39,618
Can you smell this?

285
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:42,287
Beg your pardon?

286
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:45,323
Right here.

287
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:53,598
Oh, what is that?

288
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:54,599
Just a mix of clove,

289
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:58,537
fenugreek and yarrow root oils.

290
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:00,138
It's lovely.

291
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:01,373
It is, isn't it?

292
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:03,075
- Yeah.
- Now,

293
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,277
I need you to tell me something, okay?

294
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:08,080
Anything.

295
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,615
How do you turn off the alarm?

296
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,223
This doesn't make any sense.

297
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:20,792
Do you know anyone who
might want you dead?

298
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:22,594
You can't be serious.

299
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,429
- Everyone has enemies.
- No, Detective.

300
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,164
- They don't.
- Regardless,

301
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,399
you need to limit your exposure.

302
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:28,767
Lay low for a while,

303
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:30,268
until I can find out who's behind this.

304
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:31,770
How do you propose I do that?

305
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:34,406
I'm picking up our wedding
rings this afternoon.

306
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,041
Lee and I are getting married tomorrow.

307
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:38,710
Oh.

308
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:41,012
You want me to cancel the wedding.

309
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:42,013
I just want to keep you safe.

310
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:43,682
I'd bet you'd love that.

311
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,050
I run home to Lee,

312
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,152
tell her we need to hide
until Detective Gordon can

313
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:49,321
- save the day?
- This is not a time for ego.

314
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:50,856
Oh, you're talking to me about ego?

315
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:55,093
How do I even know you're
gonna be able to find him?

316
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,695
Or that you'll even try?

317
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,497
You need to trust me.

318
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:01,032
Whoever is behind this
is gonna keep coming

319
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:03,401
until they get the job done.

320
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,704
If that's true,

321
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:08,673
it doesn't matter where
we go or what we do.

322
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:10,675
As long as I got a target on my back,

323
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:12,377
Lee isn't safe.

324
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:20,385
- Hey.
- Yeah?

325
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:23,555
Keep an eye on Mario.
Don't let him leave.

326
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,390
What are you doing?

327
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:26,958
I'm keeping an eye on Mario.

328
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:28,193
Don't look at him.

329
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:29,628
What the hell's going on?

330
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:30,862
I don't know, something doesn't fit.

331
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,731
I need to talk to Carmine.

332
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,332
Maybe once he knows Mario is the target,

333
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:37,969
something will jog his memory. Just...

334
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:38,970
- Just keep it...
- I... yeah.

335
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,705
I got it.

336
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,050
Hello, comrade.

337
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:55,153
Comrade is not a Russian word.

338
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:57,055
Oh, shut up, of course it is.

339
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,523
You shouldn't be here.

340
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,825
Relax. I know Penguin's
out for a few hours.

341
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,695
I just want to talk.

342
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,530
I don't know anything.

343
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:06,898
Listen,

344
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,534
I grew up in a place like this.

345
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,403
A large staff of people

346
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:13,672
always coming and going.

347
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:15,106
Listening.

348
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:18,777
You can't help but overhear things.

349
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:21,613
Is handsome ring.

350
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:24,249
It is. And very expensive.

351
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:27,185
I bet it would look
just fabulous on you.

352
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:33,959
Mr. Penguin,

353
00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:35,594
he treat me nice.

354
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:38,263
I have warm feeling for him.

355
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:40,198
But the other one...

356
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:41,433
Nygma?

357
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:43,935
Don't know why Mr. Penguin

358
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:45,870
likes him so much.

359
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:47,772
He could do better.

360
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,107
Wait.

361
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:51,042
You mean likes, likes?

362
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:54,012
Wow. Okay, we should definitely

363
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:55,914
revisit that another time.

364
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:57,315
But what about Nygma?

365
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:58,950
Does he say anything
about my missing friend?

366
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:00,318
Mm. I don't know,

367
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:02,053
but I hear Mr. Nygma

368
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,488
talking about

369
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:06,825
special delivery, but nothing

370
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,826
come to the house

371
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:10,061
but bill.

372
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,999
"Stocks & Bondage"?

373
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:23,842
Mm.

374
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:25,744
How many times do I have to tell you?

375
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,679
I have never...

376
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:29,347
even heard of this woman.

377
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:32,617
Well,

378
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,619
then I suppose I should

379
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:35,620
put my attention elsewhere.

380
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,188
No, no!

381
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:38,456
Leave her out of this!

382
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:39,457
Afraid I can't do that.

383
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:42,927
She is an integral part of your penance.

384
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:44,095
It was such a pleasant surprise

385
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,263
when I discovered that the two of you

386
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,165
were together.

387
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,166
You know,

388
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:50,368
after the initial gag reflex.

389
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,338
You know,

390
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:55,974
I bet this gal doesn't even exist.

391
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:58,677
I mean, come on. Who would fall in love

392
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:00,178
with a freak show like you?

393
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:02,047
Oh, wait.

394
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:03,615
Let me guess.

395
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,084
I bet she's got a certificate, too, huh?

396
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,556
What do you want?

397
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:15,527
Tell me what you want.

398
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,863
Tell me what you want.

399
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,733
I want to break Butch's heart

400
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:23,635
before I end his life.

401
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,705
You know, kind of a
eye-for-an-eye thing.

402
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,139
But in this case,

403
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:32,043
I'll take a hand.

404
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,818
Is that vinegar?

405
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:42,053
Vinegar and baking soda.

406
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,621
Takes tarnish off anything.

407
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,958
Selina, that key is
hundreds of years old!

408
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:49,561
I'm not an idiot, you know.

409
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,730
Maybe there's something on the key

410
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:53,164
that you can't see,

411
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,734
because a hundred years
of crap is covering it up?

412
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:00,939
Why did you tell Ivy
we weren't a couple?

413
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:02,774
Why did you tell her we were?

414
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:04,075
Is that a trick question?

415
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:08,313
Why can't we just be us?

416
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,084
Can you take that key out
now? It's making me nervous.

417
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,057
Hmm.

418
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:21,359
There's an engraving on it.

419
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:25,497
Like a bird or something.

420
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:30,435
Not just a bird.

421
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,637
An owl.

422
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:34,939
Uh, and?

423
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:35,974
Alfred!

424
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:38,009
If you're right,

425
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:40,745
merely possessing this
key could be seen as

426
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,147
breaking your agreement with
the people that the woman

427
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:43,581
in the owl mask represents.

428
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:44,816
Which is why we need to contact them.

429
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:45,950
They have to understand

430
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:47,719
Ivy didn't know what she was stealing.

431
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,354
Wait, where is she anyhow?

432
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:55,627
Oh, bloody hell. She's gone.

433
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:57,562
How did she disable the alarm?

434
00:18:57,597 --> 00:19:00,098
Don't worry about that now, all right?

435
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,166
What's the big deal? She'll be back

436
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,167
when she's hungry.

437
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,073
Wayne Manor.

438
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:11,276
You have the necklace.

439
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,077
We have your friend.

440
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:15,013
We'll make exchange, no?

441
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,317
Where and when?

442
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:49,945
We're supposed to go down the manhole?

443
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:52,941
That's what they said.

444
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,209
All right, give me the key.

445
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:55,644
I'll sort it out.

446
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,147
No.

447
00:19:58,182 --> 00:19:59,948
I need to speak with them personally.

448
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:01,850
Make sure they understand
this was a mistake.

449
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,420
Very well, Master Bruce.

450
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:09,992
There's no way of
asking you to stay here

451
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:11,860
that doesn't end with you
yelling at me, is there?

452
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:13,662
No.

453
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,442
Over there.

454
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:28,177
Ivy?

455
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:29,545
It's about time!

456
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:40,022
My name is Bruce Wayne.

457
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:42,558
I need to speak with Kathryn.

458
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:46,995
She needs to understand
I've honored our deal.

459
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:49,264
Hand over the necklace and
you get your friend back.

460
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,699
That's the deal.

461
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:53,068
You mean the key, don't you?

462
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:55,637
You're not getting it back

463
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:57,506
until I talk to the people you work for.

464
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,908
Maybe we just kill you and take it?

465
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:01,443
You think we're stupid
enough to bring it with us?

466
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:07,716
You really want it back?

467
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,685
I'd listen to him.

468
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,721
Put the tools down, lads, aye?

469
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:24,767
I need reassurances

470
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:26,602
my friends are no longer in any danger.

471
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:30,205
I need to speak to
the woman in the mask.

472
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:34,376
Any assurances that
woman gives you are lies.

473
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:35,744
How do you know?

474
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,845
Because the people

475
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,881
you are talking about have no honor.

476
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,949
And they will betray you

477
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:42,918
as they betrayed us.

478
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,186
Wait. You...

479
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,554
you don't work for them?

480
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:48,090
No, we work to destroy them.

481
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,227
Who are they?

482
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:54,463
They call themselves

483
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:56,999
the Court of Owls.

484
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:03,739
They're after Mario?

485
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:05,274
Yes.

486
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,242
Where is he?

487
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,378
GCPD. He's safe for now.

488
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,879
But I can't help him

489
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,881
if you don't tell me what's going on.

490
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,384
You think I'm holding something back?

491
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,686
A military grade explosion.

492
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:18,887
The clean up.

493
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:22,057
A sword-wielding assassin
in broad daylight.

494
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,959
This doesn't feel like a mob grudge.

495
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:26,161
What else is there?

496
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:29,631
Could Mario be mixed up in something?

497
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:32,634
Is that what you came to ask me?

498
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,303
I'm working the evidence I have.

499
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:36,605
I understand why you'd want to believe

500
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,908
the man who's marrying Lee
must be mixed up in something.

501
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,910
But my son

502
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:44,746
is the most decent
person I've ever known.

503
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,982
He's not like us.

504
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:52,354
That just tells me there's
something you don't know.

505
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,191
Jim, Mario's gone.

506
00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:58,193
You were supposed to keep him there.

507
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:00,762
I know, I tried, but he said
he didn't trust you or the GCPD

508
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,298
to take care of this,
so he was going to.

509
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,566
Whatever the hell that means.

510
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,102
What is it?

511
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,871
Mario just walked out of the GCPD.

512
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:12,407
I think he's gonna try
to finish this himself.

513
00:23:12,443 --> 00:23:13,575
How?

514
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:15,277
I have a pretty good idea.

515
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,351
Can I help you?

516
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:23,619
I hope so.

517
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:26,588
I had something that was
supposed to be delivered to me.

518
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:28,090
Could you check your records?

519
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,791
Sure. Let me check the safe.

520
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:31,059
Uh, what was the last name?

521
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:32,427
- Nygma.
- Oh!

522
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:35,030
That item was already delivered.

523
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,732
Great.

524
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,635
Well, I guess as long
as I'm already here,

525
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,104
I should pick up
something for the weekend.

526
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:43,438
Right?

527
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:47,042
Hmm.

528
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,111
Well, this looks fun.

529
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,612
Could I ask a favor

530
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:51,947
- of you...?
- Uh,

531
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:53,615
- Todd.
- Todd.

532
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:55,784
Could you show me how this works?

533
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,655
We're not really supposed to...

534
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,291
I won't tell if you don't.

535
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:05,394
It's pretty basic, really.

536
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:06,461
Um, you just...

537
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:09,131
put your arms through here,

538
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,366
and then your head through here.

539
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:12,834
And you bring it up...

540
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,002
And then... oh! Hey!

541
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,505
Do you like role-play, Todd?

542
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,141
Good.

543
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,576
I will play the beautiful,

544
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:23,345
coquettish bank robber

545
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,515
who needs to get into
that safe, and you...

546
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,517
get to play

547
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:31,253
the lucky young shopkeeper
who gives her the combination.

548
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:33,188
Okay?

549
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:36,291
My friend was taken by this man, Nygma.

550
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:39,361
I need to know where she is.

551
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,796
If I find her,

552
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:41,997
I could come back here

553
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,999
and personally thank you.

554
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:48,203
Give Mommy...

555
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,305
the combination.

556
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:56,011
Uh, nine to 25, 72.

557
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:57,713
Good.

558
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:11,393
Nygma, you sick bastard.

559
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,828
Hey!

560
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:15,197
Y-You can't just leave me here!

561
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:16,798
H-H-Hello?

562
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:27,676
Oh, goodie.

563
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:29,378
You're finally awake.

564
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:31,179
The show continues.

565
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:35,684
Ta-da!

566
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:38,987
I designed it myself.

567
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:40,722
You want to see how it works?

568
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:42,324
Okay!

569
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,092
I love a captive audience.

570
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:46,728
So, we'll set the timer for, say...

571
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:49,031
55 seconds.

572
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:50,365
Now, when the timer hits zero,

573
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:53,335
the spring-loaded blade is released.

574
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,703
Simple.

575
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:56,138
Now.

576
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:57,706
For the fun part.

577
00:25:57,741 --> 00:25:59,341
You can stop the blade
from being released

578
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:01,009
if you click this...

579
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:02,944
little button. But if you do,

580
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,614
it will send a fatal jolt

581
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,450
of electricity to zap Butch.

582
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:11,019
It's a simple test, really.

583
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:14,122
Stop the blade from falling

584
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,591
and kill Butch, or...

585
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,599
Mm.

586
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:26,902
The choice...

587
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,206
my dear,

588
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,808
is yours.

589
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,944
Will we hear the zap of heartbreak?

590
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:40,615
Or the sound of one hand clapping?

591
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:49,852
My name is Volk.

592
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:53,489
My brother, Jacob, and that's Dmitry.

593
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:57,060
What's with the stupid mask?

594
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,696
I like you.

595
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:02,198
You remind me of my sister in Kiev.

596
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,867
Dmitry is an initiate.

597
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,202
The mask ensures his silence

598
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:08,338
until he proves himself

599
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,974
- and becomes a full member.
- Of what?

600
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,141
Who are you?

601
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:14,510
We are called the Whisper Gang.

602
00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:17,380
Gotham's most notorious smugglers.

603
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:20,283
We used to number in the
hundreds until the Court saw

604
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:23,553
our growing strength, and
they offered us a partnership,

605
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:26,389
only to betray us.

606
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:28,992
Many escaped back to Ukraine
but a few of us stayed back,

607
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:30,493
hoping to find a way

608
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:33,129
to enact revenge.

609
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:34,697
And we did.

610
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:35,832
The key.

611
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:38,835
Well, what does it open?

612
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,004
A safe.

613
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:45,041
Is is in one of the Court's buildings...

614
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:47,744
here.

615
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,278
Inside, there is a...

616
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:51,180
a device, that we believe

617
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:53,082
can destroy them.

618
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,451
What, like, some kind of... weapon?

619
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:58,187
Well, honestly, we don't know.

620
00:27:58,223 --> 00:27:59,789
We captured a member,
but even he didn't know

621
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:02,525
what's inside the safe, only that

622
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,794
the Court fears it falling

623
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:06,696
- into the hands of their enemies.
- Wait,

624
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:08,398
Wouldn't they know you stole it?

625
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:09,832
They're probably waiting for you

626
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:11,434
- to show up there.
- No.

627
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:13,803
Because originally,
the safe had two keys.

628
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:15,538
The Court still has one of them,

629
00:28:15,573 --> 00:28:17,740
and the second was thought lost.

630
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,742
Until I found it.

631
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:22,779
You mean we did.

632
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:26,949
The Court of Owls killed my parents.

633
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:30,053
I stood down because I thought
there was no way to defeat them.

634
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:32,822
What are you proposing?

635
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:34,590
If what you're saying is true,

636
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:37,627
and there is something in that safe,

637
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:41,030
then that's no longer the case.

638
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:52,842
Mario?

639
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,613
You really think this is a good idea?

640
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,282
Using yourself as bait?

641
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:01,317
If those guys are out
there, Lee isn't safe.

642
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:03,352
They're pros. You're gonna get killed.

643
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:04,754
What do you care?

644
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:06,122
Why would someone want to kill you?

645
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:07,156
I have no idea.

646
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:08,324
Because it seems to me,

647
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,194
an operation like this
doesn't happen for no reason,

648
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:13,529
and putting yourself in the
crosshairs feels a lot like

649
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:15,031
someone protecting a secret.

650
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,366
I want to protect Lee.

651
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:19,035
That's it.

652
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,473
We're sitting ducks in here.

653
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,108
We need to get away from bystanders.

654
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,444
- They're here.
- What?

655
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,812
Get down!

656
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:36,652
No, no!

657
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,722
No! No, please!

658
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:54,003
You could've killed her.

659
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,638
Who sent you?

660
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:58,174
Why are you coming after me?!

661
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:00,777
You... know...

662
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,311
why.

663
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,196
Ed, come on.

664
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:22,732
Come on, let's talk about this, huh?

665
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:24,100
Come on, Ed.

666
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:25,201
You don't have to do this.

667
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:26,269
Come on, let's talk about this.

668
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,337
Come on! Listen!

669
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:31,340
I told you, I've never heard
of anyone named Isabelle!

670
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:32,975
Isabella!

671
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:35,011
Why is that so difficult?

672
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:37,513
Also, I'm not the one you
should be pleading with.

673
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,582
Your life is in her...

674
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:41,050
hand.

675
00:30:42,086 --> 00:30:44,787
What difference does it make?

676
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,589
You're gonna kill me one
way or the other, right?

677
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,560
Good point.

678
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:53,362
New deal.

679
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:55,198
If she loves you enough
to sacrifice her hand...

680
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,699
Twinsies...

681
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:58,401
In exchange for your life.

682
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:00,203
I swear on the memory

683
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:01,938
of my beloved Isabella,

684
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:04,373
I will set you both free.

685
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,950
Tabby.

686
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:15,751
Baby, come on.

687
00:31:19,757 --> 00:31:21,557
We can... get out of here, we can...

688
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:23,659
I like you, Butch. I really do.

689
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:25,795
But to be completely honest,

690
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,431
I'm not exactly in a
"love" place right now.

691
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:33,903
Sorry, big fella.

692
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:36,038
I wish I could say that I was surprised,

693
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:38,774
but I knew that she
was going to say that.

694
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,509
It's why I made the offer.

695
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:42,411
Any final words?

696
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:43,846
I would keep it brief.

697
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:48,484
Tabby.

698
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,586
Baby.

699
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:53,623
The last few weeks have
been the best of my life.

700
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:57,827
And it's okay you don't love me.

701
00:31:57,862 --> 00:32:01,931
'Cause I love you.

702
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:05,701
And for a guy like me?
That's... that's enough.

703
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:07,503
And you.

704
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:09,138
You're damn right I killed her.

705
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:11,841
I killed the woman you loved,

706
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,643
You know what she said to me?

707
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:15,678
Right before I put a
bullet in her brain?

708
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:18,648
You know what she told
me? She said she wished

709
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:20,216
she would have been with a real man.

710
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:21,751
Hey, Butch.

711
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:24,453
Yeah?

712
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:27,123
You're sweet.

713
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,228
No!

714
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:34,030
No!

715
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,376
Untie me!

716
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:45,712
Please, untie me! She's
got to get to a hospital!

717
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,180
Quick! Unh!

718
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,615
You said that you put
a bullet in her head.

719
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,818
Isabella died in a car crash.

720
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,252
The brake lines were cut.

721
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:55,621
I don't care! I told you
I never heard of her!

722
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:58,191
You... you really didn't kill her?

723
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,559
No! Untie me!

724
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:01,694
She's got to get to a hospital, come on!

725
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:09,936
I'd put that hand on some ice.

726
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,614
Neither of you recognize him?

727
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:22,915
No.

728
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,585
Has he said anything?

729
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,453
Not a peep.

730
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:30,423
Hey, I ran your guy's prints.

731
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,391
They're not in the system,
which, considering he's a pro,

732
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,760
wasn't that hard to believe.

733
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:36,028
Yeah, still, now that we have him,

734
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:38,364
we should work him, find
out who's behind this.

735
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,866
You better act quick. Call came in.

736
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,502
They're transferring him to
a federal facility upstate.

737
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:44,937
What? No, no, no, no. We
can't let this guy leave.

738
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,706
What can I do? My hands are tied.

739
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:48,574
The Feds want him, they get him.

740
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,942
The question is why?

741
00:33:49,978 --> 00:33:52,945
Maybe somebody wants him
out of this precinct.

742
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:55,348
Away from us.

743
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:57,283
I don't know anyone
with that kind of pull.

744
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,152
Do you?

745
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:05,458
The other assassin.

746
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:08,161
You want to tell me what
happened in the store?

747
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:09,829
There's nothing to tell.

748
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,865
He came after me, I did
what I needed to do.

749
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,171
You called her?

750
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,175
She deserves to know what's going on.

751
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,743
Either you tell her or I will.

752
00:34:31,553 --> 00:34:33,085
Come on.

753
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:48,034
I think I know who sent you.

754
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:51,370
But I need to know for sure.

755
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:54,574
And we both know that
you're not going to tell me.

756
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:57,476
So...

757
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:06,018
So, how does it feel?

758
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:09,121
I don't know, maybe I could be captain.

759
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,457
Yell at people for not having proof,

760
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,192
or, uh, at one of my detectives

761
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:14,193
for going after a pair of assassins

762
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:16,562
all by his lonesome.

763
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:17,830
Not bad.

764
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,066
Right? Very interesting play,

765
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:21,267
by the way.

766
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:22,268
It's not every day that you get

767
00:35:22,303 --> 00:35:24,937
to save the man who's
marrying the woman you love.

768
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,307
Yeah, I'm really something.

769
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,509
It's not too late, Jim.

770
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:34,213
Lee deserves to know how you feel.

771
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:38,417
God knows I know that life
gives us enough regret.

772
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:40,019
There's no need adding to it.

773
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:44,390
- Oh, crap.
- I know it's hard.

774
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:45,790
It's just, it's something you have to...

775
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:47,401
Falcone.

776
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,840
Falcone, up against the wall!

777
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,041
What are you doing?

778
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,343
Just having a chat.

779
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:05,978
Turns out our friend here works

780
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:08,180
for a former associate of mine.

781
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:10,483
So now that I know who's behind this,

782
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:13,019
I can take care of it... my way.

783
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:14,020
It's over.

784
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:15,187
You think you're gonna walk away?

785
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,523
You just assaulted a
suspect in police custody.

786
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,827
He won't be pressing charges.

787
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:23,863
I'm gonna find out what happened today.

788
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:26,399
Who's pulling the strings,
and how Mario's involved.

789
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,600
Trust me.

790
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:30,937
If I were you, I'd let it go.

791
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,781
Gather the men. Tell them
we are joining forces

792
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:42,915
with the boy.

793
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,383
I will brief them tomorrow night myself.

794
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:45,718
Volk!

795
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:48,421
Dmitry, eyes.

796
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,808
We know you've been
searching for the second key.

797
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,044
Have you found it?

798
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,690
I'll ask you again.

799
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:28,194
Have you found the second key?

800
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:31,197
Why don't you ask Dmitry, huh?

801
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:51,572
Think she'll be okay?

802
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:52,807
Think they can re-attach the hand?

803
00:37:52,842 --> 00:37:54,108
Please, she's tough as nails.

804
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:55,076
She'll be fine.

805
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:56,777
You know this is war, right?

806
00:37:56,813 --> 00:37:58,145
Nygma, Penguin, anyone
who stands with them...

807
00:37:58,181 --> 00:37:59,413
They're all dead.

808
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:01,082
This woman Isabella...

809
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:03,050
Nygma said she was a librarian, right?

810
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,686
Well, who kills a librarian?
I mean, what's the motive?

811
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:07,288
I don't know. Maybe someone had

812
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:09,560
an overdue book, and
things got out of hand.

813
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:13,060
Excuse me, but you just can't wa...

814
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:15,296
Come on! Come on!

815
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,465
We got a hand here, people. Hand!

816
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,233
You cut someone's brake lines.

817
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:21,435
You know where they're going and when.

818
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:23,771
You'd know...

819
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:25,973
You know them.

820
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:27,975
I know who did it.

821
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:30,578
I know who killed the librarian.

822
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:32,246
Who?

823
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:33,681
The same person who's in love with Nygma

824
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:36,217
- and doesn't want to share him.
- Okay.

825
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:37,952
One woman in love with
that psychotic bean pole

826
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:39,420
defies explanation, but two?

827
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:42,356
Who said anything about a woman?

828
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:45,960
I am tired of sitting
at the kids' table.

829
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:49,764
If I'm right, we can have
way more than vengeance.

830
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:52,066
We can have it all.

831
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:54,702
We don't need to go to war.

832
00:38:54,737 --> 00:38:57,638
All we need to do is start one.

833
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:08,582
There must have been some mistake.

834
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:10,918
We don't make mistakes.

835
00:39:10,953 --> 00:39:13,454
I've always done whatever
the Court has asked of me.

836
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:15,856
Even against my own interest.

837
00:39:15,892 --> 00:39:19,026
I got you Indian Hill when
Maroni refused to sell.

838
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:21,696
No one is questioning your loyalty.

839
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:22,897
If this isn't about me,

840
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:25,199
Then why are you trying to kill my son?

841
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:28,102
There are things you're not privy to.

842
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,037
That's not an answer.

843
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:33,274
It will have to do.

844
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:35,276
We both know the level

845
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,411
of destruction I can cause.

846
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:40,047
You think we're scared of you?

847
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,115
The car bomb was designed

848
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,284
to look like a mob hit.

849
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:45,286
You didn't want me to
find out it was you.

850
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:46,554
I have.

851
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:49,457
I don't care about your reasons.

852
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:50,658
If my son is harmed in any way,

853
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:53,728
I will come after you
with everything I have.

854
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:55,730
You won't win.

855
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:58,332
If my son is dead,

856
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,034
winning won't be the point.

857
00:40:01,671 --> 00:40:04,405
Gotham will burn.

858
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,242
This city is on the brink of chaos.

859
00:40:08,277 --> 00:40:11,579
Only we can save it.

860
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:14,482
We will expect your
assistance when called on.

861
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:17,184
Until then, your son is safe.

862
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,787
At least from us.

863
00:40:19,822 --> 00:40:22,757
What aren't you telling me?

864
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:26,160
A great many things.

865
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,331
Enjoy your dinner.

866
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:01,061
Hey.

867
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,470
Is everything okay?

868
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:13,007
I was on my way to the rehearsal dinner.

869
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:15,843
Then I heard myself telling
the cab driver your address.

870
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:18,045
Mario told me everything.

871
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,513
About today.

872
00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:22,016
How you risked your own
life to make sure...

873
00:41:22,051 --> 00:41:24,318
I didn't do it for him.

874
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:27,688
I know.

875
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:29,490
He's a good man.

876
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:30,991
Uh-huh.

877
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:35,896
Tell me.

878
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:37,832
What?

879
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:40,167
What you have to tell me.

880
00:41:44,173 --> 00:41:48,042
I missed my chance to give
you the life you deserve.

881
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:50,244
To make you happy.

882
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:55,616
But I do want that for you.

883
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:57,585
More than anything.

884
00:42:01,123 --> 00:42:03,357
Why does it feel like
we keep saying good-bye?

885
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:09,263
Maybe it's all we have left.

886
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:12,433
Or we just haven't done it properly yet.

887
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:23,277
Good-bye, James Gordon.

888
00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:43,364
Yo, Peeping Tom

889
00:42:44,867 --> 00:42:46,934
You lost?

890
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:49,503
Lucky for you, we sell directions.

891
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:55,075
The price... everything you've got.

892
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:57,077
She loves him. She loves him.

893
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:58,712
- She loves him...
- You deaf?

894
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:00,814
She loves him, she loves him!

895
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,516
I said...

896
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:04,318
Hey, man...

897
00:43:05,955 --> 00:43:09,556
She... loves... me!

898
00:43:09,592 --> 00:43:11,358
And I won't let her go.

899
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:13,193
She...

900
00:43:13,229 --> 00:43:17,131
loves... me!
