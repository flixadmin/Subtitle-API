1
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,760
He used to date
my sister.

2
00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:09,200
I see.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,165
You're a lucky man.
How's that?

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,201
You're still breathing.

5
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:27,278
To the ladies we've loved
and the ladies we've lost.

6
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:38,056
So, what's Braga about?

7
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:41,868
You know,
he's just one of us.

8
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:45,395
Came up from the streets.
Down for el barrio.

9
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:47,704
Now he's a shot caller.

10
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:50,408
The boss of bosses.

11
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:53,310
See all these
cats in here?

12
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:56,577
Any one of them
would die for Braga.

13
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:58,278
Including you?

14
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,049
Especially me.

15
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:13,630
Enjoy the party, fellows.
Club's yours.

16
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,933
Whatever you want, booze,
broads, it's all good.

17
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,899
Braga's mine.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,880
I'm taking the
whole house down.

19
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,049
Good luck.

20
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:40,542
Something interests you
about this car?

21
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:43,412
Just admiring
the body work.

22
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,979
Are you one of those boys
who prefers cars to women?

23
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,193
I'm one of those boys that appreciates
a fine body, regardless of the make.

24
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:02,302
Your car?

25
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,035
It's Fenix's car.

26
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:13,305
You'll meet him at the
rendezvous. He'll be leading you.

27
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,215
So now...

28
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:20,019
...that I know
your taste in cars...

29
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:22,613
...tell me, what about your women?

30
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:26,787
It all starts
with the eyes.

31
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:34,496
She's got to have those kind of eyes
that can look right through the bullshit...

32
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,662
...to the good in someone.

33
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:44,472
20% angel,
80% devil.

34
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:47,978
Down to earth.

35
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:53,999
Ain't afraid to get a little
engine grease under her fingernails.

36
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,573
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

37
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,616
It ain't.

38
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:16,718
Hi.
Hi.

39
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:19,855
I got a gift for you.
All right.

40
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,491
A dirty shot glass,
just what I always wanted.

41
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,159
I got these from the club last night.

42
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,204
There's two sets of
prints here. Run them both.

43
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:29,798
I know one of these is Campos'. I
think the other might be Braga's.

44
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,435
And you're gonna have
to go beyond Interpol.

45
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,877
So, that means I have to
contact individual agencies...

46
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:37,506
...and that could
take weeks. Okay.

47
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:53,586
Yeah.

48
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:56,793
That's your third traffic
violation in less than three blocks.

49
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,893
Slow it down,
O'Conner.

50
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,266
Sure thing, Dad.

51
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:31,426
He stopped.

52
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:27,491
We lost him.

53
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,083
He killed the tracker.
We don't know that.

54
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:31,391
I'm telling you, he killed the
tracker. We don't know that yet!

55
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:33,397
Get the bird overhead.

56
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:37,525
Right now, I'm moving north, 33', 56'...

57
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,939
All clear.

58
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:08,196
Base, flag nine,
I'm at Angels 5.

59
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:11,895
I don't have a tally on the target.
Repeat, I don't have a tally on the target.

60
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,699
They're gone, there's no one down there.

61
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:15,103
Damn it!

62
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:30,952
This ain't right, bro. Nobody said
nothing about being locked in no truck.

63
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:32,751
Tell me about it.

64
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,290
Hey. Hey!

65
00:08:38,997 --> 00:08:42,023
Yo! Where do you think
they're taking us?

66
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,692
Don't matter.

67
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:49,471
We're all just along
for the ride now.

68
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:02,543
Welcome to Mexico, boys.

69
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,693
There are helicopters
and surveillance cameras...

70
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:13,253
...that scan for heat
signatures at the border.

71
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:17,290
But there are blind spots that I
can guide you through via satellite.

72
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:21,863
There can be no margin of error, so
you must follow my every direction.

73
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:23,939
Any questions?

74
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,536
I thought Fenix
was gonna be here.

75
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,775
He'll meet you
out there.

76
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,022
All right, everybody, sync up.

77
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:45,695
Good luck, gentlemen.

78
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,668
Satellite linkup engaged.

79
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:05,073
Keep proceeding northbound
at current speed.

80
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,919
Stay close to Fenix.

81
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,523
He'll lead you across.

82
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:31,266
I got a heat signature
northbound along Legardo Ravine.

83
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:38,273
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico
side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.

84
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,250
Get the camera on it.

85
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:44,152
Manual override. Rerouting
camera to designated coordinates.

86
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:50,123
Hurry it up.
You guys have been tagged.

87
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:01,235
Shit.

88
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:04,841
Toretto,
get back in formation.

89
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,105
Reimaging commencing.

90
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,823
I don't see anything.

91
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,119
They're gone.

92
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:25,095
Get the helicopters
to cover it.

93
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,328
Base, we're 40 seconds
out from Legardo Ravine.

94
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,831
They're sending
a helicopter.

95
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:38,339
You have 30 seconds.

96
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:50,246
North 32' 33',
west 116' 49'.

97
00:11:56,761 --> 00:11:58,592
The window
is closing fast.

98
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:01,826
You need to get out of there
before they send ground support.

99
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,700
Fifteen seconds.

100
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,512
Base,
target is at two miles.

101
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,890
You're running
out of time.

102
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:37,993
You need to get out now!

103
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:54,008
Base, we're at north
32' 33', west 116' 49'.

104
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:57,953
We have no visual contact. Roll
ground units for confirmation.

105
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:20,208
Sloppy!

106
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,436
Very sloppy!

107
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:30,111
What are you doing, man?

108
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:33,955
Come on.

109
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:38,392
Get out.

110
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,128
Come on, man.

111
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:45,192
Come on, today, man.
Come on, let's go.

112
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,135
Hey, don't touch me.
Hey, don't touch me, man!

113
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:50,235
Hey, I said don't touch me, man!

114
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,832
Hey, look, dawg, don't
put your hands on me.

115
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,468
Hey,
Malik, chill, bro.

116
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:54,773
Yo, man, what's up
with your boy?

117
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,711
Hey, boss man!

118
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:01,380
What did you say?

119
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:05,183
I said only pussies
run nitrometh.

120
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:09,884
You looked under my hood?

121
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,496
I'm talking to you.

122
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,800
Got something on your mind?

123
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,970
'70 Plymouth.

124
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,239
Her name was Letty.

125
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:31,473
Yo.

126
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,746
Where's my money?

127
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,820
And somebody
wrecked her car.

128
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:47,860
I wrecked her car.

129
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:53,461
You remember her face?

130
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:00,233
Huh?

131
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:02,739
'Cause I don't.

132
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:06,777
Last time I saw it,
it was burning.

133
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:21,963
Now what?

134
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,331
I'm going to enjoy
what happens next.

135
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:01,928
Dom, get in!

136
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:04,902
Get in! Come on!

137
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,745
Come on! Get in the fucking
car! Let's go! Hurry up!

138
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,370
What
have you got, Trinh?

139
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,038
We're contacting agencies
in multiple countries.

140
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:47,107
Unfortunately, most of them have to
manually scan their prints for us to upload.

141
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:50,045
O'Conner's on line five.

142
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,214
And, sir,
you should see this.

143
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,780
Thank you.

144
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:05,260
Talk to me, O'Conner.

145
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:07,932
Where the hell have you
been? I got the shipment.

146
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:10,997
"I got the shipment,"
or "we got the shipment"?

147
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:13,134
What are you
talking about?

148
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:17,671
Traffic cams in the area picked up
pictures of you and Toretto together.

149
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:23,549
Listen to me, O'Conner. Bring in
the shipment and bring in Toretto.

150
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:26,650
But I thought the point was to get
Braga. We got an opportunity here.

151
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:29,318
Brian, the clock
stopped ticking.

152
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:32,492
Bring them in.
Are we clear?

153
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:38,165
O'Conner?

154
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,012
So this is what
$60 million looks like.

155
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,378
Yeah, we got to
get you to a doctor.

156
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:58,115
We got to find
a place to hide this.

157
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:01,885
I got a spot.

158
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,904
502, wet reckless.
I need a 48-hour hold.

159
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:18,873
Out back.
Any spot you can find.

160
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,915
You sure about this?

161
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:32,050
Yeah. The last place they'll check,
their own impound yard. Trust me.

162
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,430
You know,
I've been thinking...

163
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:43,990
...when you blew up your car back
there, you blew up mine, too.

164
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:46,559
Yeah?
Yeah.

165
00:18:46,637 --> 00:18:49,197
So now you owe me
a 10-second car.

166
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,805
Is that right?
Yeah.

167
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:05,783
Now we're even.

168
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:24,407
Is this your way of
keeping me away from him?

169
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:28,309
You're the only one I could
call. He's my brother, of course.

170
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,013
The bullet's not in there.

171
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:49,522
I'm gonna clean it and stitch
it up. It's going to hurt.

172
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,068
I bet you're going
to enjoy this.

173
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:54,068
A little.

174
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,475
Want some of this?
Yeah.

175
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:01,569
It's spicy.

176
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:04,974
I like it hot.

177
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,313
Dom, what are you doing?

178
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:11,321
You reached first,
you have to say grace.

179
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,501
Thank you, Lord,
for blessing this table.

180
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:31,705
With food, family
and friendship.

181
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:07,775
You asked me
why I let Dom go.

182
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,542
I think it's because
at that moment...

183
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:17,084
I respected him
more than I did myself.

184
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:22,653
Yeah.

185
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:29,358
One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing
really matters unless you have a code.

186
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,867
And what's your code,
Brian?

187
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:39,037
I'm working on it.

188
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:15,502
Shit. Hey, Dom.

189
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:18,139
When were you gonna tell
me? Dom, what are you doing?

190
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:20,183
When were you gonna tell me
you were running Letty?

191
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,583
Let me explain...
When were you gonna...

192
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:29,322
Dom, stop!

193
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:31,554
You don't understand.
I don't understand?

194
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:32,856
Stop!

195
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:38,228
She did it for...

196
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:42,862
Dom, stop!

197
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,067
Dom, stop it!
Please stop!

198
00:22:54,518 --> 00:22:58,147
She did it for you, Dom!
She did it for you!

199
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:06,960
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down Braga.

200
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:12,525
She just wanted you
to come home!

201
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,517
I'm sorry, Dom!

202
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,022
I'm sorry!

203
00:23:57,848 --> 00:24:03,718
You better have one hell of an
explanation. You disobeyed a direct order.

204
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:06,579
Where's the shipment?
It's safe.

205
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:08,454
It's safe.

206
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:11,427
Look, we could use the shipment
to parade in front of the media...

207
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:13,429
...get a few hundred pounds
of heroin off the street...

208
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:17,228
...but Braga's just gonna send another
shipment next week and the week after that.

209
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:19,428
Let's use the shipment
to lure Braga out...

210
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:21,562
...and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.

211
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:24,039
And how do you
suggest we do that?

212
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:26,076
A hand-to-hand
exchange with Braga.

213
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:27,542
He'll never show.

214
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:29,374
He can't afford not to.

215
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:41,184
You got a plan?

216
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:44,354
There's a price.

217
00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:50,028
We bag Braga,
you let Toretto walk.

218
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:01,038
Yes?
It's Dom.

219
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,377
I was just
thinking about you.

220
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:08,684
You know, when I gave you my
number, I was hoping you'd call.

221
00:25:09,286 --> 00:25:11,811
But not under
these circumstances.

222
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:15,284
What circumstances?
Me being alive?

223
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:18,261
Don't take it personally.

224
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:20,696
It's just business.

225
00:25:20,764 --> 00:25:22,356
I got some business
of my own.

226
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,100
Get Campos.

227
00:25:27,605 --> 00:25:29,038
It's them.

228
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:34,366
Uh-huh.

229
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:38,605
Was that how Braga inspires
loyalty? Killing his drivers?

230
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:41,482
One can always
find more drivers.

231
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:43,710
It's just good business.

232
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:45,216
I want to trade.

233
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:47,547
Braga doesn't negotiate.

234
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,649
Fine.

235
00:25:48,726 --> 00:25:53,595
You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

236
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:56,595
I know that can't
be good for business.

237
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:59,225
What do you want?

238
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:04,003
Six million cash,
delivered by Braga himself.

239
00:26:06,677 --> 00:26:08,269
I don't like being shot at.

240
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,910
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he's got something to lose, too.

241
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:13,574
He'll never go for it.

242
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:17,280
Either I deal with Braga,
or you do.

243
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:22,850
When and where?

244
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:41,810
Sir, players are onsite. Holding
positions at the perimeter.

245
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,873
All right. Listen up.
Everybody stay frosty.

246
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:47,645
We don't move a muscle until
O'Conner gives the signal.

247
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:50,414
When he gets the money,
you know what to do.

248
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:53,479
Well, the good news is,
when we get this guy...

249
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:55,957
...you walk out of here
a free man.

250
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:57,760
Is that what
they told you?

251
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,489
Yeah, that's the deal.

252
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:02,964
You still put milk and
cookies out for Santa Claus?

253
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:05,428
Yeah.

254
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,332
Here.

255
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,467
In case things go shitty.

256
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,508
Just like old times?

257
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:21,846
Yeah.

258
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:26,753
You dropped something.

259
00:27:26,824 --> 00:27:29,019
That's what you wanted, right? Dom...

260
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:46,702
He's harmless.
Don't worry about him.

261
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,970
And he's really
sorry about Letty.

262
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:54,880
Where's our stuff?

263
00:27:57,654 --> 00:28:00,919
You mean the stuff that
used to be in here, right?

264
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:05,892
Well, you'll see it when we
see Braga. That was the deal.

265
00:28:06,864 --> 00:28:08,263
No worries.

266
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:10,656
Braga keeps his word.

267
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,135
$2 million.

268
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,977
You get the rest
when I get my property.

269
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:05,982
Stasiak.
We got a match.

270
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:08,081
The fingerprint's
Braga's 100%.

271
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:10,649
Just waiting on facial
confirmation via fax.

272
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:12,695
I got
a question for you.

273
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:16,494
You wearing pink when you were
clawing your way out of el barrio?

274
00:29:17,768 --> 00:29:19,235
Order all agents
to move in.

275
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:22,431
We got confirmation. Primary
suspect wearing gray suit.

276
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:23,530
Let's move.

277
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:25,541
Sir, O'Conner hasn't
given us the signal yet.

278
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:28,942
What part of that didn't you understand?
We just got confirmation. Do it!

279
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:32,379
Secure primary suspect
in gray suit. Repeat!

280
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:35,043
Secure primary suspect
in gray suit.

281
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:51,195
You're thinking what
I'm thinking, right?

282
00:29:54,004 --> 00:29:55,631
He ain't Braga.

283
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,199
Oh, shit.

284
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:03,641
Drop your weapons!
FBI!

285
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:05,378
Get down!

286
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,547
Get out of here!

287
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:16,523
Get out of here, Dom!

288
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:22,389
Run him down.

289
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,128
Go!

290
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,462
Campos is Braga!

291
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:35,241
Come on.

292
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:44,713
Approaching primary target.

293
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,416
Primary suspect is secure.

294
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,890
He was under your nose
the whole time.

295
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:54,191
Now Braga's escaped.

296
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:57,256
Toretto's heading south, probably
long across the border by now.

297
00:30:57,334 --> 00:30:59,564
Do you have any idea the kind
of trouble you're in, O'Conner?

298
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:01,604
I was doing my job.

299
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:04,197
He ain't the first bad guy you
helped escape the law's grasp.

300
00:31:04,274 --> 00:31:06,265
As of now, you're being
taken off active duty...

301
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:09,278
...until this house can
mount a formal inquiry.

302
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:13,210
What about Braga?

303
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:16,616
That's no longer
your concern.

304
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,520
We now know where Braga is, right?

305
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,057
Customs tracked him via satellite
to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

306
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:34,569
Mexico is out
of our jurisdiction.

307
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:38,966
The fact is...

308
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:43,138
...the brass will be so busy holding
press conferences over the seizure...

309
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:45,340
...we'll skate
under the radar.

310
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:48,842
I thought we signed on
to do the right thing.

311
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,317
Everyone's looking for you.

312
00:32:29,726 --> 00:32:31,318
I'm right here.

313
00:32:32,629 --> 00:32:33,994
It's nice to see you've
gone with the times...

314
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:37,625
...and switched to electronic
fuel injection. Looks good.

315
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:40,828
Buster became a gearhead.

316
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:46,738
I'm going with you.

317
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:53,309
I don't plan on
bringing anyone back.

318
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:56,616
I know.

319
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:07,023
Hit that throttle.

320
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:34,449
Hey.

321
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:19,225
How do you say goodbye
to your only brother?

322
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:22,804
You don't.

323
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:34,107
I thought you weren't
gonna show up.

324
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:35,804
You saved my life.

325
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,148
I'm willing to
return the favor.

326
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,510
This will help
get you to Braga.

327
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:50,818
Dom.

328
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:54,456
Going in there
is suicide.

329
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:04,769
I have no choice.

330
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:10,813
You must have
loved her very much.

331
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:31,561
So this is where
my jurisdiction ends.

332
00:36:37,374 --> 00:36:39,535
And this is where
mine begins.

333
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,804
You ain't forgiven.

334
00:38:55,278 --> 00:38:57,405
You boys want
to arrest me?

335
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:02,508
No, we're beyond that.

336
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,384
You can't buy your way out of this one.

337
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,418
You and me...

338
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,493
You and me,
we're not so different.

339
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:16,823
You're no hero.

340
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:29,138
You're right.

341
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:35,581
And that's why you're going
back across the border.

342
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:43,320
But Fenix is mine.

343
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:45,386
You got it.

344
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,810
Shit!

345
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:17,384
You'll make it a couple of
miles out, if you're lucky.

346
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:12,176
You know where
you're going?

347
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:15,410
You want to borrow my GPS?

348
00:41:19,122 --> 00:41:20,817
Where are your boys at?

349
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,448
Are they going
to show up or what?

350
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:27,954
Careful what you ask for.

351
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:46,477
Just stop.
Just stop the car.

352
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:08,364
Right behind you.

353
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:26,313
Dom, head to the tunnel.
Let's use the tunnel.

354
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:55,517
Get out of here, Brian.

355
00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:06,751
You sure you know where
the tunnels are? You sure?

356
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:09,060
Yeah. I'd hold on.

357
00:43:12,135 --> 00:43:13,796
This might hurt.

358
00:43:27,183 --> 00:43:29,344
You're in
my world now, baby!

359
00:43:57,981 --> 00:44:00,541
That's it, baby!
End of the road.

360
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:02,049
Now what?

361
00:44:02,852 --> 00:44:03,944
Game over.

362
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,544
No, no, no.

363
00:44:35,184 --> 00:44:36,583
Come on!

364
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:56,890
Hey!

365
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,831
Get me out of here!

366
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:31,391
Pussy.

367
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:50,403
Let me see that.

368
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:55,348
Yeah.
Just keep pressure there.

369
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:58,009
You'll be all right.

370
00:48:03,893 --> 00:48:05,986
You gotta get
out of here.

371
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:10,589
I ain't running anymore.

372
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,332
I gotta ask you
something.

373
00:48:18,975 --> 00:48:20,101
Yeah?

374
00:48:20,876 --> 00:48:24,903
You know I would have won that
race if you didn't cheat, right?

375
00:48:27,984 --> 00:48:29,918
You hit your head hard.

376
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,690
Don't make me laugh.

377
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,735
All rise.

378
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,739
Please be seated.

379
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:02,041
Please rise,
Mr. Toretto.

380
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,684
I've listened
to the testimony...

381
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:09,350
...and taken into
special consideration...

382
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:13,418
Agent O'Conner's appeal of
clemency on behalf of Mr. Toretto.

383
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:17,059
That his actions directly
resulted in the apprehension...

384
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:19,966
...of known drug
trafficker Arturo Braga.

385
00:49:21,504 --> 00:49:22,903
However...

386
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:26,164
...this judiciary
finds that...

387
00:49:26,242 --> 00:49:31,077
...one right does not make up
for a lifetime worth of wrongs.

388
00:49:31,747 --> 00:49:33,476
And as such...

389
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:38,543
I find that I am forced to level the
maximum sentence under California law.

390
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,651
Dominic Toretto...

391
00:49:43,492 --> 00:49:47,485
...you are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life...

392
00:49:47,563 --> 00:49:50,657
...at the Lompoc maximum
security prison system...

393
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,198
...without the possibility
of early parole.

394
00:49:54,804 --> 00:49:56,635
This court is adjourned.
