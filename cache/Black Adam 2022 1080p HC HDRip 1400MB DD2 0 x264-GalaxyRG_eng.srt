1
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:42,895
Before Rome, before Babylon,
before the pyramids, there was Kahndaq.

2
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:47,059
KAHNDAQ, 2600 BC

3
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,533
The first self-governing people on Earth,

4
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:55,499
Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.

5
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,047
For centuries, they thrived.

6
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,991
But then...

7
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:10,910
came King Ahk-Ton.

8
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:15,576
Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

9
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:18,226
But he had even darker ambitions.

10
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:27,252
Obsessed with dark magic,

11
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,701
Ahk-Ton's real goal
was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

12
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:40,037
If infused with the powers
of the six demons of the ancient world,

13
00:01:40,163 --> 00:01:42,182
it would make Ahk-Ton invincible.

14
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:45,020
To make the crown, he needed Eternium.

15
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:49,003
A rare mineral of magic properties,
found only in Kahndaq.

16
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:51,675
So he enslaved his own people...

17
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:54,526
and forced them to dig.

18
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:09,143
Eternium.

19
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:15,990
Eternium.

20
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,597
Eternium.

21
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,540
Kahndaq was teetering on the brink.

22
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,794
What they needed...

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,892
Get off him.

24
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:35,508
Get off him.

25
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,640
...was a hero.

26
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:41,113
Why are we fighting each other?

27
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,894
Remember who our real enemy is.

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,634
Come with me.

29
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,958
Look. Eternium.

30
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:50,952
Let me see that.

31
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,290
The king thanks you.

32
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,309
He's supposed to reward him.

33
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:01,669
Is that right?

34
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,414
I want what I'm owed.

35
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:10,469
You want a reward?

36
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:15,397
The king thanks you for your service.

37
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,355
You want the king's reward too?

38
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:31,726
No, but my son accepts the king's mercy.

39
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:39,719
I won't always be here to protect you.

40
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,578
I don't need protection.

41
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,074
I want to be free.

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,698
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king.

43
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,480
Let someone else be the hero...

44
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,721
the graveyards are full of them.

45
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:53,034
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

46
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:59,877
Someone to hold the hopes of the people.

47
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,847
Even when all hope seems lost.

48
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,911
If we had more heroes...

49
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:12,020
then maybe our freedom wouldn't be a dream.

50
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,865
Freedom.

51
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:42,999
King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark
could quickley ignite a fire.

52
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,018
And so he ordered that it be snuffed out.

53
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,851
They thought they were getting a martyr.

54
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:55,097
Instead...

55
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,585
they got a miracle.

56
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:10,903
The Council of Wizards,
the magical guardians of the earth...

57
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,673
You have been chosen.

58
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,702
...sought to restore the balance.

59
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:17,477
They empowered him with the gifts
of the ancient gods.

60
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:19,328
And turned a boy...

61
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,485
into a champion.

62
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,938
S-H-A-Z-A-M.

63
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,220
Hurry.

64
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:28,167
Give it to me.

65
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:30,028
But the crown had already been completed.

66
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:31,896
Give it to me.

67
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,445
And when the Champion arrived
at the palace to challange him...

68
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:39,868
King Ahk-Ton summoned
its demonic power.

69
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:47,491
In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,

70
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:50,256
but the Champion was victorious.

71
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,080
The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac...

72
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:55,143
 so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.

73
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:58,481
And the Champion
was never heard from again.

74
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:03,005
KHANDAQ, PRESENT DAY

75
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:06,537
Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,

76
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:10,478
the Intergang, the latest
in a series of foreign invaders.

77
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:15,314
But legend says,
whenever Kahndaq needs him most,

78
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,194
the Champion will return
to restore freedom to the people.

79
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:22,639
It has been a long, long wait.

80
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,979
Show me your papers.

81
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:41,934
INTERGANG CHECKPOINT
Sector 5 - North Shiruta

82
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,403
Have your documentation ready.

83
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,435
It's all our three documents, yeah?

84
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:51,974
Don't judge the picture,
it's after my girlfriend broke up with me.

85
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:58,934
Open the back. Need a look inside.

86
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,990
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

87
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:09,702
It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

88
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:21,358
Watch where you're going.
You know the drill, back of the line.

89
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,423
Come on, man, you see me every day.

90
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:26,890
And every day I tell ya,
if it's got wheels, it's a vehicle.

91
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,430
Back of the line, mate.

92
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,449
You're not my mate.

93
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,757
I'm heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.

94
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:36,964
No, what you are
is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

95
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:38,859
from halfway around the world,

96
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:41,526
sent here to steal
my country's natural resources,

97
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:44,076
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

98
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:48,069
oppress our heritage,
and make us wait in lines all day.

99
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:52,950
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

100
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,457
Go on, get out of here.

101
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:02,072
Yeah, yeah.

102
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:06,786
DETAIN

103
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,813
Adrianna, we're clear.

104
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:22,032
Kahndaq isn't safe for us anymore.

105
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:24,842
Let's just move the crown first,
and then we can worry about safe.

106
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:26,673
I got Intergang watching my house.

107
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,559
I gave up my job at the university
and moved four times.

108
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,125
It doesn't mean
I'm gonna abandon my country.

109
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:34,103
I'm just saying,
no one stays a step ahead of them forever.

110
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,302
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

111
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:39,457
If I'm right,
they're days away from finding it.

112
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:46,476
What are you doing?
- I want to come with you.

113
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:49,316
You know it's too dangerous.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

114
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,294
Come on,
I want to help you beat those bastards.

115
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,075
Adriana, keep your head down, please.

116
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,908
You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

117
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:58,108
Go home, do your homework.

118
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:02,148
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

119
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,470
Go.

120
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:05,278
Go, little man. You did good.

121
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:38,487
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

122
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:40,378
Is that real Eternium?

123
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,284
Show us a little magic.

124
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,464
It doesn't work like that, it's unrefined.

125
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:46,891
You guys should get some rest.

126
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,261
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

127
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,407
Hey, come on. Stop it.

128
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,058
I'm just curious how she got it.

129
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,728
My grandmother gave it to me.

130
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:56,465
How did she get it?
- It's not a museum piece.

131
00:09:57,135 --> 00:09:58,355
It's a family heirloom,

132
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,657
going all the way back to the days
when Kahndaq was free.

133
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,541
You happy now?

134
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,096
Cool story.

135
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,681
And all I inherited was a sweater.

136
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:13,421
That's not true.
Baba left you his van, and his bald spot.

137
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,379
You know, some women like a bald spot.

138
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:19,048
Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside. You know?

139
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:44,378
Are you sure about this?

140
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:46,453
The inscrptions we found are clear.

141
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:51,239
And I'm positive about that translation.
There is something inside that mountain.

142
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:56,093
What if it really is the crown? Then what?

143
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,281
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

144
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:02,405
No one. We hide it again someplace else.

145
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:06,639
Get it out of the country if we have to.
It is too dangerous for anyone to have.

146
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,181
This is it?

147
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,471
Not yet.

148
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:16,375
Are you coming?
- Bad knee. I'll keep watch.

149
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:38,941
This way. Almost there.

150
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,600
"Men were given the gift of magic,

151
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:51,641
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted."

152
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:56,333
Keep reading.

153
00:11:56,794 --> 00:12:01,713
"The ultimate power was banished
from the earth and hidden... here."

154
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:04,785
Until now.

155
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:08,161
This mountain has kept
the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years.

156
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:13,827
We're 100 percent, totally, no take-backs
certain that we want to move it?

157
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:15,966
We don't have a choice.

158
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,658
What happened to Ishmael?

159
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,400
Great. Don't worry, I'll find him.

160
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:45,086
Samir?

161
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,345
Samir, what happened?

162
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,340
What?

163
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:56,493
I can't hear you. What are you saying?

164
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,600
Don't move.
Unless you want to join your mate.

165
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:02,207
Stay where you are.

166
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,048
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

167
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,176
"Turn back."

168
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,074
That's what it says, no?

169
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,388
Yes.

170
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:19,149
Where is Samir?

171
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,029
Claustrophobic. Needed some air.

172
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:25,713
Is this the way to the crown?
- I think so.

173
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,790
It's a tomb.

174
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,045
"Speak not his power,

175
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:53,846
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep
for all eternity" Teth Adam.

176
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:57,051
The slave who became champion
and defeated the king.

177
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,432
The legend was true.

178
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:02,521
Kahndaq... really did have a hero once.

179
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:06,181
If he was such a hero,
why'd they bury him down here?

180
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:31,845
The crown.

181
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:17,652
It's over.

182
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:19,944
Now, give me the crown.

183
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,169
Run, Addy. Run.

184
00:15:24,845 --> 00:15:26,451
Hold fire.

185
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,444
Don't hit the crown. Get her.

186
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:33,710
Go. Move.
- Circle around.

187
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,741
Get down.

188
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,914
Say goodbye to your brother.

189
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,362
In five...

190
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,467
four...

191
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:48,985
three...

192
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:50,800
two...

193
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:52,143
one...

194
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:53,603
I'm over here.

195
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:57,345
One? You let them get to one?

196
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:15,832
Any last words?

197
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,494
Please tell my son...

198
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:25,803
"Mightiest of mortals...

199
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:28,230
god of gods,

200
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:30,188
Six Immortal Elders by name..."

201
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:31,057
What?

202
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:32,164
"Shazam."

203
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:46,346
Who the hell is that?

204
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,999
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

205
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,025
Check him out.

206
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,569
Boss say you go.

207
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,642
Chief say your turn.

208
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,786
Hey, amigo. Let me see your hands.

209
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,617
Open fire.

210
00:17:57,982 --> 00:17:59,514
Your magic is weak.

211
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:08,431
Go. Go.

212
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:38,405
We need immediate backup.
Send everything you've got.

213
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:51,997
Ishmael.

214
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:02,527
Ishmael.

215
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:30,747
Let's go.
- This is as fast as I can go.

216
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:01,970
Samir. What happened?

217
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:03,640
What didn't happen.

218
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:05,846
Samir fell off of a cliff.

219
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,822
I had a gun to my head.

220
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,755
Ishmael is buried under a mountain.

221
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,186
And you summoned some flying magic man.
All for what?

222
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:16,855
Nothing.

223
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:19,952
Not for nothing.

224
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,902
Light him up.

225
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:53,440
Shit. Where the hell did he come from?

226
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,499
Rotor out. Go. Go.

227
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:58,655
I can't maintain altitude.

228
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,337
Oh, shit.

229
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,401
Stop. Stop the van.

230
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,094
Behind you.

231
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:18,642
Did he just catch a rocket?

232
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:22,660
ETERNIUM

233
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:56,642
God willing, we won't see him again.

234
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:11,662
Wait. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

235
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:13,590
Don't touch him, he's made of lightning.

236
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,673
Good point.

237
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,748
You get him, you're the electrician.

238
00:24:25,104 --> 00:24:26,894
Raptor team, come in.

239
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,569
What's your status?

240
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,692
Help me.

241
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:37,195
I told you to make it look real,
not punch me in the face.

242
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:42,583
Raptor team, come in. What is your status?

243
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,622
Status is that everyone is dead.

244
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:47,021
Ishmael, is that you? What happened?

245
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:51,512
The crown wasn't the only thing
waiting for us down here.

246
00:24:51,638 --> 00:24:54,752
Do you have it?
- No. But I know who does.

247
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:57,230
Copy that.
We're en route to your location.

248
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,959
We need immediate backup.
Send everything you've got.

249
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:05,042
This rare, magical mineral
has been mined for centuries...

250
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,188
...reports of an Eternium blast.
It is unknown who or why...

251
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:10,518
...has decimated a number of troops.
We are waiting on...

252
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:13,328
...an unidentified male.
This being is somehow able to harness...

253
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:14,878
What do you think?

254
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:17,910
I think this loose cannon
needs to be locked down...

255
00:25:18,037 --> 00:25:20,032
before innocent people start getting hurt.

256
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:21,890
Oh, and good mornig to you, too.

257
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:23,256
Shove it up your ass, Carter.

258
00:25:23,382 --> 00:25:26,086
He's been asleep for 5,000 years.

259
00:25:26,212 --> 00:25:28,109
He'll be disoriented at first.

260
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:32,466
The longer he has to adapt,
the harder it will be to take him down.

261
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:34,696
Wheels up in 30.

262
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:36,047
Who's on the team?

263
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:49,495
Welcome.
Please state your name for identification.

264
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:53,071
Hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr Hall.

265
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:54,799
Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.

266
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:55,778
Thanks.

267
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,273
Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone.

268
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,115
Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.

269
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:05,790
Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ.

270
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,688
Sounds delightful.

271
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:11,517
But please tell me you found someone
who can pack a punch.

272
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:13,539
That's where Atom Smasher comes in.

273
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:16,623
Al Rothstein,
nephew to the original Atom Smasher.

274
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:18,684
He inherited his uncle's powers.

275
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,058
Uncle Al

276
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:21,406
How's my suit? Does it fit?

277
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:24,116
No, yeah. It's perfect.
Thank you again for letting me borrow it.

278
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:26,160
You know,
I used to watch you all the time as a kid?

279
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:28,698
This is literally the only thing
that I'd ever wanted in my...

280
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,796
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't let anything happen to it.

281
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,016
It's Vintage.

282
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:33,418
And don't let anything
happen to you, either.

283
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:35,531
Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.

284
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:38,277
I'm gonna make you proud, Uncle Al.
I promise.

285
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,847
They seem green.

286
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:43,502
That's why I called in Kent.

287
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:47,906
Кent's been out of action
for a little while,

288
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:49,665
but I can't do this without him.

289
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:54,590
Takes magic to fight magic
and the man's got nearly god-level powers.

290
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:03,892
It might take a lot than that.
Are you sure they can take him?

291
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:06,577
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him...

292
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,753
we'll take care of the rest.

293
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,096
Good luck.

294
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:17,785
This is gonna be fun.

295
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:35,240
We're here, sir.

296
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:36,776
Oh, right.

297
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:42,352
Was I staring again?

298
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:44,639
Only half an hour or so, sir.

299
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:46,932
Maybe next time, honk the horn.

300
00:27:47,058 --> 00:27:48,642
Of course, sir.

301
00:27:56,617 --> 00:28:00,180
HAWKMAN'S ESTATE
SAINT ROCH, LOUISIANA

302
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,845
So what's the op?

303
00:28:04,971 --> 00:28:07,338
We're headed to Kahndaq to
apprehend and contain...

304
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,068
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

305
00:28:09,194 --> 00:28:10,408
I didn't bring passport.

306
00:28:10,534 --> 00:28:15,378
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

307
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:24,653
Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?

308
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:29,291
Everyting down to the screws.
Completely indestructible.

309
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:31,976
I'll be in the cockpit if you need me.

310
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:36,191
It's pretty cool. You got any snacks?

311
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:40,784
It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.

312
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:55,042
Here.

313
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,238
Oh. Thanks.

314
00:28:58,992 --> 00:29:00,579
I'm Al, by the way.

315
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,490
Мaxine.

316
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:08,996
What do you do?

317
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,600
Wind. You?

318
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:11,954
I grow.

319
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,017
Сool.

320
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:43,625
Whoa.

321
00:29:58,553 --> 00:30:01,442
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

322
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:08,381
My mom's not much of a doctor,
but you should probably leave th...

323
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,314
Or do that.

324
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:17,110
I know you have a lot to catch up on.

325
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:19,300
But, I was thinking
we could help each other.

326
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,491
Мove.
- I'm Amon, by the way.

327
00:30:21,617 --> 00:30:23,178
I didn't ask for your name.

328
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:26,091
You're Teth Adam, right?
Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.

329
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:27,220
I said move.

330
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:29,817
My mom said you took out a bunch
of Intergang soldiers in the desert.

331
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,380
Because they wouldn't move out of my way.

332
00:30:31,506 --> 00:30:34,320
So you can really fly and stop bullets,
'cause that's really crucial to my plan.

333
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:36,321
And is it really you stopping the bullets
or is it the suit?

334
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:37,373
Wait, what's your top speed?

335
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:40,081
I'm sure you're fast, but how fast?
Like Flash fast?

336
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:48,825
Wait, did you not have
mirrors back then?

337
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:52,845
Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

338
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,284
Five thousand years?

339
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,654
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

340
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:00,383
Until my mom woke you up.

341
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:03,309
So you've got stopping bullets, check;
flying, check;

342
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:05,859
and lighting thing, that's a big check.

343
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:12,376
I don't know this place.

344
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:14,054
This is your home.

345
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:19,691
Then my home is gone.

346
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:36,357
What happened to the crown?

347
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:37,982
Too much?

348
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,544
You know it's cursed with demons, right?

349
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:59,954
"Life is the... only path to death."

350
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:01,974
No shit.

351
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:08,641
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age
Kahndaqi demi-god."

352
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:12,647
"He defeated King Ahk-Ton
in approximately 2,600 BC."

353
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:14,627
There. That's you. See?

354
00:32:14,753 --> 00:32:16,935
That's the statue they built of you.
And now you're back.

355
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,602
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader...

356
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,126
after another over since you left.

357
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:24,319
My point is, Kahndaq still isn't free.

358
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:26,843
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

359
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:29,032
I'm no hero.

360
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:30,370
What?

361
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:33,727
Superman, Batman, Aquaman...
You're way more stacked than any of them.

362
00:32:33,853 --> 00:32:36,216
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

363
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:38,357
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

364
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:39,738
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

365
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:41,303
You're our only hope.

366
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:06,912
Wizards.

367
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,483
I can fix it. Don't worry.

368
00:33:11,393 --> 00:33:13,135
I'm not a wizard.

369
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:17,423
Hey, Mom. He's awake.

370
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:19,621
I told you not to go in your room.

371
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:21,925
It was you who spoke.

372
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,240
You woke me.

373
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:28,423
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead if it hadn't worked.

374
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,492
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

375
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:32,351
Then your enemies are vanquished,

376
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,491
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned.

377
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:37,066
Actually, we still have a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

378
00:33:37,193 --> 00:33:38,059
Then destroy them.

379
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:41,160
Intergang have guns and flybikes
and Eternium rockets.

380
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,727
We have my mom.

381
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,973
Prove your strength.
Destroy your enemy and all he cares about.

382
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:50,403
Make him beg for mercy,
but deny it until his final breath.

383
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,173
Interesting, okay?

384
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,841
I appreciate what you did to for me,

385
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:57,103
but I do not
want you teaching my son violence.

386
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:02,087
I understand.
You want his father to teach him violence.

387
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:04,030
Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

388
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:06,267
His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

389
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:09,387
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

390
00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:12,096
Yeah, Mom.
Who do you want to teach me violence?

391
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:12,932
No one.

392
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:18,313
I want a champion
to help free Kahndaq from Intergang.

393
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:20,614
Please, help us.

394
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,464
Wait. Wait.

395
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:43,609
Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

396
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:46,292
You don't feel any loyalty to us at all?

397
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,527
Not really, no.

398
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,544
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

399
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,012
I don't know what is was like
in ancient times,

400
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:53,678
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal in our world.

401
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:56,568
Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit,
get a cape, change your name.

402
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,525
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

403
00:34:58,651 --> 00:35:01,255
It's a little outdated.
And you definitely need a catchphrase.

404
00:35:01,381 --> 00:35:02,896
Something blackout bad-ass to say,

405
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:05,042
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

406
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:06,683
I don't waste words on the dead.

407
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,529
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

408
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:12,165
I was thinking, like,
"Tell them the Man in the Black sent you."

409
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:13,769
Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

410
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:15,204
Whoever's waiting for us in the afterlife.

411
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,558
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really lean into that.

412
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:20,035
My point is, you could be famous.

413
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,442
Magazines, lunch boxes, video games.

414
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:25,207
And the superhero industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

415
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,332
I don't need a box for my lunch.

416
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,316
Anyone you've ever known is dead.

417
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:34,096
What else are you gonna do?

418
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:41,142
Wait. Where are you going?

419
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:58,867
Waller's file needs a bit to be desired.

420
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:02,719
Most of this was considered a myth
until yesterday afternoon.

421
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:05,608
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

422
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:08,150
When you've seen
as many different futures as I have,

423
00:36:08,276 --> 00:36:10,219
you cease to believe in absolutes.

424
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:13,547
What are you laughing at?

425
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:16,767
I'm not laughing. That was a smirk.

426
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:19,196
I know. That's how you laugh.

427
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:23,760
I've missed having you around
to spout old cryptic shit like that.

428
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:27,327
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around to ignore all my advice.

429
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:28,676
Carter...

430
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:31,882
This is not a very good plan.

431
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:37,469
Yeah, well...

432
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:40,753
A bad plan is better than no plan at all.

433
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:44,393
If only there were a third option.

434
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:49,857
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

435
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,255
Why not?

436
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:53,647
'Cause that helmet is from another planet.

437
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:55,060
It's millions of years old.

438
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:56,756
It chooses who it lets touch it.

439
00:36:57,812 --> 00:36:59,385
Like Kent?
- Yeah.

440
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:03,012
Like, Kent is leterally possessed
when he puts it on.

441
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:04,686
What happens if I touch it anyway?

442
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:08,164
Soul crushing terror? Or... something.

443
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,726
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

444
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:12,415
Coming up on it.

445
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,500
Ready stations in five.

446
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:17,131
Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?

447
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:18,556
He's not some dude.

448
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:21,436
He's a weapon of mass destruction.

449
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:23,141
You don't have to raise your hand.

450
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:26,233
Question: if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

451
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,107
If we can get him to say the word,
"Shazam,"

452
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:31,543
Teth Adam will lose his power.

453
00:37:31,669 --> 00:37:35,363
And we're hoping since he's had
a few thousand years to sleep it off,

454
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:38,711
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

455
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:40,022
From the footage you showed us,

456
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:42,863
he doesn't really seem
like a "peacefully negotiate" kind of guy.

457
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:44,193
Correct.

458
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,837
Look alive.

459
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:49,116
We're here.

460
00:37:49,982 --> 00:37:52,374
ENTERING KAHNDAQI AIRSPACE

461
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:32,606
Forgive me.

462
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:48,587
This is a message
for all Intergang soldiers.

463
00:38:48,713 --> 00:38:51,450
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

464
00:39:15,362 --> 00:39:16,681
Тeth Adam.

465
00:39:18,795 --> 00:39:20,117
Please.

466
00:39:20,403 --> 00:39:23,228
There he is. Move.

467
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:25,587
Тeth Adam.
- Move.

468
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:27,717
Тeth Adam...

469
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:31,734
Who's gonna save you now, mate?

470
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:35,860
The statue?

471
00:39:37,697 --> 00:39:39,071
That's my son.

472
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:41,768
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

473
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,172
What are you doing?

474
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,400
Hang on. I recognize you.

475
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:49,188
Where is the crown?

476
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:52,090
Let's go.

477
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:09,129
You could've showed up a bit sooner.
But that was dope.

478
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:16,115
We need backup down here.

479
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:58,087
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

480
00:40:58,213 --> 00:41:01,517
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

481
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:03,718
But before you zap them.

482
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,543
Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

483
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:29,376
He's here.

484
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:30,576
You sense his presence?

485
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:32,201
No.

486
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:36,207
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

487
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:49,719
Fate and I'll take the lead. Listen.

488
00:41:49,845 --> 00:41:51,784
Now, you two hang back 'til we call you.

489
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,531
We're the anvil, you're the hammer.
You're ready.

490
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:57,657
He just dropped the...

491
00:41:58,186 --> 00:41:59,439
Shit.

492
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:06,400
Be prepared.

493
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:28,311
Behind you.

494
00:42:41,902 --> 00:42:43,451
Let us be.

495
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:45,940
I don't know their crimes,

496
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:49,415
but whatever they are,
these men should face due process.

497
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,815
Then let the gods make their judgment.

498
00:42:54,941 --> 00:42:56,402
Yeah.
- Yeah.

499
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:58,287
You don't look like an Intergang.

500
00:42:58,413 --> 00:43:00,957
We're the Justice Society.

501
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:04,128
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

502
00:43:04,254 --> 00:43:07,467
We're here to restore peace to Kahndaq.

503
00:43:07,724 --> 00:43:11,707
And we will use force if necessary.

504
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:14,962
Force is always necessary.

505
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,410
Teth Adam.

506
00:43:16,536 --> 00:43:19,963
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

507
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,597
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

508
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:28,496
You have two choices: kneel or die.

509
00:43:29,048 --> 00:43:31,068
I was a slave until I died.

510
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:34,862
Then I was reborn a god.

511
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:38,238
I kneel before no one.

512
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,274
Fate, give me a distraction.

513
00:44:40,182 --> 00:44:43,737
Just say, "Shazam." We all go home.

514
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:47,075
I don't have a home.

515
00:45:20,994 --> 00:45:22,362
Look at that suit. It's cool.

516
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:23,399
Thanks. You, too.

517
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:26,327
Thank you. It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

518
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,420
Hawkman just does not give up, does he?
- Nope.

519
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,996
Amon, where are you going? Wait.

520
00:45:51,122 --> 00:45:52,683
To help him.

521
00:46:13,094 --> 00:46:15,763
Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time.

522
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:17,247
Let's roll.

523
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,393
What are you doing? Hey.

524
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:03,746
No.

525
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:08,706
I'll be right there.

526
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,109
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

527
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:05,347
I can't hold him much longer.

528
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:11,833
Move.

529
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:35,899
I'm coming.
I'm zeroing in on your location.

530
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:09,830
I got him. Guys, I got him.

531
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:13,728
It's me, Al.
In case you didn't recognize me.

532
00:49:13,854 --> 00:49:16,677
There's something different about you.
Can't quite put my finger on it.

533
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:18,844
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

534
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,253
But you... You're like a tornado.

535
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:22,638
I thought the two of you did great work.

536
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:24,975
First time out... Bravo.

537
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:27,423
Thanks. I mean,
I got a little turned around back there,

538
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:28,779
but, it all worked out, right?

539
00:49:28,905 --> 00:49:30,299
You're damn right it did.

540
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,021
Let's hope Waller
has that cell ready for him.

541
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:40,804
You want me to keep my hand here, right?

542
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,949
You'd better not let him up.

543
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:47,489
What do I do? Guys?

544
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:08,388
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

545
00:50:08,515 --> 00:50:10,533
Long live the Champion.

546
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:12,854
Long live the Champion.

547
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:23,721
Yeah, he's definitely still breathing.

548
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:28,010
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

549
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,528
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

550
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:49,953
We're not strong enough.

551
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,693
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction...

552
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:55,079
to figure that out
before we gor our asses kicked.

553
00:50:55,205 --> 00:50:56,546
I'm working on it.

554
00:50:56,672 --> 00:50:57,919
Miss?

555
00:50:58,045 --> 00:50:59,867
Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?

556
00:50:59,993 --> 00:51:01,323
Yes, I do mind.

557
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:02,780
Where are you going with this, Kent?

558
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:04,211
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

559
00:51:04,338 --> 00:51:07,657
One catastrophe at a time.
We can't give him a chance to regroup.

560
00:51:07,783 --> 00:51:09,457
He's been spotted entering the palace.

561
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:11,520
It safe to say
he's not going there to surrender.

562
00:51:11,646 --> 00:51:13,350
Why do you want Teth Adam to surrender?

563
00:51:13,476 --> 00:51:15,536
He's the Champion of Kahndaq? Who are you?

564
00:51:15,662 --> 00:51:16,965
The Justice Society?

565
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,225
We have been living under
military occupation for 27 years,

566
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:22,582
and never seen you before.

567
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:25,244
You didn't come when Intergang
invaded our country,

568
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,978
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

569
00:51:28,104 --> 00:51:30,450
But now, we finally have our own hero...

570
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:33,529
and you decide to fly down here
and save us?

571
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:36,297
Thank you, but... we're covered.

572
00:51:36,423 --> 00:51:39,965
Go and protect inernational stability
someplace else.

573
00:51:40,091 --> 00:51:42,656
Oh, and second, I don't have the crown.

574
00:51:42,782 --> 00:51:44,404
Let me spell it out for you.

575
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:48,273
Teth Adam can't be Kahndaq's champion
because he is not a hero.

576
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:50,101
Tell that...

577
00:51:50,227 --> 00:51:54,079
to all the people he just liberated.

578
00:51:54,629 --> 00:51:56,759
I know what this looks like. I do.

579
00:51:56,885 --> 00:51:58,415
But I can assure you that my t...

580
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:04,333
I am so sorry. Was that expensive?

581
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:08,252
Me and you.
When we get back to the ship...

582
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,274
Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

583
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,925
I...

584
00:52:12,423 --> 00:52:14,319
Can we please just see the crown?

585
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:16,273
I don't have it.

586
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,283
We don't have time for this.

587
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:38,342
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

588
00:52:38,468 --> 00:52:42,046
You don't have any authority here.
Teth Adam has done nothing...

589
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,889
Teth Adam is not who you think he is.

590
00:52:45,015 --> 00:52:46,377
And how whould you know?

591
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:50,040
We have access to ancient texts
that have been kept secret for centuries.

592
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,713
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

593
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:55,939
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

594
00:52:56,834 --> 00:53:00,843
And we flew all the way over here
to stop it from happening again.

595
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:06,307
You want to go in there alone?
Are you sure?

596
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,477
You want to go in and fight
Teth Adam again, be my guest.

597
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:12,124
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

598
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:16,188
without destroying the rest of my city,
I'm your only shot.

599
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,096
You brought the invaders with you.

600
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,128
They only want to talk.

601
00:53:42,684 --> 00:53:46,192
They can talk. I won't listen.

602
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:50,434
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother told me the story...

603
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,512
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot...

604
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,532
to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq
by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle.

605
00:53:57,659 --> 00:54:01,007
But according to the Justice Society,
that's not really what happened.

606
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:04,178
They say that you didn't come here
to seek justice.

607
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:08,213
Hurry.

608
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:09,796
Give it to me.

609
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,915
That you came to exact revenge.

610
00:54:31,308 --> 00:54:33,094
And in your anger...

611
00:54:34,344 --> 00:54:38,409
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

612
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:41,598
This is what I want.

613
00:54:41,724 --> 00:54:44,870
...your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.

614
00:54:51,935 --> 00:54:55,211
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy...

615
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:57,233
of the gifts that you were granted.

616
00:54:57,584 --> 00:54:59,587
We have chosen recklessly...

617
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,469
and humanity has paid the price.

618
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,505
And now, Teth Adam...

619
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:06,116
you must pay.

620
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:27,970
It wasn't your tomb that I opened, was it?

621
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:32,705
It was your prison.

622
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,899
And now there's a statue of you.

623
00:55:36,312 --> 00:55:39,861
Out of the hope that someday
Kahndaq's champion would return.

624
00:55:39,987 --> 00:55:41,757
But it's built on a lie, isn't it.

625
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:43,958
I never said I was a hero.

626
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:45,802
I never claimed to be anything.

627
00:55:46,168 --> 00:55:48,352
You may not have been a hero.

628
00:55:48,726 --> 00:55:51,387
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

629
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:00,244
I will hear them out.

630
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:03,384
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

631
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:09,510
Uncle Karim.

632
00:56:09,636 --> 00:56:11,433
I can't believe you're sitting around
watching TV...

633
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,047
when the most epic day ever is...

634
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:14,846
In here, little man.

635
00:56:17,197 --> 00:56:19,834
Ishmael. My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

636
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,499
Funny story, he didn't.

637
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,263
Where's Adrianna?

638
00:56:23,389 --> 00:56:25,721
She's back at the square...
- We should go bail her out right now.

639
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:27,971
But she's the one who sent me home
to make sure the crown's safe.

640
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:29,783
It is safe, okay? Somewhere else.

641
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:32,323
Definitely not here. Let... Okay...

642
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:33,839
Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

643
00:56:33,965 --> 00:56:36,478
Back away. Put the bag down, now.

644
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,370
Give him the bag. Give hime the bag.

645
00:56:43,281 --> 00:56:44,764
Very good. Back away.

646
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:48,304
Back away.
- Oké. I'm...

647
00:56:57,352 --> 00:56:59,500
It's all going to be okay, little man.

648
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:01,750
Let me teach you some history
that you've never learned...

649
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,153
in one of your mother's classes.

650
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,801
When we had a powerful king,

651
00:57:04,928 --> 00:57:08,391
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

652
00:57:08,517 --> 00:57:09,921
It used to be great.

653
00:57:10,047 --> 00:57:11,561
Run, Amon, run.

654
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:33,270
Crash the building.
I lost the kid. He has the crown.

655
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:53,305
We're here to negotoiate the terms
of your peaceful surrender.

656
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,367
I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.

657
00:57:57,493 --> 00:58:00,989
What have your powers ever given to you?
Nothing but heartache.

658
00:58:01,518 --> 00:58:02,672
You have no idea.

659
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,733
Then why are you making this hard on us?

660
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:06,989
We both know
you're not supposed to be here.

661
00:58:07,115 --> 00:58:09,523
It is you who is not supposed to be here.

662
00:58:09,649 --> 00:58:12,040
I want you all to leave
Kahndaq and never return.

663
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:15,771
Gladly, with you as our prisoner.

664
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,579
How 'bout I rip
you little wings off instead?

665
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:22,223
I'd like to see you try.
- Okay, more fighting won't solve this.

666
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:23,611
I disagree.
- Me, too.

667
00:58:23,738 --> 00:58:25,165
Looks like we found common ground.

668
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:27,390
This can only end one way.

669
00:58:28,604 --> 00:58:29,973
Мom?
- Amon.

670
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:31,950
I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.

671
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:33,292
Ishmael's dead.

672
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:36,072
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

673
00:58:36,862 --> 00:58:38,057
Ground forces...

674
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:40,477
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

675
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:42,213
They're coming.

676
00:58:42,339 --> 00:58:44,074
Intergang are after my son.

677
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,220
They don't want him,
they want the Crown of Sabbac.

678
00:58:47,346 --> 00:58:48,928
I know you're not a hero.

679
00:58:49,054 --> 00:58:51,475
But you're not a monster, either.
I don't care what anyone says.

680
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:53,685
You saved me in that cave.

681
00:58:53,811 --> 00:58:56,796
You didn't know me
and your first instinct was to save me.

682
00:58:56,922 --> 00:59:00,369
I'm begging you. Please, save my son.

683
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,382
Check the whole place clean.

684
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:07,132
Cover all access points.

685
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,262
Keep looking.

686
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,751
Area's clear.

687
00:59:19,877 --> 00:59:21,529
There. Take him.

688
00:59:21,655 --> 00:59:22,966
Right there, right there.

689
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:25,666
Shit...

690
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:27,074
Move, move.

691
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,672
Don't shoot him, I need him.

692
00:59:47,244 --> 00:59:48,889
End of the road, kid.

693
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:57,806
Release the child.

694
00:59:57,932 --> 00:59:59,552
Whatever you say.

695
01:00:02,543 --> 01:00:03,763
Yes.

696
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:04,518
Thank you.

697
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:07,365
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time.

698
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:13,190
Оh. And remember your catchphrase.

699
01:00:17,439 --> 01:00:19,459
Time to go, Amon.

700
01:00:26,493 --> 01:00:28,091
Where's the crown?
- What crown?

701
01:00:28,218 --> 01:00:30,619
You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

702
01:00:30,745 --> 01:00:34,229
That's the plan, little man.
We'er gonna go for a ride. Come one.

703
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:50,707
Put me down. Put me down.

704
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:53,370
You should really be more careful
with your word choice next time.

705
01:00:53,496 --> 01:00:55,544
And tell them that the Man in Black...

706
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:03,614
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

707
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:15,053
Mom?

708
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,416
Amon, where are you?

709
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,221
No, no, no, what?

710
01:01:18,347 --> 01:01:19,648
I'm on one of their bikes.

711
01:01:19,774 --> 01:01:21,162
What bikes?

712
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:41,372
Amon.

713
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:42,422
Can you hear me?

714
01:01:42,548 --> 01:01:43,800
Mom, I'm okay.

715
01:01:50,422 --> 01:01:51,850
Shit.

716
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:59,213
Activate infrared.

717
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,352
What are you doing?

718
01:02:06,478 --> 01:02:07,765
Searching for the child.

719
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:09,195
No, you're murdering people.

720
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:10,571
How else do I find the child?

721
01:02:10,697 --> 01:02:13,154
I can help you,
but no more extrajudicial killings.

722
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,639
I don't need any help.

723
01:02:17,203 --> 01:02:19,982
Smasher, Cyclone.
What are you waiting for?

724
01:02:20,108 --> 01:02:21,765
Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

725
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:24,383
Okay. I got this. On the count of three.

726
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:28,074
One, two...
This feels a lot higher than last time.

727
01:02:30,383 --> 01:02:31,924
That was not cool.

728
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,973
Whoa, slow down.

729
01:02:48,439 --> 01:02:49,779
I got you. I got you.

730
01:03:00,524 --> 01:03:01,875
ENGINE FAILURE

731
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:12,002
Hey, careful, dude. I almost hit you.

732
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:18,236
I am so sorry.

733
01:03:18,362 --> 01:03:20,425
I don't really have peripheral vision
in the mask. It's my uncle's.

734
01:03:20,552 --> 01:03:21,971
I'll get it tailored.

735
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:23,366
Me and you.

736
01:03:23,492 --> 01:03:24,711
Roger that.

737
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,557
Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

738
01:04:11,683 --> 01:04:14,448
How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?

739
01:04:14,794 --> 01:04:16,749
I'm not that kind of doctor.

740
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:18,633
But don't worry, I can see the future.

741
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:20,592
This isn't how you're going to die.

742
01:04:20,718 --> 01:04:21,978
How do I die, then?

743
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:23,737
Just stay away from electricity.

744
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:26,713
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

745
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:29,020
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

746
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:41,267
OVER SPEED
ETERNIUM LEVELS CRITICAL

747
01:05:36,035 --> 01:05:37,602
Oh, God.

748
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,611
The Champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

749
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:42,356
I'm counting on it.

750
01:05:53,153 --> 01:05:54,682
Please don't.

751
01:05:55,157 --> 01:05:56,901
Teth Adam. Where are you?

752
01:05:57,028 --> 01:05:57,900
You followed me?

753
01:05:58,027 --> 01:06:01,851
My mind and body can exist
in different places at the same time.

754
01:06:01,978 --> 01:06:02,974
Did you find the boy?

755
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,085
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

756
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,375
Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.

757
01:06:10,437 --> 01:06:12,255
You killed him, didn't you?

758
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:20,884
He didn't make it.

759
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:26,363
The bullet's extracted.
The tissue damage has been repaired.

760
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:30,427
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

761
01:06:31,013 --> 01:06:33,169
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

762
01:06:34,675 --> 01:06:36,570
That is insane.

763
01:06:37,129 --> 01:06:39,127
The nanobots did most of the work.

764
01:06:39,253 --> 01:06:41,355
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna let you downplay this.

765
01:06:41,481 --> 01:06:44,137
I literally just witnessed a miracle.

766
01:06:44,813 --> 01:06:46,322
What? I say something stupid?

767
01:06:46,448 --> 01:06:49,519
No, it's just that you can transform
your molecular structure,

768
01:06:49,645 --> 01:06:51,394
grow a hundred times your own size.

769
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,194
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

770
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,535
I don't know, it's... It's cool.

771
01:06:58,530 --> 01:06:59,951
Thank you.

772
01:07:00,553 --> 01:07:02,649
But it's not as cool as nanobots.

773
01:07:04,129 --> 01:07:06,197
That's how you do your wind thing.

774
01:07:06,392 --> 01:07:08,979
Well, the wind thing
is called aerokinesis.

775
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:11,197
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream...

776
01:07:11,323 --> 01:07:14,830
by this really messed-up scientist
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

777
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:20,351
I'm... so sorry.

778
01:07:20,945 --> 01:07:22,327
No, you're good.

779
01:07:22,453 --> 01:07:24,371
It seems like you really turned it around.

780
01:07:24,497 --> 01:07:26,041
Found your calling.

781
01:07:26,884 --> 01:07:28,647
Hoping this is mine.

782
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:37,230
There's no point in dwelling in the past.

783
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:41,680
It's already moved on from you.

784
01:07:45,114 --> 01:07:46,562
Why did you say that?

785
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,213
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

786
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:52,393
Your thoughts are beter spent
on the things you can change,

787
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,348
not those you can't.

788
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:56,684
You see the future?

789
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:59,331
Tell me how I get my son back.

790
01:08:00,004 --> 01:08:01,468
By trusting us.

791
01:08:01,595 --> 01:08:04,596
Karim will live. We will save Amon.

792
01:08:04,722 --> 01:08:06,412
It's what we do.

793
01:08:11,131 --> 01:08:13,433
I suppose they didn't have doors
in your day.

794
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,991
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

795
01:08:16,714 --> 01:08:18,940
What I did there is called sarcasm.

796
01:08:19,066 --> 01:08:21,341
Where's Amon? Did you found him?

797
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:24,535
Not yet, but I will.
The men who took him will suffer.

798
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:27,562
Maybe these guys can help.

799
01:08:28,698 --> 01:08:33,034
There's an upside to keeping prisoners.
They can answer our questions.

800
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,487
What did you do with my son?

801
01:08:43,168 --> 01:08:45,546
Adrianna. Adrianna.

802
01:08:45,672 --> 01:08:48,917
I've learned that in this modern world,
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

803
01:08:49,043 --> 01:08:50,772
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

804
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:53,465
No.

805
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,815
Let's start with just one simple question.
Can either of you fly?

806
01:08:59,764 --> 01:09:01,539
Shit.

807
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:04,496
I think I'll sit this one out.

808
01:09:11,003 --> 01:09:12,715
Tell me what you did with Amon.

809
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:16,118
You'd better not drop those prisoners.

810
01:09:16,245 --> 01:09:18,320
I'm not going to drop them.

811
01:09:19,508 --> 01:09:21,045
I'm going to drop one of them.

812
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:23,620
Whoever ansers first lives. Where is he?

813
01:09:23,746 --> 01:09:24,987
I don't know.

814
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:33,379
He's at our mine in the desert.

815
01:09:33,505 --> 01:09:35,069
I can show...

816
01:09:40,418 --> 01:09:42,816
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

817
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:46,177
You said you wouldn't hurt the prisoners.

818
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:47,990
That was sarcasm.

819
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:49,799
No, technically, it was just a lie.

820
01:09:50,341 --> 01:09:51,862
Intergang have a mine in the desert.

821
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:53,239
Amon is there.
- I know it.

822
01:09:53,365 --> 01:09:55,457
It's near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

823
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,078
Let's go.

824
01:09:58,048 --> 01:10:00,193
I told you, stop killing people.

825
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:01,583
They look alive to me.

826
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:03,302
Because I saved them.

827
01:10:03,428 --> 01:10:05,044
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

828
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:07,987
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

829
01:10:08,114 --> 01:10:09,307
I did it your way.

830
01:10:09,433 --> 01:10:11,158
He does have a point.

831
01:10:11,951 --> 01:10:14,009
I know it got lost in all the confusing,

832
01:10:14,135 --> 01:10:16,282
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

833
01:10:16,408 --> 01:10:18,438
We know where Amon is. We have to go.

834
01:10:18,538 --> 01:10:20,096
There's no "we" here.

835
01:10:20,222 --> 01:10:24,158
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

836
01:10:24,284 --> 01:10:27,722
You think yourself a hero,
but you would let these criminals go free,

837
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:30,957
knowing that many more will suffer
at their hands unless we end them now.

838
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:33,706
Heroes don't kill people.

839
01:10:37,225 --> 01:10:38,506
Well, I do.

840
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,466
Here we go.

841
01:11:42,516 --> 01:11:44,160
Is that what I think it is?

842
01:11:45,652 --> 01:11:47,522
23 pounds of pure Ethernium,

843
01:11:47,649 --> 01:11:50,178
much denser than typical artifacts
of the period.

844
01:11:50,304 --> 01:11:51,836
King must have had a really strong neck.

845
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:54,402
No, it snapped when I killed him.

846
01:11:55,723 --> 01:11:57,070
What's that?

847
01:11:57,196 --> 01:11:59,010
There's writing on the inside of the rim.

848
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:01,844
"Life is the only path to death."

849
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:03,287
That's what it says.

850
01:12:03,413 --> 01:12:06,427
Life is the only path to death.

851
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:11,408
Well, that's surprisingly obvious.
Could it have another meaning?

852
01:12:11,534 --> 01:12:13,493
What if it means, like...

853
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:17,103
"Life is short.
You gotta hold on to what you love."

854
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,366
Stop.

855
01:12:20,492 --> 01:12:21,714
Deep.

856
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,352
It doesn't matter what it means.

857
01:12:23,478 --> 01:12:25,481
It should be buried under the ocean
for eternity.

858
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:28,615
That's not far from what we had in mind
for you when this is over.

859
01:12:28,741 --> 01:12:30,264
Or I could bury you with it.

860
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:35,474
We can't get rid of it now.
It's the one thing that Intergang wants.

861
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,459
Believe me, I know more than anyone
what this crown is capable of.

862
01:12:39,585 --> 01:12:42,466
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

863
01:12:42,784 --> 01:12:46,231
Adrianna...
Trust me, we will get your son back.

864
01:12:46,357 --> 01:12:48,439
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

865
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:50,208
Hand it over.

866
01:12:52,104 --> 01:12:55,889
We can't risk letting this crown fall
into the wrong hands.

867
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:59,033
We will find another way.

868
01:12:59,704 --> 01:13:01,327
No.

869
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:04,425
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

870
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:07,719
but that's easy to do
when you're the one drawing the line.

871
01:13:07,845 --> 01:13:09,804
All I care about is Amon.

872
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:13,927
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

873
01:13:14,053 --> 01:13:18,169
And you... you will work together.

874
01:13:24,422 --> 01:13:26,930
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

875
01:13:27,252 --> 01:13:29,501
We'll go in at dawn.

876
01:13:30,289 --> 01:13:32,185
I hope you can be a team player.

877
01:13:32,312 --> 01:13:33,852
I love teams.

878
01:13:34,141 --> 01:13:35,944
That was sarcasm again, yes?

879
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:37,184
Very much so.

880
01:13:37,311 --> 01:13:39,514
Good. Just checking.

881
01:13:49,795 --> 01:13:53,764
A wise man once told me
a bad plan is better than no plan at all.

882
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:57,081
That was before we had a very bad plan.

883
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:58,838
Let it go.

884
01:13:59,128 --> 01:14:01,812
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

885
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:03,572
He's a murderer, Kent.

886
01:14:03,698 --> 01:14:06,804
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

887
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,228
You don't get to decide who lives or dies.

888
01:14:11,234 --> 01:14:13,395
That's... up to Fate.

889
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:15,839
What's the helmet telling you?

890
01:14:15,965 --> 01:14:18,129
Somebody's gonna die.

891
01:14:18,691 --> 01:14:21,371
Who is it, Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

892
01:14:21,497 --> 01:14:23,405
Surprisingly, no.

893
01:14:23,849 --> 01:14:25,501
Is it me?

894
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:35,211
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

895
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,560
All I can tell you is...

896
01:14:41,017 --> 01:14:44,185
There is still time to change the future.

897
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:46,449
Let's use it.

898
01:14:51,347 --> 01:14:55,274
Well, I guess we're sticking
with a very bad plan.

899
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:06,667
AL HADIDIYAH MINE
INTERGANG CONTROLLED OPERATION

900
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:10,795
The Al Hadidiyah mine
is Intergang's most valued asset.

901
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:15,285
I'm gonna land us right here,
cut off their access to reinforcements.

902
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:18,343
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

903
01:15:18,469 --> 01:15:20,601
There is only one way in, one way out.

904
01:15:20,727 --> 01:15:22,961
We'll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol.

905
01:15:23,087 --> 01:15:27,003
Communication is key.
We keep in step or we get outflanked.

906
01:15:27,093 --> 01:15:30,389
We move through the mine, inch by inch,
until we find Amon.

907
01:15:30,515 --> 01:15:33,171
This is where you come in.
Are you ready... Damn it.

908
01:15:50,264 --> 01:15:51,647
Or we could just do that.

909
01:16:05,613 --> 01:16:10,364
Pure Eternium Shield.
Unbreakable, even with your powers.

910
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,932
Amon.

911
01:16:19,058 --> 01:16:21,110
You hurt him, I will kill all of you.

912
01:16:21,236 --> 01:16:24,025
Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.

913
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:25,812
We don't have it.

914
01:16:25,938 --> 01:16:30,372
Believe me,
nothing good will come from that crown.

915
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:35,092
No crown, no negotiation.

916
01:16:35,802 --> 01:16:37,407
I have it.

917
01:16:38,834 --> 01:16:40,598
It's right here.

918
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:44,493
Release my son, you can have it.

919
01:16:46,687 --> 01:16:48,655
What do you think you're doing?

920
01:16:49,662 --> 01:16:54,917
Intergang killed my husband.
I'm not letting them take my son, too.

921
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:02,455
Not your son. Not your country.

922
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,291
Not your decision to make.

923
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:07,639
Stop there.

924
01:17:07,765 --> 01:17:11,002
It's okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

925
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:12,421
Hand it over, now.

926
01:17:13,582 --> 01:17:15,808
I'm sorry, Mama.
- No.

927
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,050
Now, let Amon go.

928
01:17:29,366 --> 01:17:29,993
I thank you.

929
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:33,352
And I thanks your friends for returning
this crown to its rightful owner.

930
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:38,788
What kind of Champion of Kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders?

931
01:17:38,914 --> 01:17:40,152
You have what you want.

932
01:17:41,392 --> 01:17:42,249
Let him go.

933
01:17:42,376 --> 01:17:43,996
Ishmael, what are you doing?

934
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:45,722
Taking back what's mine.

935
01:17:46,616 --> 01:17:49,752
I'm the last living descendant
of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

936
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:53,640
And you have just given me
everything I need to become the next...

937
01:17:53,766 --> 01:17:56,048
king of Kahndaq.

938
01:17:57,459 --> 01:18:00,971
My family passed the knowledge on,
you know, one to the next.

939
01:18:01,097 --> 01:18:07,499
This crown, crafted by our ancestors,
stolen by the wizards and hidden away.

940
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:12,030
But still a source of great power,
if only we can wield it.

941
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:21,719
They say when Hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

942
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,662
I wonder if you'll do the same for them.

943
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:25,856
Please, Ishmael.

944
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:27,046
Sorry, Amon.

945
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:30,997
Fate, get ready.

946
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:35,336
Death is the only path to life.

947
01:18:39,252 --> 01:18:41,399
Amon.

948
01:19:46,507 --> 01:19:47,827
Amon.

949
01:19:50,801 --> 01:19:54,413
He's alive.
But we need to get him to the medical bay.

950
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:56,430
Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet.

951
01:19:56,556 --> 01:19:58,103
It was me.

952
01:20:06,724 --> 01:20:08,084
Come.

953
01:20:17,287 --> 01:20:18,926
We're going with you.

954
01:20:19,052 --> 01:20:21,696
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

955
01:20:34,346 --> 01:20:38,022
I found the crown. But it's not alone.

956
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:51,372
How long we gonna keep doing this?

957
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:58,704
There's no point in fighting.
We both know no one can stop me.

958
01:20:59,211 --> 01:21:00,663
You're right.

959
01:21:01,505 --> 01:21:03,266
Only you can.

960
01:21:03,966 --> 01:21:07,464
Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died.

961
01:21:11,483 --> 01:21:12,948
Who's Hurut?

962
01:21:18,146 --> 01:21:20,373
Hurut was a true Champion of Kahndaq.

963
01:21:26,121 --> 01:21:28,615
And he was also... my son.

964
01:21:30,608 --> 01:21:33,155
I won't always be here to protect you.

965
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:34,875
I don't need protection.

966
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:36,487
I want to be free.

967
01:21:37,839 --> 01:21:39,454
Freedom is for the birds.

968
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:41,602
Let someone else be the hero...

969
01:21:42,322 --> 01:21:44,908
the graveyards are full of them.

970
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:51,720
I tried to protect him.

971
01:21:59,577 --> 01:22:01,597
But I wasn't strong enough.

972
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,394
Shazam.

973
01:22:09,116 --> 01:22:12,639
The wizards decided
that he would be their champion.

974
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:15,281
But after the Champion's many victories,

975
01:22:15,408 --> 01:22:18,591
the king went after
what Hurut loved the most.

976
01:22:20,275 --> 01:22:21,865
Our family.

977
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:41,197
Hold on, Father.

978
01:22:41,906 --> 01:22:43,420
Stay with me.

979
01:22:50,501 --> 01:22:52,401
With my powers...

980
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,560
you'll be safe.

981
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:57,404
I couldn't protect your mother.

982
01:22:58,129 --> 01:23:00,763
Repeat what I say.

983
01:23:01,491 --> 01:23:02,932
Shazam.
- Shazam.

984
01:23:15,983 --> 01:23:18,445
Instead of battling the king...

985
01:23:18,892 --> 01:23:21,429
Instead of saving Kahndaq...

986
01:23:22,224 --> 01:23:24,672
Hurut chose to save...

987
01:23:25,338 --> 01:23:26,887
me.

988
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:48,034
But he couldn't save himself
from the king's assassins.

989
01:23:50,463 --> 01:23:53,451
The powers were not a gift
from the wizards...

990
01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:55,660
but a curse.

991
01:24:05,318 --> 01:24:08,128
Born out of rage.

992
01:24:10,804 --> 01:24:13,054
The statue of the Champion isn't you.

993
01:24:16,194 --> 01:24:17,482
It's Hurut.

994
01:24:20,313 --> 01:24:23,013
My son dreamt of a better world.

995
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,841
That's why he saved me.

996
01:24:29,943 --> 01:24:32,983
But the world was only a better place
with him in it.

997
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:50,035
Kahndaq needed a hero.

998
01:24:51,804 --> 01:24:53,426
Instead, it got me.

999
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:57,763
All this power...

1000
01:24:58,994 --> 01:25:01,886
And the only thing I can do with it
is hurt people.

1001
01:25:02,573 --> 01:25:07,289
I will speak the word my son gave me,
and I will give up my power.

1002
01:25:09,431 --> 01:25:13,249
And when I do,
you must ensure I never speak it again.

1003
01:25:19,105 --> 01:25:20,432
Shazam.

1004
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:30,891
Some men are not meant...

1005
01:25:31,017 --> 01:25:32,603
to be heroes.

1006
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:43,118
TASK FORCE X BLACK SITE
SECRET LOCATION

1007
01:26:16,878 --> 01:26:18,379
Hey.

1008
01:26:36,154 --> 01:26:39,087
So beautiful.

1009
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:06,343
Surprised to see us?

1010
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:09,369
Surprise is a dirty word in this business.

1011
01:27:09,495 --> 01:27:11,928
Are you sure you can handle him?

1012
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:15,485
You're the one who can see the future,
you'll tell me if we can't.

1013
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:17,032
Just be careful with this one.

1014
01:27:17,854 --> 01:27:20,444
You know, they say the gods created us,

1015
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:23,698
but we're the ones
who always wind up burying them.

1016
01:27:24,736 --> 01:27:26,792
Waller sends her regards.

1017
01:27:33,197 --> 01:27:35,045
They'll know how to deal with him.

1018
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:40,467
To keep him from regaining his powers,
they'll keep him in suspended animation.

1019
01:27:47,586 --> 01:27:51,818
As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.

1020
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:58,354
He'll never say another word again.

1021
01:28:16,919 --> 01:28:19,340
Hey. There he is.

1022
01:28:19,466 --> 01:28:23,355
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1023
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:25,807
Well, statistically,
most heroes don't wear capes.

1024
01:28:25,934 --> 01:28:27,826
But yeah, try it on.

1025
01:28:30,755 --> 01:28:32,639
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1026
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:37,637
That's a nice touch.

1027
01:29:17,487 --> 01:29:18,981
Kent.

1028
01:29:20,066 --> 01:29:21,679
Kent.

1029
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:26,056
Mission accomplished?

1030
01:29:26,182 --> 01:29:27,776
My vision hasn't changed.

1031
01:29:28,181 --> 01:29:30,343
But Teth Adam's out of the equation.

1032
01:29:30,469 --> 01:29:33,441
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1033
01:29:33,567 --> 01:29:35,677
What is the helmet telling you?

1034
01:29:36,493 --> 01:29:39,728
My vision has always shown me
great calamity.

1035
01:29:39,854 --> 01:29:41,908
The world in flames.

1036
01:29:42,034 --> 01:29:43,576
We can stop it...

1037
01:29:45,112 --> 01:29:47,052
but you die.

1038
01:29:48,609 --> 01:29:50,715
You should've told me sooner.

1039
01:29:53,318 --> 01:29:55,160
I have no fear of death.

1040
01:29:55,286 --> 01:29:57,450
That's precisely why I didn't tell you.

1041
01:29:57,577 --> 01:29:59,790
The world needs the Justice Society.

1042
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:01,503
The world needs you.

1043
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:04,368
But you can't choose who lives and dies.

1044
01:30:04,494 --> 01:30:06,381
That's Fate, right?

1045
01:30:07,085 --> 01:30:10,966
Well, that sounds familiar.

1046
01:30:13,223 --> 01:30:16,181
I remember seeing my first airplane.

1047
01:30:16,975 --> 01:30:21,365
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1048
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:25,080
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1049
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,621
But I didn't cheer.

1050
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:31,977
Even though I was only a boy.

1051
01:30:32,508 --> 01:30:36,858
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1052
01:30:36,984 --> 01:30:40,733
Thanks to this, I've lived longer
than I could've ever have hoped for.

1053
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:45,356
I have seen the world change
in more ways than I could've imagined.

1054
01:30:48,048 --> 01:30:49,899
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1055
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:53,690
And I don't want my friend to die.

1056
01:31:01,158 --> 01:31:05,768
Ishmael said,
"Death is the only path to life."

1057
01:31:05,894 --> 01:31:08,567
But that's not what the inscription says.

1058
01:31:08,693 --> 01:31:11,616
Right. "Life is the only way to death."

1059
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:15,796
Maybe he got it backwards,
like he read it in a mirror or something.

1060
01:31:15,922 --> 01:31:18,310
That's it. In Kahndaqi mythology,

1061
01:31:18,436 --> 01:31:21,548
the souls of the damned
are sent to the Rock of Finality.

1062
01:31:21,674 --> 01:31:26,590
The underworld is a mirror to our own.
Here, turn the crown around.

1063
01:31:27,126 --> 01:31:28,553
Now mirror the letters.

1064
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:30,985
See? That's what I missed.

1065
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:36,122
"Death is the only path to life."

1066
01:31:39,669 --> 01:31:42,345
He kidnapped Amon on purpose,

1067
01:31:42,471 --> 01:31:44,826
because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.

1068
01:31:44,952 --> 01:31:48,810
And he believed the Champion's magic
would send him to the Rock of Finality.

1069
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:52,534
As life is the path to death.

1070
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:56,310
Now your death is a path to life.

1071
01:31:56,436 --> 01:32:00,702
The wizards have their champion,
now we have ours.

1072
01:32:00,828 --> 01:32:03,603
You will take the throne of Kahndaq...

1073
01:32:03,729 --> 01:32:07,392
and unleash hell on Earth.

1074
01:32:07,518 --> 01:32:10,301
Speak our name.

1075
01:32:10,427 --> 01:32:12,283
"Sabbac."

1076
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:35,048
What the bloody hell is that?

1077
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:36,963
Readout says it's the demon, Sabbac.

1078
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,896
Get me closer. Now, right now.

1079
01:32:39,023 --> 01:32:41,059
We're 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds.

1080
01:32:48,557 --> 01:32:51,481
The king has returned.

1081
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:54,330
The throne will be mine.

1082
01:32:56,127 --> 01:32:58,146
Brace yourselves.

1083
01:33:03,636 --> 01:33:05,137
Hold on.

1084
01:33:41,524 --> 01:33:43,056
Now prepare to die.

1085
01:33:49,099 --> 01:33:50,577
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1086
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,517
No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne.

1087
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,616
Copy that.
- We're on it.

1088
01:34:15,742 --> 01:34:17,076
Heads up.

1089
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:02,663
Activate infrared.

1090
01:35:06,138 --> 01:35:08,024
Sabbac, show yourself.

1091
01:35:10,546 --> 01:35:12,282
Adrianna.

1092
01:35:12,568 --> 01:35:14,295
Amon.

1093
01:35:17,347 --> 01:35:19,126
That's for my cruiser.

1094
01:35:57,396 --> 01:35:59,126
This is it.

1095
01:36:00,047 --> 01:36:01,700
We can't win, Carter.

1096
01:36:01,826 --> 01:36:04,952
Yeah, but the world burns if we don't.
Right?

1097
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:09,517
Bad plan is better than no plan at all.

1098
01:36:36,281 --> 01:36:38,542
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1099
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:40,313
Giving us a third option.

1100
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:41,773
It's supposed to be me.

1101
01:36:41,899 --> 01:36:44,198
I didn't tell you my whole vision,
old friend.

1102
01:36:44,868 --> 01:36:46,471
I did see your death.

1103
01:36:46,597 --> 01:36:48,851
But I also found a way to prevent it.

1104
01:36:48,977 --> 01:36:53,582
It has been an extraordinary life,
but always with one foot in the future.

1105
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:56,868
Carter, for the first time in 100 years,

1106
01:36:56,994 --> 01:36:58,808
when I look ahead...

1107
01:37:00,882 --> 01:37:02,074
I see nothing.

1108
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,155
No, Kent.

1109
01:37:03,281 --> 01:37:04,684
And...

1110
01:37:04,988 --> 01:37:06,554
it's...

1111
01:37:07,023 --> 01:37:08,104
beautiful.

1112
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:09,240
Wait, Kent.

1113
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:10,292
Goodbye...

1114
01:37:10,418 --> 01:37:11,618
Kent.

1115
01:37:12,019 --> 01:37:13,173
...my dear friend.

1116
01:37:13,299 --> 01:37:14,519
Kent.

1117
01:37:17,029 --> 01:37:19,048
Hit it from every side.

1118
01:37:21,054 --> 01:37:23,073
Kent.

1119
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:27,218
No.

1120
01:37:46,093 --> 01:37:50,887
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1121
01:37:51,013 --> 01:37:54,210
defender against darkness and chaos,

1122
01:37:54,336 --> 01:37:57,957
but even my powers cannot defeat you.

1123
01:38:07,122 --> 01:38:09,631
There's no one that can defeat me.

1124
01:38:13,755 --> 01:38:18,191
There is one... There is one...

1125
01:38:18,317 --> 01:38:19,948
Teth Adam.

1126
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:22,939
I know you can hear me.

1127
01:38:24,448 --> 01:38:28,416
The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.

1128
01:38:28,542 --> 01:38:33,546
Now you are the only one
who can defeat the Demon Champion.

1129
01:38:59,202 --> 01:39:03,146
You have the power
to be the destroyer of this world.

1130
01:39:05,704 --> 01:39:08,658
But you can also be its savior.

1131
01:39:25,499 --> 01:39:30,973
You believe you are not a worthy champion
because the wizards did not choose you.

1132
01:39:31,099 --> 01:39:34,853
But Fate does not make mistakes.
Neither did your son.

1133
01:39:38,913 --> 01:39:40,594
We were wrong about you.

1134
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,817
The world doesn't always need
a white knight.

1135
01:39:44,058 --> 01:39:46,249
Sometimes it needs something darker.

1136
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:06,478
Don't you dare give up on us now.
The world needs you.

1137
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:14,991
Kent.

1138
01:41:24,102 --> 01:41:25,332
No.

1139
01:42:29,521 --> 01:42:30,860
Mom?

1140
01:42:31,464 --> 01:42:33,214
What's happening?

1141
01:42:34,339 --> 01:42:36,132
It's Sabbac.

1142
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:38,119
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1143
01:42:38,462 --> 01:42:40,158
Whatever happens...

1144
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:42,922
you stay behind me.

1145
01:42:57,072 --> 01:42:59,796
Don't worry, I die by electricity.

1146
01:43:01,363 --> 01:43:04,069
You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it.

1147
01:43:04,195 --> 01:43:05,584
Come and get it.

1148
01:43:06,125 --> 01:43:07,121
No, no. No.

1149
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:09,677
Don't send me home, I can help.
- I know.

1150
01:43:09,803 --> 01:43:12,684
But you can do better
than swinging a stick.

1151
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:53,754
The Gods have brought us together again.

1152
01:43:55,481 --> 01:43:58,406
It's not your time, Father.

1153
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:03,175
Hey.

1154
01:44:03,594 --> 01:44:05,263
What are you all standing around for?

1155
01:44:06,493 --> 01:44:08,302
This is our chance.

1156
01:44:10,962 --> 01:44:14,034
With these hands, we built Kahndaq.

1157
01:44:14,311 --> 01:44:16,384
And with these hands, we will set it free.

1158
01:44:22,448 --> 01:44:24,358
The people need a hero.

1159
01:44:25,962 --> 01:44:27,691
No, Father.

1160
01:44:28,088 --> 01:44:30,417
They need to be free.

1161
01:44:34,299 --> 01:44:36,318
What are we waiting for?

1162
01:44:58,539 --> 01:45:00,971
Say the word.

1163
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,363
Shazam.

1164
01:45:13,772 --> 01:45:16,893
The people of Kahndaq rise up against you.

1165
01:45:45,342 --> 01:45:46,959
Yes.

1166
01:45:51,121 --> 01:45:52,609
I got this.

1167
01:45:53,621 --> 01:45:55,165
Go get him.

1168
01:46:12,378 --> 01:46:14,181
You know what I have to do.

1169
01:46:15,704 --> 01:46:17,360
Beat his ass.

1170
01:46:17,486 --> 01:46:22,685
Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided
by a true battle of champions.

1171
01:46:23,204 --> 01:46:24,975
Let's end this.

1172
01:46:51,142 --> 01:46:52,395
It's a lot of them.

1173
01:46:54,013 --> 01:46:56,405
It's a bit more than I thought.
- Yeah.

1174
01:46:56,531 --> 01:46:57,734
Just a bit.

1175
01:47:05,312 --> 01:47:07,155
Hey, mom.

1176
01:47:13,992 --> 01:47:17,658
These are our streets. Our city.

1177
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:21,297
Free Kahndaq.

1178
01:47:28,934 --> 01:47:31,550
The wizards' powers were wasted on you.

1179
01:47:31,677 --> 01:47:34,069
You are not a hero.

1180
01:47:35,928 --> 01:47:39,219
No. I'm not.

1181
01:47:40,901 --> 01:47:42,371
But he is.

1182
01:47:53,577 --> 01:47:55,918
You cannot stand against me.

1183
01:47:56,044 --> 01:47:58,837
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1184
01:48:08,153 --> 01:48:11,186
I learned this trick from an old friend.

1185
01:48:49,829 --> 01:48:51,459
You can control it.

1186
01:48:55,556 --> 01:48:57,075
You have to.

1187
01:49:08,055 --> 01:49:10,694
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

1188
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:37,138
Yes.
- Yes.

1189
01:50:00,249 --> 01:50:02,976
I never tought I'd be happy to see you.

1190
01:50:05,918 --> 01:50:08,057
I'm only here because of him.

1191
01:50:10,895 --> 01:50:13,213
That makes two of us.

1192
01:50:29,747 --> 01:50:31,843
See you around, old friend.

1193
01:50:46,911 --> 01:50:48,643
Think you can keep him out of trouble?

1194
01:50:48,769 --> 01:50:50,419
As long as no one comes looking for it.

1195
01:50:50,545 --> 01:50:52,130
Fair enough.

1196
01:50:53,528 --> 01:50:55,133
Just be careful.

1197
01:50:55,259 --> 01:50:58,408
The kind of justice you dish out
can darken your soul.

1198
01:50:58,534 --> 01:51:03,990
It's his darkness that lets him do
what heroes like you cannot.

1199
01:51:05,482 --> 01:51:07,944
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

1200
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:17,934
I tought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1201
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:19,591
Just saying.

1202
01:51:20,876 --> 01:51:22,791
We made a great team.

1203
01:51:28,321 --> 01:51:29,830
Maybe we could...
- Don't push it.

1204
01:51:30,425 --> 01:51:32,492
Smasher, let's go.

1205
01:51:43,609 --> 01:51:46,342
Long live the Champion.

1206
01:51:46,468 --> 01:51:52,158
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

1207
01:51:53,768 --> 01:51:55,667
You could lead them.

1208
01:52:28,985 --> 01:52:30,638
How does it feel?

1209
01:52:32,166 --> 01:52:33,428
Wrong.

1210
01:52:44,729 --> 01:52:46,176
So... what now?

1211
01:52:46,987 --> 01:52:49,406
Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?

1212
01:52:49,533 --> 01:52:51,806
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1213
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:53,879
And it still does.

1214
01:52:54,725 --> 01:52:57,632
What is needs now is a protector.

1215
01:52:57,725 --> 01:52:59,225
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1216
01:52:59,351 --> 01:53:02,008
Perhaps that name is a little...

1217
01:53:02,134 --> 01:53:03,589
old-fashioned.

1218
01:53:04,576 --> 01:53:06,424
So what should we call you?

1219
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:47,985
BLACK ADAM

1220
01:56:01,648 --> 01:56:04,256
Okay, "Black Adam."

1221
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:09,453
My name is Amanda Waller.
Congratulations, you have my attention.

1222
01:56:09,579 --> 01:56:12,814
This is gonna be your only warning.

1223
01:56:13,511 --> 01:56:16,419
You don't want to stay in my prison,
that's fine.

1224
01:56:16,545 --> 01:56:18,853
Kahndaq is your prison now.

1225
01:56:19,145 --> 01:56:23,107
You step one foot ouside of it,
you will not live to regret it.

1226
01:56:25,092 --> 01:56:27,311
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1227
01:56:27,437 --> 01:56:31,090
I can call in a favor and send people
who aren't from this planet.

1228
01:56:32,973 --> 01:56:34,929
Send them all.

1229
01:56:36,050 --> 01:56:37,462
As you wish.

1230
01:56:52,444 --> 01:56:56,630
It's been a while since anyone's
made the world this nervous.

1231
01:57:01,713 --> 01:57:03,400
Black Adam.

1232
01:57:04,446 --> 01:57:06,082
We should talk.
