1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,366
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,391 --> 00:00:03,071
- I need your help, Roy.
- You really think

3
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:05,030
an energy weapon's gonna
stop this Monitor guy?

4
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:07,928
We got the plutonium
with an assist from Roy.

5
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:09,247
You're working with the Monitor.

6
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:11,632
Mar Novu is trying to save
worlds, not destroy them.

7
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:12,923
I didn't want to believe it.

8
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:17,069
The only way to win is
to accept the inevitable.

9
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:18,479
Where the hell are we?

10
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:19,954
We're on Lian Yu.

11
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:26,304
The name of the island they
found me on is Lian Yu.

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,606
It's Mandarin for purgatory.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,853
Now I understand why.

14
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:36,981
The memories, the pain,
I've never escaped them.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,715
They're always with me,

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,015
a reminder of what I had to endure

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,440
with only one thought, one goal...

18
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:47,483
Survive.

19
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:52,774
To save the multiverse, I
must become something else.

20
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:57,835
To do that, I have to return
to where my journey began...

21
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:00,337
Purgatory.

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,507

23
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:09,064
So this is the famous Lian Yu.

24
00:01:09,262 --> 00:01:11,725
I did not want a return
ticket to this place.

25
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:15,029
The 3 of you were supposed to
be safe and sound in Star City.

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,349
How'd you get here?

27
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:18,079
A bunch of guys in tac gear came

28
00:01:18,104 --> 00:01:19,437
and stormed the bunker.

29
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:20,725
A.R.G.U.S Agents.

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,798
Sounds just as fun as tranq darts.

31
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:24,261
I'm sorry about that.

32
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:26,445
I needed you here, and I didn't
have time to convince you.

33
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,709
What the hell's going on, Lyla?

34
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,238
Mar Novu needs us to build a weapon,

35
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:30,770
and it has to be done on this island.

36
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,769
I'm not doing anything for that guy.

37
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:34,393
John, we have to.

38
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:40,482
Since when do we take
orders from the enemy?

39
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:42,801
We were wrong about Novu, John.

40
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:43,891
He's not our enemy.

41
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,028
Since when?

42
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:47,361
He dropped me in an alternate reality

43
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,826
in order to teach me the lesson that

44
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,699
to fix the multiverse,

45
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,723
we need to work with him.

46
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:54,001
This is crazy.

47
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:56,833
I know it's hard to hear,
Johnny, but it's the truth.

48
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:58,962
John...

49
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:04,842
How do we build the weapon?

50
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,387
The materials we need are already here

51
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,748
in the crates outside.

52
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:09,406
Dr. Wong has been experimenting

53
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:11,585
with the dwarf star particles
since leaving Hong Kong.

54
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,359
He's designed schematics for the build.

55
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,551
Schematics? Why does that make me think

56
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:17,825
that this Dr. Wong guy won't
actually build this thing?

57
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,149
We're counting on you for that.

58
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:22,074
- Say again?
- The device is powered by plutonium.

59
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,156
Dinah, Roy, and Rene
are on their way here

60
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:25,378
with samples from Star City.

61
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:26,643
So my mission was part of this?

62
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,900
All of our missions are a part of this.

63
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,556
With all due respect,

64
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,988
what am I doing back on Lian Yu?

65
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,729
In the past few days,
the island has seen

66
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:41,061
a rash of energy spikes.

67
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:43,302
Is that your reason for it being green?

68
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:45,185
Because the last time that I was here,

69
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,059
Adrian chase blew it up.

70
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,166
Yes. Harnessing that energy is the key,

71
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,751
and we need to do it right away because

72
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:53,180
we have no idea how long
the energy spikes will last.

73
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:54,571
Okay, wait. So we...

74
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:56,722
build this magic weapon
for the space god

75
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:58,500
and we stop Crisis?

76
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,267
There is no stopping Crisis.

77
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,705
Well, then what's the weapon for?

78
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,063
I don't know,

79
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,390
but Novu said this is how we survive it,

80
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:07,608
and I believe him.

81
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:09,566
If we can't stop Crisis...

82
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:15,836
Sorry.

83
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,912
What is he talking about?

84
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:20,854
Oh, my God.

85
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,424
Would the group mind if I
had a moment with my kids?

86
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,334
Of course.

87
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:37,285
There's no easy way to say this.

88
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:41,096
Mar Novu has seen my fate.

89
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:43,682
I don't survive Crisis.

90
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:46,431
- What do you mean?
- I mean that he told me

91
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:49,183
what would happen to me
the day that he walked in

92
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,540
and asked for my help.

93
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,146
And when exactly were you
planning on telling us?

94
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:57,355
I've been fighting my fate
because of the two of you,

95
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,257
and I can't fight it, I can't change it.

96
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,597
So you're just giving up?

97
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:06,490
I am attempting to save the multiverse,

98
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:10,771
and I'm trying to keep
the two of you safe.

99
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:12,435
We're gonna build the weapon,

100
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,164
we're gonna finish this mission,

101
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:17,575
and that's the way that it has to be.

102
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:20,982
Well, then I guess we better get to it.

103
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:32,908
Lyla, what happened to no
more secrets between us?

104
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,415
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,386
So you thought tranqing
me and bringing me here

106
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,632
of all places was somehow
a better explanation.

107
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,738
Mar Novu made it clear that silence was

108
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,506
a requirement of the mission.

109
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,074
We couldn't risk interfering

110
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:48,659
with the journeys of the other players.

111
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:51,950
As in Oliver's journey
ending in a death sentence?

112
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,287
What did Novu ask you to do, Lyla?

113
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:56,156
He didn't give me details.

114
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:59,176
He just told me that
when the time comes,

115
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:00,854
I would know what to do.

116
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,757
You're just fine with that? Why?

117
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:05,325
Faith.

118
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:14,311
You remember that IED that took
out my unit in Afghanistan.

119
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,233
I remember that. Of course I do.

120
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,411
You were the only survivor.

121
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:21,742
Took you years to stop having
nightmares about that blast.

122
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,541
Mar Novu when he first came to me,

123
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,696
he told me he rescued me that day...

124
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:28,849
because I have a greater purpose.

125
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,089
- And you believed him?
- A grown man in costume

126
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,424
prophesizing the apocalypse?

127
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,244
I thought it was a joke,

128
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:36,468
but then he came to me again,

129
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,309
and he showed me...

130
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,531
us, our future...

131
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:48,300
just... wiped away,
gone as if it never existed.

132
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:50,672
So you made a deal with him?

133
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,339
We would work together to find heroes

134
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:54,354
strong enough to face this Crisis.

135
00:05:56,768 --> 00:06:00,414
He told me it was the only way
I could protect our family.

136
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:09,525
Lyla, you may have accepted that this
was the only way to move forward,

137
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:12,659
but I have not.

138
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:16,412
I won't.

139
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:29,610
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
the Black Canary knows how to fly.

140
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:33,004
Flying's easy. Landing's the hard part.

141
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,540
Kidding.

142
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:39,065
There it is...

143
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:40,888
Purgatory.

144
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,224
Looks a little less bombed
out than I remember.

145
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,678
Wow. After everything I've
heard about this place,

146
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:47,227
I didn't imagine it to be so...

147
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:48,652
Terrifying?

148
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:49,930
Beautiful.

149
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,932
Makes sense you'd think so

150
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:53,800
since apparently you're moving here.

151
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:55,492
Maybe not.

152
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:58,258
This time around, you
are part of a team.

153
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:01,411
Island team, do you copy?

154
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:04,087
We are 5 miles south and
inbound for landing. Over.

155
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,549
We copy. Island team will meet you

156
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:07,247
at the airstrip to unload. Over.

157
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:09,483
No wind to speak of. Looks like we're in

158
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:11,296
for a relatively smooth landing.

159
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:14,108
Hang on.

160
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,618
Hang on. What the hell is that?

161
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:17,977
Something's wrong.

162
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,384
Hey. Is everything all right up there?

163
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:22,009
We're picking up...

164
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,079
Something's incoming.

165
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,537
Did she say, "incoming"?

166
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:28,607
Dinah, are you there? Can you read me?

167
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:29,654
Can you read me?

168
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,171
Oh, my God.

169
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,926
Brace for emergency landing.

170
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:35,217
Hold on!

171
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,914
They're not gonna make it.

172
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:43,944
We need to find the crash site.

173
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,532
I'm working as fast as I can.

174
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:47,437
I can't get in contact with
Roy, Rene, or Dinah.

175
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,861
Something keeps blocking my signal.

176
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,074
Not something, someone.
Whoever shot down that plane.

177
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,939
You should have told
us we weren't alone.

178
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,007
I thought we were.

179
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,833
I had A.R.G.U.S.
sweep the entire island.

180
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,987
Okay. I just got the coordinates,

181
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,796
but the plutonium landed
in a different spot.

182
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:02,258
There's a tracker in the case,

183
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,045
but it's nowhere near
Rene, Dinah, or Roy.

184
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,430
The people are the priority.

185
00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:07,334
Well, obviously, but we
still need the plutonium

186
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,358
to build the weapon.

187
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,818
All right. John, let's split up.

188
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:12,003
I'll run point on the rescue.

189
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,056
Connor, you're with me.

190
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:14,455
I'm coming, too.

191
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:16,313
I called them here. This is on me.

192
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:18,298
Whatever the 3 of you
do, just be careful.

193
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:20,402
We don't know who these
people are or what they want.

194
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,531
Copy that.

195
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:25,513
And I guess that means,
what, the 3 of us,

196
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,103
we are on nuclear weapon duty?

197
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,478
I'm staying here.

198
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,015
Are you okay with that?

199
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:34,994
Someone needs to protect William.

200
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,464
Gee. Thanks.

201
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,712
It's fair.

202
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,073
Thank you.

203
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,891
William synched this map to
the plutonium's location.

204
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,623
It's gonna get us close to the case,

205
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,247
but the coordinates won't be exact,

206
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:55,496
so we're gonna have to sweep the area.

207
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:57,763
Well, the sooner we find it, the better

208
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,468
because I am not a fan of this island.

209
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:03,694
Yeah? Well, it has
that effect on people.

210
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:07,174
You know, I, uh... I never expected

211
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,745
to be on a mission with
you like this, you know.

212
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,336
I'm glad you're here.

213
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,502
No offense, but shouldn't
this Kodak moment

214
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,561
be with you and someone else?

215
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:20,767
- What?
- You and Mia.

216
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,903
Oh. Trying to give her a little space.

217
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,168
Sure you're not trying to
avoid a difficult conversation?

218
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:27,352
I'm pretty sure she doesn't
want to talk to me, Laurel.

219
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:29,781
Oliver, don't be an idiot, okay?

220
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,484
All that girl wants to do
is live up to her father.

221
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,321
Fine. All this father wants
is to complete this mission

222
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:39,691
so that my kids actually
have a world to live in.

223
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,355
We are almost there. Come on.

224
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,663
Oliver.

225
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:45,680
A piece of advice.

226
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:47,448
Don't leave this island
with more regrets

227
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:49,422
than you already have buried here.

228
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:57,742
Oh. Building this weapon with
2019 tech may actually kill me.

229
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,400
I miss the future.

230
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,970
What's this?

231
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:09,721
Those are very volatile
dwarf star particles

232
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:13,218
that could level an
entire city or island.

233
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:16,610
All right. What can I do to help, huh?

234
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:19,470
Well, do you know how to
calculate the volume of a sphere?

235
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,751
4/3 pi times radius cubed.

236
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:24,628
I was raised by Felicity, too, remember?

237
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:25,653
Right.

238
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,771
Well, do you know what the
Pauli exclusion principle

239
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:28,858
of quantum physics is?

240
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,348
Didn't pay that much attention.

241
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:32,573
Well, then that pretty much
takes you out of the running

242
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,130
of helping me in any meaningful way.

243
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,681
Damn. I'm gonna need a wire stripper.

244
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:39,734
These are the most complicated coding

245
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,279
and design sequences I have ever seen,

246
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,705
and I'm including 2040
when I say, "ever".

247
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:52,148
It's not like you to
hide out in the bunker

248
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,318
and miss out on all the action.

249
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:57,281
Still mad at Dad?

250
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,286
It's his life.

251
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:05,361
He can do whatever he
wants with it, right?

252
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:06,993
Always has.

253
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:09,096
You're being a bit
harsh, don't you think?

254
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,338
And you are being a bit
chill, don't you think?

255
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:15,069
I was right all along.

256
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:18,764
Yeah. He has always been a hero first

257
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:20,639
and a dad second.

258
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,412
We never should have trusted him.

259
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,479
- Mia.
- I'm getting your wire stripper.

260
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:31,277
I'm sorry our first
meeting had to be this.

261
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,677
I envisioned getting to know
my future son over a meal,

262
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:37,015
not en route to a plane crash.

263
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,175
This...

264
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:40,621
this feels about right for our family.

265
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,433
Most of our milestones got interrupted

266
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,798
by some sort of international
emergency or another.

267
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:46,743
Yeah. I guess your dad
and I weren't really there

268
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,162
for you and J.J.

269
00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:50,760
You were there when it counted.

270
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:53,864
Besides, I was beyond
proud to be the son

271
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:56,320
of the two superspies that
co-founded Knightwatch.

272
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:58,046
You never mentioned that.

273
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,889
I think maybe I wasn't supposed to.

274
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:02,970
Time travel rules and all.

275
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:04,995
Have to assume that the
timelines are different now

276
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:07,561
unless you remember your
mother being in league

277
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:09,342
with a evil deity.

278
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:12,362
Mar Novu is not evil.

279
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:15,307
Our friends' plane got
shot out of the sky, Lyla.

280
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:17,422
How do you know that wasn't
part of his cosmic plan?

281
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:19,091
And don't say faith.

282
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,673
Because I'm fresh out.

283
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:25,672
Okay, okay.

284
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:26,897
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

285
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,711
You guys okay?

286
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:29,927
I think so.

287
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,392
We have no idea where Roy is.

288
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,986
Okay. You are definitely not okay.

289
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,440
We cannot let this get infected.

290
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,185
You guys keep searching.
I'll take Rene back

291
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,129
- and get him fixed up.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

292
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,503
- We need to find Roy.
- Where? Where?

293
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:41,827
This way.

294
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:46,750
Laurel, I found it!

295
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:51,935
Laurel!

296
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,225
Let her go.

297
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,384
I'm afraid he can't do that.

298
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:08,679
Hello, Oliver.

299
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,270
Fyers.

300
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,664
- You're dead.
- What?

301
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:16,176
Seems I've been given
a new lease on life,

302
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:18,917
though this time I'll be
sure to finish the job.

303
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:31,720
Drop your weapon.

304
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:36,902
Drop... your weapon!

305
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:53,761
Friends of yours?

306
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:55,844
Edward Fyers and Billy Wintergreen.

307
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,395
They were on the island
when I first got here,

308
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,000
and they're both dead.

309
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:01,468
So now we're fighting ghosts?

310
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:02,604
How is that even possible?

311
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:04,839
- Get this to William.
- Where are you going?

312
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:05,926
I have to go after Fyers.

313
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,412
Or you come with me,

314
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:08,747
and we finish this weapon

315
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:10,907
and get the hell off
this nightmare island.

316
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,186
Fyers is my mess.

317
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:14,269
He's a mercenary that
I fought and I killed.

318
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:15,413
He clearly wants revenge,

319
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,905
and makes him my responsibility.

320
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:20,537
All right. I'll be back
as soon as I can.

321
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:44,485
_

322
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:47,041
Yao Fei?

323
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:55,997
- Are you real?
- As real as the men you hunt.

324
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:57,345
Why'd you try to shoot me?

325
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,803
Like the first time.

326
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,381
To keep you from danger.

327
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:02,872
No one can keep me from
danger. Okay? Not even you.

328
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:04,828
Because you are fated to die?

329
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,569
There are forces at play

330
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:08,894
that want you to not succeed.

331
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:10,802
Fyers and his men know about the weapon,

332
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,386
and they want to use it for themselves.

333
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:16,243
All right. Well, who
else has, um, returned?

334
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:18,393
Only those who were with
you from the beginning,

335
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:21,622
but you must not let the evil
that tempted you at the start

336
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,620
distract you at the end.

337
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:26,574
He's coming after more than my
mission, Yao Fei, you understand?

338
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,822
I'm not gonna let that happen.

339
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:31,599
Last time you tried to do
alone did not end well.

340
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:33,543
I'm not that person anymore.

341
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:35,905
I will hope.

342
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,635
- Roy!
- Roy!

343
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,787
Roy!

344
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,976
There!

345
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:48,987
Roy!

346
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,767
I can't... I can't move!

347
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:54,007
Roy, we're gonna get you out of here.

348
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:55,087
His arm is pinned.

349
00:15:55,112 --> 00:15:57,518
- Can you feel anything?
- No, no.

350
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,573
We got a problem. Fuel.

351
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:05,223
Okay. We got to get him out of here

352
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:06,581
before this whole thing blows.

353
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,063
Let's get this off of him, okay?

354
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:10,337
- Yeah.
- 1, 2, 3, lift!

355
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:15,539
How bad is it?

356
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:17,744
Tell me!

357
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,170
Your arm is crushed.

358
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:22,124
If you can't feel it, then
that means pretty badly.

359
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,318
If we can't move what is pinning you,

360
00:16:24,343 --> 00:16:26,583
then we need to start thinking
about other contingencies.

361
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,154
What are we talking about here?

362
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,926
We don't have much time.

363
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,218
The best way to get Roy out

364
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:34,115
might be amputation.

365
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:35,623
Can you do that?

366
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:37,208
I have a med kit in my pack back there.

367
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:38,265
It'll have what I need.

368
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,160
If we can just move
this off of him, okay,

369
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,559
we have a chance at saving his arm.

370
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,944
I mean, the odds aren't very good.

371
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,554
We owe it to him to keep trying!

372
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:46,859
Just move this thing, all right?

373
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,141
Let's go!

374
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:52,757
- Dinah.
- I'm gonna check it out.

375
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:56,183
Yeah. All right. Look.
Let's try to find a lever

376
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,338
to help get this off of him, okay?

377
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:01,142
Roy, just hang tight.
We'll be right back.

378
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:09,359
Oh, good. You're not dead.

379
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,367
Or maybe I spoke too soon.

380
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:15,627
Rene is injured but okay.

381
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,782
Roy's in a bad spot.

382
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,379
Well, we're all gonna be there with him

383
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,169
if... if we don't keep moving.

384
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:23,619
Sounds like you found the
guys who shot down our plane.

385
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,374
Oliver's old island enemies.

386
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,142
They've been dead for the last 12 years.

387
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,675
Heh heh. Of course they have.

388
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:31,420
Where is Oliver?

389
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:33,024
He went after them,

390
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,863
made me the radioactive material mule.

391
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,187
Let's go.

392
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:41,884
1, 2, 3!

393
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,644
Damn it!

394
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,174
It's not moving.

395
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,599
It's got to be caught on something,

396
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:50,783
a root system or something.

397
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,048
All right. Then we dig him out.

398
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,289
- We dig him out.
- We have to hurry.

399
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:54,803
Guys, we're about to have company

400
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:56,552
- and not the good kind.
- We can hold them off!

401
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,616
The fuel's about to spark,
John. We don't have time.

402
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,635
We can trench it, Dinah!

403
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,941
- Dad, we are out of options!
- We are not out of options!

404
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:03,845
- I don't accept that!
- We don't have a choice!

405
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,180
We always have a choice, Connor.

406
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:06,721
Then I'll make it.

407
00:18:07,268 --> 00:18:10,985
Do it. Just... cut me free.

408
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:13,694
No. No, Roy.

409
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,287
John, it's better my arm than our lives.

410
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:24,247
Get the kit. Get the kit.

411
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:28,056
Laurel and I will distract them.

412
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:29,856
Here. You apply the tourniquet.

413
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,347
I'll get ready.

414
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:35,807
Just hold on, okay? Just hold on.

415
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,424
Okay.

416
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,128
This will be over fast.

417
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:49,614
Am I gonna feel it?

418
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:51,385
Probably.

419
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,230
I'm with you, Roy. I'm with you, okay?

420
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:55,954
You ready?

421
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,717
Do it!

422
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:00,077
Hyah!

423
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,347
Fyers' camp is just ahead.

424
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:07,506
We should not be back here.

425
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:09,206
You don't have to help, Yao Fei.

426
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,787
I help for Shado.

427
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,148
I'm sorry I couldn't save her.

428
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:16,809
You know the bond now
between a father and a child.

429
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:19,637
I do. It's exactly why I
have to put Fyers down.

430
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:21,227
Should be right up here.

431
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:23,952
They're gone.

432
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:25,337
Okay. That doesn't make any sense.

433
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:26,634
He should be here.

434
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:36,331
Fyers knew you'd come here.

435
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:38,967
Well, now he's free and clear to
attack my friends and my family.

436
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:40,332
We need to get out of here.

437
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,350
How?

438
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,461
Use your bow?

439
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,711
It's pinned.

440
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:49,611
All right. Well...

441
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,995
We will have to cut our way out.

442
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:54,137
The net is made of braided steel.

443
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,139
- That blade won't cut.
- It'll cut.

444
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,189
I got you, I got you.

445
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:02,933
What the hell happened?

446
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,798
His arm got pinned
underneath the landing gear.

447
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:05,831
We had to amputate.

448
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,416
I'm sure you did what you needed to do.

449
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,337
- Roy?
- William.

450
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:11,722
Not sure it's really a good
time for a meet and greet.

451
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:12,811
Is Oliver back yet?

452
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,276
We thought he was with you.

453
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,990
No. He went after the
bad guys on his own.

454
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,230
- Why would you let him do that?
- Seriously?

455
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:19,543
We have to go after him.

456
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:22,053
No. No. William has
to finish the weapon.

457
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:23,428
I don't care about your weapon!

458
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:25,373
Oliver knows this island
better than anyone, Mia.

459
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:25,964
He'll be fine.

460
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:27,733
Plus it's smarter for
us to stick together.

461
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,877
No. We are not leaving him out there.

462
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:31,125
Mia!

463
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:33,977
Fine. I'll go on my own!

464
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:37,799
- This is a bad idea.
- Then don't come with me.

465
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:39,897
You heard Laurel. We
should stick together.

466
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,282
- It's smarter tactically.
- Are you really gonna lecture me

467
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,530
on tactics right now?

468
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:45,783
Well... no, but...

469
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:48,043
Dig is right.

470
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,274
I mean, Dad and this
island, they go way back,

471
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:51,902
and he knows every inch of this place.

472
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,935
You going out there
could make things worse.

473
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,500
I'll take my chances.

474
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,557
Get out of my way.

475
00:20:58,449 --> 00:20:59,941
William.

476
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,978
Look. It is okay for you
to be afraid of losing him,

477
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,024
especially after the way
that you left things.

478
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:08,689
You don't know what
you're talking about.

479
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:11,115
This is exactly what
happened with Felicity.

480
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,421
You were angry with her, but
you still wanted to save her.

481
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:16,211
I'm not just gonna sit
here and do nothing, okay?

482
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:19,112
I will not leave him
alone out there. I...

483
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:21,805
I will not...

484
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,353
let him die.

485
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,725
I let myself believe for just...

486
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:31,284
Just a minute that I could
actually have my dad.

487
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:36,551
Look. When I was a kid, I spent
a lot of time pushing him away...

488
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:39,960
because I never thought
that I could lose him,

489
00:21:40,722 --> 00:21:42,088
and then he disappeared.

490
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,946
Yeah. Now we might lose him again.

491
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:47,136
- How are you so calm about this?
- I'm not, but...

492
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:49,941
When I was little, Felicity
had me down in that bunker

493
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,609
watching Dad out in the field,

494
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:54,383
and I saw that he could cheat
death more than anyone,

495
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:57,124
but if this really is the end,

496
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:02,673
I don't want to waste the time that
I have left with him being angry.

497
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:05,016
Do you?

498
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:12,890
I was wrong. You haven't changed.

499
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,725
Still that impatient boy I found.

500
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,390
You realize that
insulting me is not gonna

501
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:17,984
make this go any faster, right?

502
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,246
Breathe.

503
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:21,398
Remember in everything, breathe.

504
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,670
I'm trying to...

505
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:25,435
...cut my way out of a net,
Yao Fei, not shoot an arrow.

506
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,961
We wouldn't be in this
net if you had breathed.

507
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,353
You know what Fyers
is capable of, right?

508
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:32,209
I need to get back to my family,

509
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:33,844
and I'm running out of time.

510
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:35,402
You could be with your family,

511
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:36,692
but you chose here instead.

512
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:39,074
I chose to protect them.

513
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:42,293
You avoid them because
you're fated to die.

514
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:45,186
I've been fighting that
fate for a long time.

515
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,825
I've accepted it.

516
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,003
That hasn't made things any easier.

517
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:53,030
What am I supposed to say to my kids?

518
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:54,895
What I could not to Shado.

519
00:22:56,002 --> 00:22:57,642
You say good-bye.

520
00:22:58,473 --> 00:23:00,502
I don't think that I can.

521
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,143
My kids have spent basically

522
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:08,296
their entire lives without me.

523
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:13,820
And they're about to have
to do it all over again.

524
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:15,400
You think you have failed.

525
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:17,293
The first thing that you taught me...

526
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:19,578
Shengcún, survive.

527
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:23,249
Well, I can't do that anymore.

528
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,340
Shengcún is more than body.

529
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,961
It is spirit, what lives on

530
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:30,923
like I did in Shado,

531
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:32,464
like she does in you.

532
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:35,015
That is survive.

533
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:37,379
How do I do that?

534
00:23:37,404 --> 00:23:39,125
You live now,

535
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:41,253
with your children,

536
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,224
with the time you have left.

537
00:23:47,182 --> 00:23:49,484
I need to get out of this net first.

538
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,153
Always have patience.

539
00:23:56,906 --> 00:24:00,647
Like I said, patience.

540
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:03,158
Huh!

541
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:12,111
Just came by to check on
you. How you feeling?

542
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:13,914
I... I've been better.

543
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:21,121
I'm so sorry, Roy.

544
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:24,490
I should have found
another way to get you out.

545
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:26,777
This wasn't your fault.

546
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:29,678
Yeah. Well, that's where you're wrong.

547
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:34,577
I mean, you wouldn't
even be in this situation

548
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,462
if I hadn't come to
find you in Hub City.

549
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:42,444
Roy...

550
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,378
I can't protect the people I care about.

551
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:48,389
You know I worked with you and
Oliver for a really long time,

552
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,516
and if I've learned anything,
it's that this team

553
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:55,403
has each other's backs
no matter the cost.

554
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,707
Things just didn't
exactly go as planned.

555
00:24:58,732 --> 00:24:59,931
That's an understatement.

556
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,989
No, but I would rather be here.

557
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:04,928
I would rather be here with you

558
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:07,053
and with the team than back in Hub City,

559
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:08,735
living a life all alone.

560
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:14,207
Heroes make sacrifices, John,

561
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:16,758
and for better or for worse,

562
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,474
this just had to be mine.

563
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:30,187
John... we got a problem.

564
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:31,857
Fyers and his men have
surrounded the camp.

565
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:33,314
We can expect an attack any minute.

566
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,779
How long before the weapon is ready?

567
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:36,723
I'm done building it. Once
the plutonium finishes

568
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:38,500
transferring the energy,
I can turn it on.

569
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:41,396
- How long will that take?
- I'm not sure.

570
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:43,167
Can we take this to a
safer part of the island

571
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,869
- and finish it there?
- No, no. It has to be here.

572
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:46,704
I've tapped into the center
of the island's energy.

573
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:48,448
- We can't move.
- And it has to be tonight.

574
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:50,073
We don't know when the next energy spike

575
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:51,597
will be, and we can't afford to wait.

576
00:25:51,622 --> 00:25:53,449
We need to buy William more time.

577
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,199
Dad, you're okay.

578
00:25:57,224 --> 00:26:00,288
Yeah. An old friend steered me back.

579
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:01,935
I'm sorry that I took off.

580
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,637
Should have been here
with the two of you.

581
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,311
You're here now.

582
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:07,790
How are we supposed to
beat an army of ghosts?

583
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,650
Power up the device.

584
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:13,081
The sphere's absorbing
the energy of the island,

585
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:14,322
and if that's what brought

586
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:16,387
these dead people back to
life in the first place...

587
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:18,770
Activating the device will destroy them.

588
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:20,677
We're talking about plutonium here.

589
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:22,162
That's nasty stuff. It can take out

590
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:24,125
this entire island, us included!

591
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,390
If this is our best chance
of surviving the Crisis,

592
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:27,644
then we need to take the risk.

593
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,654
Lyla's right. She's right.

594
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,896
This is it.

595
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:34,222
This is our best shot.

596
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:37,773
Suit up.

597
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:47,696
You are as foolish as ever, Queen.

598
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:49,418
Surrender!

599
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:53,017
I suppose that means you're
not here to surrender to me.

600
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,009
I'm the one who killed you, Fyers.

601
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:57,277
I'm very pleased to return the favor,

602
00:26:57,302 --> 00:27:00,359
a task you've made much
easier by coming alone.

603
00:27:00,522 --> 00:27:02,241
I'm not alone.

604
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,267
Now that the plutonium has
transferred the energy,

605
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:23,452
all I have to do is power it on,

606
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:25,175
and voilà!

607
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:29,725
It doesn't look on.

608
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,967
- Why isn't it working?
- I have no idea.

609
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:35,103
It doesn't matter how
many people you have.

610
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:37,479
The outcome is the same.

611
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,004
Kill them!

612
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:45,725
William, we're running out of time.

613
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,210
Okay. I think I have something.

614
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:48,871
There was a double
helix genetic sequence

615
00:27:48,896 --> 00:27:50,110
in Dr. Wong's formula.

616
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,175
I thought it was an error,

617
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:53,360
but now I think the device
can only be powered on

618
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:55,710
using a specific DNA code.

619
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:01,076
Oliver.

620
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:04,107
Oliver, we need you back
here to activate the device.

621
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:06,640
Oliver, you got to go!

622
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:12,016
Yao Fei, if this works...

623
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,963
We will part again, but the
dead are never really gone.

624
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:18,465
I've got your 6.

625
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:03,336
They're not gonna be able to
hold them off much longer.

626
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,179
We need to hurry.

627
00:29:04,204 --> 00:29:05,205
The sphere is touch-activated.

628
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:07,069
It'll turn on the moment
you pick it up, and...

629
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:08,893
I don't know what happens after that.

630
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:10,554
Okay.

631
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,951
Wow. That was anticlimactic.

632
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:22,152
- What the hell?
- What? What is it?

633
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,011
Dad's DNA doesn't match the
algorithm's specified sequence.

634
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:27,109
Does that mean we can't turn it on?

635
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,594
You can't...

636
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:31,445
But she can.

637
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:34,236
What are you talking about?

638
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:36,328
The DNA sequence isn't Dad's.

639
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:37,983
It's yours.

640
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,913
Is it me, or is this not going well?

641
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:47,153
We got to buy them some time.

642
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:52,425
God, I hate this island!

643
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,284
Might as well go out with a bang.

644
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:59,916
I thought this weapon was supposed
to help us survive Crisis.

645
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:02,198
That's what Novu told me.

646
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:04,693
Does this mean you're the weapon?

647
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:07,744
Johnny...

648
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:12,059
I understand why you have to do this.

649
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:54,347
Lyla, are you all right?

650
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,250
I have to go.

651
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:20,438
Hey, guys. I just, uh...

652
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:21,783
I just connected with A.R.G.U.S.,

653
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:23,584
and Lyla organized a rescue boat

654
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,209
before everything happened.

655
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,343
Should be here any minute, so...

656
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:30,215
So, we're all going home.

657
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,071
Did Mom... did she know what
was gonna happen to her?

658
00:31:35,096 --> 00:31:37,661
No. No. She was just as
surprised as the rest of us.

659
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:39,728
Novu just loves surprises, doesn't he?

660
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:42,207
Whatever Mar Novu has planned for Lyla,

661
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,996
she can handle it.

662
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:47,270
How much time do we have,

663
00:31:47,477 --> 00:31:49,477
before the Crisis?

664
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:52,552
Not long.

665
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:56,866
Should, um, probably finish packing,

666
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:59,407
before the boat arrives.

667
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:02,308
Agreed. No more island vacations.

668
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,154
Uh, hey, guys.

669
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:10,293
Listen. I just wanted to...

670
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:13,758
I wanted to thank both of you

671
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:17,322
for just being there
for me no matter what.

672
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:19,810
Why does this sound
like a good-bye speech?

673
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:22,693
Pass. Do not accept.

674
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:26,056
This ain't over till it's over, Oliver.

675
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,350
Come on.

676
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,694
Hey.

677
00:32:50,977 --> 00:32:52,663
I don't really know what to say.

678
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:55,172
I'm really happy that you're
back with the team, and...

679
00:32:56,537 --> 00:32:58,102
I'm really sorry.

680
00:32:58,696 --> 00:33:00,465
I'll be okay.

681
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:04,638
Plus, Dig's gonna set me up with one
of those fancy A.R.G.U.S. doctors.

682
00:33:04,663 --> 00:33:06,911
Uh, the boat's almost ready.

683
00:33:06,936 --> 00:33:08,076
We good down here?

684
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:09,441
Yeah. We should go.

685
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:12,778
Oh. Uh, almost forgot.

686
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:16,663
This is what led me
here in the future...

687
00:33:17,947 --> 00:33:21,315
to you and, uh, to the team.

688
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:23,432
Thought you might like it back.

689
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,514
I don't need it.

690
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,177
Plus, I think it should
stay in the family.

691
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:36,974
You know, when Felicity gave this to me,

692
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,188
she told me it was a
symbol of reconnection.

693
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,397
- She was right.
- She normally is.

694
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:46,854
No. You keep it.

695
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:49,896
William, what you were able to do,

696
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:51,917
you're a hero.

697
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:55,862
Well, I had a pretty good example.

698
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:58,329
It means a lot to me

699
00:33:58,354 --> 00:34:00,972
that I've had a chance to...

700
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:04,160
to see the type of man you've become.

701
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,353
I hope you'll forgive me

702
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,959
for... lots of things eventually.

703
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,305
Dad, I already have.

704
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,694
I mean, I know for you
I only left a year ago.

705
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,952
For me, it's been 20 years,

706
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:19,398
and back then when I was a kid,

707
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:21,955
I didn't understand what it meant

708
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,856
to fight for something
bigger than yourself,

709
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:26,423
but now I do,

710
00:34:27,706 --> 00:34:29,639
and I'm really proud of you, Dad.

711
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:31,642
Not as proud as I am of you.

712
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,091
- I'm gonna hug you now.
- You better.

713
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:55,115
Thinking about where Lyla went?

714
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,449
Can't think about anything else.

715
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,160
I know this is a
sacrifice she has to make

716
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,177
for the multiverse.

717
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:07,601
I feel like I'm always
asking you favors.

718
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:09,873
Anything you need, Oliver, always.

719
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,956
I need those kids back in 2040,

720
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:18,399
somehow, some way before
whatever's gonna happen happens.

721
00:35:18,424 --> 00:35:20,296
Yeah. I was thinking
about the same thing.

722
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:22,728
I'll make sure they get home safe.

723
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,445
One more thing.

724
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,073
When this is over,

725
00:35:27,098 --> 00:35:29,576
track down Felicity and...

726
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:32,809
Just tell her that I don't want...

727
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:38,546
Mia and William kept separated.

728
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:42,868
I think that they deserve
to grow up with each other.

729
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:45,880
I'll tell her.

730
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:46,913
Yeah.

731
00:35:47,496 --> 00:35:50,841
You know, Oliver, I once
told you a long time ago

732
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:54,921
that a soldier never lets a
brother go into battle alone.

733
00:35:57,628 --> 00:36:00,251
I think that's why it was so
hard for me to accept the idea

734
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:03,667
that you weren't gonna
make it out of this.

735
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:06,702
I felt like I'd be failing you.

736
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:10,485
You could never fail me, John.

737
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:14,799
I'm gonna stick by your side

738
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:16,673
for as long as I can,

739
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:19,097
but I know you have to do this alone.

740
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,615
Every mission has an end.

741
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:24,984
I wish this one didn't.

742
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:30,269
I couldn't have done any of this,

743
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:34,883
any of it without you.

744
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:37,662
You've always been my rock.

745
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:39,327
Don't mean the best
man you've ever known?

746
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:41,084
I also mean that.

747
00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:54,244
Hey. Let's get out of here, man.

748
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,709
Don't want to keep the boat waiting.

749
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:57,085
I'll be right behind you.

750
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,810
One more thing I got to do.

751
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,733
Hey.

752
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,161
Hey.

753
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:23,501
Um, William said I might find you here.

754
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:25,926
Figured you'd be the
first one on the boat.

755
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:30,322
You okay?

756
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:35,197
My whole life...

757
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:37,698
I heard nothing but stories about you,

758
00:37:38,086 --> 00:37:41,525
you know, this legendary
Green Arrow and his team.

759
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:45,346
I should have been proud of you,

760
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,589
because you were a hero, and...

761
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:53,330
All I could see is that that is

762
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,355
the reason that you weren't with me,

763
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:59,587
and it's... it's kind of
hard to let that go.

764
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:04,727
I never meant to cause you any pain.

765
00:38:07,136 --> 00:38:09,603
Your mom and me just
wanted to protect you.

766
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:10,933
I know.

767
00:38:11,861 --> 00:38:14,325
I, uh... I understand that now.

768
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,364
For a very long time,

769
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,752
I have hated this place.

770
00:38:22,777 --> 00:38:26,245
Just I'd think about all the
people that it took from me.

771
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:30,089
It would just... It would
just make me so angry.

772
00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:33,138
But you're not now?

773
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:35,030
I'm still a little bit angry.

774
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:39,666
This island taught me to survive.

775
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:42,059
It turned me into someone else,

776
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:45,644
somebody better than
the person I was before.

777
00:38:49,556 --> 00:38:51,936
So despite my feelings...

778
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:57,196
There are no stories about
the Green Arrow to tell...

779
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:01,291
if I don't make my way to Lian Yu,

780
00:39:01,316 --> 00:39:04,355
and I'm also not
standing at this moment,

781
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,444
looking at my daughter.

782
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:10,894
Thank you for letting me
be a part of your story,

783
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:15,111
even if it was only for a little while.

784
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:20,514
Mia, something tells me you're
gonna create your own stories.

785
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:34,735
So what now?

786
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,411
We need to get back home,

787
00:39:37,051 --> 00:39:39,937
and just be prepared

788
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,849
for whatever's coming next.

789
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:42,874
Okay.

790
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:54,059
Dad.

791
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,004
- Lyla?
- Not anymore.

792
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:09,389
I'm now a Harbinger of things to come.

793
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:11,356
- And that's...
- Yes.

794
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:14,109
The Crisis has begun.

795
00:40:25,996 --> 00:40:28,152
For so many years,

796
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:30,313
I've traveled across worlds...

797
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:32,608
_

798
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:35,351
across the multiverse to do one thing...

799
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,963
Kill you.

800
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:39,961
And now here...

801
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:42,468
you saved my life.

802
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:47,474
Submit and begin your life anew.

803
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:49,075
Show me.

804
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:52,431
The knowledge is within you.

805
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:42,516
_

806
00:41:43,202 --> 00:41:45,533
_
