1
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,139
Haven't you
found it yet?

2
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,141
Uh, not yet, uncle.

3
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,744
But tell me,
why am I researching

4
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:14,146
Celtic pig goddesses?

5
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,048
Do not waste time
asking questions.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,182
Read.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,184
One more thing.
Jade is--

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,519
bored!

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,754
Uncle Jackie,

10
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:23,555
when are you going to
score us a mission?

11
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,358
Jade, I am not
a secret agent.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,160
I am a researcher.

13
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,361
But do not worry.

14
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,562
When I come home,

15
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,364
we will make
a big bowl of popcorn,

16
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,468
and you can help me
proofread my notes.

17
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,770
(Dial tone)

18
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,104
Hello?

19
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,372
(Exasperated sigh)

20
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,107
Doing homework all day?

21
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,375
Somebody around here

22
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,310
must believe in
life after breakfast.

23
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,546
Gentlemen,
we have an emergency.

24
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,252
Black: Criminal mastermind
Dr. ashby necrosis is back.

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,387
Dr. necrosis,

26
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,189
the kingpin
of techno-crime?

27
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,390
The same.

28
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,792
Reports are
that he has developed

29
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,794
a cutting-edge
high-tech doomsday device.

30
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,929
The entire world
is in jeopardy.

31
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,598
We've located
what we believe to be
the doctor's base,

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,301
the necropolis,
- inside this dormant volcano.

33
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,403
Someone must infiltrate
the necropolis

34
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,806
and destroy
the doomsday weapon.

35
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:16,308
I suggest Taggart mcstone.

36
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,211
Unfortunately,
- agent tag retired last year.

37
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,580
He left the spy game
forever.

38
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,017
Never say forever.

39
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,385
Agent tag!

40
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,222
I'll require the standard
infiltration package--

41
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,924
my briefcase
and a fresh suit.

42
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,425
Italian, of course.

43
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,626
Of course.

44
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,782
Good luck, tag.

45
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,450
If I'm not back
by 8:00,

46
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,320
cancel my reservation
at Chez Louis.

47
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,467
(Vibrating)

48
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,869
Hmm. Running rough.

49
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,871
Cargo must have shifted.

50
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,508
Aah-aah-aah-aah
aah-aah-aah aah...

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,030
(Grunt)

52
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,831
510...

53
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,534
511...

54
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,635
Captain black,

55
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,671
I cannot find Jade anywhere.

56
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,239
Uhh! Whoo!

57
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,441
Good. We have a major
operation going down

58
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,443
and I can't risk
her being underfoot.

59
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,744
Yah!

60
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,079
Jade is always underfoot.

61
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,949
If she is not under my feet
and not under your feet,

62
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,685
whose feet is she under?

63
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,086
Oh, no.

64
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,921
Comm-one,

65
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,823
get me agent
Taggart mcstone.

66
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,725
Yes, sir.
Homebase to outfield.

67
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,327
Homebase to outfield.

68
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,695
Jade.

69
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,296
No can do, sir.

70
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,566
Agent tag is flying
under radio silence.

71
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,637
Hmm. 34 down, 6 letters.

72
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,772
Celtic pig goddess.

73
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,341
(Beeping)

74
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,176
Computer:
Approaching target.

75
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,444
Autopilot off.

76
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,415
Yaah!

77
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,657
Aah!

78
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,373
I spy with my little eye...

79
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,942
Something beginning with...

80
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,711
Secret base.

81
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,780
Uhh! Ooh! Uhh!

82
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,815
Uhh! Uhh!

83
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:50,922
Aw, come on.

84
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,292
How am I supposed to
keep up with that?

85
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,960
Hmm.

86
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,730
Sledding in July.

87
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,432
Cowabunga!

88
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,003
Works better with snow.

89
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,838
Wha--ohh!

90
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,940
(Jade gasping)

91
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,242
Hyah!

92
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,577
Mission log:

93
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,879
Enemy unconscious.

94
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,381
Borrowing crudely tailored
jumpsuit as a disguise.

95
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,051
Note: Orange is not my color.

96
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,453
(Gasp)

97
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,059
Whoops!
A blast!

98
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,428
Hurry!

99
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,630
Jade may be in
terrible danger!

100
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,166
I'm sure tag has
everything under control.

101
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,467
You think so?

102
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,868
No.

103
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,907
Jackie, are you sure
you want to do this?

104
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,375
I'm sure.

105
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,776
I think.

106
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:50,215
Yaaaahhh!

107
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,817
Who are you?

108
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,352
Why are you
following me?

109
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,586
Uh...

110
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,221
Captain black sent me.

111
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,224
Hmm. A little girl
with dark hair

112
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,828
who tags along
and is an obvious liar.

113
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,429
I've heard of you.

114
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,731
You're Jade.

115
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,833
Section 13
has classified you

116
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,601
as the ultimate
security risk.

117
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,770
You've jeopardized
my mission!

118
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,071
Whoa.

119
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,041
And you need to calm down,
captain blood pressure.

120
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,076
Mission log: Aborted.

121
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,712
I'll take you back
to San Francisco
at once.

122
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,847
Ohh...

123
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,983
Let go of her,
you big bully!

124
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:28,186
Jade! I'll be back!

125
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,354
Jackie?

126
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,358
Yeeaaaahhh!

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,926
(Crash)

128
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,964
(Moaning)

129
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,066
Huh? Ohh...

130
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,403
Uh-oh.

131
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,037
Jackie! No!

132
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,875
Agent tag!

133
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,009
Wake up!

134
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,310
Huh? Tag?

135
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:55,480
Now who's going to
defeat Dr. necrosis

136
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,916
and destroy
his doomsday device?

137
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,086
Uncle Jackie?

138
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,287
Oh, no.

139
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,889
Destroying
a doomsday device

140
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,590
sounds too dangerous.

141
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,093
Well, sure, if you
say it like that.

142
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,494
I told you,

143
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,897
I am not
a secret agent.

144
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,266
I am a researcher.

145
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,701
All you have to do
is save the world.

146
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,403
No.

147
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,005
I'm taking all 3 of us

148
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,973
back to section 13
right away.

149
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,524
See? This is why
we can't buy you nice things.

150
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,830
Whoopsie! Incoming!

151
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,064
Get 'em!

152
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,133
Bad day, bad day,
bad day!

153
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,409
Agent tag, please,
wake up.

154
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,112
Admit it.

155
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,683
This is better than
doing homework all day.

156
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,585
No, it is not.

157
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,299
Now--uhh!

158
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,838
Uhh--ooh! Uhh!

159
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,673
(Grunting)

160
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,035
Uhh!

161
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,172
Ooh. Careful you don't
hurt agent tag.

162
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,909
Him?! What about me?

163
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,479
Gohh--

164
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,015
uncle Jackie!

165
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,449
This way!

166
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,651
Jade, no!

167
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,053
Daahh!

168
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,788
Get him!

169
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,459
Whoaaaaa!

170
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,900
(Coughing)

171
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,272
Automated voice:
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!

172
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,942
We gotta find
that doomsday device!
Come on!

173
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,547
Ohh! Why do you refuse
to wake up?

174
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,517
All right, then.

175
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,718
Stay here.

176
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,386
Try not to attract attention.

177
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,588
Perfect.

178
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,722
Jade?

179
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,123
Jade?!

180
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,558
Ohh!

181
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,269
(Footsteps)

182
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,937
Shh! Someone's coming.

183
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,138
Jackie?

184
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,206
Jackie?

185
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,198
Whaa--

186
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,566
doomsday device.

187
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:35,934
You fools!

188
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,402
You need me!

189
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:41,339
I spent 20 years
designing the laser Cannon.

190
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,575
Huh! Last year's technology.

191
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,745
Dr. necrosis has a new
doomsday toy,

192
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,781
all packed up
and ready for transport.

193
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:50,982
Transport?

194
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,417
Loading dock.

195
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,388
Hoyle.

196
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,991
I have deduced the identity
of our intruder.

197
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,793
Taggart mcstone.

198
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,195
That wild card
still in the game?

199
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,531
But I thought
he folded last year.

200
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,400
There is no one else
it could be.

201
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,801
He is the only human

202
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,003
capable of infiltrating
my necropolis.

203
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,006
Oh, how I long
to meet my Nemesis

204
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,608
face to face.

205
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,209
You won't ruin his face,

206
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,678
will you, hoyle?

207
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,454
No promises.

208
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,924
For years he has foiled
all my techno-plans,

209
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,727
but this time
we have the druid stone,

210
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,564
and even agent tag
cannot defeat
its ancient magic.

211
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,766
The world is ours.

212
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,368
We hold all the cards.

213
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,636
We have the upper hand.

214
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,837
We--

215
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,639
we could take it
down a notch

216
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,973
on the card puns.

217
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,376
All that matters
is the druid stone.

218
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,245
It is the heart of
my new doomsday weapon.

219
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,847
Guard it well, hoyle.

220
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,216
As the doctor orders.

221
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,292
Whoa.

222
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,928
The doomsday weapon
is ancient magic?

223
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,796
This is big.

224
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,540
Uhh!

225
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,352
Ohh-whoa!

226
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,920
Jade?!

227
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,522
Jackie?

228
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,659
Stay here!

229
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,961
Stay here?

230
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,028
Tch.

231
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,196
When will he learn?

232
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,072
All right, easy.

233
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,573
Easy!

234
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,486
That is a doomsday device?

235
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,255
But it is just a rock.

236
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,322
Daahh!

237
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,027
All hands on deck,
agent tag.

238
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,428
Ohh!
Yuuh!

239
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,997
I am not agent tag!

240
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,832
Don't try to bluff me.

241
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,934
It doesn't <i> suit</i> you.

242
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:27,071
(Grunting)

243
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,876
Gahh!

244
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,746
The druid stone is secure.

245
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,648
And inform the good doctor

246
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,350
that we have
a bonus jackpot on board.

247
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,685
A certain joker

248
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,821
who claims he <i> isn't</i>
àagent tag.

249
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,998
You are not
what I expected,

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
agent tag.

251
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,002
Although your disguise
as a buffoon

252
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,138
was most convincing.

253
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,273
But I am not
agent tag.

254
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,908
I am Jackie chan,

255
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,610
a researcher.

256
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,512
Of course,
if you were agent tag,

257
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,280
you would deny it
emphatically.

258
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,316
No. I would claim
to be agent tag,

259
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,418
assuming you would not
believe me.

260
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,019
But I would anticipate
your assumption

261
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,421
that I would not
believe you.

262
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,423
I would foresee
your anticipating
my assumption

263
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,024
of your not
believing me.

264
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,327
But how could you predict
I wouldn't expect
your foreseeing

265
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,729
my anticipation of your
assuming my not believing?

266
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,432
Hah! Answer me that.

267
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,101
I do not even know
what you just said!

268
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,338
Precisely what
I expected you to say...

269
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,039
Agent tag.

270
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,711
Dr. necrosis, the druid stone
has been installed.

271
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,918
Jackie: Ohh!
It is a druid stone.

272
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,321
But a druid stone
is ancient, weak magic.

273
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,223
It is hardly
a doomsday weapon.

274
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,291
(Chuckles)

275
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,759
Ancient, yes.

276
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,762
But coupled with the world's
largest radio telescope

277
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,531
and a global satellite system,

278
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,601
it is no longer weak.

279
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,872
Aah!

280
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,210
With this remote control,

281
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,114
I can target multiple beams
to any square inch on earth.

282
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,819
Remote control, eh?

283
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,255
Time for a little
channel surfing.

284
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,343
Aah--

285
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,059
yaahhh!

286
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,867
Pick a card,
any card.

287
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,343
Thank you.

288
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,712
Uch. Dealer calls
a new game.

289
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,948
Huh?!

290
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,583
Crazy eights!

291
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,127
Uhh!

292
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:12,730
One of these has gotta
shut this puppy off.

293
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,820
Putting litter
in its place.

294
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,427
Ooh!

295
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,505
Jackie! The doctor's
making a break for it!

296
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,912
Excuse me, doctor,

297
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,981
but it hurts
when I go like this!

298
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,153
Blast you, agent tag.

299
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,287
I am not--

300
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,388
(groan)

301
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,490
Oh, never mind.

302
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,692
Mission log:
Mission accomplished.

303
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,193
Not yet.

304
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,930
We still have to retrieve
the druid stone.

305
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,163
And that's how I reached
arecibo in time

306
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,531
to rescue the chans.

307
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,766
That's why you're
our top agent, Taggart.

308
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,334
Rescue the chans?

309
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,737
We did all
the hard stuff!

310
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,338
It's all right, Jade.

311
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,406
Let it go.

312
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,375
Now, if I can finish
my crossword,

313
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,744
this day will truly
be a success.

314
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:40,945
6 letters--

315
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,947
a Celtic pig goddess.

316
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,348
(Yawns)

317
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,750
Moccas.

318
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,352
M-o-c-c-a-s.

319
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,520
Mr. chan,

320
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,089
you're a genius.

321
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,324
Jade: Nope.

322
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,359
Just a researcher.

323
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,767
Hey, Jackie.

324
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:03,834
Yes.

325
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,236
Did you ever work
with Bruce Lee?

326
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,337
Yes.

327
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,405
There's a scene.

328
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,040
I remember,
there's a scene.

329
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,174
He--it was a 2 stick.

330
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,176
I comes in, he just--phoom!

331
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,545
He hit me one stick,
then I fall down.
He just--pahh!

332
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,448
He give me one stick
right on here.

333
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,384
I was this big
with all, uh,

334
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,153
bruise going on.

335
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,955
After cut, he turn around,

336
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,990
just--"ohh! I'm sorry,
sorry. What's your name?"

337
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,992
"My name is Jackie."
"I'm sorry."

338
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,827
I said, "ok, fine, fine."
You know, stunt guy.

339
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,029
Suddenly
the stunt coordinator,

340
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:36,734
"Jackie, you continue
