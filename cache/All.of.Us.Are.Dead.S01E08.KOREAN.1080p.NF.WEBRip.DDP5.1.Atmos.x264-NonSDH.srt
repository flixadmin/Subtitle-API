1
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,610
Whoa!

2
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,004
The kids getting bullied
are a problem too.

3
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,757
Honestly, the kids must have
a reason for bullying you.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,804
Look.

5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,598
It's okay. Take it off.

6
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,433
-Hands off.
-Don't you dare move.

7
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,608
You did nothing wrong?

8
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,113
Nothing you feel bad about?

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,035
Honestly, the kids must have
a reason for bullying you.

10
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,164
PROVIDING AN EDUCATION
THAT WARMS AND STRENGTHENS LIVES

11
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,674
You know, I really wish the school
would burn down.

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,427
<i>Till nothing's left.</i>

13
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,846
So that everything will be gone.

14
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,239
Hey, Dae-su!

15
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,167
What about others? Is it really just you?

16
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,127
I'm by myself.

17
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,212
What about downstairs? In the classrooms?

18
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,297
There's no one down there. It's just me!

19
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,353
Hold tight!

20
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,481
You're sure? There's no one else, right?

21
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,608
They're all zombies.

22
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,486
There are no survivors.

23
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,031
Pull it tighter, guys.

24
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,190
Give me your eye, huh?

25
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,989
What the hell?

26
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,993
Why didn't you die?

27
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,122
{\an8}DOOR WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY
IN CASE OF FIRE

28
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,166
Guys!

29
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,417
The door's unlocked.

30
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,548
-Let's go!
-One, two, three!

31
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,845
-Look! A chopper!
-Over here!

32
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,639
-Help!
-Hey!

33
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,598
Over here!

34
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,808
We're here!

35
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,309
Help!

36
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,894
Come back!

37
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,271
-Help!
-Come back!

38
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,999
Where are you going?

39
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,583
Help!

40
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,636
Hey!

41
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,305
Over here!

42
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,767
We're here!

43
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,758
Mom…

44
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,315
Mom…

45
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,481
Fuck it.

46
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,281
He's gone.

47
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,492
What the actual fuck?

48
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,287
-Who's gone?
-Gwi-nam.

49
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,041
It's his smell.

50
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,460
<i>I hear his breathing.</i>

51
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,657
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

52
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,734
What happened?
Didn't Gwi-nam fall from the fourth floor?

53
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,943
Yeah, I threw him off.

54
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,778
So how did he manage to survive?

55
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,993
Maybe he doesn't die.
He comes back to life.

56
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,705
He's not a human or a zombie.

57
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,585
Do you remember that girl
in the teachers' office?

58
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,878
I'm gonna kill you!

59
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,380
Give it to me, you fucker! I'll kill you!

60
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,469
-Yeah, she was weird.
-He's like her, isn't he?

61
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,679
You could be right.

62
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,433
Maybe Nam-ra is the same.

63
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,187
Look, I found an "O."

64
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,981
That's what you've got?

65
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,858
She'll be okay.

66
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,194
You can't guarantee that'll happen.

67
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,073
We can't guarantee
anything right now, can we?

68
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,951
We don't even know if we're gonna live.

69
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,786
Let's go make the SOS sign.

70
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,540
Bare-su.

71
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,045
What if it were On-jo,
could you just abandon her?

72
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,265
It came and left, huh? The helicopter?

73
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,849
Mm-hm.

74
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,061
Maybe they started the rescues.
Let's get to the roof.

75
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,564
What if that's the end of the rescue?

76
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,856
Maybe it's only the beginning.

77
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,818
We don't even know if it'll come back.

78
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,778
I don't think we should try
to go up to the roof.

79
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,322
What if it does come back?
What then?

80
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,657
-Nothing.
-Yeah, right.

81
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,868
We can't make it to the roof, anyway.

82
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,913
How are we gonna carry him up there?

83
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,124
Yep.

84
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,794
-Just leave me and go.
-For real?

85
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,422
Yeah. You should just go.

86
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,091
You mean it? You know me, right?

87
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,594
I'll do it.

88
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,554
Should we?

89
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:57,972
Shouldn't we?

90
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,725
Don't act all tough.

91
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,602
There are enough crazy tough guys outside.

92
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,646
I'm not gonna die from this, am I?

93
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,691
How would I know if you'll die?

94
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,861
Anyway, I think we should put up
a sign or something outside.

95
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,196
How's anyone going to know
if we're in here and save us?

96
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,241
Doesn't this place have a roof?
Can't you just get there?

97
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,785
They'll see us on the roof.

98
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,580
Well, there is a ladder
that leads to the roof, but--

99
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,457
There is, right? Where is it?

100
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,791
-It's outside.
-Outside?

101
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,834
Yeah, outside.

102
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,299
-Motherfucker. Get over here!
-Wait, wait, wait. Why?

103
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,800
-Outside? Outside?
-Oh.

104
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:35,760
-Sorry!
-Get back here.

105
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,178
Stay back.

106
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,304
Get your ass here.

107
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,514
-I'll put you outside for five seconds!
-Help!

108
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,474
This is too big.

109
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,600
How about this?

110
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,727
-Break it apart.
-Here's a big one.

111
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,062
How's this?

112
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,855
Not that one. Put it down.

113
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,023
Not this?

114
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,484
-Grab anything big and colorful.
-Can I use this?

115
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,819
Joon-yeong, go up there and look.

116
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,863
Careful. Careful.

117
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,908
How does it look?

118
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,701
-First…
-Yes.

119
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,328
The "O," it's just too narrow.

120
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,164
He said the "O" is too narrow.
Dae-su, hand me that long one.

121
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,958
It should be
much bigger than this.

122
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,461
Nam-ra, could you carry this?

123
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,089
Guys, keep it up.

124
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,423
That goes over there.

125
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,383
It goes like this.

126
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,260
-And the "S" is way too short.
-We need one more of these.

127
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,472
-Is this enough?
-Fill that spot in too. That's it.

128
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,182
Oh, I, I got this part.

129
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,184
They're too close.

130
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,769
Hey, spread that out a little bit.

131
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,145
Let's clean it up a bit.

132
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,564
Come take a look. We did a good job, guys.

133
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,358
Look.

134
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,652
Yeah, well, there's no way
anyone can miss that.

135
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,363
-Right?
-We did do a good job.

136
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,994
It's a little crooked, though.

137
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,539

{\an8}Once the temperature went up,
the white blood cells were activated.

{\an8}But they were absorbed by the virus
and transformed into a different one.

147
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,414
Careful now.

148
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,629
The zombies…

149
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,343
Get a bite down.

150
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,472
You're doing great.

151
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,897
No, it's not broken.

152
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,651
So it'll get better soon,
just leave it like this.

153
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,028
Thanks, detective.

154
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,199
No need for formalities
in the middle of all this. Call me Jae-ik.

155
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,659
Okay.

156
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,703
Since we're stuck up here,
and we're getting to know each other,

157
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,413
can I be completely frank with you?

158
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,123
Yes, of course. Say anything you want.

159
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,291
Mm, okay.

160
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,544
-Dumbass. You're such an idiot.
-Aah! Ow!

161
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,505
You came all the way here just to shoot
some stupid Internet show?

162
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,757
You're unbelievably dumb.

163
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,927
What? Like and subscribe?
You like that more than your life?

You're one crazy stupid motherfucker.

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,348
I'm sorry, detective.

166
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,184
Don't call me detective.
I said to call me by my name.

167
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,310
It's fine, detective.

168
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,146
If you were my brother,
you wouldn't need to worry about zombies.

169
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,399
I would just beat you to death myself.

170
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,987
But someone has to uncover the real truth
and let the world know what's happening.

171
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,613
What? The truth?

172
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,741
Hey. Are you a journalist?

173
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,701
I…

174
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,912
Well, journalists don't dig hard enough
for the truth, you know?

175
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,123
That's where people like me come in.

176
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,500
Your excuses.

177
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,168
Oh.

178
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,506
It looked like your colleague
totally dumped you and took off.

179
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,300
Should I blast him on my show?

180
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,093
I can even interview you if you want.

181
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,014
-Forget it.
-You should take revenge on traitors.

182
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:50,973
Look.

183
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,101
I learned from my many years
as a detective.

184
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,895
The assholes fighting to stay alive,

185
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,689
and assholes coming at you
hoping to die can't be beaten.

186
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,066
I'm worried for the kids.

187
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,236
I have a pretty good number of followers.

188
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,071
I can cancel him socially for good.

189
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,908
-Oysterubbish.
-Orangibberish. Not Oysterubbish.

190
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,826
Who even cares? Just shut up, would you?

191
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,995
And just go pick up
everything we can throw, all right?

192
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,290
-What are you talking about?
-Why else? It's crazy hot up here.

193
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,084
You're gonna stay here
until you become human jerky and die?

194
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,795
Why is everyone I meet like this?

195
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,887
They're not moving.

196
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,848
No. The zombies follow sounds.

197
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,767
Another.

198
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,362
What are you doing?

199
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,322
You said you'd get rid of them,
not lure them in.

200
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,950
They followed sounds earlier.

201
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,577
Shit. Give me that.

202
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,371
Stop it. More keep coming.

203
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,830
I said you give it to me, asshole.

204
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,333
-I swear you're weird…
-Quick!

205
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
MUNPYEONG DAYCARE

206
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,514
Oh, my God.

207
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,308
Oh, my God.

208
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:19,979
Hey, sergeant!

209
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,814
-You traitor!
-Traitor.

210
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,151
Jump! Jump on top of the bus!

211
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,611
Jump down!

212
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,488
-I got it, asshole. Shh…
-Come on, jump!

213
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,406
-Let's go.
-What?

214
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,242
-I said let's go!
-What… But…

215
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,540
This is freaking me out.

216
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,712
Shit. That was close.

217
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,380
Hey. Jump.

218
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,549
What? I can't jump.

219
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,384
Don't give me that bullshit. Jump.

220
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,802
But I hurt my leg!

221
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,928
I know. Jump!

222
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,973
You should've just taken me with you.
Why did you jump first, huh?

223
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,892
-That's because you're slow! Come on!
-My leg is injured!

224
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,228
You want to die there,
or you want to break your leg here?

225
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,855
This is nuts.

226
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,025
But my leg hurts. What about my leg, huh?

227
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,860
-Se-bin.
-Yes?

228
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,862
Close your eyes, keep them shut.

229
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,406
Let's just go!

230
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,950
-I'll catch you… Hey, wait, wait!
-No, I can't!

231
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,535
Hold on! Stop! Stop! Stop!

232
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,120
Jump right now, asshole!

233
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,289
Damn it! Hold on. Okay. Hold on.
Just give me a second.

234
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,874
-I'll jump. Wait!
-Just leave him!

235
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,418
Can we just get going for God's sake?

236
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,377
Aim for here.

237
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,629
-Shit.
-What the hell are you doing?

238
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,176
Whoa! No! Help me! Help me, detective!

239
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,512
I mean, Jae-ik. Pull me up.
Please save me. Please.

240
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,891
All clear!

241
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,476
Here we go! Hold on tight!

242
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,102
Let's go, Ho-seong!

243
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,482
Ooh! Wait!

244
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,452
-What does SOS mean?
-It's a distress signal.

245
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,121
I know that. What does it stand for?

246
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,333
It doesn't stand for anything.
SOS is just SOS.

247
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,959
That makes no sense.

248
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,629
That's just how it is.
It doesn't mean anything.

249
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,714
Then rescue quickly…

250
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,301
Speed of save… Save?

251
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,553
Why'd you ask
if you're not gonna believe me?

252
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,138
I thought you'd know.

253
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,058
I do know. Look it up.
You'll see I'm right.

254
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,103
Whatever. How can I look it up?
I don't have a phone.

255
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,771
What?

256
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,566
I asked On-jo what SOS mean,

257
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,361
and she said it doesn't mean anything.

258
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,947
Just say you don't know next time.

259
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,240
Well, it's true.

260
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,783
It's true.

261
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,369
-Really?
-Mm-hm. She's totally right.

262
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,579
Why don't you believe her?

263
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,248
Hey, prez.

264
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,375
What does SOS mean?

265
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,918
That jerk!

266
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,128
Forget him. Let him be.

267
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,798
Is it true, though?

268
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,300
What?

269
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,221
Are you sure SOS doesn't mean anything?
Isn't it supposed to be an acronym?

270
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,349
-You don't believe me, either?
-Mm.

271
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,396
The sun's setting. Let's start a fire.

272
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,237
It's setting.

273
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,407
I think it's working.

274
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,368
I'm done.

275
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,287
-Already?
-Next.

276
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,038
All right. Let's do this.

277
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,755
You'll get tired. Slow down.

278
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,757
The fire won't start if he goes slowly.

279
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,384
Do it faster.

280
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,303
Faster. Faster. I said come on, faster!

281
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,096
Rub it faster!

282
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,848
What is it, cramps?

283
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,226
-My hands. I can't do it.
-I'll do it. Step back.

284
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,741
Hey, should we kill him?

285
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,826
Are you praying?

286
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,704
Stop praying. Try… Stop it.

287
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,999
It's hard. It won't work.

288
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,755
Isn't that smoke?

289
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,089
{\an8}-Hey. Smoke.
-Smoke!

290
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,132
Hold on.

291
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,884
{\an8}-Please. Come on.
-Blow.

292
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,469
{\an8}Come on, blow.

293
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,929
{\an8}-Be careful.
-Blow.

294
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,931
Did it work? Su-hyeok?

295
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,891
{\an8}Come on, come on.

296
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:26,808
Damn it.

297
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,227
Shit.

298
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,272
Let me try.

299
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,073
-Hey.
-You're getting there.

300
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:42,991
Hey.

301
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,789
Just use this.

302
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,128
Well, I smoke sometimes.

303
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,886
You had it this whole time.

304
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,390
You don't want it?

305
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,936
Light it.

306
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,730
MUNPYEONG DAYCARE

307
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,284
Hey, traitor.

308
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,368
A traitor.

309
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,412
I went back and saved you.

310
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,081
You took the children
and abandoned me with this freak.

311
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,667
I found this bus and came back.

312
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,169
Seriously, man, use your head.

313
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,170
Asshole.

314
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,674
-Do you have a license to drive a bus?
-Uh, no.

315
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,134
I have a regular license.

316
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,136
I swear I'll kill you once we get there.

317
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,221
Starting with driving without a license…

318
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,931
-Stop, stop, stop the bus!
-Whoa!

319
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,437
What? What was that? It's a zombie, right?

320
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,397
Since when do zombies ride bikes?

321
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,566
-Dumbass. Hey, Oyster.
-It's Orange.

322
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,692
Take the baby.

323
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful.

324
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,153
Be careful. Careful, careful.

325
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,155
Open the door.

326
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,454
You pull any shit, I'll fucking kill you.

327
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,247
If I become a zombie,
I'll go only after you.

328
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,750
-I'll bite your neck only. Got it?
-Yeah.

329
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,172
Oh, shit.

330
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,343
Excuse me.

331
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,345
Are you okay?

332
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,059
You weren't bitten or anything.

333
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,353
You're okay, right?

334
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,522
Yes, I'm okay.

335
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,610
Come with us. I'm a cop.

336
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,864
Sergeant!

337
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,993
Mr. Detective!

338
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:50,994
No, no, it's okay!

339
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,996
The soldiers are here. They're soldiers.

340
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,624
We're saved!

341
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,751
What was that?

342
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:03,965
Hey!

343
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:04,925
Don't shoot!

344
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,511
I'm a cop. Wait. I'm a cop.

345
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,347
Don't shoot! Here! Huh?

346
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:15,769
Chin down. Extend your left arm.
Don't stick out your chest too much.

347
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,521
Ooh.

348
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,939
This is so sexy, ooh.

349
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,860
-What's with the face?
-Take this seriously,

350
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:24,820
or don't do it at all.

351
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,280
Stop being so stuck up
about shooting arrows.

352
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,911
Yeah. Didn't work.

353
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,246
You thought it was easy?

354
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,832
Anything is easier than studying.

355
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,626
You can get into Seoul University
with good grades.

356
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,545
But if you're just good in archery…

357
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,547
you can't go anywhere.

358
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,592
We can't make the national team,
or get a scholarship to college.

359
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,720
There's nothing left to do.

360
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,390
Stop whining. Everyone knows
you'll make the national team.

361
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,351
You'll go to college
just by shooting arrows.

362
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,312
Damn it.

363
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,737
Are you not?

364
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,074
You didn't make the national team?
No college?

365
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,049
You won't die
if you don't go to college, you know.

366
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,929
I really love shooting arrows.

367
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,100
All I ever knew was archery.

368
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,312
I don't know what else to do.

369
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,440
As long as I could keep doing it,

370
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,942
I didn't care about colleges
or corporate teams.

371
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,237
But now I…

372
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,699
I've nowhere to go shoot my arrows.

373
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,121
I'm only 19.

374
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,750
But I feel like there's no hope.

375
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,671
If the zombies were to kill
all the archers in the country,

376
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,715
you'll automatically make
the national team.

377
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,842
You're nuts.

378
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,761
That's a good thing?

379
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,095
Hey, it's hope.

380
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,515
At least you have potential
to become something.

381
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,060
Even if I survive,
I'm not getting into college.

382
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,394
CSAT? Fuck.

383
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,105
My answers are always C or D.

384
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,107
Why are they C or D?

385
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,361
C if I'm not sure about it,
and D if I'm clueless.

386
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,989
{\an8}I swear it's like
I avoid all the right answers.

387
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,204
All right. That's enough of that.
It's time to teach me how to shoot arrows.

388
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,499
'Cause even if I totally suck,
it's better than you shooting alone.

389
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,557
Dae-su.

390
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,308
Yeah?

391
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,435
How was your audition?

392
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,480
They said I have to lose weight.

393
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,484
Well, you're a good singer.

394
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,071
Sing for us. I wanna hear it.

395
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,865
Just forget it. I don't want it.

396
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,660
I actually really like that song.

397
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
Is that so?

398
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,622
Mm-hm.

399
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,707
Really?

400
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,833
It's really nice.

401
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,419
You sing well.

402
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,296
It'll cheer us up.

403
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,850
I got to get to the rooftop, damn it.

404
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,622
<i>The police…</i>

405
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,625

00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,669

407
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,255

408
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,300
<i>All involved.</i>

409
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,344
<i>…here with some</i>
<i>of my classmates,</i>

410
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,012
<i>and they're really good to me.</i>

411
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,764
Let me just show you. This is them.

412
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,101
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

413
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,187
<i>I want a raise in allowance.</i>

414
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,775
-Is it ready to go?
-Yes.

415
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,906
<i>Music and lyrics</i>

00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,382
I'm hungry.

417
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,176
<i>How can you sing</i>
<i>at a time like this?</i>

418
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,638
<i>Doesn't it feel like everyone</i>

419
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,224
<i>Why is it final? Are we dying?</i>

420
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,978
<i>Hello.</i>

421
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,773
<i>I'm Oh Joon-yeong, business major</i>
<i>at Seoul University, class of 23.</i>

424
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,655
<i>Won't happen.</i>

425
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,156
<i>What the hell?</i>

426
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,785
<i>Mom.</i>

427
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,037
<i>It's me.</i>

428
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,164
<i>Dad, you're okay too, right?</i>

429
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,212
<i>Mom. Listen. Don't freak out, okay?</i>

430
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,008
<i>You're the only person I can tell.</i>

431
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,802
<i>Gyeong-su's dead, Mom.</i>

432
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,806
<i>Because I called him over.</i>

433
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,812
<i>I did it in case he'd bite</i>

434
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,524
<i>It's my fault he died, you know?</i>

435
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,450
<i>Please tell his grandma on my behalf.</i>

436

<i>Put it gently, so she doesn't get…</i>

00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,207
<i>too upset.</i>

438

<i>Gyeong-su wanted to work</i>

439
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,181
<i>But I told him no, because he'd try</i>
<i>to eat free chicken every day.</i>

440
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,145
<i>I should have just let him do it.</i>

<i>You killed him.</i>

443
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,590
You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

444
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,926
You wiped that on the scratches
on Gyeong-su's hand.

445
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,053
Like his blood is so clean?

446
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,097
He was a zombie.

447
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,350
Nam-ra, that's enough.

448
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:01,479
It's true. Na-yeon did it. She killed him.

449
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,731
How could you, you're just a fucking…

450
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,149
-How could…
-No!

451
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,402
You're…

452
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,654
a murderer.

453
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,298
-Go.
-<i>You killed me.</i>

454
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,467
Go.

455

Please go.

456
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,346
<i>You killed me.</i>

457
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,418
It was such a nice song.

458
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,628
Didn't you say that it sucked?

459
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,382
Well, now that I actually listened to it,
I think it's kind of nice.

460
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,801
That was encouraging, Dae-su.

461
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,098
How long…

462
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,851
have you been smoking for?

463
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,772
Since eighth grade.

464
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,275
I had no friends
and a lot of stress back then.

465
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,283
Did you ever need a friend, though?

466
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,327
I'm not sure.

467
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,788
I can't really tell.

468
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,584
You always put up a wall.

469
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,589
You'd wear your headphones all day,
and you never said anything.

470
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,260
Wasn't it because you hated us?

471
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,607
I never hated you guys.

472
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:13,820
I just…

473
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,116
didn't have any friends.

474
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,660
Well…

475
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,955
I never really liked you.

476
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,921
I thought you didn't talk to us,
because we were beneath you.

477
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,215
I kind of hated you.

478
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,219
There were times that I wished
you just disappear.

479
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,599
Aren't you close?
You're the top two students.

480
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,184
That's why I hated her.

481
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,562
No matter how hard I worked,
I was always second.

482
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,731
But it's okay now.

483
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,153
I think I was able to come in second,
because of Nam-ra.

484
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,991
Hey. Second's good too.

485
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,495
I can't even be 20th. Right?

486
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,039
Hey.

487
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,667
Don't compare yourself to Joon-yeong.

488
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,127
I was just saying.

489
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,755
Why do you always get on my case
whenever I say something?

490
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,552
Wait a second. Do you like me?

491
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,889
Shut up, you moron!

492
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,975
I'm going to put it out there,
so you don't get hurt.

493
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,644
I like somebody else.

494
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,438
So don't like me.

495
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,815
I don't like you!

496
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,193
I'm not interested in you at all.

497
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,486
Dae-su. Who do you like, then?

498
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,530
He's, he's a total freak.

499
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,784
-His sister.
-Ha-ri from Archery?

500
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,953
You're insane.

501
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,122
I go crazy when I'm in love.

502
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,875
She's like my little Cupid.

503
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,793
Stop it.

504
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,796
If we get out of here alive,
I'm gonna tell my sister.

505
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,632
Will you really tell her?

506
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,633
-Yeah.
-What?

507
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,842
To shoot and kill you.

508
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,677
I said not to like my sister.

509
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,722
You can't do that to me,
future brother-in-law.

510
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,640
You… Hey!

511
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,725
-Will you tell her? Promise?
-Yeah. To kill you.

512
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,519
Stop it. Seriously. I love her.

513
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,240
Gyeong-su…

514
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,454
No!

515
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,881
Ms. Park.

516
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:22,925
It's Gyeong-su.

517
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,512
They're all… Gyeong-su.

518
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,222
Na-yeon.

519
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,478
You were scared.
So were the others. That's all.

520
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,524
So make sure you go back to them later.

521
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,238
Go to them and tell them…

522
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,825
and tell Gyeong-su

523
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,494
that you're sorry.

524
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,832
Na-yeon.

525
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,335
Stay alive.

526
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,254
You have to stay alive.

527
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,344
And you're gonna help them
this time. Okay?

528
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:12,099
Do at least one thing to help them,
you understand?

529
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,120
Na-yeon.

530
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,832
It wasn't your fault.

531
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,085
It was my fault.

532
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,923
I'm sorry for cornering you.

533
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,187
You…

534
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,275
Na-yeon, you have to stay alive.

535
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:16,474
INSTRUMENT STORAGE

536
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,947
My mom and dad prepped
everything for my transfer.

537
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,909
They said to just go to Seoul.

538
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,079
But I really didn't want to go there.

539
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,629
I wouldn't have had any friends,
and I was afraid of the Seoul kids.

540
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,882
I didn't know what to do.

541
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,386
Then On-jo gave me a great idea.

542
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,142
She said I just had to cut school
for five days.

543
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,104
Then the principal can't write you
a recommendation.

544
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,316
So that's what I did.

545
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,946
It's all thanks to On-jo…

546
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,824
that I didn't have to transfer.

547
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,788
I should've just gone to Seoul.

548
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,001
Then none of this
would have happened to me.

549
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,547
People have always said…

550
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,842
my sister was an archery prodigy
ever since she was little.

551
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,013
So our parents only cared about

552
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,183
trying to get my sister
onto the national team.

553
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,229
They've never paid attention to me at all.

554
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,233
I'll give you all my attention,
brother-in-law.

555
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,570
Don't be sad. You have me.

556
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,407
Thank God that I have Dae-su.

557
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,706
I don't really have anything to say.

558
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,835
I wouldn't really know…

559
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,172
but I feel like I made friends.

560
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,649
Me and…

561
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,360
On-jo…

562
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,105
What's that?

563
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,608
-It's… nothing.
-Well…

564
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,612
I have to go to the roof.

565
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,198
But the door's locked.

566
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,869
So I'm going that way.

567
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:30,584
-You're not a zombie, are you?
-Zombie? Fuck that.

568
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,840
Is that food?

569
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:41,845
Are you hungry?

570
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,766
Are you, huh?

571
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,435
Are you hungry?

572
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:55,901
Me too.

573
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,964
I just, well…

574
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,633
I just want some water, really.

575
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,719
Not stuff like that.

576
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,179
Be completely honest.

577
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,809
Be completely honest. Do you like someone?

578
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,609
-Mm-hm.
-You do? For real?

579
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,908
Yeah.

580
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,830
Why do you keep on stalling?
Do you have a crush?

581
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,750
Uh, pretty much.

582
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,835
Pretty much? What does that mean?

583
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,505
Who is she?

584
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,725
No one.

585
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:10,893
Who is she?

586
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,228
Do I know her?

587
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,273
Who is it?

588
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,776
You.

589
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,528
It's you, On-jo.

590
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,573
I like you.

591
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,245
Hey. Stop that.

592
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,125
He doesn't mean it. He's just kidding.

593
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:41,340
I mean, we were friends and neighbors
since kindergarten, that's all.

594
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:45,677
Stop joking.

595
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,722
I'm not joking.

596
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,975
Ever since I was six years old,

597
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,312
I've always liked you, On-jo.

598
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,191
And I always will.

599
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:05,739
Awesome.

600
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,427
Cheong-san.

601
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,945
Did you know? I had no idea.

602
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,989
You're the only one
who didn't know.

603
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,283
-Everyone knew?
-Yes.

604
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,661
-Why didn't I know?
-I didn't, either.

605
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,247
-Because you're you.
-Cheong-san's so cool.

606
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,213
On-jo.

607
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,678
I'm sorry.

608
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,057
You don't have to like me back.

609
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,142
Please don't.

610
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,226
I did it.

611
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,521
I said it all, so it's all good.

612
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,441
How is it all good? You're a jerk.

613
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,902
You were my best friend.

614
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,198
I-sak's gone and now you're gone too.

615
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,579
What is it that you want from me?

616
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,199
Did you…

617
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,077
Did you ever like me?

618
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,669
Not even a little bit?

619
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,923
You never liked me?

620
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,054
Would you please leave?

621
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,100
I just want to be alone.

622
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,313
You don't have to like me back.

623
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,603
On-jo!

624
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,110
Cheong-san!

625
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,326
Give me your eye, asshole.
