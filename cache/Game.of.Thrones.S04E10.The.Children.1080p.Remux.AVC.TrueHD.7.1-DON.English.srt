Truly, I was.

10
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,579
The Halfhand ordered me to join your army

00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,374
and bring back whatever information
I could to Castle Black.

12
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,918
He made me kill him so you'd trust me.

I was loyal

to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?

00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,057
Were you enough to turn her?

18
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,812
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

19

you're low on arrows,

How many are left, 50?

48
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,561
I told Tormund and Orell.

49
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,104
We have more than 1,000 men.

50
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,649
I showed you everything I had.
The whole army, 100,000 strong.

51
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,278
And what did you do?
You fired on us with everything you had.

52
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,445
It wasn't much.

53
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,992
As soon as I saw that,
I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,

54
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,578
an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.

55
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,288
A lot of them will die climbing,

56
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,498
but most of them will be over
by the end of the day.

57
00:06:55,165 --> 00:07:00,170
It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow,
which is more than you've ever done for me.

58
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,631
My people have bled enough.

59
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:03,841
We're not here to conquer.

60
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:08,095
We're here to hide behind your Wall.
Just like you.

61
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,556
We need your tunnel.

Now we both know that winter is coming.

63
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,105
And if my people aren't south of the Wall
when it comes in earnest,

64
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,024
we'll all end up worse than dead.

65
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,737
You want to strike a bargain with me?
Here's the bargain.

You go back, you open the gates to us,

67
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,284

I reckon you could do it
before any of them could stop you.

They'd kill you, of course.

that had him expelled

163
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,796
the process may change him

164
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,299
somewhat.

165
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,762
Will it weaken him?

166
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,598
Oh, no.

167
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,767
Very well, then.

168
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,037
TYWIN: Not another word.

169
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,873
We've been over this. The matter's closed.

170
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm opening it again.

171
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,253
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

172
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,298
You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

173
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:28,011
And you will marry Loras Tyrell
as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

174
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,221
I will not.

175
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,265
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

176
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,227
Tyrion's sentence
will be carried out tomorrow.

177
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,941
You have on several occasions
made great claims

178
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,777
about your commitment
to this family's future.

179
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,405
Your role in that future
is more vital now than it ever was.

180
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,366
I don't care.

181
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,828
I will stay in King's Landing where I belong
with my son, the king.

182
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,581
When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

183
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,917
I decided to take your brother with me
and not you.

184
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:04,214
You insisted that you would not be left
at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.

185
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,966
- If you recall...
- I'm not interested in hearing

186
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,636
another one of your smug stories
about the time you won.

187
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,972
This isn't going to be one of those times.

188
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,640
Do you think you'll be the first person

189
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,768
dragged into a Sept
to be married against her will?

190
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,645
When you marched into the throne room
to tell me

191
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,857
we'd won the Battle of Blackwater,
do you remember?

192
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,111
I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.

193
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,155
I was about to give him
essence of nightshade.

194
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,698
That's how far I was willing to go

195
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,701
when I thought someone awful
had come to take my son away.

196
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,247
Someone awful is coming to take him away.

197
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,665
No.

198
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,793
Joffrey is dead.
Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

199
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:45,005
And now you want to ship me off
to Highgarden and steal my boy.

200
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,923
My last boy.

201
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,594
Margaery will dig her claws in,
you will dig your claws in,

202
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,222
and you'll fight over him like beasts
until you rip him apart.

203
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:58,351
I will burn our house to the ground
before I let that happen.

204
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,353
And how will you do that?

205
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,857
I'll tell everyone the truth.

206
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,276
What truth would that be?

207
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,157
You don't know, do you?

208
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,037
You never believed it.

209
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:18,788
How is that possible?

210
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,377
What am I saying? Of course it's possible.

211
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,839
How can someone so consumed
by the idea of his family

212
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:31,134
have any conception
what his actual family was doing?

213
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,222
We were right there in front of you,
and you didn't see us.

214
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,557
One real look in the past 20 years

215
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:40,310
at your own children
and you would have known.

216
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,896
Known what?

217
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,357
Everything they say is true

218
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,983
- about Jaime and me.
- No.

219
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,818
- Your legacy is a lie.
- No, no, no, no.

220
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,905
I don't believe you.

221
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,535
Yes, you do.

222
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,429
CERSEI: Jaime.

223
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,016
You won.

224
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,769
One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.

225
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,105
There's really nothing
you wouldn't do, is there?

226
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,023
For my family, no, nothing.

227
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,150
I would do things for my family
you couldn't imagine.

228
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,820
- Tyrion is your family.
- He's not.

229
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,823
- You don't get to choose.
- I do. So do you.

230
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,909
You can choose the creature that
killed our mother to come into this world...

231
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,453
Are you really mad enough
to blame him for that?

232
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,164
He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.

233
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,083
A disease doesn't decide to kill you.

234
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,836
All the same, you cut it out before it does.

235
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,796
What do you decide?

236
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,465
- What do you choose?
- The things I did to get back to you,

237
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,051
to endure all that, only to find you...

238
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,140
I choose you.

239
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,100
- Those are words.
- Yes.

240
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,144
Like the ones I just said to Father.

241
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,188
I told him.

242
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:08,982
Told him what?

243
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,817
I told him about us.

244
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,989
- You told him?
- I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.

245
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,617
I told him I'm staying right here
with Tommen, with you.

246
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,495
- You think he'll just accept that?
- Go and ask him.

247
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,958
What did you say?

248
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,294
I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

249
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,963
I don't choose Tywin Lannister.

250
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:36,217
I don't love Tywin Lannister.
I love my brother.

251
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,677
I love my lover.

252
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:42,724
People will whisper, they'll make their jokes.
Let them.

253
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,769
They're all so small, I can't even see them.

254
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,021
I only see what matters.

255
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,699
- Someone will walk in.
- I don't care.

264
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:31,648
Thank you for seeing me, Your Grace.

265
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,692
My name is Fennesz.

266
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:39,239
I can speak the Common Tongue, if you wish.

267
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,074
You speak it very well.

268
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,953
Before you freed me,
I belonged to Master Mighdal.

269
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:49,207
I was tutor to his children.
I taught them languages and history.

270
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,253
They know a great deal about your family
because of me.

271
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:58,758
Little Calla is only seven,
but she admires you very much.

272
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,719
I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.

273
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,721
What can I do for you?

274
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,686
When you took the city, the children
begged me not to leave the house.

275
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,898
But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.

276
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,776
So I lost my home.

277
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,780
Now I live on the streets.

278
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,574
I have outfitted mess halls

279
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,034
to feed all former slaves
and barracks to shelter them.

280
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,412
I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.

281
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,331
I went to one of these places.

282
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,293
The young prey on the old,

take what they want and beat us if we resist.

My Unsullied will make them safe again
in short order, my friend,

285
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,633
this I promise you.

286
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,512
Even if they are safe, who would I be there?

287
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,348
What purpose would I serve?

288
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,810
With my master, I was a teacher.

289
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:54,522
I had the respect and love of his children.

290
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,649
What is it that you want from me?

291
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,401
Your Grace,

292
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,655
I ask you to let me sell myself
back to Master Mighdal.

293
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,325
You want to return to a man who owned you

294
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,744
like a goat or a chair?

295
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,370
Please, Your Grace.

The young may rejoice in the new world
you have built for them,

but for those of us too old to change,

298
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,839
there is only fear and squalor.

299
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,133
I am not alone.

300
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:26,054
There are many outside
waiting to beg the same of you.

301
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:30,850
I did not take this city to preside over
the injustice I fought to destroy.

302
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,603
I took it to bring people freedom.

303
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,315
But freedom means making your own choices.

304
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,819
I will allow you to sign a contract
with your former master.

305
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,281
It may not cover a period

That's Sandor Clegane. The Hound.

You're Arya Stark.

495
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,213
I asked if you wanted something.

496
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:12,883
I swore to your mother
I would bring you home to her.

497
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:17,053
- My mother's dead.
- BRIENNE: I know.

498
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,140
I wish I could have been there to protect her.

499
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,018
You're not a Northerner.

500
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,354
No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.

501
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:28,732
Why didn't you?

502
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,614
She commanded me to bring
Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.

503
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,449
You're paid by the Lannisters.

504
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,035
You're here for the bounty on me.

505
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,788
I'm not paid by the Lannisters.

506
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:43,955
No?

507
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,503
Fancy sword you've got there.
Where'd you get it?

508
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:54,883
I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life.

509
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:59,596
Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth.

510
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,723
Tell me that's not Lannister gold.

511
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,894
Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

512
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,771
The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.

by the old gods and the new.

- She's not coming with you.
- She is.

I always wanted some Valyrian steel.

520
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:26,665
Come with me, Arya. I'll take you to safety.

521

Her mother's dead. Her father's dead.
Her brother's dead.

Winterfell is a pile of rubble.

you're the wrong one to watch over her.

00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,530
Now, enough of this nonsense.

659
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:55,908
I am your son, and you sentenced me to die.

660
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,787
You knew I didn't poison Joffrey,

661
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,623
but you sentenced me all the same.

662
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,167
- Why?
- Enough.

663
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:08,254
We'll go back to my chambers
and speak with some dignity.

664
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:11,006
I can't go back there. She's in there.

665
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,133
You're afraid of a dead whore?

666
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,220
(GROANS)

667
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,856
You shot me.

668
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:34,155
(GROANS)

669
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,200
You're no son of mine.

670
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:39,535
I am your son.

671
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,664
I have always been your son.

672
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:45,833
(GROANS)

673
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:00,473
What have you done?

674
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:03,642
Quickly.

675
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:10,065
Trust me, my friend. I've brought you this far.

676
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:42,389
(BELLS TOLLING)

677
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,682
I want to see the captain.

678
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,475
You're seeing him.

679
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,686
I want to go north, to the Wall.

680
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,147
No, you don't.

681
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,399
I can pay.

682
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:18,569
There is nothing in the North
but ice and war and pirates.

683
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,822
I wouldn't need a cabin. Please.

684
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,574
I could work scrubbing the floors...

685
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,410
I'm not going north, child. I'm going home.

686
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,371
- Where's home?
- The Free City of Braavos.

687
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,249
Wait. I have something else.

688
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:35,920
- More silver won't make a difference.
- It's not silver.

689
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:37,171
It's iron.

690
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:41,425
This...

691
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,182
- How did you...
- Valar Morghulis.

692
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:52,645
Valar Dohaeris.

693
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:55,439
Of course, you shall have a cabin.
