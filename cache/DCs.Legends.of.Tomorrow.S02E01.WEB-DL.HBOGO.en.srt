1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
<i>The Time Masters were an organization
charged with protecting history</i>

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,000
<i>from rogue time travelers,
but they were destroyed.</i>

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,360
<i>Under the leadership of Rip Hunter,
we have taken up their mantle.</i>

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,280
<i>Sara Lance, former member
of the League of Assassins.</i>

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,280
<i>Dr. Raymond Palmer, The Atom.</i>

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,280
<i>The Arsonist, Mick Rory,
and Firestorm, the merged super form</i>

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,120
<i>of Jefferson Jackson
and myself, Martin Stein.</i>

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,200
<i>We are the only ones left
to protect history.</i>

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,880
<i>We are the Legends Of Tomorrow.</i>

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,720
Sorry! My bad!

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,560
What the hell is going on out here?

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,920
Sorry, sir. He broke through
the security cordon downstairs.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,280
Only because they wouldn't let me up
without an appointment.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,800
But, how does a regular guy

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,920
get an appointment
with the Mayor anyway?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,240
Heywood, Dr. Nate Heywood.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm... here to talk
about Sara Lance, Ray Palmer

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,680
and the rest of the Legends.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,840
I think they're all in trouble.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,040
Thank you for not having me
arrested back there.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,800
Those security guards
really overreacted.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,080
You know, one of them tried
to Mace me.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,360
Dr. Heywood, I only agreed
to give you five minutes

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,960
which was three minutes ago

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
because Ray and Sara
are friends of mine.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,880
But I don't know the first thing
about any Legends.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,080
Of course you do,
because you're the Green Arrow.

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
- Excuse me?
- Huh?

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,280
We're done here.

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
Look, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
I didn't mean to drop a bomb
on you like that.

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,240
It's just, I've exhausted
all my normal avenues

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,080
and you're the only person left
who won't think I'm crazy.

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,640
Are you sure about that?

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm a historian.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,520
In layman's terms,
I'm a time detective

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,040
which I really don't have to be
to look at a calendar to see

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,720
one week after you came to this city,
Robin Hood showed up.

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,480
You said that Sara and Ray are...

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,520
Traveling throughout time
with the other Legends.

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,720
"Legends" is what they
call themselves.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
Now, for the past six months,

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,520
I've been noticing subtle changes
to history, almost imperceptible.

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,280
Actually, if it wasn't
for a friend of mine

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,600
who's a quantum physicist,

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,040
I wouldn't have been able to detect
the subliminal alterations.

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
The point being, I think
your friends are responsible.

49
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,880
You're looking at me
like you want evidence.

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,160
Evidence, okay.
An illuminated manuscript

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,920
from 1216 depicting a knight.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,360
Looks a lot like your friend
Dr. Palmer, same nose and... chin.

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,560
Erratic text describing a woman
in white with a bo staff.

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
Hieroglyphic from Mesopotamia
depicting an albeit crude ship

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
that flies through the air
and disappears.

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,800
Let's skip to the part
where they're in trouble.

57
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
UFO sighting, New York City, 1942.

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,040
Multiple witnesses report a flying
machine diving into the Atlantic

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,760
which matches not only
the Mesopotamian hieroglyphics but...

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,880
The part where they're in trouble!

61
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,280
Contemporaneous with the sighting
were multiple reports

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
of an underwater detonation
of an atomic bomb!

63
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,960
Now, the government has denied this.

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,560
You said 1942.

65
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,000
That's three years before...

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,360
Before the atomic bomb
was supposedly invented, yes.

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,320
I told you history was changing.

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,800
Dr. Heywood, if the Legends' ship
met an A-bomb...

69
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,360
they're not in trouble...

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
They're dead.

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,600
{\an5}We're closing in on your coordinates,
Dr. Heywood.

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,320
Are you seeing the sonar
readings of the sea floor?

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Either that's a really
weird-looking rock formation

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,440
or, the wreckage of a time ship.

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,840
{\an5}If the Legends went down
with the ship...

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,880
Where are the bodies?

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,800
The ship's keeping him in stasis.

78
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,000
How do you know that?

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
My name is Oliver Queen

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,160
and my preference
is to not break your arm.

81
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,960
So I want you to calm down

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,200
and tell us
what happened to your team.

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,000
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,600
{\an5}All I remember is being knocked out
by that skinny, little Englishman.

85
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
Very embarrassing.

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,600
{\an5}I know that Sara told her father
she was leaving to protect history.

87
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Why?

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,960
Why does history need protecting?

89
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,000
{\an5}Because the idiots
who were protecting it,

90
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,360
the Time Masters, were blown up.

91
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,720
So you and the Legends took over?

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,440
Chasing down time criminals

93
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,720
{\an5}and fixing the parts of history
they screwed up.

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,560
Aberrations, the captain called them.

95
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,080
We were chasing them

96
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,960
{\an5}for about six months
without a problem.

97
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,640
Well... the occasional problem.

98
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,080
{\an5}I knew we were all in trouble
when Rip made us put on blouses

99
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,760
just to save the King of France.

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,240
I look like an idiot.

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,920
{\an5}I rather like the style of
<i>Le Mousquetaires de la Garde</i>.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,120
- You would.
- Can we concentrate, please?

103
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,360
{\an5}King Louis XIII is scheduled
to meet an untimely end

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
at the hand
of Cardinal Richelieu's men

105
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,840
at any moment.

106
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Roger that.

107
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,640
I have eyes on the King.

108
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,640
<i>Whatever you do, do not
let him out of your sight.</i>

109
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,360
{\an5}But if today's when he's supposed to,
you know, with the queen, I...

110
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Raymond, without that consummation

111
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,000
{\an5}there will be no Louis coutures,
no Sun King

112
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
and no golden age of France.

113
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,520
{\an5}Which means, by extension,
no Madame Curie, no Louis Pasteur.

114
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,680
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.
History will be totally screwed.</i>

115
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,840
<i>But I don't have to be there
for the actual...</i>

116
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,880
<i>you know, consummation. Do I?</i>

117
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,640
It's beautiful, Your Grace.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,240
As is yours.

119
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,920
Who gave it to you?

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
My sister.

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,400
You speak of her as if she is gone.

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,480
{\an5}I hate to see a lady
so beautiful so sad.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Your husband...

124
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,360
Enjoys the company
of his male courtiers.

125
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,200
{\an5}Why should I be denied
similar pleasures?

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
<i>Sara...</i>

127
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,120
I need to know that the Queen
is secure.

128
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,760
Meantime, I believe
I've identified our assassins.

129
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,560
{\an5}And I'd wager, those aren't
just swords on their hips.

130
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,360
Yes, that would explain
the aberration.

131
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,000
My love, there is no need
for you to...

132
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
knock.

133
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,600
Sorry to spoil the mood.

134
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,760
Where the hell's Sara?

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Everyone back to the ship!

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,960
That's easier said than done.

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,480
Ray, meet me on the north side
of the house!

138
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,720
It's actually a chateau.

139
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,880
What's your plan?

140
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,720
You'll see!

141
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

142
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,600
Oh, bloody hell.

143
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,240
That was the last assassin.

144
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,320
What did we say about using powers
and future tech, Dr. Palmer?

145
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,120
Well, yeah, but they started it.

146
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Don't look at me.

147
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
I left my gun on the ship
like a good little Boy Scout.

148
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,480
What's going on?

149
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
Who are you people?

150
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,600
I believe the Queen
is waiting for you in her bedroom.

151
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,960
And I'll bet she's
all warmed up for you.

152
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Shut your mouth, Jax,
or I'll cut your eyes out

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,160
and feed them to you.

154
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,040
I believe our work here is done.

155
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,400
Wait, how'd you go
from the court of Louis XIII

156
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,920
to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean?

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
You said you wanted
to hear the full story.

158
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,440
We do, just some of us have lives
that we'd like to get back to.

159
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,880
We got ourselves in trouble

160
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,200
by visiting a time
we were told not to.

161
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,280
1942?

162
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,320
Who told you not to go to 1942?

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,920
Some guy in a hood named...

164
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
Rex Tyler.

165
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,880
Said if we set foot in 1942,
we'd be all screwed.

166
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,760
And then, he just vanished.

167
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,200
Okay. If he told you not
to go to 1942...

168
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
then why'd you go?

169
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,840
Put another successful mission
down in the books.

170
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,960
Where are we off to next?

171
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,320
Gideon and I have calculated
a 96 percent likelihood

172
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,880
of another aberration
in Bhopal, 1912.

173
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,360
Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

174
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,880
For real. We've been going non-stop
for the past six months.

175
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,320
Nobody wants to address the fact

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,280
that Cardinal Richelieu's men
were armed with laser guns?

177
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,840
Clearly provided to them
by a time pirate or some-such.

178
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,840
Grey's right.
We need to find out who so...

179
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,040
You can get another chance
of destroying the very history

180
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,920
that you're supposed
to be protecting?

181
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
I knew I forgot something.

182
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,240
The part where Rip tells us
everything that we did wrong.

183
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,920
As in, seducing the Queen of France

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,360
just before she's supposed
to conceive

185
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
the country's greatest hope
for the future?

186
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,200
She seduced me.

187
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,000
All wrong, as in violating our policy

188
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,040
of not using super powers
in front of people?

189
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
They had laser guns.

190
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,320
At least, I didn't
screw up this time.

191
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,560
Stealing's not screwing up.

192
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,040
<i>Another successful mission, Captain?</i>

193
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,720
Yes. Well, it seems I don't share
our team's definition of success.

194
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,960
But let's see if our labors came
to a certain fruition, shall we?

195
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,960
Well, that was fun.

196
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,920
I'm in no mood for a lecture, Sara.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Too tired from dishing them out?

198
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,800
Replacing the Time Masters
is an enormous responsibility,

199
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
Sara, and one which I fear
our team is ill-equipped...

200
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,360
Gideon, are we under attack?

201
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,640
<i>Negative, that was a shock wave
generated by a time quake.</i>

202
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
A what?

203
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
A disturbance in the temporal zone

204
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
caused by an unusually
large aberration.

205
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
You never mentioned
a time quake before.

206
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
I've never experienced one
before. Gideon?

207
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,640
<i>The shock wave's point of origin
was New York City, 1942.</i>

208
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
That's not possible.

209
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,520
Wait, what wasn't possible?

210
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
What?

211
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,400
You said you and the Legends
discovered an aberration

212
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,920
in 1942, what was it?

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,880
My guess is it involved Nazis.

214
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,800
You could say that.

215
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,400
The krauts nuked
New York City in 1942.

216
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,360
Wow, someone just blew up New York.

217
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
During World War II.

218
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,400
Think we can all guess
who that someone is.

219
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,160
Nazis.

220
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,400
I hate Nazis.

221
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Aided by some sort of time-traveling
ally, obviously.

222
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,880
Wait, does that mean
the Allied forces lost the war?

223
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,480
In which case, why aren't
we speaking German right now?

224
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,680
Because we're in the temporal zone.

225
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,400
And because it takes time
for the consequences

226
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,080
of an aberration, even one
as cataclysmic as this one,

227
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,280
to ripple throughout time.

228
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
So how much time
do we have to stop it?

229
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,320
Isn't traveling
to that particular time

230
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,040
precisely what Rex Tyler
told us not to do?

231
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,880
Well, what's the alternative?

232
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,560
We let New York blow up?

233
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
It's not like there are
Time Masters left to stop it.

234
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Miss Lance is right.

235
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,440
We are history's
last line of defense.

236
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,520
- I like the sound of that.
- I'd rather die than speak German.

237
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,240
Best case scenario,
let's assume that Mr. Tyler is wrong

238
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,040
and we all end up not dying in 1942.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,040
What if, in endeavoring to save
New York, we make things worse?

240
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,320
What could be worse
than a genocidal fascist

241
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,040
nuclear-armed superpower?

242
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
Relax, Captain.

243
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
We got this.

244
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,920
Gideon, I need you to pull up
everything you can

245
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,720
on the target in 1942.

246
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,480
<i>I assume that by "target"
you mean Damien Darhk.</i>

247
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,000
You are finally getting the hang
of this whole revenge thing.

248
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,320
All right, so we know
that he was alive during 1942,

249
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,880
so we just need to know where he is.

250
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,920
<i>According to a 1942 FBI file,
the target was spotted here.</i>

251
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,720
Hope I'm not interrupting.

252
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,680
No, just reading up on 1942.

253
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,680
You've been spending a lot of time
down here lately, alone.

254
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
Am I not allowed in the library?

255
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,200
You just never struck me
as a bookworm.

256
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm just making sure

257
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,120
that you're not holding
onto anything.

258
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,080
I... I know a thing
or two about grief

259
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,440
so, if you ever want
to talk about Laurel...

260
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,360
Then I know where to find you.

261
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Thank you.

262
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,320
Miss Lance.

263
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
Any luck pinpointing the epicenter

264
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,440
- of the temporal aberration?
- No.

265
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,960
<i>Perhaps these news reports
will prove useful.</i>

266
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Oh, that's good news.

267
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,720
Even though we get nuked,
we still win the war.

268
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,960
Look at the date, Dr. Palmer.

269
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,040
In this version of history
World War II lasts two more years.

270
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,120
And claims 12 million more lives.

271
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,320
Including Albert Einstein.

272
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,520
<i>Actually, Einstein went missing
just prior to the attack on New York.</i>

273
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
Wait. Wait.

274
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,480
Perhaps these... these two events
aren't merely coincidental.

275
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,520
Think about it, a Nobel Prize
winning physicist goes missing.

276
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,320
And miraculously, the Germans
get the bomb three years ahead of us.

277
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,160
They must've kidnapped Einstein,
forced him to build them an A-bomb

278
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,440
which means, the only way
for us to fix the aberration...

279
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,800
Is for us to kidnap him first.

280
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Yes!

281
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,320
<i>Gideon, please chart a course
for New York City, 1942.</i>

282
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,520
I can't believe I'm going
to meet Albert Einstein.

284
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,480
I can't believe
you're making me stay on the ship.

285
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,880
I'm asking you to stay
on the ship, Mr. Jackson.

286
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,640
While the rest of you get to have
all the fun battling Nazis.

287
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,920
You're the only one that I trust

288
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,400
to give the time drive
a long overdue tune up.

289
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,160
And build the time library
and modify the bridge

290
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,400
and half the other hundred things
you've been getting me to do.

291
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,160
All right, give me your tools then.

292
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,480
- What?
- Pack up your tools

293
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
and give them to me.

294
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,680
Why would I do that?

295
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,040
Well, I'm gonna give them to Mr. Rory

296
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,600
to see if he wants to be
the ship's mechanic.

297
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
You see, that's not funny.

298
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,000
Quite right, because in the event

299
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,880
that we can't stop
this nuclear explosion...

300
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,640
a fully-functioning time drive
is going to come in handy.

301
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,520
{\an5}So how do we find Einstein
in a city of seven million people?

302
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Well, we just look for the physicist
with the crazy white hair.

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I mean the other one.

304
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,440
According to Gideon,
there's a cocktail party

305
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,560
at Columbia this evening.

306
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Cocktail party?

307
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,160
Means booze. Where is it?

308
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,480
At Columbia, I just...

309
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,920
Why does no one ever listen to me?

310
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey, where you going?

311
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I have a grandfather
that's in the FBI.

312
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
I figured I'd check in
in case we need backup.

313
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,440
Oh. Good plan.

314
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Hey!

315
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,440
Where do you think you're going?

316
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Follow Sara,
in case she needs backup.

317
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,160
Oh, God.

318
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,080
Take me to Conway and Fifth.

319
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Oh, jeez.

320
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,600
Never been to a nerd party before.

321
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,280
You mean a physics symposium.

322
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,520
- Nerd party.
- Keep your eyes open.

323
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,680
We're sure to be in the company
of German spies.

324
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,120
That's... that's him.

325
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,800
Good evening, ladies.

326
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,160
The greatest mind
the world has ever known.

327
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,120
I am merely demonstrating
Newton's third law.

328
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,280
"For every action, there is an equal
and opposite reaction."

329
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,720
I like him.

330
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
He's a pig.

331
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,320
I just found our spies.

332
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
- Them?
- Notice their uniforms.

333
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,720
The stitching on the lapels,
it's exquisite.

334
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,000
You mean to say fake.

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
Surprise.

336
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Surprise.

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,760
How long have you been following me?

338
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,240
How long have you been
following Darhk?

339
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,520
Shut your mouth, Ray.

340
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,440
We got company.

341
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,080
<i>Guten abend, mein Herren.</i>

342
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,200
- Are they speaking...
- German.

343
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,720
The extraction team is on the move.

344
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,840
Let me talk. I speak "physicist".

345
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,240
Oh, Herr Professor,
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

346
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,680
- Who are you?
- My colleague and I

347
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,840
were just having
a rather spirited debate

348
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,560
about your theory of relativity.

349
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
Perhaps you can help us settle it.

350
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,760
I was this close to getting them both
to come back to my room.

351
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,800
Well, what about your wife?

352
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,600
The one who died or the one
who divorced me 30 years ago?

353
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,240
Come on, it's time to go.

354
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
You don't have to speak German
to know what "uranium" means.

355
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,600
So what?

356
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,040
Even Einstein can't build
a bomb without fuel.

357
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,760
Darhk must be the one
supplying the Nazis.

358
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,920
Damien Darhk murdered
my sister in 2016.

359
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,960
- If I take him out here in 1942...
- You save her.

360
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,000
I've been waiting six months
to get this son of a gun.

361
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,680
You're gonna have to wait
a little while longer.

362
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,160
We gotta let him go.

363
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,200
Until we get our hands
on the uranium he's selling,

364
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,880
New York City's hanging
in the balance.

365
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,520
I really hate you sometimes, Ray.

366
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,840
What do you two think you're doing?

367
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,800
We have to get you out of here.
Your life is in danger.

368
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,440
This is why I never travel
without my security detail.

369
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,720
Help! I'm being kidnapped!

370
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,360
We might not look like it,
but we're the good guys.

371
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,200
Why should I believe
that you are really a physicist?

372
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,200
Because for every action...

373
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,880
there's an equal
and opposite reaction.

374
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,600
So how'd it go with Einstein?

375
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,720
Depends on who you ask.

376
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,320
But apparently, the professor
has one hell of a right hook.

377
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
Seriously? Ray punched him out?

378
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
Yeah. He's sleeping it off
in the brig.

379
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,640
So can we get the hell
out of 1942 now?

380
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,840
It looks like.

381
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,560
- Gideon?
<i>- I'm afraid not, Miss Lance.</i>

382
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,240
But without Einstein's help,
the Nazis...

383
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,760
<i>Still manage to destroy New York City
with an atomic blast.</i>

384
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,160
<i>The historical aberration
remains unchanged.</i>

385
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,400
How is that possible?

386
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,440
The Nazis must've gotten the bomb
from someone other than Einstein.

387
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,080
<i>Guten morgen.</i>

388
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,560
What is this? Some sort of prison?

389
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,680
What am I doing in here?

390
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,120
Good question.

391
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,760
I'm sorry. I never had
the opportunity to introduce myself.

392
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm Professor Martin Stein,
just like "Einstein" minus the "Ein."

393
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,120
There's just so much
I'd like to discuss with you.

394
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,280
Such as, your paper
on unified field theory.

395
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,600
I have not yet published my paper
on unified field theory!

396
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Who are you?

397
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,160
Why have you abducted me?

398
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,960
The guys at the party
wanted you to make

399
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,440
an atomic bomb for <i>"ze Führer".</i>

400
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
No.

401
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,200
Not even a man
as mad as Adolph Hitler

402
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
would want to create
such a terrible weapon.

403
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,680
You yourself once said
that two things are infinite,

404
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,160
the universe and human stupidity.

405
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,280
And you are living proof
of the latter.

406
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,680
He just called you stupid.

407
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,000
Now, open this door and let me out!

408
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,680
We will, soon. I promise.

409
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,080
We saved you from the Nazis.

410
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,600
The least you could do
is help us save New York.

411
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
From what?

412
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,400
From some theoretical attack?

413
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,800
Some eventuality that not even
I could have predicted?

414
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,800
The only way you...

415
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,760
<i>Mein Gott.</i>

416
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Yes, obviously, you know.

417
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,360
I deduced it, Herr Doktor.

418
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,480
Perhaps you could deduce
how the Germans managed

419
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,960
- to create a nuclear bomb...
- Atomic.

420
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,720
When you are the only man on Earth
capable of performing such a feat.

421
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,360
<i>Ja.</i>

422
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,520
That is correct.

423
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,680
I am the only man.

424
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Wait a minute.

425
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,240
You saying there's some lady
out there

426
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,240
that can make an atomic bomb?

427
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

428
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,240
Why am I talking to him

429
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,120
when you are clearly
the brains of the operation?

430
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,640
Your ex-wife is also a physicist.

431
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
Without Mileva's help...

432
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,280
I would still be working
as a patent clerk in Vienna.

433
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,080
So, while we were busy
safeguarding Professor Einstein...

434
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
The Nazis were busy
kidnapping his ex.

435
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,200
Her name is Mileva Maric.
She's a fellow nuclear physicist.

436
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,520
Who, let me guess,
had no one guarding her.

437
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,440
Yes, Einstein's collaborations
with Ms. Maric

438
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,600
were a closely guarded secret
between the two of them.

439
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,520
A secret that the Germans
apparently knew.

440
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,760
So, unless we can determine
where they're keeping her

441
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
while she manufactures their bomb...

442
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,680
If I had to guess, I'd say she's
with Damien Darhk's uranium.

443
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,160
Damien Darhk? As in...

444
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,440
The man who murdered your sister.

445
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,240
How is Damien Darhk
even alive in 1942?

446
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,280
Thanks to the Lazarus Pit,
he hardly ages.

447
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,040
Sara's kind of an expert
on Damien Darhk.

448
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,200
Drop it, Ray.

449
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,840
I'm sorry, but while you were
all saving Einstein,

450
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,560
Sara was off on her own
secret side mission

451
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,920
to kill Laurel's killer in the past.

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,760
And I suppose you never thought
about saving your fiancée?

453
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,240
Yeah, of course I did.
But I never did it

454
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,440
because it's against the rules.

455
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,600
What rules?

456
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,240
We're not Time Masters.
There are no rules.

457
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,680
Well, if there were,
there'd certainly be one

458
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,080
about lying to your team.

459
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,560
Listen to yourself.

460
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
Look, we get it, you're perfect.

461
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,960
Always the Boy Scout,
aren't you, Raymond?

462
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Yeah, well, I could say
the same thing

463
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,360
about you being an assassin.

464
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,200
Well, if we're being honest...

465
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,840
then let me get something
off of my chest.

466
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,320
Let's all just take a deep breath,
shall we?

467
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,440
You think that
you're such a big hero, Ray?

468
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,360
Without that fancy suit,
you're nothing

469
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,200
but a self-righteous rich guy.

470
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Maybe you're right...

471
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,760
but without my suit, there's no way
of finding Einstein's ex-wife

472
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,360
or Damien Darhk for that matter.

473
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Sorry, what are you saying?

474
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,200
That anyone who spends
a lot of time around uranium,

475
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,640
in this case Damien Darhk,
picks up trace amounts of radiation,

476
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,160
which my suit can track.

477
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,200
And lead us straight
to the Nazis' nuclear bomb.

478
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,120
Beautiful work, Mileva.

479
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,960
Dr. Einstein should never
have let you get away.

480
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,200
I did what you want.

481
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,880
Now let me go.

482
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
Actually, we still have need of you.

483
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,600
This thing didn't exactly come
with an owner's manual.

484
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,680
Get her and the bomb onboard.

485
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,640
We can't allow them
to get that bomb onboard.

486
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,840
What about Mileva?

487
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,760
Don't worry, Doctor,
we'll be sure to keep her safe.

488
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,640
But we must secure
the nuclear bomb...

489
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,320
- Atomic.
- About to be placed

490
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,600
aboard a Nazis submarine.

491
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,480
This is no time for subtlety.

492
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,640
Agreed.

493
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,040
Let's make sure
we all follow the plan.

494
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
Let's just get this done.

495
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,680
Step away from the lady and the bomb!

496
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,800
Final warning!

497
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,720
<i>Schnell! Töten sie!</i>

498
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,280
I love roasting Nazis!

499
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
<i>Mein Gott!</i>

500
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,440
We need to get Miss Maric to safety!

501
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Sara!

502
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Get down.

503
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,320
Interesting technique.

504
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,920
League of Assassins, am I right?

505
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,920
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

506
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,160
A long time? For what?

507
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,960
- To kill you.
- Try to, you mean.

508
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,080
Dr. Palmer, let's take precautions.

509
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
And disable the bomb?

510
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Already on it.

511
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,760
Guys, a little problem here.

512
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,800
Suit's not as radiation-proof
as I thought.

513
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,240
Sara! Fall back!

514
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,680
Guys, actually a big problem.

515
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,560
Haircut! Watch out!

516
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Mick, look out!

517
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
Fall back!

518
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,080
Sara!

519
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,280
<i>Mr. Rory's injured.
Dr. Palmer is incapacitated.</i>

520
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,880
<i>We need to fall back now!</i>

521
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,400
Firestorm, cover Dr. Palmer and Sara.

522
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,200
Okay, Mick's on the mend
and Einstein and his ex

523
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,960
are safe and sound
with the security detail.

524
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,080
Thank you, Jax.

525
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,760
But the Nazis still have the nuke.

526
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
What are we doing leaving New York?

527
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Because the Nazis still have a nuke

528
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,520
which we saw being loaded
onto a U-boat.

529
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
They're gonna hit New York
from underwater.

530
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,600
Yeah, I'm tracking
the uranium signature

531
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,240
recorded by Dr. Palmer's suit.
But before we engage the Nazis,

532
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I need you to make
these modifications.

533
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,040
Really? Is now the time
for me to be playing mechanic?

534
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,320
Look, I know
that you consider the chores

535
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,280
that I've been assigning you
to be a waste of time, Jefferson.

536
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,840
But believe me,
they're more than just an exercise.

537
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,040
What's the subliminal variance
of the quantum manifold?

538
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
- Two microns.
- And if one wanted

539
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,320
to divert power from the axial array?

540
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,840
Can't be done, you'd have
to go through the clavian adjunct.

541
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,160
All of the stuff
you've been having me do,

542
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,920
you've been teaching me
about the Waverider.

543
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,160
I'm a time traveler, Jefferson.

544
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,880
I spend most of my time
thinking about the future,

545
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,680
specifically my own. And...

546
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,800
it occurs to me that that future

547
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,920
might not involve me
being aboard this ship.

548
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,720
And I need someone to know
its secrets in my absence.

549
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,400
Nice try, dude,
but you're not quitting on us.

550
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,640
What's a "Timescatter"?

551
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,760
A last ditch option...

552
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,080
and one that I pray
we will never have to use.

553
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,560
We going swimming or something?

554
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm tracking the Nazi U-boat.

555
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,360
Where is it now?

556
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
It's close.

557
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,800
<i>They've knocked out
our telemetry, Captain.</i>

558
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,120
What's going on?

559
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,160
As you can see, the Waverider
is ill-suited for underwater combat.

560
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I'm trying to bypass
the tertiary subsystem array.

561
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,600
Make it fast, haircut.

562
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Yes!

563
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,120
Is the weapon ready?

564
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,240
Yes, Herr Darhk.

565
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,080
Fire!

566
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,280
- What was that?
- They're not firing on us.

567
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
It's the nuclear bomb.

568
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,320
Atomic.

569
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,040
Whatever it is, we gotta stop it.

570
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,600
I fear that there is only one way
to do that.

571
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,080
Okay. I don't know
what you wanted me to do

572
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
but, I did it.

573
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,560
Excellent work, Jax.

574
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,680
What's going on?

575
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,200
I am piloting us on a collision
course with the torpedo.

576
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Now, with any luck, it will hit us
before New York City.

577
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,400
How is that lucky?

578
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,920
Can the Waverider handle the blast?

579
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,440
Honestly, I have absolutely no idea.

580
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,240
Which is why, I'm doing this.

581
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,800
Where is everybody?

582
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,680
The appropriate question is when.

583
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,120
Other the last few months,
I've implemented a safeguard

584
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,480
in case of a catastrophe.

585
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,000
A high burst of temporal energy

586
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,800
has scattered our team
throughout history.

587
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,800
I knew you never liked me.

588
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,280
I'm afraid, injured as you are,

589
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,240
you wouldn't survive
the rigors of time travel.

590
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,640
Which is why, I'm doing this.

591
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,120
Gideon, how much time do we have?

592
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,520
<i>Thirty seconds, Captain.</i>

593
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
- Gideon?
<i>- I'm here, Captain.</i>

594
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,840
You always are.

595
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,800
Okay, there's just one question
that you haven't answered.

596
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,320
Where's Captain Hunter?

597
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
I don't know.

598
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,720
Must have time-scattered himself
like the rest of them.

599
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,640
Guess I gotta play hero
and find them.

600
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,600
Do you even think
this ship still flies?

601
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,040
I don't see why not.

602
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,840
Fridge works.

603
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,600
I don't have time to time travel,
but if your team is stuck in history,

604
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,920
who better to help find them
than a historian?

605
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
This guy?

606
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,400
Without Dr. Heywood,
you'd still be in stasis.

607
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,680
Good point.

608
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,480
Library, this way.

609
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,160
Hey, wait. Time-out.

610
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,680
This was supposed
to be a salvage mission.

611
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,040
Who are you kidding?

612
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,400
You've been waiting your whole life
for a chance like this.

613
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,560
Well, I... I did some digging.

614
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,000
But I think I finally got a lead
on Ray Palmer.

615
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,640
Are you, sure you know
how to fly this thing?

616
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,840
Let's find out.

617
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,840
Maybe you should slow down?

618
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,680
Maybe you should shut up
and strap in.

619
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,760
I can't believe this.

620
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,520
We're about to travel through time!

621
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Did I tell you
about the side effects?

622
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,360
What side effects?

623
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,640
Mick! Buddy!

624
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,160
- How'd you find me?
- I didn't.

625
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,480
Pretty did.

626
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,800
Is he okay?

627
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
Side effects of time travel.

628
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Speaking of,
you're never gonna believe

629
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,120
where the rest of your team ended up.

630
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,040
{\an5}This festival is boring.

631
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,480
Bring me my wizards!

632
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,720
My liege, how may we entertain you?

633
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,360
Do you wish to gaze
into my magic mirror, Your Majesty?

634
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,720
I grow bored of your tricks.

635
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,640
Off with their heads.

636
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,520
- What?
- You little brat.

637
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,840
This is incredible.

638
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,400
An actual medieval execution?

639
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,920
I never imagined
I'd see this with my own eyes.

640
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,240
Who... who's that?

641
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,360
The new guy.

642
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,200
- New guy! Duck!
- Hiyah!

643
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,440
I'm Dr. Heywood.
I heard so much about you.

644
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,640
Hey, how about we get
to know each other

645
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,800
- back on the ship?
- Okay.

646
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,160
But first we have to find Sara.

647
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,960
Vile witch!

648
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,120
{\an5}You have corrupted
the women of our village!

649
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,840
{\an5}In my defense,
they were happily corrupted.

650
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,320
Hang the witch!

651
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,800
Hang the witch!

652
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,200
Hang the witch!

653
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,560
Hang the witch!

654
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,680
You must be Sara Lance.

655
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,720
It's okay. He's with us.

656
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,280
Hey.

657
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,960
Is she always this violent?

658
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm sorry, but so far
I haven't been able to detect

659
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,320
any historical alteration
that would indicate

660
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,360
Mr. Hunter was stranded in a time.

661
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,560
Why don't we ask Gideon where he is?

662
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,960
Who's Gideon?

663
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,600
<i>Greetings, Dr. Heywood.</i>

664
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,760
<i>I am the ship's
artificial consciousness.</i>

665
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Gideon, we need you to tell us
where Rip is.

666
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,760
<i>I'm afraid I have no idea.</i>

667
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,480
<i>But I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.</i>

668
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,080
Final message?

669
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,560
<i>Sorry for stranding
you all throughout history,</i>

670
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,320
<i>but it was the only way to save you.</i>

671
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,320
<i>Well, you know what they say,
Captain must never abandon his ship.</i>

672
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,640
<i>Well, neither shall I abandon hope</i>

673
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,040
<i>of seeing you all again someday,
somewhere in time.</i>

674
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,160
<i>As flawed and unruly
as you are individually,</i>

675
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,720
<i>together you are the best crew.</i>

676
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,120
<i>The best team a captain
could ever hope for.</i>

677
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
<i>So...</i>

678
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
<i>stick together.</i>

679
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,240
<i>And remember...</i>

680
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,200
<i>history is yours now,
my dear Legends.</i>

681
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
<i>Good luck.</i>

682
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,600
So, what do we do now?

683
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,800
We drink.

684
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,760
It's not like we were exactly
Time Masters, even with Rip.

685
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,080
But I think he knew that one day
we might have to do this without him.

686
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,440
And we all heard his message.
He wanted us to keep going.

687
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
We have to keep going.

688
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,480
There's a rogue time traveler
out there somewhere.

689
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, a time nemesis
whose idea of fun

690
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,560
is helping Damien Darhk
and the Nazis blow up New York City.

691
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
What's to stop them
from going back in time

692
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,600
and kidnapping Einstein
and his ex-wife again?

693
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,120
We can't be everywhere at once.

694
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,280
But you can safeguard the Einsteins.

695
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,400
Safeguard the Einsteins?

696
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
How?

697
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,320
By making one slight
alteration to history.

698
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,040
We'd like to talk
to Mr. Einstein. CIA.

699
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,880
He means OSS.

700
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,240
This is related
to the Manhattan Project.

701
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,760
You're headed to Columbia University,
right, for the symphony?

702
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,920
- Symposium.
- Same thing.

703
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,960
Once you're there, we're gonna
need you to publicly announce

704
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,320
that Miss Mileva Maric
has been your silent partner

705
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,520
for over 30 years.

706
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,480
You see, acknowledgment
of Mileva's contributions

707
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,880
is the only way to keep her safe.

708
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,040
Besides, it's the right thing to do.

709
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,200
Don't be a jerk.

710
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,200
Today, I want to tell you
about a very special woman...

711
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,600
my longtime collaborator,
Mileva Maric.

712
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,360
What does that mean?

713
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,960
Krauts won't be able to get to her?

714
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,120
Yes, and then people won't say,
"Hey, you're a regular Einstein."

715
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,600
They'll say,
"You're like one of the Einsteins".

716
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,440
That's so crazy.

717
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,680
I can't believe
we just changed history.

718
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,600
No, Dr. Heywood. We saved it.

719
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,640
You promised no trouble, Herr Darhk.

720
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,840
And you promised me competency.

721
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,760
Perhaps, we'll have better luck
with the next bomb.

722
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,200
That's cute,
but there won't be a next bomb.

723
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,640
You see, my partner wants
to move on to other things.

724
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,960
But your partner isn't here, is he?

725
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,280
According to who?

726
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,040
Hello, Eobard.

727
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,720
Mr. Darhk.

728
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,960
How'd it go with Einstein?

729
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,000
Good, until someone gives
the Confederate Army machine guns

730
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,880
or breaks Mozart's fingers, or...

731
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,160
One aberration at a time.

732
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
Hey, remember that thing

733
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,000
that I said before
about you being a...

734
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,440
Billionaire Boy Scout?

735
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
You weren't all wrong.

736
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah, but you're more than that.

737
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Thanks.

738
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,000
And we'll get justice for Laurel,
Sara, promise.

739
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,840
What do you guys say
we get out of 1942?

740
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,680
Not until you answer a few questions.

741
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,440
We're the Justice Society of America.

742
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,880
And you're coming with us.
