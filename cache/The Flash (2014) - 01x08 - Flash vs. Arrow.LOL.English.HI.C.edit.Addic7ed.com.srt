No matter what I say, I'm
getting the advice, right?

- No.
- Oh.

178
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:47,569
He's a cop and he thinks
that you're dangerous.

179
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,773
And he's trying to convince
his boss that you're a menace

I know it's a long shot,
but Central City has

the highest concentration of
iron oxide in the country.

are cool with him now.

against teaming up with him,
what are we doing here?

322
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:49,267
He's a good kid, and it's
just a name, Diggle.

323
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,772
The man who rents this storage unit...

324
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:56,605
I want... his... name.

325
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,318
Hey.

326
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,856
The bad guy that you're after,
the one who robbed the bank,

327
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:08,725
his name is Roy G. Bivolo.

328
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:11,992
Uh, thanks. How did you find that out?

329
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:15,999
The guy's still alive, right?

330
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,368
I'm just asking.

331
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,138
I thought you didn't want to help.

332
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,808
I'm not. It's just a name.

333
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:23,976
- All right.
- Hi.

334
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:25,512
- Hey.
- Ooh!

335
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:28,185
One non-fat latte,
extra sugar for Felicity,

336
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,923
and one coffee, black, for Oliver.

337
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,359
I brewed you a fresh pot, so...

338
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,229
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

339
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,297
Barry, um, can I talk
to you for a second?

340
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,297
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

341
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:43,899
Bye.

342
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:48,438
Ow. What are you doing?

343
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:51,442
You did not tell me that
you knew Oliver Queen.

344
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,878
- I know Oliver Queen.
- Oh, my God,

345
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,412
he's even more handsome in person.

346
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,546
And his arms are, like,
twice the size of yours.

347
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,784
Technically they're not twice the size.

348
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,117
He's on my three list.

349
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,817
- What's a three list?
- My list

350
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,685
of three guys I'm allowed
to cheat on Eddie with.

351
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:05,554
You usually don't meet
people on your list,

352
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:10,127
but now here he is, and I just
cannot stop staring at him.

353
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:11,929
[Sighs]

354
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,733
Felicity, this is me
noticing you staring.

355
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,001
We need to help Barry with his case.

356
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,602
Why don't you want to help?

357
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,540
Because Barry doesn't
really want my help.

358
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,408
He only thinks he does.

359
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,975
Harrison Wells and Barry's cop foster dad

360
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,881
both said you were dangerous
and a bad influence.

361
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,650
Barry defended you.

362
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,184
You're going to hock me about this

363
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,856
until I say yes, aren't you?

364
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:38,192
I'm a hocker.

365
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,729
Okay.

366
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,307
- Okay, what?
- Okay, we'll help you

367
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:45,261
catch your bad guy.

368
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,599
Great. Meta-human.

369
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,436
I am not calling him that, Barry.

370
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,906
Partners?

371
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,375
Partners.

372
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,819
- Hey.
- You're late.

373
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,885
Barry, how can you have super-speed

374
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:14,323
- and still not be on time?
- Sorry, I guess

375
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:17,425
the super-tardiness kinda neutralizes it.

376
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:20,164
So how do we catch Bivolo here?

377
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,134
Oh, no, we don't here.
We're here to train.

378
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,502
What? Like <i>Rocky?</i>

379
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:29,539
I read your friend Iris'
blog post on The Flash,

380
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,642
and I visited all the crime
scenes you fought at.

381
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,113
- Don't you sleep?
- Last month

382
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,083
you took on a man named Lenard Snart.

383
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,518
We call him Captain Cold.

384
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,466
We can talk about you
giving your enemies

385
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,887
silly code names later.

386
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:44,091
You mean like over coffee with
Deathstroke and The Huntress?

387
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,094
The point is that you engaged
Snart on a commuter train,

388
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:48,927
which he derailed.

389
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,992
Okay, there may have been some
damage, but I got the job done,

390
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:53,895
- I was the hero.
- Barry, when you approach

391
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:57,501
a new environment, do you
case every inch of it?

392
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:01,473
You could. You have the time.

393
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,310
But you don't.

394
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,480
You just run in blind.

395
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:09,914
There's a difference, Barry,
between having powers

396
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,382
and having precision.

397
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,736
When I came to you thinking about

398
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:13,751
going out and helping people,

399
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,451
you said I could be an inspiration.

400
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,152
Living this life...

401
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:18,988
Well, it takes more than a mask.

402
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:20,657
It takes discipline.

403
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:23,096
And since you are probably
as stubborn as I am...

404
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:26,365
What is that for?

405
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,299
You're going to run over there,

406
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,901
you're going to come back at me,

407
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,498
and you're going to get hit
with an arrow.

408
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,103
[Laughs] No, I'm not.

409
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:36,338
[Laughs] Yes, you are.

410
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:38,939
Okay, fine,

411
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,040
I will humor you.

412
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:44,378
Ready?

413
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,482
Ready.

414
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,323
Nice try.

415
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,461
Gah! Ah!

416
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,729
What, you shot me? [Panting]

417
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,430
I heard you heal fast.

418
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,234
- [Squish]
- [Screams]

419
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,036
Oh, God!

420
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:09,212
[Muffled argument]

421
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:11,548
Hey. What's up?

422
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:15,586
Eddie's making his case
for the task force again.

423
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,620
But I thought the Captain
shot him down already.

424
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:20,622
Well, apparently he's got a new argument.

425
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:23,591
The Arrow made another
appearance last night.

426
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:26,463
And you forgot to tell me
that you got Bivolo's name

427
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,633
from shooting that
storage guy in the leg.

428
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,602
Well, technically I didn't shoot him.

429
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,239
Well, what word would
you use to describe

430
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,741
how you got this info?

431
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:37,679
I'm gonna go with “torture.”

432
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,850
I don't... The Arrow gets results.

433
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:41,586
He's a crazy man.

434
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,789
Look, I don't actually disagree
with you at the moment,

435
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,223
but we wouldn't even have Bivolo's name

436
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,022
if it weren't for The Arrow.

437
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:50,092
So maybe instead of judging him,
you should just be thanking him.

438
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:52,196
Two things I won't be
doing in this life...

439
00:20:52,197 --> 00:20:56,933
Playing professional baseball,
and thanking that lunatic.

440
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:58,935
[Beep]

441
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:00,804
Stay.

442
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:02,438
Have you heard of color psychology?

443
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:04,316
The theory that changes
in the color spectrum

444
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,340
can affect emotion.

445
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,576
It is so nice to have
another woman to talk to.

446
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:08,977
I know.

447
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,479
I was thinking that if Bivolo uses color

448
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,313
to induce the temporary psychosis,

449
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,384
maybe we can use light
and color to reverse it.

450
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:18,487
Miss Smoak, a word, if you please.

451
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:24,731
Hey, what's up, doc?

452
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:26,631
Sorry, that was dumb.

453
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,434
Remember I went to M.I.T.

454
00:21:28,435 --> 00:21:30,203
Yes, you're smart.

455
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:33,304
Felicity, I like to surround my
team with known quantities.

456
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,806
That is because I find the unknown

457
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,979
to be toxic, dangerous.

458
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,183
The Arrow is unknown.

459
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,221
I can assure you, Dr.
Wells, he's not dangerous.

460
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,289
To us.

461
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,324
Well, of that, I have little doubt.

462
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:54,896
And yet, I find myself with a conundrum.

463
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:59,828
How can I completely trust a man
when I don't even know his name?

464
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,931
And so, I was hoping, Miss Smoak,

465
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:04,465
that you could help me trust him.

466
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:08,271
Who is he under the hood?

467
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:11,876
That is not my secret to tell, Dr. Wells.

468
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,685
Of course.

469
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:24,155
I'll figure it out on my own.

470
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:26,425
[Whoosh]

471
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,195
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,605
How'd it go with Oliver?

473
00:22:29,606 --> 00:22:31,742
You know, to be honest,
not exactly the partnership

474
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:32,432
I thought it would be.

475
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,634
Oh, did he really do the
thing with the arrows?

476
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:36,271
You knew he was going to shoot me?

477
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,806
Whoa, it is practically
impossible to tell

478
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,893
when Oliver's making a joke.

479
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:40,678
Hey, we just got a ping from

480
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,080
the facial recognition software
on Bivolo, aka, Prism.

481
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:45,216
Since when do we have
