00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,230
Whoa.

341
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:46,190
That is pretty... Whoa!

342
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,420
Hello.

343
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,211
Everybody here
for the interview?

344
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,387
Me, too.

345
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,258
So, what do you guys got
going on later?

346
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:12,651
Are you up to no good?

347
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,306
You gonna get
into some mischief?

348
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,658
Okay.

349
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:22,269
Send the first one in.

350
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,968
They're ready
to see you, Mr. Gru.

351
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:26,578
Oh, good.

352
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:27,884
Great.

353
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,451
Oh...

354
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:02,005
Distinguished villains,

355
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,442
my name is Gru.

356
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,097
I feel like I'm talking too loud

357
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,013
even though our proximity

358
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:13,016
doesn't require
this kind of volume.

359
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:20,589
If you told me when I was ten

360
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:23,026
that I would have the chance
to fill the shoes

361
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,202
of my favorite villain ever,

362
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:27,639
Wild Knuckles, I would say,

363
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,728
"You got rocks in your head."

364
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:32,296
But now that I'm 11
and three quarters,

365
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,777
it makes a lot more sense.

366
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,214
All right, who let the kid in?

367
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:39,477
I thought he was a tiny man.

368
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,088
What's wrong with you?

369
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:46,963
You seriously think a puny
little child can be a villain?

370
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:48,399
Um, yes.

371
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:50,619
I-I am pretty despicable.

372
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,838
You don't want to cross me.

373
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:55,928
Evil is for adults

374
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:59,845
who steal powerful
ancient stones and wreak havoc.

375
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:03,719
And not for tubby little punks

376
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:07,461
who should be at school,
learning,

377
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,507
taking a recess,

378
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,378
sucking his thumb.

379
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:13,816
"Sucking his..."

380
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,907
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

381
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,474
Who's next?

382
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,303
I am Wing Man,

383
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:25,654
the next member
of the Vicious Six.

384
00:25:25,697 --> 00:25:29,048
Behold, the power of flight!

385
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:34,053
All right, joke's over.

386
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:35,925
Showtime.

387
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:41,452
This is a big one.

388
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,498
Yeah, yeah.

389
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,761
To the left. That's right.

390
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:04,449
Bring him in,
bring him in, boys.

391
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,651
Everybody pile on!

392
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:10,481
He took the stone!

393
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:13,571
I'll get him!

394
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,007
Oh! Ah!

395
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:18,837
Lock down the building.

396
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,801
Oh! Oh!

397
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:28,499
- Huh?
- What? - Uh...

398
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:31,502
Nothing to see here.

399
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:33,243
- Oh.
- Oh, look at you.

400
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:35,419
Frampton Comes Alive!
Nice choice.

401
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:39,553
I...

402
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,513
Just keep walking.

403
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,829
Who the heck is that? A kid?

404
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:57,702
Oh, guys.

405
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,835
- Bello.
- Mini-Boss!

406
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:01,750
What are you doing here?

407
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:04,883
Okay, just get on.

408
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,711
Which way did he go?

409
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,060
There's that little thief!

410
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:09,888
Go! Go, go, go!

Knock, knock. Delivery.

413
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:43,356
That demon child!

414
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,638
Otto, take the stone
back to the lair.

415
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,055
I'll distract them.

416
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,796
Go! Go, go, go!

Yeah, baby.

00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,797
Well...

436
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,669
this kid just stole something

from the worst villains
in the world.

438

"We have made
a terrible mistake.

No, not "Otto le come-ay."

447
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:50,396

506
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:41,062
Could I just speak

Wild Knuckles!

508

You're alive?

510
00:33:52,116 --> 00:33:55,163
Wow. My favorite villain
is also my kidnapper?

511
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:57,208
This could be
a great opportunity

512
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:59,297

513
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,125
Shut up and give me the stone.

514

Oh, yes, the stone.

515

Here's the thing about that.

516
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:07,827
Kind of a funny story.

517

Give it to him!

518
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,922

somewhere.

I'm not. I'm not. I swear.

525

00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:22,023
Hey, wait a minute.

672
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:24,199
Bello.

673
00:45:24,242 --> 00:45:25,635
Oh, no!

674
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:33,251
Trespassers!

675
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:34,252
Get 'em!

676
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,427
Hey, you. Come back here!

677
00:45:38,517 --> 00:45:40,563
Go, go!

678
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:50,616
Kevin! Oh, okay.

679
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:12,508
Get your little butts back here!

680
00:46:18,644 --> 00:46:22,474
Okay, now, you might feel
a little pinch.

681
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,482
Got you now.

682
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:33,877
Time to break some bones.

683
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,407
Any plans for the weekend?

684
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:51,547
Take five deep breaths.

685
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,462
I'll be right back.

686
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:55,638
Hey!

687
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:58,597
You like picking
on little guys, huh?

688
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:01,165
Go take a nap, old lady.

689
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:02,558
Old lady?

690
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:15,876
I am a master of the ancient
Shaolin art of kung fu.

691
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:16,964
Ah.

692
00:47:28,453 --> 00:47:29,672
Huh?

693
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:37,071
Ha-ha!

694
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:50,214
Get lost!

695
00:47:53,783 --> 00:47:57,178
If you come back
to our place, you're dead.

696
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:58,701
Uh, come-ay.

697
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:04,315
Oh, pank you.

698
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,274
Pank you...

699
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:09,930
You can thank me by going away.

700
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,322
I'm working.

701
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:13,977
...kung fu...

702
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:16,371
You want to learn kung fu?

703
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:21,942
Bello, chica.

704
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:23,682

705
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:25,684
Mm, mm.

706
00:48:31,038 --> 00:48:32,909
My teaching days are over.

707
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:35,303
This is my life now.

00:48:53,756 --> 00:48:54,975
Fine.

712
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,585
I will teach you.

713
00:49:00,806 --> 00:49:01,982
Hey!

714
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:03,089
Those are not for you.

715
00:49:03,113 --> 00:49:04,723
Uh, excuse-a, excuse-a.

716
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,422
The name of the game
is sell, sell, sell!

719
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:34,579
Where's Gru?

720
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:36,059
Huh? How should I know?

721
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:37,539
What's with the costumes?

722
00:49:37,582 --> 00:49:39,497
Halloween was four months ago.

723
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:41,499
You look stupid. Buzz off.

724
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:42,718
Shoo!

725
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:44,415
I'm getting my meat tenderizer.

726
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,678
Let me help you
with that, dearie.

727
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:48,289
Uh-uh-uh. Don't touch me.

728
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:49,986
Now, where's the boy?

729
00:49:52,641 --> 00:49:54,425
Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.

730
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:57,254
Don't worry.
We're not mad at him.

731
00:49:57,298 --> 00:49:59,213
We just want to...

732
00:49:59,256 --> 00:50:00,866
hire him.

733
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:05,393
Where is he?

734
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,395
Wild Knuckles, San Pan-pisco.

735
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:09,266
Wild Knuckles is alive?

736
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,355
And working with the kid.

737
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:12,661
- Hmm.
- Oh.

738
00:50:12,704 --> 00:50:14,445
We're going to San Francisco.

739
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:17,100
Let's hit it.

740
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:24,847
You had better be paying
for my roof.

741
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,067
Ay, ay, ay.

742
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,331
- Ooh.
- Pretty groovy, huh?

743
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:39,731
We begin with a basic kick.

744
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:41,907
Now you.

745
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:47,478
Okay.

746
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:48,914
No kicking.

747
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:51,569
This is a melon hammer.
It's a weapon.

748
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:54,268
This is Fred. He is a dummy.

749
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:57,097
Never underestimate a dummy.

750
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,490
- Ha. Dummy.
- Bello, Fred.

751
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:02,189
Now attack!

752
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:11,589
Stuart! Stuart!

753
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:23,471
Fred.

754
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:26,952
Doubt tells me
I cannot break this wood.

755
00:51:26,996 --> 00:51:28,171
Uh-huh.

756
00:51:28,215 --> 00:51:30,695
But doubt exists
only in the mind.

757
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:33,437
You know what I say to my mind?

758
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,267
Now you.

759
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:38,660
Uh, uh...

760
00:51:38,703 --> 00:51:40,052
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

761
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:49,453
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

762
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:10,257
Okay. Clearly, we are not
ready for philosophy.

763
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,215

I just had to fire my henchmen.

You know why? 'Cause they
weren't getting the job done.

That's your evil chuckle?

- Obviously.
- Well, it stinks.

Start with the pool.

Oh, yeah.
I forgot to mention,

830
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,528
the pool is filled

Yeah, well, well,

Be careful.
I can't have you lose an arm,

some light bulbs after this.

how it's done.

00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:22,291
Whoa! Oh, no.

838
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:27,470
Marvin, no, no. Stop that.

839
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:30,995
Whoa. Help! Oh, no.

840
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,128
The net!

841
00:56:34,129 --> 00:56:36,392
I got you! I got you!

842
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:39,003
I don't got you.

843
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:43,791
Take my hand.

844
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:46,489
Whoa. Whoa.

845
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:48,360
I got you!

846
00:56:57,892 --> 00:57:00,808
You could've run,
but you... but you didn't.

847
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,812
I told you, you are my
favorite villain in the world.

848
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:08,511
I could not let you
get eaten by crocodiles.

849
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:11,296
Even though that would've been
kind of cool to watch.

850
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,562
So... so you want to be
a great villain, huh?

851
00:57:15,605 --> 00:57:18,739
That's all I ever wanted.

852
00:57:18,782 --> 00:57:21,393
You want, uh...
I don't know, you want me...

853
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:23,918
you want me to teach you
a thing or two?

854
00:57:23,961 --> 00:57:26,486
Mm-hmm-hmm!

855
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:29,880
Many fighters have asked me,

856
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:33,405
how did I become a great master?

857
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:34,885
Hey, look-a!

858
00:57:44,982 --> 00:57:49,378
Even the smallest of us
are capable of great things.

859
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:51,772
You just dig down deep,

860
00:57:51,815 --> 00:57:54,775
find your inner beast, and...

861
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,173
Uh... gesundheit?

862
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:04,219
Now you try.

863
00:58:04,262 --> 00:58:05,655
Uh...

864
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:22,498
Find your inner beast!

865
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:25,806
Stop this kick.

866
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,076
We have a lot more work to do.

867
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,747
Eh? Eh?

868
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:48,453
Kevin, Stuart and Bob,
you are ready.

869
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:54,111
No, no, no, no, no!

870
00:59:54,155 --> 00:59:57,549
Ready for your junior kung fu
achievement badges.

871
00:59:57,593 --> 01:00:00,030
They're dead.

872
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:08,430
First rule of heist: Always stay in character.

873
01:00:08,473 --> 01:00:10,258
Got it, Grandpa.

874
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:15,567
Say, do you mind
if we use the john?

875
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:18,701
Poindexter here can't
hold it in till we get home.

876
01:00:18,745 --> 01:00:20,224
Uh-huh.

877
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:35,892
The Bank of Evil.

878
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:48,252
It's showtime, kid.

879
01:00:48,296 --> 01:00:51,038
Follow my lead,
and don't forget your cue.

880
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:55,346
Hello. I, uh...
I just need to cash this.

881
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:58,262
Oh, wowie zowie!
What a big bank.

882
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:01,091
How many security guards
are in here?

883
01:01:01,135 --> 01:01:02,658
Who's this little guy?

884
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:05,400
Well, that's my grandson,
who still has not learned

885
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:08,446
that children should be seen
and not heard.

886
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:10,274
Kids.

887
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:12,363
I actually have a son of my own.

888
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:14,757
He looks weird.

889
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:16,716
Oh, don't listen to him.

890
01:01:16,759 --> 01:01:20,197
Your son is very, uh, cute.

891
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:21,808
Hmm.

892
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:24,245
Oh, no!

893
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:25,812
- Mr.
- Oh.

894
01:01:25,855 --> 01:01:28,249
Oh, help!
I'm seeing a white light.

895
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:31,861
Helen, I'm coming for ya!

896
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:37,127
Helen, I'm coming for ya.

897
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:38,520
Oh. Help!

898
01:01:38,563 --> 01:01:41,392
Help my-my pop-pop!

899
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:43,960
Somebody help him!

900
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,222
Huh?

901
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:46,571
My grandpa!

902
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:47,853
We need a doctor!

903
01:01:47,877 --> 01:01:49,923
This is the big one.

904
01:01:49,966 --> 01:01:52,273
- Whoa!
- Oh.

905
01:01:53,491 --> 01:01:55,363
You hear that?

906
01:01:55,406 --> 01:01:57,626
It's the sweet sound of angels.

907
01:01:58,975 --> 01:02:00,847
Help!

908
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:02,239
Do something!

909
01:02:02,283 --> 01:02:04,589
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

910
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:19,474
No, no, no. The other way.

911
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,128
The other way.

912
01:02:24,914 --> 01:02:26,698
All right, everyone stand back.

913
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:28,613
Uh-oh.

914
01:02:28,657 --> 01:02:29,677
- Clear!
- No, wait a minute. Wait.

915
01:02:33,227 --> 01:02:35,229
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

916
01:02:35,272 --> 01:02:36,970
No, no, no, I'm feeling better.

917
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:39,581
Clear!

918
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:41,670
Maximum charge.

919
01:02:41,713 --> 01:02:43,237
- Clear!
- Thank you.

920
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,630
You saved my grandpa.

921
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:48,285
Uh, did we...
did we do the heist?

922
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:52,855
Grandpas say
the darndest things.

923
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:54,857
- You dropped these.
- Um...

924
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:00,384
Look what I got!

925
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:02,169
Hey. Not bad.

926
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,692
Not bad at all.

927
01:03:03,735 --> 01:03:05,215
We make a good team.

928
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:06,608
We do?

929
01:03:06,651 --> 01:03:08,915
Oh, yeah.
Hey, we got to keep at it.

930
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:11,091
Wait till you see what
I'm gonna teach you next.

931
01:03:11,134 --> 01:03:13,354
I cannot wait.

932
01:03:13,397 --> 01:03:15,835
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

933
01:03:20,665 --> 01:03:21,971
Mm-hmm.

934
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:45,386
Yoo-hoo. Mini-Boss.

935
01:03:45,429 --> 01:03:47,040
Okay, Stuart...

936
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,824
Bob...

937
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,870
Time to strike!

938
01:03:54,308 --> 01:03:55,744
- Mini-Boss!
- Yoo-hoo.

939
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:23,772
Aah! They're not here.

940
01:04:23,815 --> 01:04:25,556
Fan out and find them.

941
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:43,923
Something big's going down
in Frisco.

942
01:04:43,966 --> 01:04:46,708
Look-a. Ooh.

943
01:04:53,062 --> 01:04:55,456
- Whoo, there it is.
- Whoa.

944
01:04:59,677 --> 01:05:01,592
It's been one heck
of a ride, little man.

945
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:02,985
Ah, dude.

946
01:05:04,073 --> 01:05:05,901
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

947
01:05:07,685 --> 01:05:09,731
Hey, soul brother, good luck!

948
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:20,829
Wow.

949
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:26,704
Oh...

950
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:29,229
Ooh.

951
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:34,495
My friend, you're now

952
01:05:34,538 --> 01:05:36,845
gonna learn from the old school.

953
01:05:42,459 --> 01:05:44,940
Oh, no.

954
01:06:01,522 --> 01:06:04,351
I can't believe
they did this to me!

955
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,267
I-I taught them
everything they know!

956
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:10,226
We were a team!

957
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:13,055
I give up.

958
01:06:15,753 --> 01:06:19,018
Hey, you are a great bad guy,

959
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:21,411
and they are stupid idiots.

960
01:06:21,455 --> 01:06:23,239
Only dream I ever had

961
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:26,547
was doing bad stuff
with my buddies.

962
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:30,072
Now look at me: Old, alone.

963
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:32,727
Well, you are old,

964
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,729
but you're not alone.

965
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:39,081
All right.

966
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,996
Listen up, buster.

967
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,390
We are starting a new team,

968
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:47,307
and it's going to be called
The Terrible Twos.

969
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,135
We can find a better name later,

970
01:06:49,178 --> 01:06:52,877
but right now
we're going to find that stone

971
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:55,793
and show everybody
that you still got it.

972
01:06:55,837 --> 01:06:58,666
Come on.
You're just a little kid.

973
01:06:58,709 --> 01:07:01,321
It's over. Go home.

974
01:07:01,364 --> 01:07:03,758
- But you said we...
- Go home!

975
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:45,452
Come on, come on. Let's go!

976
01:07:48,237 --> 01:07:50,065
Whoa!

977
01:07:51,414 --> 01:07:53,590
Otto?

978
01:07:57,594 --> 01:07:58,682
Otto!

979
01:07:58,726 --> 01:08:00,684
- Yee-haw!
- Otto!

980
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:02,556
Hyah! Hyah!

981
01:08:03,905 --> 01:08:05,080
Hey!

982
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:07,648
Otto! It's Mini-Boss!

983
01:08:07,691 --> 01:08:09,389
Ah! Mini-Boss!

984
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:13,915
- Mini-Boss!
- Otto!

985
01:08:15,699 --> 01:08:17,179
Look-a! Look-a!

986
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:20,008
Stone-a.

987
01:08:20,051 --> 01:08:21,488
You found the stone.

988
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,533
Otto, I'm so proud of you.

989
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:25,840
Oh...

990
01:08:25,883 --> 01:08:27,450
All right,
we don't have much time.

991
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:29,036
- We got to get this to Wild Knuckles.
- Oh, okay.

992
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,540
Okay.

993
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:32,194
Get him!

994
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:38,505
Go, go, go!

995
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:44,946
Long time, no see, punk.

996
01:08:47,818 --> 01:08:49,733
I'll take that.

997
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,651
Yes!

998
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,219
Don't move!

999
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:58,525
- Huh?
- Right there! Freeze!

1000
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:00,309
Anti-Villain League.

1001
01:09:00,353 --> 01:09:02,616
You are under arrest.

1002
01:09:07,316 --> 01:09:09,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, everybody.

1003
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:12,060
Did you forget what time it is?

1004
01:09:25,813 --> 01:09:27,771
Happy New Year!

1005
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,430
Fire!

1006
01:09:56,147 --> 01:09:57,888
Stand your ground.

1007
01:09:59,586 --> 01:10:01,283
- Look out!
- Whoa!

1008
01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:13,924
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1009
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:15,384
no, no, no, no, no!

1010
01:10:16,603 --> 01:10:18,822
Where do you think
you're going? Hmm?

1011
01:10:18,866 --> 01:10:22,957
You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay!

1012
01:10:29,006 --> 01:10:32,009
Enjoy being torn apart.

1013
01:10:32,053 --> 01:10:34,316
Hey!
...Mini-Boss!

1014
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,709
Guys!

1015
01:10:35,752 --> 01:10:38,668
Oh. Why don't we
make this a fair fight?

1016
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:52,900
Oh, you thought I was serious.

1017
01:10:52,943 --> 01:10:54,858
Run!

1018
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,603
No!

1019
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:05,347
Hello, traitors.

1020
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:08,219
Remember me?

1021
01:11:09,438 --> 01:11:11,048
You.

1022
01:11:11,092 --> 01:11:12,659
You can leave me for dead,

1023
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:14,704
you can destroy
everything I own,

1024
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:17,707
but I will not let you
hurt that kid!

1025
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:19,927
Oh, so you're gonna
save the kid?

1026
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,364
Yeah, you and what army?

1027
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:25,193
This army!

1028
01:11:25,236 --> 01:11:27,195
Okay. This army.

1029
01:12:28,212 --> 01:12:30,998
Dig down deep.

1030
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:33,957
Find your inner beast.

1031
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:12,039
Mmm.

1032
01:13:51,731 --> 01:13:52,949
Otto!

1033
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:55,604
Hurry! Faster!

1034
01:13:57,476 --> 01:13:58,955
No!

1035
01:14:06,789 --> 01:14:08,922
Got you.

1036
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:14,536
Go, go, go!

1037
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:27,767
No.

1038
01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:39,169
Get away from him!

1039
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:40,736
Destroy the kid.

1040
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:51,791
Oh!

1041
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:00,843
No!

1042
01:15:02,366 --> 01:15:05,108
Hey, hey.
How does it feel to be beaten

1043
01:15:05,152 --> 01:15:07,197
by a tubby little punk?

1044
01:15:11,332 --> 01:15:14,117
You guys were amazing!

1045
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:16,772
The kung fu...
Where did that come from?

1046
01:15:16,816 --> 01:15:19,253
Obviously, you guys are rehired.

1047
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:23,344
- Oh.
- Stuart!

1048
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:34,398
♪

1049
01:15:43,016 --> 01:15:45,627
It's all yours, sir.

1050
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:47,194
Where do you want it?

1051
01:15:47,237 --> 01:15:48,761
Can you feel this, sir?
Right here.

1052
01:15:49,936 --> 01:15:51,720
Oh, no.

1053
01:15:51,764 --> 01:15:53,940
Wild Knuckles.

1054
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,900
Hey.

1055
01:15:57,944 --> 01:15:59,902
Y-You're gonna be okay, right?

1056
01:15:59,946 --> 01:16:02,122
Don't worry about me, kid.

1057
01:16:02,165 --> 01:16:03,558
I'll be fine.

1058
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:05,168
Finally.

1059
01:16:05,212 --> 01:16:08,694
You're going away
for a long, long time.

1060
01:16:08,737 --> 01:16:11,522
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't bet on it.

1061
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:13,916
No.

1062
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,832
See you soon, kiddo.

1063
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:22,882
Ooh-la-la.

1064
01:16:51,693 --> 01:16:54,827
Wild Knuckles was
my favorite villain.

1065
01:16:56,263 --> 01:16:59,266
We didn't have much time
together,

1066
01:16:59,309 --> 01:17:01,268
but the time we did have,

1067
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,358
I'm so grateful for.

1068
01:17:04,401 --> 01:17:07,753
I've been thinking about
how you won't see me grow up

1069
01:17:07,796 --> 01:17:09,929
or be there for
all the terrible things

1070
01:17:09,972 --> 01:17:12,192
that I'm going to do.

1071
01:17:12,235 --> 01:17:14,629
And believe me,
there are gonna be

1072
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:16,675
some awful things.

1073
01:17:26,336 --> 01:17:28,599
But I'm going to make you proud.

1074
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:31,820
I'm going to be
the best villain ever

1075
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:33,909
because of you.

1076
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:37,304
Because you taught me
what matters.

1077
01:17:37,347 --> 01:17:39,872
You can't do anything alone.

1078
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:43,310
Find your tribe,

1079
01:17:43,353 --> 01:17:47,618
and never, ever let them go.

1080
01:17:47,662 --> 01:17:49,403
Otto?

1081
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:51,971
Si.

1082
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:37,364
You better stay out
of trouble, kid.

1083
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:41,629
I will lead a good
and honest life.

1084
01:18:43,152 --> 01:18:45,720
You're alive?

1085
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:48,027
Oh!

1086
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:50,725
You just blew my mind.

1087
01:18:50,769 --> 01:18:52,074
How did you do that?

1088
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:55,817
I cannot wait
to fake my own death

1089
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:57,688
to avoid the authorities.

1090
01:18:57,732 --> 01:18:59,473
Shoot for the moon, kid.

1091
01:18:59,516 --> 01:19:00,779
Shoot for the moon.

1092
01:19:02,215 --> 01:19:04,086
See you later, suckers!
