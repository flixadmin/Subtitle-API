This drawing depicts a man
being healed by water.

328
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,669
And look at his eyes.

329
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,630
His face.

330
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,474
Who does that remind you of?

331
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,549
That's impossible.

332
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,393
I mean, this drawing
is 2,000 years old.

333
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,715
I know.

334
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,394
That's him.

335
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,115
That's Ra's al Ghul.

336
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,839
He wants the knife.

337
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,119
I struck out with Falcone.

338
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,830
<i>HARVEY: That right?</i>

339
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,638
Try not to sound too happy about it.

340
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,512
<i>Look, if you brought back Falcone,</i>

341
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,910
<i>that would mean gang wars
and blood in the streets.</i>

342
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,150
<i>And I don 't like it
when the streets are bloody, Jim.</i>

343
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,390
Yeah, see how you like it
with Penguin.

344
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,675
See you tomorrow. Harvey.

345
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,035
SOFIA: Mind if I join you?

346
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,680
What are you doing here?

347
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,233
I figured you didn't know anyone in
town. Thought I'd keep you company.

348
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,313
Or maybe Ijust didn't
want to drink alone.

349
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,389
To my dad.

350
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,039
I am sorry about your father.

351
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,136
We may have had
our differences over the years,

352
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,275
but I always respected him.

353
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

354
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,039
When Iwas a little girl,

355
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,936
if I wanted to spend time
with my father,

356
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,951
he'd have me schedule an appointment.

357
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,950
Save the respect.
I know who my father is.

358
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,954
Took him getting sick for us to
finally have a real relationship.

359
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,720
How long have you lived down here?

360
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,833
<i>Since I was 13.</i>

361
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,680
My father thought sending me away
from Gotham would keep me safe.

362
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,196
I mean,
there are worse places to grow up.

363
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,679
People are happy here.

364
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,558
You see the sun every day.

365
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,597
And I wasn't alone. I had Mario.

366
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,559
We took care of each other.

367
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,038
I know there's nothing I can say.

368
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,998
I am sorry for what happened to him.

369
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,633
You're right.
There is nothing you can say.

370
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,033
He was infected with the virus.

371
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,916
You did what you had to.

Word on the street is

375
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,433
it's an inside job.

376
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,437
Find whoever is in charge of hiring.

377
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,635
Kill them.

378
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,274
I want everyone here interrogated.

379
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,554
There's a traitor amongst us.

I know. What do you think?

386
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,271
I think that rehashing someone else's
idea isn't very original.

It's an homage.

389
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,954
And I thought you'd like it.

390
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,673
It's very nice.

This is so much fun.

If only I were
the criminal mastermind you are,

394
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,398
we would've been together sooner.

395
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,953
I'm sorry,
I don't really follow that.

396
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,471
Well, it took me months
to plan your escape.

397
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,593
I had to learn Penguin's schedule.
When he came and went.

398
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,639
Devise an exit strategy.

399
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,994
I'm sure it would've taken you
two seconds to think something up.

400
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,474
It is slightly impressive you were
able to outwit Oswald.

402
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,469
Though, <i>as</i> you say, my plan
would've taken much less time.

403
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,073
Oh, wait. That is a great idea.

404
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,071
You should tell me
what your plan would've been.

405
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,232
Because a window into your master
villainy would mean so much to me.

Yes.

I've been focused on
repairing the wrong muscle.

What?

423
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,713
Your brain.

424
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,679
It fires synapses that carry neurons
to the rest of your body.

425
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,194
If we can stimulate it,

426
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,998
perhaps your other muscles
will follow.

427
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,075
- Logical.
- Yeah.

428
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,880
- What do you suggest?
- Well,

429
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,956
in anticipation of our partnership,
I have been working on a few

430
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,520
riddles.

431
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,829
Yes!

432
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,716
Riddles!
That's exactly what I need.

433
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,600
That's gonna make me feel like
myself again.

434
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,870
Fire away.

435
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,280
Okay. Here goes.

436
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,830
What's black and white
and red all over?

437
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,710
Easy. Zebra with a gaping hole.
Next.

438
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,719
No, it's actually a newspaper.

439
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,393
That's ridiculous. There's nothing
red on a newspaper. Next.

440
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,552
- Well, it makes sense, if...
- Nextl

441
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Um...

442
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,272
I have a face and two hands,
but no arms or legs.

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,752
Deformed baby. Come on.

445
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,439
Surely, you can do better than this.

446
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,916
The answer is a clock. Hands...

447
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
I think something is wrong
with your brain, Ed.

448
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,959
There is

449
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,950
nothing wrong with my brain.

450
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,711
The problem is your riddles.

451
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,512
Bring me a riddle

452
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,154
that is worthy of my name.

I'II know to pack a swim suit.

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,992
Yeah. I got a nice two-piece.

456
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,311
He comes with a sense of humor.

457
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,032
You ever think about
walking away from it all?

458
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,235
Gotham?

459
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,355
Sometimes.

460
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,829
But I can't.

461
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,029
Why not?

462
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,955
It's in my blood.

463
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,034
My father spent his entire life
fighting for the city.

464
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,840
Never took the easy way out.

465
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,034
Neither can I.

466
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
What?

467
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,760
Give 'em to me.

468
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,273
I don't really think
they're your size.

469
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,155
Come on.

470
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,120
- That too?
- Mmm-hmm.

471
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,750
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

472
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,680
You can't be serious.

473
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,999
Just a little water, Jim.

GORDON: I can't remember the last time
Ijust stood still.

475
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,394
AII right, Master Bruce.

476
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,840
Let's go over the plan again.

477
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,755
It's simple.

478
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,192
I show up at the auction
and buy the knife.

479
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,551
Should be easy enough.
I am a billionaire.

480
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,677
And a very public one at that.

481
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,676
Turning up at the
Penguin's black market auction

482
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,149
is certainly gonna raise
a few eyebrows. Innit?

483
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,480
You're the one that said that
bidding on it was the smarter play.

484
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,753
That I did. But I didn't mean
going in as yourself. Did I?

485
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,629
What do you think the idea was

486
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,314
going down to the docks
pretending to be someone else?

487
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,029
I was trying to teach you a lesson.

488
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,599
Now, if you're going to continue

Master Bruce,

490
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,552
you've got to learn how to assume

491

other roles.

492
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,829
Play the role

You mean behave
like a spoiled brat.

498
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,429
It goes against everything

499
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,949
that your beautiful parents
tried to ingrain in you.

500

overplay our hand, shall we?

512
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,714
I must admit, this is fun.

financial restraint.

I know technically you are
the richest man in the room,

but let's not try and buy
absolutely everything. shall we?

516
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,816
True. But if I only bid on the knife
everyone's been trying to steal

517
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,672
from Penguin,
it might draw his suspicion.

518
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,233
If I go on a spending spree,
recklessly throwing my money around,

Nice. When did you think of that?

My father might not think I'm ready.

652
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,592
But I am.

653
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,195
Is that so?

654
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,918
What do you think I've been doing
down south. the past 10 years?

655
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,433
You knew you were coming back

656
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,272
from the moment
I left your father's house.

657
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,071
Everything that's happened was what?

658
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,880
You sizing me up?

659
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,554
No. Not everything.

660
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,590
But I had to get to know you
if we're gonna work together.

661
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,875
We're not.

662
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,998
Don't be sore, Jim.
You came looking for a gangster.

663
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,593
That's exactly what you found.

664
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,076
We can do great things together,
you and I.

665
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,554
I'Il be in touch.

666
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,470
You?

667
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,078
You're the one who stole from me?

668
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,400
MYRTLE: Some good it did.

669
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,433
The ice broke his brain.

670
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,795
What are you talking about?

671
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,751
What's green and red and goes
round and round?

672
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,150
Frog in a blender.

673
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,876
Exactly.
Ed couldn't even get that.

674
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,474
It does seem unlike Ed
to keep this rube alive.

675
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,711
Sound the word. I want him found.

676
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,110
And her?

677
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,549
A lot of people have been trying to
steal from me lately.

678
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,233
An example needs to be made.

679
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,432
Have fun, Victor.

680
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,716
- Love your dress.
- Thank you.

681
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,309
I made it. (SOBS)

682
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

683
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
(BOTH GRUNTING)

684
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,677
Excellent technique, Barbara.

685
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,915
I'm impressed.

686
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,034
I had a good teacher.

687
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,999
I wish you'd have called ahead.

688
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,191
Does that mean
you don't have the knife?

689
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,152
No. Bruce Wayne has it.

690
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,349
Bruce?

691
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,395
Really?

692
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,509
How interesting.

693
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,597
- Y0u're not angry?
- No. Not at all.

694
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,034
You see, Barbara,

695
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,316
when I bathed you in the Lazarus Pit.

696
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,076
I did it in the knowledge that
you would become

697
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,919
a competent ally of mine.

698
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,595
And so far,

699
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,593
you've done an admirable job.

700
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,435
I'm glad you feel that way.

701
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,672
And I wouldn't worry
about that knife.

702
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,839
Didn't seem all that special to me.

703
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,590
Oh, but you couldn't be more wrong.

704
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,270
You see,

705
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,229
that knife

706
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,439
is the key

707
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,473
to everything.

708
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,632
Well, not everything.

709
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
