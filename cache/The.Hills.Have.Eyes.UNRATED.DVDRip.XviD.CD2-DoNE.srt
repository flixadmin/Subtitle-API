1
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:05,127
<i>Doug! Do something!</i>

2
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,145
Move! You gotta be
a man to do that!

3
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:28,693
I told you to move!
So, move!

4
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,866
Now, get! Get!

5
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:43,301
Whoo!

6
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,512
<i>What you got under there?</i>
<i>That's it. Give it to me. Whoo! Whoo!</i>

7
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,674
Fuck off!

8
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:54,218
Come on. Yeah!

9
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:42,531
Whoo!

10
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,603
Whoo.

11
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:53,303
<i>It's not my Bob!</i>
<i>It's not my Bob!</i>

12
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:56,813
Come on, Mom. No! Let's go.
No, just come on.

13
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,976
It's not my Bob.

14
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,679
What was that?

15
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,916
Mom, just stay here, okay?

16
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:13,292
<i>- Help! Help! Help!</i>

17
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:21,431
Oh, you fat.

18
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,134
Oh. Big, fat...

19
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,643
and juicy.

20
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:46,390
No. No, please!

21
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:06,777
Bobby!
Bobby, where you going?

22
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,853
Fucking kill those motherfuckers!

23
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:12,481
<i>Get back here! Don't do something stupid!</i>

24
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:22,365
No. No.

25
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,443
Get back to the trailer!

26
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,434
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Get out the door!</i>

27
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,774
Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!

28
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,541
- Brenda!
- Bobby!

29
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,777
Come on, now.
Look at me. Look at me.

30
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:50,082
That's it. Look at me.

31
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,250
Shit! I'll come back for ya.

32
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,759
Brenda!

33
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,997
Bitch stuck me like a pig!

34
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:18,209
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

35
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,094
No.

36
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,572
Oh, God!

37
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:49,203
Don't move! Don't move, honey. Don't move.

38
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,748
Okay. Okay. All right.
You're gonna be okay.

39
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,377
You're gonna be okay. S-Sweetheart?

40
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:57,785
Okay.

41
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,223
Honey? Sweetheart?

42
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,091
Lynn, come on!

43
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:07,995
Lynn!

44
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,030
Come on!

45
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,877
Oh!

46
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,819
Hmm.

47
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,096
<i>Okay.</i>

48
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,586
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

49
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:23,966
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

50
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,704
What are we gonna do
if they come back, Doug?

51
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:37,386
This trailer is so small.
I clean and clean.

52
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,389
- It's still a mess.
- Shh.

53
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,550
<i>It's a mess.</i>

54
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,927
- Is Big Bob home?
- Not yet.

55
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:54,129
Every- Everybody went to bed?

56
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,139
- Yes?
- Yeah.

57
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:59,472
Brenda's right here,
and Bobby's in the back.

58
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,445
Is Lynny sleeping? Hmm?

59
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:10,486
You need anything?

60
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,750
- A blanket.
- Okay.

61
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,758
- It's cold.
- Okay.

62
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,422
- It's cold.
- Shh. Shh. Nice and warm, huh? Nice and warm.

63
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:32,042
You're so sweet, Doug.

64
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:38,449
I understand why Lynny
loves you so much.

65
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,643
So-

66
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,131
I'm not gonna take this shit.

67
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,861
- Hey, we're not going anywhere!
You wanna die too?
- I don't fucking care!

68
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,962
You wanna die, huh?
Look what they did to your mother!

69
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,633
Look what they did to your sister!
Huh? You stop and think!

70
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:06,836
You're not a fucking child anymore!
You won't make it three feet out there.

71
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:10,108
We need a plan.
We need to think.

72
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:12,183
- We need-We need to think.
- Think about what?

73
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,184
Think about what, Doug?
They have Catherine!

74
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,153
They have your daughter.
And you're just gonna sit here and do nothing?

75
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,485
That's 'cause you're a fucking pussy
just like my dad said!

76
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,890
- Shut the fuck up! You shut up! Shut your mouth!
- Fuck you.

77
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,824
<i>No! Turn the lights on.</i>

78
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,403
<i>Turn the lights on.</i>
<i>Turn the lights on.</i>

79
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:36,668
<i>- He said he's coming back!</i>
- Shh! Quiet!

80
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,403
He said he's coming back
for me. Please.

81
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:45,708
It's them! It's them!
It's them!

82
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:55,584
<i>Goggle? Goggle?</i>

83
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,274
<i>Goggle? You copy, Goggle?</i>

84
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:50,247
<i>Where's Goggle?</i>

85
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:53,943
<i> He stayed back there.</i>
<i>He's keeping an eye on them.</i>

86
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:58,455
- I told you.
- What?

87
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:03,756
<i>I told you,</i>
<i>you've gotta kill them all!</i>

88
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,382
Beast! Beast! You're alive!

89
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,511
<i>Oh, good boy.</i>
<i>Good boy. Good boy.</i>

90
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,613
- Good boy.
- Oh, my God.

91
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:36,353
<i>Jupiter's going to finish them off.</i>

92
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,520
Why are you doing this to us?

93
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,794
Why are you doing this?
You hear me?

94
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,801
Give me back my baby!

95
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,803
What the fuck
do you want from us?

96
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:54,401
What do you want?

97
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,708
You give me back my little girl.
You hear me?

98
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:16,161
- Bobby?
<i>- Hmm?</i>

99
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,168
How many bullets
do you have left?

100
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,670
A clip and a half.

101
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:24,098
What are we doing?

102
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,456
Which way, Beast? Which way?
Come on. Follow the trail.

103
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:29,238
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

104
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,204
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

105
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,983
Where are they, boy?

106
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,553
Which way, Beast?

107
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:35,966
Good boy.

108
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,306
Bobby?

109
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,037
Bobby, I followed the blood trail.

110
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:25,276
It leads to a town or something
out here. Bobby?

111
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:26,709
Who knows?
Maybe someone heard our calls.

112
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,541
Nobody's gonna hear
the fucking calls, Brenda!

113
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,081
Nobody's gonna see the goddamn smoke
in this goddamn desert!

114
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:35,550
We're in the middle of freakin'-
Ah, shit!

115
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:38,986
<i>- God!</i>

116
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:48,831
I'm sorry.

117
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:59,769
I'm so scared.

118
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,971
Who are these people?

119
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:30,484
<i>Good dog. Stay.</i>

120
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,518
<i>- Did you push her?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

121
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,645
<i>- Did you destroy the furniture?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

122
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:40,724
<i>Did you call her</i>
<i>trailer park trash?</i>

123
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:51,358
<i>- So, now, you're saying you still</i>-
<i>- I'm still in love with her.</i>

124
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,801
<i>Okay, but-So, you said</i>
<i>you treasured the marriage...</i>

125
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,136
and you wanted to end it
two weeks after you got into it?

126
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,209
<i>I wanted to end it</i>
<i>because I have</i>-

127
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,801
I had a feeling that things
weren't gonna work together.

128
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,508
She wasn't working as a team player
with me, and I tried coaching her-

129
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:07,709
<i>- What were you doing coaching her?</i>
<i>- Well, I tried to show</i>-

130
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,253
<i>- Is she your child?</i>
<i>- No, she's not my child, but she</i>-

131
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:12,754
Shh, shh, shh.

132
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,984
<i>She wanted me</i>
<i>to eat dinner-spaghetti</i>-

133
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:19,392
<i>and I wanted to do it</i>
<i>before it got cold.</i>

134
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,155
Watch her head, Bobby.

135
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,673
Come on.

136
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,522
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

137
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,825
<i>Answer me!</i>

138
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:24,298
I don't know where she is.

139
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:28,667
I never leave this place.

140
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:35,979
Your people asked our families...

141
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,139
<i>to leave their town...</i>

142
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:42,879
and you destroyed our homes.

143
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:47,754
<i>We went into the mines.</i>

144
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:52,386
<i>You set off your bombs...</i>

145
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:55,260
and turned everything to ashes.

146
00:28:56,834 --> 00:29:01,828
You made us what we've become.

147
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,534
<i>Boom. Boom. Boom!</i>

148
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,111
Where's my baby?

149
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:13,183
What's so funny?

150
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:18,017
It's breakfast time!

151
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,468
Please don't kill me.

152
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:28,970
<i>"Please don't kill me."</i>

153
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:33,099
<i>- Please don't kill me.</i>
<i>- "Please don't kill me."</i>

154
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:07,468
Lizard.

155
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:09,539
Kill the baby.

156
00:36:05,762 --> 00:36:09,858
Baby. Baby.

157
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:32,312
Get out of the way, Ruby.

158
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:36,324
I said get. Now, get!

159
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:52,200
<i>Mister, would you play with us?</i>

160
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,393
