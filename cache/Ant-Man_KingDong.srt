1
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,965
Stark!

2
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:22,655
He doesn't seem happy.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,045
Hello, Hank.

4
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,415
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,204
I took a detour...

6
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,407
...through your defense lab.

7
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:35,072
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

8
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:39,655
That depends if you think
it's a poor attempt to replicate my work.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,968
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

10
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:44,615
You were instructed to go to Russia.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,642
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

12
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:47,793
I'm a scientist.

13
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:49,468
Then act like one.

14
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:52,093
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

15
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,361
Help us put it to good use.

16
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,893
I let you turn me into your errand boy,
and now you try to steal my research?

17
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,232
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,886
Ah...

19
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:08,906
Easy, Hank.

20
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:15,075
You mention my wife again
and I'll show you ferocity.

21
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:16,717
Don't look at me. You said it.

22
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:20,215
I formally tender my resignation.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,561
We don't accept it. Formally.

24
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:23,822
Hank,

25
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:25,619
we need you.

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,586
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.
Don't let your past determine the future.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,018
As long as I am alive,
nobody will ever get that formula.

28
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,863
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

29
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:48,095
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,283
Yes.

31
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:52,815
Our scientists haven't come close to
replicating his work.

32
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,935
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,697
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

34
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:01,690
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.
He's no security risk.

35
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,557
Unless we make him one.

36
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:45,629
You like that?

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,046
You like that?

38
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,516
Come get you some now.

39
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:01,366
You didn't even move.

40
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:02,935
Nah.

41
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,241
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

42
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,267
You see this right here?

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,502
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

44
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,330
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

45
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:22,143
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,221
All right, break it up.

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,557
Break it up! Break it up!

48
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,109
Scotty!

49
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:46,960
What's up, man!

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,615
Damn! Hey.

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,927
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

52
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,135
Hey, what's up with your eye?

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,132
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

54
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:59,185
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

55
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,031
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,446
You know what? I'm still the only one
who knocked him out.

57
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,507
Well, I definitely didn't.

58
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,832
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,320
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss
my celly getting out?

60
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:12,775
Hey, how's your girl, man?

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,961
Oh, she left me.

62
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,750
- Oh.
- Yeah, my ma died, too.

63
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:19,205
And my dad got deported.

64
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:21,742
But I got the van!

65
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,390
- It's nice.
- Yeah, right?

66
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:26,336
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

67
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:28,648
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

68
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:30,295
You're gonna be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

69
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,815
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,446
And I gotta introduce you to some people.
Some really skilled people.

71
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,215
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,561
No, I'm serious, man. I'm not going back.

73
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,093
I got a daughter to take care of.

74
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,455
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,404
Look, man, I got a master's in
electrical engineering, all right?

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,321
I'm gonna be fine.

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,015
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

78
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,042
Would you like to try
our Mango Fruit Blast?

79
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,148
Uh, no, thanks.

80
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:00,695
Um, I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

81
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:03,283
Oh, we don't... We don't make that.

82
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:06,335
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

83
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,249
It's ice cream. Baskin-Robbins.

84
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,767
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

85
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,343
Dude.

86
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:14,496
Can I see you in the back, chief?

87
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,375
Pronto.

88
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,734
Sure thing, Dale.

89
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:20,756
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

90
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,809
- Hey, Dale.
- Come on in.

91
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,495
Pull up some chair.

92
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,295
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

93
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:33,575
You found out.

94
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,895
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,287
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But I...

96
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,055
No one would hire me.

97
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,526
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

98
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,257
Look, I'm sorry.

99
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:46,281
I don't do it anymore. I just...

100
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,307
Respect.

101
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,735
I couldn't be happier about it.

102
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,171
- Really?
- Yeah.

103
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:53,255
Thank you. Thank you.

104
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,851
You really stuck it to
those billionaire SOBs.

105
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,437
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

106
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,554
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?"

107
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:02,476
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

108
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,047
Well, I'm very happy in this job, and
I really just appreciate the opportunity to...

109
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:09,304
Well, you're fired, of course.

110
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,415
I can't really keep you on.

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,124
Wait, what? Fired?

112
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,148
Yeah.

113
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,455
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

114
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,415
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

115
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,775
I'll tell you what, though.

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,963
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

117
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:30,348
but if you want to grab one of those Mango
Fruit Blasts on your way out the door,

118
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:32,671
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

119
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,851
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

120
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,185
I thought you were supposed to be at work.

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,043
I was. I got fired.

122
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:18,895
Damn. They find out who you are?

123
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,967
Yeah.

124
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,817
Baskin-Robbins always finds out, bro.

125
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,763
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

126
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:27,093
- You want some waffles?
- Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

127
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:28,548
Oh. That's Kurt.

128
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,961
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

129
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:34,361
- Nice meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,287
Who are you?

131
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:37,822
Dave.

132
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,554
Nice work on the Vista job.

133
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:42,895
Vista job, yes.

134
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,400
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

135
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:48,895
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

136
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:51,695
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

137
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,165
You mean you're a pussy.

138
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:54,375
Yeah.

139
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,295
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

140
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,815
And it added up to millions.

141
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,765
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

142
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,629
And what does he do?
He hacks into the security system

143
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,325
and transfers millions back to the people
that they stole it from.

144
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,273
Posts all the bank records online.

145
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,458
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

146
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,703
What are you doing?

147
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,057
Hmm?

148
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:19,295
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

149
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,606
What do you want?

150
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:21,735
Okay.

151
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,691
My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago
about this little perfect job.

152
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,575
No way.

153
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,859
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

154
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,884
No!

155
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:32,495
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

156
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,662
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

157
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,655
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

158
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,586
I don't care. I'm out.

159
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:58,895
Dr. Pym?

160
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,140
Yes. I'm still alive.

161
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:09,382
ID?

162
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:12,624
Perhaps that will suffice.

163
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,921
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

164
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:21,226
Is that Hank Pym?

165
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:26,705
Good morning, Hank.

166
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:29,175
Hope.

167
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,680
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

168
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,524
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

169
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,914
More like "thrilled".

170
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,600
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

171
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,135
What's the occasion?

172
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,367
Oh, you'll see.

173
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,308
Won't he, Hope?

174
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,174
We're ready for you inside.

175
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,378
Ouch.

176
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:59,015
I guess some old wounds never heal, huh?

177
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,724
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

178
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,390
You're in for a treat.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,992
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

180
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,242
How's your face?

181
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:17,961
After you.

182
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,942
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

183
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:31,407
This company's founder and my mentor,

184
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,081
Dr. Hank Pym.

185
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,734
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,

186
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,001
I immediately started researching
a particle

187
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,895
that could change
the distance between atoms,

188
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,764
while increasing density and strength.

189
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:01,971
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

190
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:06,065
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

191
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:12,842
But just imagine,
a soldier the size of an insect.

192
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,010
The ultimate secret weapon.

193
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:32,003
An Ant-Man.

194
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,526
That's what they called you. Right, Hank?

195
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,039
Silly, I know.

196
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:42,627
Propaganda.

197
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,849
Tales to astonish!

198
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,198
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

199
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:52,255
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

200
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,807
every single time I asked you,

201
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:59,221
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,610
Just a tall tale.

203
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:02,682
Right.

204
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,790
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

205
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,975
Well, I was inspired by
the legend of the Ant-Man.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,844
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

207
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,742
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

208
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:28,365
Could that be done?

209
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:33,234
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

210
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,125
Distinguished guests,

211
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:40,682
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

212
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:42,484
The Yellowjacket!

213
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,563
Oh, no.

214
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:53,117
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war,

215
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:58,402
capable of altering the size of the wearer
for the ultimate combat advantage.

216
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,757
We live in an era in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves

217
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,711
are undermined by constant surveillance.

218
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:07,758
It's time to return to a simpler age.

219
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:11,656
One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly

220
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:13,125
to protect their interests.

221
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:15,979
An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,

222
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:20,176
The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict
on the geopolitical landscape

223
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:22,045
completely unseen.

224
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:26,168
Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.

225
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,950
Practical applications
include surveillance,

226
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,453
industrial sabotage,

227
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,180
and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.

228
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:41,609
A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited
influence to carry out protective actions.

229
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:45,055
And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets

230
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,086
will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.

231
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,257
The Yellowjacket.

232
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,651
So, it's a suit?

233
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,849
Don't be crude, Frank.

234
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:02,883
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

235
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,055
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

236
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,970
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

237
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,891
Imagine what our enemies could do
with this tech.

238
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,691
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

239
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,242
I really value your opinion.

240
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,413
Thank you for coming.

241
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:18,198
Hope?

242
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,451
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

243
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:22,602
Thank you.

244
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,575
You seem a bit shocked.

245
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,889
Darren, there's a reason that
I buried these secrets.

246
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,828
So you finally admit it!

247
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:38,239
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

248
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,575
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

249
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,445
Don't do this.

250
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,150
Dr. Cross?

251
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,285
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

252
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,281
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

253
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:52,512
Deal.

254
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,455
We have to make our move, Hank.

255
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,527
How close is he?

256
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,852
He still can't shrink a live subject.

257
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:09,975
Just give me the suit and
let me finish this once and for all.

258
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,001
No.

259
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,129
I have Cross' complete trust.

260
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:15,316
- It's too dangerous.
- We don't have a choice.

261
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:17,908
Well, that's not entirely true.

262
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:21,749
I think I found a guy.

263
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,578
Who?

264
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,535
Daddy!

265
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,050
Peanut! Oh!

266
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:33,945
Happy birthday!

267
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,399
I'm so sorry I'm late.

268
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:37,028
I didn't know
what time your party started.

269
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:38,543
It was on the invitation.

270
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:40,535
He didn't get an invitation.

271
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,135
But he came anyway!

272
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,130
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

273
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:46,984
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

274
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,017
Oh, you don't...

275
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:49,175
What are you doing here, Lang?

276
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,725
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

277
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,434
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

278
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,609
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

279
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,956
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

280
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:01,047
Hey, look what I have for you.

281
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:02,815
Can I open it now?

282
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,569
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

283
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,629
You're my bestest friend.

284
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:11,815
What is that thing?

285
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,569
He's so ugly!

286
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,175
I love him!

287
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,725
Can I go show my friends?

288
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,547
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

289
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,040
You're my bestest friend.

290
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,172
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

291
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,237
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

292
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,906
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

293
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,617
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
- It's my house!

294
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:32,202
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

295
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:35,775
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

296
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,847
It's a birthday party.

297
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,556
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

298
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,582
She's my daughter.

299
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,102
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

300
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:45,212
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

301
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:47,234
Your fiancé is an asshat.

302
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,521
He's not an asshat.

303
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:51,436
- Hey, watch your language. Okay?
- What language? I said "hat".

304
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:52,555
Stop it.

305
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,248
Really, Maggie? That guy?

306
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:59,365
Come on! You could marry anyone you want,
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

307
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,090
At least he's not a crook.

308
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,684
I'm trying, okay? I've changed.
I'm straight.

309
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,156
I had a job and...

310
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,687
I wanna provide.

311
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:13,238
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

312
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:14,367
So much.

313
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:17,523
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

314
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,881
What do I do?

315
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:20,864
Get an apartment,

316
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,840
get a job, pay child support.

317
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,094
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

318
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,728
You're her hero, Scott.

319
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,546
Just be the person that
she already thinks you are.

320
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,490
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

321
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,088
Yeah. Well, uh...

322
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,643
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

323
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:10,921
It'd be nice though, right?

324
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,468
But there are laws.

325
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,525
What laws? Of man?

326
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:18,095
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

327
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,282
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

328
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,429
Darren, I don't think you understand...

329
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,641
Hmm.

330
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,186
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

331
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:41,606
Goodbye, Frank.

332
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,723
Thank you.

333
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:03,434
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

334
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,176
And today,
during my morning meditation,

335
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:09,239
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

336
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,473
How's that?

337
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:12,307
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

338
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:17,432
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

339
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,166
I devoted my genius to him.

340
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,083
I could have worked anywhere.

341
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,331
I chose my mentor poorly.

342
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,049
You didn't even have a choice.

343
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,762
He never believed in you.

344
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:35,153
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

345
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:38,715
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

346
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:42,512
Because his failures as a mentor,

347
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,512
as a father,

348
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:48,231
forced us to spread our wings.

349
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,200
You're a success, Darren.

350
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,521
You deserve everything coming your way.

351
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:17,658
Ooh.

352
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,340
Stop cheating.

353
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:21,872
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

354
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,809
Maybe he didn't hear you.

355
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,161
How was the party?

356
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,523
Tell me about that tip.

357
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:35,464
What?

358
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:37,575
I wanna know about that tip.

359
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:40,295
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

360
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,721
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

361
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,032
It's gotta be airtight.

362
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,015
Okay.

363
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,281
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

364
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,735
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

365
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,080
But there was a rosé that saved the day.
It was delightful.

366
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:55,815
And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.

367
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,047
It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.

368
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,179
It's the wrong details.
It has nothing to do with the story.

369
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:02,309
Go.

370
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,761
So, uh, he tells me that she's working as
a housekeeper now, right?

371
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:10,215
And she's dating this dude, Carlos,
who's a shot caller from across the bay.

372
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,323
And she tells him about
the dude that she's cleaning for.

373
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,823
Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO.
That is all retired now, but he's loaded.

374
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:21,815
And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,

375
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,495
and they get to talking, right?

376
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:26,034
And here comes the good part. Carlos says,

377
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:31,166
"Yo, man. This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."

378
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,680
Of course Ernesto comes to me because
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

379
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:34,706
Of course, I ask him...

380
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:38,053
"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"

381
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,752
And he says, "Nah, dawg.
All she said is that it's super-legit

382
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:43,939
and whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."

383
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,150
What?

384
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,655
Old man have safe.

385
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:52,815
And he's gone for a week.

386
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,055
All right. There's an old man,
he's got a safe, and he's gone for a week.

387
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,361
Let's just work with that.

388
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:58,685
You know what I'm saying?

389
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,690
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

390
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:53,002
No one will be making for
distress call tonight.

391
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:54,089
Comm check.

392
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,360
- Check.
- Check.

393
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:57,710
Hey, if the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

394
00:22:57,735 --> 00:23:00,986
Don't worry. It's not gonna happen.

395
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,444
I love it when he gets cocky.

396
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:12,423
Damn!

397
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,361
Alarm is dead.

398
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:42,433
Nice.

399
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,462
All right, I'm moving through the house.

400
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:14,295
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

401
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,926
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

402
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:19,088
Aw, man, are we screwed?

403
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,715
Not necessarily.

404
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,161
I'm in.

405
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:13,395
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

406
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,044
Oh, man.

407
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,615
What is it?

408
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,819
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

409
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,035
How serious are we talking, Scotty?

410
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,675
It's a Carbondale.

411
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:32,221
It's from 1910.
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

412
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,051
Wow. Can you crack it?

413
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,478
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

414
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:39,975
Remember what that iceberg did?

415
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,729
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

416
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:42,855
Killed everybody.

417
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,682
Did not kill the Old lady.
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

418
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,422
What are you doing?

419
00:26:40,447 --> 00:26:43,087
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

420
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,041
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

421
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,522
- What are you doing now?
- Waiting.

422
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,121
Waiting.

423
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,361
Nice.

424
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,250
What is it? Cash? Jewels?

425
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,363
- There's nothing here.
- What did you say?

426
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,889
- It's a suit.
- What?

427
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,407
It's an old motorcycle suit.

428
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:18,375
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

429
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,439
No.

430
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:21,806
It's a bust.

431
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:26,124
I'm really sorry, Scotty.
I know you needed to score.

432
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,251
I thought we were using mice.

433
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,241
What's the difference?

434
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:10,535
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

435
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:12,415
Darren, maybe we should think...

436
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,920
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

437
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,947
I can't go to the buyers with
half a breakthrough.

438
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:46,887
Experiment 34-C results, negative.

439
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,790
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

440
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:07,509
Why would you lock this up?

441
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,601
This is so weird.

442
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,830
Scotty, what's up, man?

443
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,607
I wonder... What is this?

444
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,571
The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?

445
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,001
What? Who said that?

446
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,329
Luis, down here!

447
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,643
It's a trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case,

448
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,925
water.

449
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:28,741
Guess you're tougher than you thought.

450
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,805
Oh, I don't want to see this!

451
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:34,720
Luis!

452
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,508
Son of a...

453
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,118
What the hell?

454
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,968
Not bad for a test drive.
Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.

455
00:33:04,993 --> 00:33:07,041
No! No! No, thank you!

456
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:21,252
Get down on the ground!

457
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:22,895
You are under arrest!

458
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,685
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

459
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,801
Oh...

460
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,770
Don't move.

461
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,994
You know, you almost had us convinced
that you were gonna change your ways.

462
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:40,914
They were really rooting for you.

463
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,602
It's gonna break their hearts.

464
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,603
You got a visitor.

465
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:49,808
Who?

466
00:33:50,223 --> 00:33:51,224
Your lawyer.

467
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,331
My lawyer?

468
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:58,784
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

469
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,366
I'm starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

470
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,201
Oh, man.

471
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,776
Sit down.

472
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,564
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

473
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:15,478
I don't even wanna know why you have it.

474
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,568
Maggie was right about you.

475
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,183
How do you know about...

476
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,248
No wonder she's trying to
keep you away from Cassie.

477
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:26,765
The moment things get hard,
you turn right back to crime.

478
00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:31,411
The way I see it, you have a choice.

479
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,171
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

480
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,920
or go back to your cell
and await further instructions.

481
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,411
I don't understand.

482
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,494
No, I don't expect you to.

483
00:34:43,634 --> 00:34:46,815
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

484
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,171
neither do I.

485
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,975
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

486
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,103
What?

487
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:07,695
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

488
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:10,815
So, next time you think you might see one,

489
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,142
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

490
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:29,615
You're my bestest friend!

491
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,680
Are you sure you don't want
a different toy?

492
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:33,628
No, I love this one.

493
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,971
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

494
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,011
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

495
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:44,797
Is Daddy a bad man?
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

496
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,926
No.

497
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:50,755
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

498
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,284
Smart choice. You actually listened,
for once.

499
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,321
Under the door.

500
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,095
Okay, where to now?

501
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,076
Hang tight.

502
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,130
Oh, God.

503
00:36:58,861 --> 00:36:59,961
What, what?

504
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,472
- Where the hell did he go?
- I have no idea. He just vanished.

505
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,448
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

506
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:05,679
Get back! Get back!

507
00:37:05,704 --> 00:37:08,310
Scott, these are my associates.

508
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:10,375
Is that a camera on an ant?

509
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,335
Yeah, sure. Why not?

510
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,415
Where's the car?

511
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,090
No car. We've got wings.

512
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:16,236
Incoming!

513
00:37:26,406 --> 00:37:29,385
Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.

514
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,410
- How safe is...
- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

515
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,087
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

516
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,619
So they can give you a lift
past their five-block perimeter.

517
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:52,109
All right.

518
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:53,355
Now, what's the next move?

519
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:54,323
Hang on tight.

520
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:56,112
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

521
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:57,787
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

522
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:00,025
You're throwing 247 off balance.

523
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,392
Wait, his name is 247?

524
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,181
He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.

525
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,966
Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?

526
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:07,710
Whoa!

527
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:09,578
Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.

528
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:11,210
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

529
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:13,091
No, I think it's 247.

530
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:13,740
Wait.

531
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:14,827
Hang on tight!

532
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:17,425
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

533
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,284
I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.

534
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:21,309
What?

535
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,329
- Can I make one little request?
- No.

536
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,523
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

537
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:28,665
Time out.

538
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:29,934
All right, hold on.

539
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,755
Just wait! Whoa!

540
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,095
What happens if I throw up in this helmet?

541
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,179
It's my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up.

542
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:40,093
Let's set her down, all right?
I'm getting light-headed.

543
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,401
Hang on, Scott.

544
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:43,921
I'm getting a little light...

545
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:45,835
I need a snooze button.

546
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:48,632
Hit me in 5 minutes.

547
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:08,642
Hello.

548
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,361
Who are you?

549
00:39:15,612 --> 00:39:18,309
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

550
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:19,462
Yes.

551
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:20,601
Why?

552
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,600
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

553
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,940
Oh. Oh.

554
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:28,441
Hey, look...

555
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,361
Whoa!

556
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:36,775
Paraponera clavata.

557
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:39,992
Giant tropical bullet ants, ranked
highest on the Schmidt pain index.

558
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,880
They're here to keep an eye on you
when I can't.

559
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,533
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

560
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,361
Who?

561
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:50,775
Hey!

562
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,377
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

563
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,803
How am I supposed to do this?

564
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,123
All right, just one step at a time.

565
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,241
Ugh!

566
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:20,375
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

567
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,579
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

568
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,855
We don't need this guy.

569
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,415
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

570
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:33,055
I did. She's great.

571
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,242
She doesn't think that we need you.

572
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,815
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

573
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,135
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

574
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,731
and then Hope has you arrested.

575
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:45,804
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

576
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,524
She's a little bit anxious.

577
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:49,575
It has to do with this job,

578
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,126
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

579
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:54,495
I take it that you're interested in.

580
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,646
What job?

581
00:40:55,671 --> 00:40:56,832
Would you like some tea?

582
00:40:57,446 --> 00:40:58,953
Uh... Sure.

583
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,690
I was very impressed with how
you managed to get past my security system.

584
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:07,822
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

585
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,495
Were you watching me?

586
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,179
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

587
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,444
Oh! Excuse me.

588
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,534
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

589
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,091
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

590
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,984
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

591
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,617
But you beat it.

592
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:31,335
Would you like some sugar?

593
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,679
Yeah, thanks.

594
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,080
You know what? I'm okay.

595
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,202
How do you make them do that?

596
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,975
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

597
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,641
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

598
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:53,828
Right. But how do you make them do that?

599
00:41:55,785 --> 00:42:01,394
I use electromagnetic waves to
stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

600
00:42:02,506 --> 00:42:04,395
I speak to them.

601
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:08,491
I can go anywhere, hear anything,
and see everything.

602
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:10,554
And still know absolutely nothing.

603
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,133
I'm late to meet Cross.

604
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:17,735
Uh... Dr. Pym?

605
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,081
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

606
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:22,843
Sorry, I just have one question.

607
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,535
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

608
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,210
and can I go back to jail now?

609
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,722
Come with me.

610
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:33,512
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

611
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,726
Huh?

612
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,041
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

613
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:38,795
That's what powers the suit.

614
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,604
That's why it works.

615
00:42:41,737 --> 00:42:42,738
Wow.

616
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,804
- Whoa!
- But it was dangerous.

617
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,468
It was too dangerous.

618
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,768
So I hid it from the world.

619
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,570
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

620
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,561
Pym Tech.

621
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,806
Yes.

622
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,468
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

623
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,880
Darren Cross.

624
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:10,055
He's a big deal.

625
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,560
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

626
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,964
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

627
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:19,415
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

628
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,640
he began to suspect that
I wasn't telling him everything.

629
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,815
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

630
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,049
and he became obsessed with
recreating my formula.

631
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,655
But I wouldn't help him.

632
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,526
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

633
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,175
How could he do that?

634
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,366
The board's chairman is my daughter, Hope.
She was the deciding vote.

635
00:43:43,513 --> 00:43:48,351
But she came back to me when she saw
how close Cross was to cracking my formula.

636
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,586
The process is highly volatile.

637
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,891
If one isn't protected by
a specialized helmet,

638
00:43:54,914 --> 00:43:57,390
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

639
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,735
I don't think Darren realizes this,

640
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,468
and, you know,
he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

641
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:06,395
So, what do you want from me?

642
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,206
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

643
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:13,232
Do you?

644
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,805
I do.

645
00:44:15,378 --> 00:44:17,015
If you can help me,

646
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,761
I promise I can help you
be with your daughter again.

647
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,167
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

648
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:29,686
Absolutely. My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

649
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,125
What do you want me to do?

650
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,552
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

651
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:40,218
Are you gonna be home for dinner tonight?

652
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:44,039
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up.
Text me.

653
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:45,867
Okay. Good news?

654
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,054
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

655
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:50,508
Are you trying to find my daddy?

656
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:54,402
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

657
00:44:55,454 --> 00:44:57,078
I just want your daddy to be safe.

658
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,532
Hope you don't catch him.

659
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:50,042
This isn't the first time these guys have tried
to get their hands on game-changing weaponry.

660
00:45:50,211 --> 00:45:53,953
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

661
00:45:53,978 --> 00:45:56,625
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

662
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:58,970
He always wanted my tech.

663
00:45:58,995 --> 00:46:02,317
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

664
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,470
and destroy all the data,

665
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,578
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

666
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,165
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

667
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,244
I spent half my life

668
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:23,432
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

669
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:27,078
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

670
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:30,668
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

671
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,406
This could change the texture of reality.

672
00:46:35,282 --> 00:46:39,332
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

673
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:42,062
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

674
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,658
Scott, they are ants.

675
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,765
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

676
00:46:49,808 --> 00:46:54,655
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

677
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,287
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean,
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

678
00:46:58,424 --> 00:47:00,506
He's right, Hank. And you know it.

679
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:03,218
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

680
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:07,368
I was against using him when we had months,
and now we have days.

681
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,495
I'm wearing the suit.

682
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,931
Absolutely not!

683
00:47:09,956 --> 00:47:12,880
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

684
00:47:12,905 --> 00:47:14,539
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

685
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:17,249
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

686
00:47:17,274 --> 00:47:19,720
- We don't have time to screw around!
- Hope, please listen to me...

687
00:47:19,745 --> 00:47:21,437
He is a criminal! I'm your daughter.

688
00:47:21,462 --> 00:47:22,609
No!

689
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,804
She's right, Hank. I'm not your guy.

690
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,541
Why don't you wear the suit?

691
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:09,929
You think I don't want to?

692
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:11,194
I can't.

693
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:17,508
I spent years wearing it,
and it took a toll on me.

694
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,371
You're our only option.

695
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:34,735
Before Hope lost her mother,

696
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,685
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

697
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,848
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

698
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:49,084
It's too late for me,

699
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,129
but not for you.

700
00:48:52,367 --> 00:48:54,215
This is your chance.

701
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,847
The chance to earn
that look in your daughter's eyes.

702
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:01,811
To become the hero that
she already thinks you are.

703
00:49:02,403 --> 00:49:04,656
It's not about saving our world.

704
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:08,375
It's about saving theirs.

705
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,523
Damn. That was a good speech.

706
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,201
Scott,

707
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:19,914
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

708
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,535
In the right hands,

709
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,848
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

710
00:49:27,873 --> 00:49:31,234
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

711
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,523
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

712
00:49:34,548 --> 00:49:35,797
you need to be fast.

713
00:49:35,822 --> 00:49:39,166
You should be able to shrink and grow
on a dime.

714
00:49:39,455 --> 00:49:42,777
So your size always suits your needs.

715
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:46,055
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

716
00:49:46,242 --> 00:49:50,051
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

717
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:53,445
Ow!

718
00:49:55,174 --> 00:49:56,175
Ahhh!

719
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:57,653
Ow!

720
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,981
Useless.

721
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:04,843
When you're small, energy's compressed,
so you have the force of a 200-pound man

722
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:08,156
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

723
00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:11,562
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

724
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,263
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

725
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,044
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

726
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:16,020
Show me.

727
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,680
- Terrible.
- You wanna show me how to punch?

728
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:19,536
Show me-

729
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:23,434
That's how you punch.

730
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,375
- She's been looking forward to this.
- No kidding.

731
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,095
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

732
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,240
Oh, by "difficult time",
he means when my mother died.

733
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:33,313
We lost her in a plane crash.

734
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:36,816
It's bad enough you won't tell me how she died.
Could you please stop telling me that lie?

735
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,604
We're working here.

736
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,653
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

737
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,521
Were you going for the hand?

738
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,968
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

739
00:50:54,993 --> 00:50:57,678
Do not screw with the regulator.

740
00:50:57,703 --> 00:51:01,210
If that regulator is compromised,
you would go subatomic.

741
00:51:01,544 --> 00:51:02,645
What does that mean?

742
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,882
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

743
00:51:05,907 --> 00:51:07,318
What does that mean?

744
00:51:07,343 --> 00:51:11,871
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

745
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:16,044
become irrelevant
as you shrink for all eternity.

746
00:51:16,745 --> 00:51:18,833
Everything that you know

747
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,771
and love,

748
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,250
gone forever.

749
00:51:24,213 --> 00:51:27,356
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

750
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:31,691
You've learned about the suit, but
you've yet to learn about your greatest allies,

751
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:34,265
the ants.

752
00:51:34,544 --> 00:51:37,760
Loyal, brave,
and your partners on this job.

753
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:46,686
Paratrechina longicornis.
Commonly known as crazy ants.

754
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:48,887
They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,

755
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:51,358
which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.

756
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:53,300
You're not so crazy.

757
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:54,880
Hey!

758
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,126
You're cute.

759
00:52:05,537 --> 00:52:07,665
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

760
00:52:17,129 --> 00:52:20,815
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

761
00:52:20,892 --> 00:52:22,815
There's a security guard posted
around the clock.

762
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,446
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

763
00:52:25,744 --> 00:52:28,091
Okay, who's next?

764
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:31,372
Paraponera clavata.

765
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,170
I know. Bullet ants, right?

766
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:34,765
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

767
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,599
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

768
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,300
The Yellowjacket pod is
hermetically sealed,

769
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:45,685
And the only access point is a tube we estimate
to be about 5 millimeters in diameter.

770
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,553
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

771
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:51,574
The tube is protected by a laser grid, and
we can only power that down for 15 seconds.

772
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,205
You're gonna need to signal the crazy ants
to blow the servers,

773
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:58,315
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

774
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:00,721
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

775
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,140
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

776
00:53:03,165 --> 00:53:05,975
Ideal for ground and air transport.

777
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,684
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

778
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,791
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony".

779
00:53:11,174 --> 00:53:12,600
That's good. That's very good.

780
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:17,267
Because this time, you're really gonna
have to learn how to control him.

781
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:20,023
Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.

782
00:53:23,072 --> 00:53:24,358
Aw! You okay? Did I hurt-

783
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,057
Hank wants you outside for target practice.

784
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:40,322
The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.

785
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,040
Red shrinks.

786
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,650
Blue enlarges.

787
00:53:46,737 --> 00:53:48,916
Solenopsis mandibularis.

788
00:53:48,941 --> 00:53:50,272
Known for their bite,

789
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:53,028
the fire ants have evolved into
remarkable architects.

790
00:53:53,053 --> 00:53:56,596
They are handy to get you in and out
of difficult places.

791
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:07,695
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

792
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,628
They're not listening to me.

793
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,096
You have to commit. You have to mean it.

794
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,328
No shortcuts, no lies.

795
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:22,088
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

796
00:54:22,113 --> 00:54:23,735
We don't have time for coddling.

797
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,922
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

798
00:54:25,947 --> 00:54:27,198
Really?

799
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,164
Is that where our focus should be?

800
00:54:54,426 --> 00:54:55,552
Hope!

801
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:07,077
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

802
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,247
We can't do this without her.

803
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:23,575
Oh, God.

804
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,568
You gotta lock your doors.

805
00:55:25,593 --> 00:55:28,483
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

806
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:30,192
Do you think this is a joke?

807
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,895
Do you have any idea
what he's asking you to risk?

808
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,160
You have a daughter.

809
00:55:35,185 --> 00:55:36,615
I'm doing this for her.

810
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,610
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

811
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:41,415
He was in grief.

812
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,805
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

813
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,436
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

814
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,283
He just sent me off to boarding school.

815
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,855
You know, I thought,
with all that's at stake,

816
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,043
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

817
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,043
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

818
00:55:58,268 --> 00:56:01,055
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

819
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,541
Then why are you here?

820
00:56:02,715 --> 00:56:04,260
It proves that he loves you.

821
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,207
Hope. Look at me.

822
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,205
I'm expendable. That's why I'm here.

823
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,203
You must have realized that by now.

824
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,287
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

825
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,527
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

826
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,487
Anyway...

827
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,015
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

828
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,281
when I called the cops on you.

829
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,481
What's her name?

830
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,810
Cassie.

831
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:43,238
It's a pretty name.

832
00:56:46,758 --> 00:56:49,602
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

833
00:56:49,627 --> 00:56:51,065
That's how it works.

834
00:56:52,804 --> 00:56:54,215
Think about Cassie.

835
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,815
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

836
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,502
Open your eyes

837
00:57:08,527 --> 00:57:11,081
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

838
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,200
That's good!

839
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:59,123
Your mother convinced me to
let her join me on my missions.

840
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:01,855
They called her the Wasp.

841
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,121
She was born to it.

842
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,604
And there's not a day that goes by
that I don't regret having said yes.

843
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:17,638
It was 1987.

844
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,043
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk...

845
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,570
...and launched an ICBM at
the United States.

846
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:40,163
The only way to the internal mechanics
was through solid titanium.

847
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:53,940
I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.

848
00:58:54,193 --> 00:58:57,436
But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.

849
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,085
Your mother, she didn't hesitate.

850
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,844
Janet! No!

851
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,569
She turned off her regulator
and went subatomic...

852
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,168
...to deactivate the bomb.

853
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,769
And she was gone.

854
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,328
Your mom died a hero.

855
00:59:34,008 --> 00:59:36,329
And I spent the next 10 years

856
00:59:36,354 --> 00:59:40,758
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

857
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,448
You were trying to bring her back.

858
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:51,656
But all I learned was we know nothing.

859
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,523
It's not your fault.

860
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,364
She made her choice.

861
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,682
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

862
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,570
I was trying to protect you.

863
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,050
I lost your mother.

864
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,925
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

865
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:25,187
I'm sorry.

866
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,766
This is awesome.

867
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:32,547
It's awesome, you know?

868
01:00:32,572 --> 01:00:34,654
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

869
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,205
It's important.

870
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,580
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

871
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,409
Yes, you did. Yes.

872
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,483
I'm going to make some tea.

873
01:00:52,197 --> 01:00:53,201
Nailed it!

874
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,488
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

875
01:01:34,052 --> 01:01:37,295
The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.

876
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,481
It's freezing!

877
01:01:38,506 --> 01:01:40,674
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

878
01:01:41,705 --> 01:01:44,436
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

879
01:01:44,604 --> 01:01:47,335
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

880
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,958
We need it to counteract the transmission blockers
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

881
01:01:52,051 --> 01:01:53,440
It's currently collecting dust

882
01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:57,209
in one of Howard Stark's old storage facilities
in upstate New York.

883
01:01:57,234 --> 01:01:59,202
Should be a piece of cake.

884
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:01,295
You're over the target area.

885
01:02:01,368 --> 01:02:03,655
Disengage now, Scott!

886
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,841
Squadron A, go!

887
01:02:05,182 --> 01:02:06,213
B, go!

888
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:09,784
C, go!

889
01:02:10,851 --> 01:02:13,422
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

890
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,174
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

891
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:18,377
Stay calm.

892
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:22,127
Guys? We might have a problem.

893
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:25,494
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

894
01:02:25,957 --> 01:02:27,004
It's not!

895
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,787
You son of a bitch!

896
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,369
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

897
01:02:34,394 --> 01:02:35,475
Abort now!

898
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,231
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

899
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:40,304
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

900
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,495
He's gonna lose the suit.

901
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,010
He's gonna lose his life.

902
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,928
All right,
I'm on the roof of the target building.

903
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,690
Somebody's home, Scott.

904
01:02:57,884 --> 01:02:59,215
What's going on down there, Sam?

905
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,366
It's the Falcon!

906
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:03,106
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

907
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,721
Wait a second.

908
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:06,714
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

909
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:08,369
It's okay. He can't see me.

910
01:03:08,394 --> 01:03:09,575
I can see you.

911
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,761
He can see me.

912
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,095
Hi. I'm Scott.

913
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,770
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

914
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:20,175
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I'm a big fan.

915
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,850
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

916
01:03:22,656 --> 01:03:23,817
I'm Ant-Man.

917
01:03:24,236 --> 01:03:25,255
"Ant-Man"?

918
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,135
What? You haven't heard of me?

919
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,204
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

920
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:31,135
You wanna tell me what you want?

921
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,561
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

922
01:03:33,586 --> 01:03:35,315
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

923
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,991
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

924
01:03:38,016 --> 01:03:39,427
I know exactly how that is.

925
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:41,479
Located the breach.

926
01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:42,721
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

927
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,994
What the hell are you doing?

928
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,760
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

929
01:04:07,959 --> 01:04:08,924
Sorry!

930
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,730
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

931
01:04:11,705 --> 01:04:12,481
That's enough!

932
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:37,102
Ant-thony! A little help!

933
01:04:49,726 --> 01:04:50,966
I've lost visual.

934
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,480
He's inside my pack!

935
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:02,552
Sorry!

936
01:05:04,086 --> 01:05:05,520
You seem like a really great guy.

937
01:05:30,836 --> 01:05:34,360
It's really important to me that
Cap never finds out about this.

938
01:05:37,468 --> 01:05:40,995
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

939
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,081
You jeopardized everything!

940
01:05:59,931 --> 01:06:01,535
You got it.

941
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:05,754
Well done.

942
01:06:05,779 --> 01:06:06,779
Wait a minute.

943
01:06:06,804 --> 01:06:08,215
Did you just compliment me?

944
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,720
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

945
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,046
I was good, wasn't I?

946
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:19,075
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

947
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:21,584
Let us not dwell on the past.

948
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,008
We gotta finish our planning.

949
01:06:26,226 --> 01:06:27,910
Don't mind him.

950
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,561
You did good.

951
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:37,724
Darren.

952
01:06:40,536 --> 01:06:42,370
How the hell did you get in here?

953
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,841
You left the front door open, Hank.

954
01:06:46,255 --> 01:06:48,441
It's official. You're old.

955
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,161
The plans.

956
01:06:51,482 --> 01:06:53,086
He will kill him.

957
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,085
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

958
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,655
I have good news.

959
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,920
Really?

960
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,761
What's that?

961
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,055
Pym Tech, the company you created,

962
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,935
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

963
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,726
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

964
01:07:24,515 --> 01:07:25,641
You're welcome.

965
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,280
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

966
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,962
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

967
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:37,707
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

968
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,126
I'll be there.

969
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,645
What did you see in me?

970
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,251
I don't know what you mean.

971
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:05,330
All those years ago, you picked me.
What did you see?

972
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,216
I saw myself.

973
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:12,107
Then why did you push me away?

974
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,927
Because I saw too much of myself.

975
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:29,495
He knows. He's baiting you.

976
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,249
We have to call it off.

977
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,579
We're all taking risks.

978
01:08:32,604 --> 01:08:33,935
What if he saw me here?

979
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,291
He didn't. There's no way.

980
01:08:35,316 --> 01:08:36,958
How do you know that?

981
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:46,416
Darren, hi.

982
01:08:46,576 --> 01:08:49,386
Hope, where are you right now?

983
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,346
I'm at home. Why?

984
01:08:51,371 --> 01:08:53,135
I just saw Hank.

985
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,969
I still get nothing but contempt from him.

986
01:08:54,994 --> 01:08:58,555
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

987
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,005
We need to start everyone working
around the clock.

988
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,990
Get the assembly line up and running.

989
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,455
And I'm tripling security.

990
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:09,962
Full sensors at all entrances and exterior
air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.

991
01:09:09,987 --> 01:09:11,661
Great. Good idea.

992
01:09:11,686 --> 01:09:15,404
Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

993
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:23,003
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

994
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:24,996
But he is not onto you.

995
01:09:25,021 --> 01:09:29,329
He's adding full body scanners to
all entrances and closing exterior vents.

996
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,323
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

997
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:34,365
The water main.

998
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,403
You can't add security to a water main.

999
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:39,855
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1000
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,135
that's how I get in.

1001
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,757
Somebody would have to reach the building's
control center to change the water pressure.

1002
01:09:44,782 --> 01:09:47,513
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

1003
01:09:47,538 --> 01:09:49,063
So we expand our team.

1004
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,855
What do we need?

1005
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,282
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

1006
01:09:54,307 --> 01:09:57,691
somebody else to hack in to
the power supply and kill the laser grid,

1007
01:09:57,716 --> 01:09:59,810
and a getaway guy.

1008
01:09:59,835 --> 01:10:04,232
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three Wombats. No way.

1009
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:06,255
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1010
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,935
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1011
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,642
Because we just robbed you.

1012
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,084
You know that he was arrested for
stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1013
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,415
Two smoothie machines.

1014
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,010
Are you sure they can handle this?

1015
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,555
Oh, we can handle it. We're professionals.

1016
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,167
You'll forgive us if
we're not instilled with confidence.

1017
01:10:25,192 --> 01:10:29,199
Well, hey, everybody just kick back and relax
a little bit, man. We know our business.

1018
01:10:29,448 --> 01:10:31,815
We broke into this spooky-ass house,
didn't we?

1019
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:33,335
I let you.

1020
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,447
Well, one could say that
I let you let me.

1021
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:40,095
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
- Yeah, we can handle it.

1022
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,884
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

1023
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,389
- I'm in the system?
- You're in the system.

1024
01:10:44,569 --> 01:10:45,775
The system?

1025
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,134
Yeah, we're doomed.

1026
01:10:48,283 --> 01:10:50,964
All right. There's something
you guys need to see.

1027
01:10:50,989 --> 01:10:52,935
When you get to this corner,

1028
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,725
there's gonna be three offices
on your left side.

1029
01:10:55,757 --> 01:10:56,908
Damn!

1030
01:10:58,844 --> 01:11:01,575
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1031
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,285
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

1032
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:07,655
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

1033
01:11:07,724 --> 01:11:09,055
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1034
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,923
- Really?
- Yeah.

1035
01:11:10,992 --> 01:11:12,153
Good.

1036
01:11:19,124 --> 01:11:21,197
This is the work of gypsies.

1037
01:11:21,222 --> 01:11:22,348
That's witchcraft.

1038
01:11:22,373 --> 01:11:23,534
Wow, that's amazing.

1039
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,810
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1040
01:11:25,835 --> 01:11:27,015
That's some kind of wizardry.

1041
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,121
This is sorcery!

1042
01:11:28,146 --> 01:11:29,375
How'd you do that, bro?

1043
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,368
Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

1044
01:11:31,929 --> 01:11:33,215
Ahhh!

1045
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,685
Get off! Get off!

1046
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:37,236
Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!

1047
01:11:39,564 --> 01:11:41,015
I gave them each half a Xanax

1048
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,579
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1049
01:11:43,915 --> 01:11:45,882
They fell right asleep.

1050
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,025
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

1051
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,650
No, please don't.

1052
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,890
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

1053
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:57,606
I'm just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1054
01:11:57,631 --> 01:12:00,815
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1055
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,525
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

1056
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:05,087
to almost liking you.

1057
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,841
You really should write poetry.

1058
01:12:10,337 --> 01:12:12,089
Get some sleep, Scott.

1059
01:13:02,498 --> 01:13:05,455
All right, just so we're clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

1060
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,135
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

1061
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,491
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

1062
01:13:08,516 --> 01:13:09,961
- Luis?
- Oh, man, you know it.

1063
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:12,321
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.
That's what's up.

1064
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,227
Luis.

1065
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:15,575
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.
I'm just excited.

1066
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,931
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1067
01:13:16,956 --> 01:13:18,375
So, you know,
that makes me nervous, too.

1068
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,455
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1069
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,243
- Oh, my Lord.
- She's not my...

1070
01:13:21,268 --> 01:13:23,827
You know what? I was thinking of
a tactic, like when I go undercover.

1071
01:13:23,852 --> 01:13:26,008
Like a whistling. You know
what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1072
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:28,665
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1073
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,738
It's not The Andy Griffith Show.
No whistling.

1074
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,046
All clear in Sector One.

1075
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,361
Step out.

1076
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,166
All clear.

1077
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,966
We're set.

1078
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,733
Wish me luck.

1079
01:14:20,514 --> 01:14:22,004
Utilities online.

1080
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,249
Hey! What are you doing?

1081
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,408
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I'm securing it.

1082
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,131
I'm the boss.

1083
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,890
- Oh.
- Utilities 1.3-

1084
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,934
Water level is dropping!

1085
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,483
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1086
01:15:32,508 --> 01:15:33,919
All right, I see it.

1087
01:15:41,886 --> 01:15:45,158
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1088
01:15:48,474 --> 01:15:51,549
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1089
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,228
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1090
01:16:08,715 --> 01:16:10,797
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1091
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,964
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1092
01:16:16,047 --> 01:16:18,095
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1093
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,326
This is problem?

1094
01:16:19,351 --> 01:16:22,681
Considering the Crown Vic's the most
commonly used car for undercover cops, man,

1095
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,851
yes, this is problem.

1096
01:16:28,525 --> 01:16:29,478
That's Pym.

1097
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:33,681
Oh, no.

1098
01:16:33,944 --> 01:16:36,885
I'm deploying the bullet ants.
Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...

1099
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:39,834
I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.

1100
01:16:41,066 --> 01:16:42,192
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

1101
01:16:48,089 --> 01:16:49,534
Ow! Ow!

1102
01:16:52,409 --> 01:16:53,535
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1103
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:58,042
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty
in a very serious operation.

1104
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,408
Signal decoy in place.

1105
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,781
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1106
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,455
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1107
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,164
Scott, we have problem.

1108
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:18,913
Problem? What's the problem?

1109
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,480
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1110
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:24,155
Listen to me.

1111
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:28,080
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

1112
01:17:28,665 --> 01:17:30,394
That's awfully dramatic.

1113
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,606
Are you kidding me?

1114
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,749
Problem solved.

1115
01:17:55,592 --> 01:17:56,798
Well...

1116
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,390
How do I look?

1117
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:10,990
There he is.

1118
01:18:12,653 --> 01:18:15,356
Just in time. Come on.

1119
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,669
12-point verification.

1120
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,769
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

1121
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:30,415
Confirming authorization level.

1122
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,044
Well, you can never be too safe.

1123
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,640
Access granted.

1124
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,330
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1125
01:18:43,047 --> 01:18:44,692
You really did it.

1126
01:18:44,813 --> 01:18:46,755
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1127
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,730
Arriving in second position.

1128
01:19:16,272 --> 01:19:18,320
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

1129
01:19:29,578 --> 01:19:30,942
Proceeding to command position.

1130
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,317
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

1131
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,466
All right, guys. I'm in position.

1132
01:19:54,491 --> 01:19:56,175
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1133
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,262
No, no, no, no, no!

1134
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:00,926
Did you see that?

1135
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:08,852
Assume formation.

1136
01:20:09,023 --> 01:20:12,528
All right, you cute little crazies,
let's fry these servers!

1137
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,082
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1138
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,601
Servers are fried.

1139
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,935
Data backup completely erased.

1140
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,564
Heading to the particle chamber.

1141
01:20:50,986 --> 01:20:52,885
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1142
01:20:56,815 --> 01:20:59,216
My associates have agreed to your terms.

1143
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,521
Wonderful.

1144
01:21:00,546 --> 01:21:03,268
Mr. Carson introduced me to
these fine gentlemen here.

1145
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:04,897
They're representatives of Hydra.

1146
01:21:05,145 --> 01:21:08,401
They're not what they were.
They're doing some interesting work.

1147
01:21:08,803 --> 01:21:10,971
And I'm enjoying myself.

1148
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:16,315
You tried to hide your technology from me.
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

1149
01:21:20,225 --> 01:21:21,272
Wow.

1150
01:21:21,812 --> 01:21:23,018
Wow!

1151
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:27,822
I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away,
but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.

1152
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,485
Well, you figured wrong.

1153
01:21:30,554 --> 01:21:31,885
I know this van.

1154
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,601
Anybody home?

1155
01:21:40,077 --> 01:21:41,291
All right, guys. I'm here.

1156
01:21:46,237 --> 01:21:47,849
I'm setting the charges.

1157
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,518
Great job, guys. I'll take it from here.

1158
01:22:18,953 --> 01:22:20,539
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1159
01:22:22,242 --> 01:22:23,401
Final position.

1160
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,327
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1161
01:22:34,352 --> 01:22:35,922
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

1162
01:22:35,947 --> 01:22:37,427
- I'm getting close!
- No, you're not.

1163
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:43,855
San Francisco P.D.!

1164
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,881
Out of the van!

1165
01:22:45,273 --> 01:22:46,520
I know you're in there!

1166
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:48,707
- Make it go faster.
- Dude, seriously.

1167
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:56,522
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?

1168
01:22:56,547 --> 01:22:57,548
So close.

1169
01:22:58,392 --> 01:22:59,803
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
- Freeze!

1170
01:22:59,843 --> 01:23:01,493
There was a black guy that
looked exactly like me

1171
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:03,481
who attacked us and put us in
the back of this disgusting van.

1172
01:23:03,506 --> 01:23:04,996
- Get out of the van!
- Okay, I'm coming.

1173
01:23:05,304 --> 01:23:06,382
Take it easy!

1174
01:23:06,953 --> 01:23:08,921
No, I will not move! Go now!

1175
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,208
- Wait!
- What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1176
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,121
Phew!

1177
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,761
What? What?

1178
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,686
Hey, little guy.

1179
01:23:40,446 --> 01:23:43,575
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

1180
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,802
Which begs the question,
who is the new Ant-Man?

1181
01:23:47,099 --> 01:23:51,171
Who is the man that my beloved mentor
trusted even more than me?

1182
01:23:53,402 --> 01:23:55,726
Scott Lang.

1183
01:23:56,907 --> 01:24:01,215
A martyr who took on the system
and paid the price,

1184
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,929
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.

1185
01:24:05,084 --> 01:24:07,937
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1186
01:24:09,316 --> 01:24:14,210
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

1187
01:24:14,734 --> 01:24:18,181
And then he disappears magically,

1188
01:24:19,218 --> 01:24:21,495
despite having no money to his name.

1189
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,205
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1190
01:24:26,552 --> 01:24:30,318
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1191
01:24:30,343 --> 01:24:33,745
Darren, don't do this.

1192
01:24:33,967 --> 01:24:37,485
If you sell to these men,
it's gonna be chaos.

1193
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:41,849
I already have. And for twice the price,
thanks to you.

1194
01:24:42,609 --> 01:24:45,977
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate
an Avengers facility.

1195
01:24:46,002 --> 01:24:47,970
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1196
01:24:48,403 --> 01:24:52,091
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1197
01:24:53,084 --> 01:24:54,495
They don't run on diesel.

1198
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,083
If you want the fuel,
you'll have to come to me.

1199
01:24:58,497 --> 01:25:03,410
What do you call the only man who can
arm the most powerful weapon in the world?

1200
01:25:03,977 --> 01:25:06,628
The most powerful man in the world.

1201
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,335
You proud of me yet?

1202
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,409
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

1203
01:25:11,614 --> 01:25:14,497
It's been too late for a long time now.

1204
01:25:16,089 --> 01:25:17,185
Darren!

1205
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:20,495
What are you doing?

1206
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,775
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

1207
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,615
This is not who you are.

1208
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,450
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

1209
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,606
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1210
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:43,247
You're right.
I have to be the one to do it.

1211
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,126
Here we go.

1212
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,685
Drop your gun.

1213
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,335
You know, I came to the house
the other night to kill him,

1214
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,495
but you were there.

1215
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,047
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

1216
01:26:02,072 --> 01:26:03,481
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

1217
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:06,415
but I think I am now!

1218
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,522
Drop your gun now!

1219
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:11,239
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1220
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:25,825
Dad!

1221
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:36,153
Hank, no.

1222
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,930
No, Hank.

1223
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:40,535
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1224
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,640
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1225
01:26:43,466 --> 01:26:46,591
Take the suit off, or I'll blow
your brains out and peel it off.

1226
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,764
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.
Request immediate backup!

1227
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,166
Go, go, go!

1228
01:27:30,072 --> 01:27:33,280
Get me to the roof.
And radio ahead.

1229
01:27:33,305 --> 01:27:36,149
I want to make sure the helicopter
is ready to take off.

1230
01:27:36,174 --> 01:27:37,375
You two,

1231
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,085
kill anything that comes out of that vault!

1232
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,369
Dad, can you move?

1233
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,131
We need to get him out of here.

1234
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:51,020
Go get that suit.

1235
01:28:33,895 --> 01:28:35,192
Hey, Scotty.

1236
01:28:35,645 --> 01:28:37,374
Hey, did I save your life?

1237
01:28:38,274 --> 01:28:39,411
Scotty?

1238
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:40,997
Scotty?

1239
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:44,833
Thank you, Luis.

1240
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:46,695
- Are we the good guys?
- Yeah.

1241
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,001
- We're the good guys, right?
- Yeah, we're the good guys.

1242
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:51,224
Feels kinda weird, you know.

1243
01:28:51,249 --> 01:28:53,247
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1244
01:28:53,465 --> 01:28:55,547
Get out of here before this place blows!

1245
01:29:02,778 --> 01:29:05,286
Damn it! That guy.

1246
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,848
Hey! We're getting out of here!

1247
01:29:13,325 --> 01:29:16,482
The charges are set. We've gotta
find a way out of here. And fast.

1248
01:29:16,507 --> 01:29:20,778
Don't worry. I'm not gonna die.

1249
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,645
And neither are you.

1250
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,778
It's not a keychain.

1251
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,290
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

1252
01:29:42,946 --> 01:29:44,710
And there's a tank.

1253
01:29:54,189 --> 01:29:55,759
A little help!

1254
01:29:57,338 --> 01:29:58,606
I got it.

1255
01:29:59,298 --> 01:30:00,743
We need a doctor!

1256
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,400
We've got him.

1257
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,706
Thank you.

1258
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,084
Let's go!

1259
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:27,458
Ant-thony!

1260
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,010
Go!

1261
01:30:43,172 --> 01:30:44,452
You're gonna regret that.

1262
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,570
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!

1263
01:30:56,595 --> 01:30:58,165
- What?
- Get out of that van!

1264
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:59,924
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

1265
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,323
Hey! Hey!

1266
01:31:08,608 --> 01:31:10,667
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

1267
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,128
The windows!

1268
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:19,471
Did you think
you could stop the future with a heist?

1269
01:31:19,496 --> 01:31:21,253
It was never just a heist!

1270
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:44,370
Put the gun down!

1271
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,808
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

1272
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,284
We gotta set her down somewhere.

1273
01:32:43,893 --> 01:32:46,260
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1274
01:32:46,341 --> 01:32:47,941
Playing Disintegration by the Cure.

1275
01:33:26,579 --> 01:33:27,660
Call 911!

1276
01:33:46,027 --> 01:33:47,791
It's okay.

1277
01:33:52,368 --> 01:33:54,451
Freeze! Put your hands up!
Get them up!

1278
01:33:56,934 --> 01:33:57,935
Scott?

1279
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,280
Paxton, you have to listen to me!

1280
01:34:27,608 --> 01:34:29,895
Paxton, turn around! Take me back!

1281
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,922
I am taking you back. To prison.

1282
01:34:31,947 --> 01:34:34,427
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

1283
01:34:34,452 --> 01:34:35,591
In the bug zapper. There...

1284
01:34:37,487 --> 01:34:40,855
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

1285
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,935
All units, we have a 2-36
in progress at 840 Winter Street.

1286
01:34:45,217 --> 01:34:46,548
- Cassie!
- That's my house.

1287
01:35:04,145 --> 01:35:05,431
Don't be scared.

1288
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,815
Paxton, let me help!

1289
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,365
- Don't move.
- Let me help!

1290
01:35:09,398 --> 01:35:10,951
Maggie! What's going on?

1291
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:12,910
- He's got Cassie!
- Who's got Cassie, honey?

1292
01:35:12,935 --> 01:35:13,695
That thing.

1293
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,349
- Thing?
- I don't know! I don't know!

1294
01:35:23,897 --> 01:35:25,581
Are you a monster?

1295
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:29,132
Do I look like a monster?

1296
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:31,615
I want my daddy!

1297
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,771
I want your daddy, too.

1298
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,567
There you are.

1299
01:35:39,592 --> 01:35:40,957
Daddy, is that you?

1300
01:35:42,858 --> 01:35:43,859
Hi, peanut.

1301
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,801
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

1302
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,607
Now, where did you go, little guy?

1303
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,006
There you are.

1304
01:36:12,928 --> 01:36:14,259
Not just me!

1305
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,280
Damn it!

1306
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,570
Go! Go!

1307
01:37:22,331 --> 01:37:24,015
Scotty needs us,
you know what I'm saying?

1308
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,883
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

1309
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,726
Back it up.

1310
01:37:29,751 --> 01:37:31,545
- Back it up, slow.
- Yeah.

1311
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,375
- Back it up.
- Yeah.

1312
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,845
- Back it up.
- Okay.

1313
01:37:35,968 --> 01:37:37,652
- We just back it up, okay?
- That's it.

1314
01:37:37,677 --> 01:37:39,042
- Back it up.
- That's right.

1315
01:37:39,067 --> 01:37:41,877
- Backin' up?
- Yep, just backin' up.

1316
01:37:41,902 --> 01:37:43,108
No, no. Just back it up.

1317
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,873
You insult me, Scott.

1318
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,120
Your very existence is insulting to me.

1319
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,321
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you
if you were bigger.

1320
01:38:07,169 --> 01:38:08,455
Yeah, I agree.

1321
01:38:30,691 --> 01:38:31,692
Cassie!

1322
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,247
I'm gonna show you
just how insignificant you are.

1323
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,615
Cassie! I'm coming!

1324
01:38:58,685 --> 01:39:00,335
That's a messed-up looking dog.

1325
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,130
I'm gonna destroy everything you love.

1326
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,290
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1327
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:15,451
I can't break through.

1328
01:39:16,282 --> 01:39:18,330
It's titanium, you idiot!

1329
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,519
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1330
01:39:27,862 --> 01:39:29,135
Sorry, sweetheart.

1331
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,606
You have to help Daddy
pay for his mistakes.

1332
01:39:31,631 --> 01:39:33,055
- You stay behind me, okay?
- Okay.

1333
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:34,081
Stay behind me.

1334
01:39:35,698 --> 01:39:38,456
I'm gonna have to shrink
between the molecules to get in there.

1335
01:39:38,481 --> 01:39:40,529
Get away from us!

1336
01:39:42,362 --> 01:39:43,448
Daddy, help!

1337
01:39:43,473 --> 01:39:44,862
I love you, Cassie.

1338
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,365
Daddy, where are you?

1339
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:20,618
You could go subatomic.

1340
01:40:22,092 --> 01:40:23,332
Oh, no.

1341
01:40:35,489 --> 01:40:41,886
You would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space...

1342
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:46,649
All concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.

1343
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:52,565
All concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.

1344
01:40:56,821 --> 01:40:58,722
Come back, Daddy!

1345
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:06,085
As you shrink for all eternity.

1346
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:10,325
Everything that you know...

1347
01:41:12,072 --> 01:41:13,801
...and love,

1348
01:41:14,876 --> 01:41:16,587
gone forever.

1349
01:41:17,688 --> 01:41:19,258
Daddy, where are you?

1350
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,241
Where are you?

1351
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:42,525
Where are you?

1352
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,529
- Daddy!
- Cassie.

1353
01:41:53,192 --> 01:41:54,762
Come back, Daddy!

1354
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,531
Do not screw with the regulator!

1355
01:42:31,907 --> 01:42:33,727
Daddy!

1356
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:38,550
I love you so much.

1357
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,601
I love you, too.

1358
01:42:41,194 --> 01:42:42,275
So much.

1359
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,400
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1360
01:42:51,505 --> 01:42:52,666
Sorry.

1361
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,528
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1362
01:42:59,521 --> 01:43:00,522
Mommy!

1363
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,084
She's fine, she's fine.

1364
01:43:14,306 --> 01:43:15,876
Scott, please.

1365
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:18,499
You don't remember anything?

1366
01:43:18,524 --> 01:43:19,895
Hank. I don't.

1367
01:43:20,115 --> 01:43:22,287
There must be something else.

1368
01:43:24,046 --> 01:43:29,885
Well, I suppose the human mind
just can't comprehend the experience,

1369
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,291
but you made it.

1370
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,610
You went in,

1371
01:43:36,874 --> 01:43:38,603
and you got out.

1372
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,484
It's amazing.

1373
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:46,545
Scott, I'll walk you out.

1374
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,405
Get some rest.

1375
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,818
Is it possible?

1376
01:44:20,968 --> 01:44:22,015
When did this happen?

1377
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,166
Nothing's happening.

1378
01:44:23,191 --> 01:44:25,582
Whoa. Hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

1379
01:44:25,607 --> 01:44:29,108
Well, if that's the case,
shoot me again.

1380
01:44:29,609 --> 01:44:32,215
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1381
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,163
I'm a little surprised myself.

1382
01:44:34,188 --> 01:44:36,555
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

1383
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:38,070
Really, Hope.

1384
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,365
- Scott.
- Yeah?

1385
01:44:40,882 --> 01:44:42,611
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, yeah.

1386
01:44:44,076 --> 01:44:45,999
Scott, I met with my captain today.

1387
01:44:46,024 --> 01:44:48,490
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

1388
01:44:49,377 --> 01:44:50,817
Something happened with the cameras.

1389
01:44:51,818 --> 01:44:53,807
Some circuits got fried.

1390
01:44:54,818 --> 01:44:57,215
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

1391
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,366
Really?

1392
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:59,885
Well, yeah.

1393
01:45:01,383 --> 01:45:04,506
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1394
01:45:04,727 --> 01:45:06,420
Thank you, Paxton.

1395
01:45:06,594 --> 01:45:08,039
I'm blown away.

1396
01:45:09,006 --> 01:45:10,815
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

1397
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,888
Well, that's my pleasure.

1398
01:45:13,963 --> 01:45:17,092
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1399
01:45:19,324 --> 01:45:20,926
- This is awkward.
- Yeah.

1400
01:45:20,951 --> 01:45:21,959
Yeah.

1401
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:24,225
I mean, what do we even talk about
after all of that?

1402
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:25,693
- Oh, I know.
- What?

1403
01:45:25,733 --> 01:45:27,502
I did my first cartwheel today.

1404
01:45:27,526 --> 01:45:28,255
What?

1405
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,834
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1406
01:45:30,859 --> 01:45:32,270
But today was the magic day.

1407
01:45:32,295 --> 01:45:33,720
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1408
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,575
No, that can't be Cassie.
That's not you.

1409
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,200
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it is.

1410
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,368
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

1411
01:45:41,393 --> 01:45:42,631
Yeah, that's her.

1412
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,130
Good boy.

1413
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,436
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1414
01:45:52,563 --> 01:45:53,564
Sorry.

1415
01:45:55,173 --> 01:45:56,902
It's work.

1416
01:45:57,572 --> 01:45:58,858
Yeah.

1417
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:01,826
All right.

1418
01:46:01,851 --> 01:46:03,615
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1419
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,059
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1420
01:46:05,084 --> 01:46:08,826
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1421
01:46:08,851 --> 01:46:10,600
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1422
01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:12,998
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1423
01:46:13,215 --> 01:46:15,455
And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.

1424
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,721
But you know me, I'm more like
a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1425
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:20,575
But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1426
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,568
Luis.

1427
01:46:21,593 --> 01:46:22,775
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1428
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,733
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1429
01:46:24,998 --> 01:46:26,895
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1430
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,467
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1431
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:33,060
Like crazy-stupid fine." And he
goes up to the bartender and goes,

1432
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,764
"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1433
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:36,146
She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1434
01:46:36,185 --> 01:46:38,733
The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1435
01:46:38,972 --> 01:46:40,895
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1436
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,730
"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1437
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:46,567
and I got mad connects with the peeps behind
the curtains, you know what I'm saying?"

1438
01:46:46,592 --> 01:46:48,215
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1439
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:51,210
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,
I can't tell you who my contact is,

1440
01:46:51,235 --> 01:46:52,693
because he works with the Avengers."

1441
01:46:52,809 --> 01:46:54,095
Oh, no.

1442
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,521
Yeah, and this dude sounds like
 a badass, man.

1443
01:46:56,546 --> 01:46:57,707
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1444
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,888
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,

1445
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:01,135
who's flashing his fresh tack,

1446
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:03,731
who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"

1447
01:47:03,756 --> 01:47:06,885
And she's like, "Well, we got everything
nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.

1448
01:47:06,918 --> 01:47:09,133
We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1449
01:47:09,137 --> 01:47:10,654
You gotta be more specific."

1450
01:47:10,679 --> 01:47:12,826
And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1451
01:47:12,851 --> 01:47:16,298
And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1452
01:47:16,311 --> 01:47:17,360
So I asked Ignacio,

1453
01:47:17,567 --> 01:47:19,615
"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick

1454
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:21,881
to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1455
01:47:21,906 --> 01:47:23,146
that he's looking for him?"

1456
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,411
And? What'd he say?

1457
01:47:29,601 --> 01:47:31,046
He said, "Yes."

1458
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:28,485
There's something I want to show you.

1459
01:49:30,655 --> 01:49:34,012
I realized you can't destroy power.

1460
01:49:35,452 --> 01:49:39,377
All you can do is make sure that
it's in the right hands.

1461
01:49:46,038 --> 01:49:51,370
This is an advanced prototype that
your mother and I worked on together.

1462
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,262
She never got to use it.

1463
01:49:55,948 --> 01:50:00,410
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1464
01:50:07,027 --> 01:50:09,553
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1465
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,439
It's about damn time.

1466
01:56:18,896 --> 01:56:20,307
Hey, Cap!

1467
01:56:33,946 --> 01:56:36,743
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

1468
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,163
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

1469
01:56:39,188 --> 01:56:40,189
Even if he did...

1470
01:56:40,214 --> 01:56:41,943
Who knows if the Accords will let him help.

1471
01:56:43,491 --> 01:56:45,016
We're on our own.

1472
01:56:46,364 --> 01:56:47,695
Maybe not.

1473
01:56:50,026 --> 01:56:51,471
I know a guy.
