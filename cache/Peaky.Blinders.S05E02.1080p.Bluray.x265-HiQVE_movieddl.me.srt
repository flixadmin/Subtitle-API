Lizzie and Ruby, are they still at yours?

169
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,440
Yes, Tom, they're still there.

170
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,080
She's coming home today, she said, so...

171
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,600
...she'll be home later.

172
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,360
Hm. Has she been talking about me?

173
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,320
I mean, they talk a lot,
you know what women are like.

174
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320
The kitchen and, you know,
kids running around.

175
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I...I don't pay 'em no mind, Tom.

176
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,440
- I don't listen to 'em 'alf the time.
- Yeah.

177
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
Well, everything she says is true.

178
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,560
Well...

179
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,120
...you like the life, Tommy.

180
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,200
I don't like the fucking life.

181
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,040
I don't like the fucking life,

182
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,440
I don't like
that Michael is coming back today.

Take a weapon.

Tell Moss to clear the station of coppers.

187

You hear me?

Yes, sir.

Hey, Tommy.

190
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,440
I heard 'em say one thing, though.

191
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,960
Just talking, you know,
they were saying that, er,

192
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,560
you...you don't sleep or something.

193
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,160
You can't sleep.

194
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,400
When I do sleep, I dream.

195
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,480
And in my dream,
someone wants my crown.

196
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,960
I think it might be Michael.

197
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,920
Call me at three.

198
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,040
Arthur, I'm gonna put
that bullet on a necklace

199
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,360
and wear it as a reminder.

200
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,880
Arthur?

201
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,360
- I heard you.
- You got trouble for me, then?

202
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,960
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,320
Afternoon. Someone get you some tea?

209
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,760
No, I'm fine, Mr Shelby.

210
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,160
- This won't take long.
- Good.

You've got five minutes.

212
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,680
Mr Shelby,
there was a shooting two days ago.

213
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,520
A man died.

214
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,040
It was a murder.

215
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,200
In Maida Vale.

216
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,720
Of all places.

217
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,320
- His name was Levitt.
- Uh-huh.

218
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
He was a journalist.

219
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
The night before he was shot,
he came here to see you.

220
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,840
We found a Commons pass
and your name in his diary.

221
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,360
I was wondering
what his business here was.

222
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,840
And I'm wondering...

223
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,960
...what your business here is.

224
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,600
According to his diary,
you knew him from Birmingham.

225
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,960
What's your name?

226
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,280
Stacker.

227
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,200
Stacker. OK.

228
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,800
Mr Shelby, Mr Levitt was a queer.

229
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Some may think
it was one of his queer friends...

230
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,600
Mr Stacker,

231
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,280
I get the feeling that,
with a little provocation,

232
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,240
you could be very persistent.

233
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,560
Only within my remit.

234
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,960
Well, your Chief Constable Wyatt,

235
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,560
he has clear views about persistence,
which he has shared with me.

236
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,720
Mr Shelby...

237
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,480
He likes persistence, as do I.
And thoroughness.

238
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,840
But not frivolity.

239

A man who walks in the park with other men
dies in Maida Vale.

240
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,800
And you come to me?

241
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,720

She's my wife, Mum. At least look at her.

Tommy said to ask you
to tell me the truth.

We've been travelling for 15 days,

Maybe we could talk about this

Yes.

Let's go home and we can talk.

OK.

Our ship docked at Belfast.

I was then taken off the ship by two men.

Do you want to know the truth, Mum?

Who's <i>we?</i>

in this case describing a group of people
who are impatient and young and,

324

as I have said, adore dangerous.

327
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,160
Give him one from my bottle.

We have a mutual acquaintance.

333
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,240
May Car let on.

334
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,160
When I asked about you, she said,
"Oh, my goodness, where do I begin?"

335
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,960
And why were you asking after me?

336
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,520
Because, as I have said,

337
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
I adore dangerous.

338
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,240
And where did she begin?

339
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,280
You know, I was rather hoping
we might have this meeting alone.

340
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,840
My sister is my political adviser.

341
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,320
And my advice just now was,
"Don't meet Mr Mosley."

342
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,240
Because I am dangerous?

343
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,240
No.

344
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,000
What is it you are impatient for,
Mr Mosley?

345
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,840
I'm impatient for my fucking whiskey.

346
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
Bennett!

347
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
May Car let on spoke about you

348
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,800
the way I imagine one might
about a party they barely remember,

349
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,720
where you crash the car
into the dovecote

350
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,200
and live on champagne and cocaine
for three whole days.

351
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,840
You know, that kind of party.

352
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,000
Only three days?

353
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,440
Hmm.

354
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,640
My sister advised against meeting you

355
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,200
because it appears
you are moving away from the party...

356
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,800
...in a different direction.

357
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,120
And which direction is that?

358
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,360
Towards fascism.

359
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,640
"We are the people,
and we have had enough."

360
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,280
I thought that was excellent.

361
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,920
In which direction are you heading,
Mr Shelby?

362
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,760
I am my own revolution.

363
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,560
And you prefer Irish to Scotch.

364
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,720
As do I.

365
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,720
Like all things regarding Ireland,
it is...complex.

366
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,880
Yes?

367
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,800
Oh!

368
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,800
Where do you stand
on the Irish question, Mr Shelby?

369
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,640
Never been asked it.

370
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,960
Then perhaps it's time you were.

371
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,880
Tommy, I am the people,
and I have had enough.

372
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,560
We are looking for someone
to begin a dialogue...

373
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,960
...with certain elements in Belfast

374
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,920
with whom
we don't officially have any dealings.

375
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,480
I'll be too busy singing in the House.

376
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,720
It would involve a promotion.

377
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,760
Junior Minister to the Duchy of Lancaster.

378
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,560
Birmingham is my concern.

379
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,640
Ireland bores me.
Thanks for the whiskey, Mr Mosley.

380

(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

381
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,400
Hmm.

382
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,640
What the fuck was that about?

383
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,800
Ireland. It's been Ireland's day
all fucking day long.

384
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,840
What do you mean?

385
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,560
Ada, go home and start calling
anyone who had dealings

386
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,160
with Shelby Company Limited
while you were in Boston.

387
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,440
Ask them about Michael.

388
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Ask them what about him?

389
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,600
Who he's been seeing,
who he's been meeting,

390
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,400
- what deals he's made.
- Why?

391
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,080
Ask 'em especially about people
he's met from Glasgow or Belfast.

392
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,560
Tommy,
why don't you come back with me, eh?

393
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,560
You can play chess with Karl.

394
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,520
I'll make some calls,
you can listen in.

395
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,600
Drive home tomorrow.

396
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,320
That bastard starts talking
about Irish whiskey.

397
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,680
The fuck does he know? Eh?

398
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,640
More than me, Tommy.
What are you talking about?

399
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

400
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,240
My chair. My throne.

401
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,920
People thinking I'm gonna fall,

402
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,440
they start behaving
in a different way around you.

403
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,920
Who thinks that?

404
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,200
They start to circle.

405
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,320
Who's going to take the throne, eh?

406
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
Linda, she wants some for Arthur,

407
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,320

Just go home, make some calls.

410
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,200
Protestants are coming, I think.

411
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320

Are you armed?

415
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,720
Yeah.

00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,040
Yeah.

Would you please consider
putting your weapons behind the bar

418
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,000
in case feelings begin to run high?

419
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,680
Behind the bar, Poll, eh?

420
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,720
Behind my own bar, yeah?

421
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,640
I prefer it there.

Thomas?

423
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,040
I had a dream...

424
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,600
...about a black cat last night, Poll.

425
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,920
A black cat dream
means there is a traitor close by.

426
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,680
It was you who taught me that.

427
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,200
Black cat can mean lots of things.

428
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,760
Can mean you're hurting yourself.

429
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,000
Betraying yourself.

430
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,680
Are you seeing things, Thomas?

431
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,200
Yes, I am.

I'd like to introduce you to my wife.

440
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,240
I would also like to, er, say something.

441
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,880
- Sit down, Michael.
- I betrayed you.

442
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,640
- Michael.
- But only in my heart.

443
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,440
There was a time,

444
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,000
in America,

445
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,440
and there was a lot of money in that bank.

446
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,680
And I wondered
if I could...I could leave,

447
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,720
move to California.

448

But Gina stopped me.

- Gina said...
- I told you to sit down, Michael.

452
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,000
Now, tell me...

453
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,880
...what happened on that ship

454
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,720
in Belfast harbour.

455
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,920
On the journey back from New York,
we got married.

456
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,800
But we needed to find a witness.

457
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,120
A purser.

458
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,640
He was from Belfast.

459
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,840
We got friendly.

460
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
What happened when the ship docked?

461
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,120
This purser had friends who ran
a whiskey distillery in County Tyrone.

462
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,600
They wanted a way
of getting their stuff into America.

463
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,360
So I said, "OK, invite them aboard."

464
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
When they came in, I realised
that they didn't make whiskey.

465
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,720
They were Scottish. From Glasgow.

466
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,400
Couldn't understood
a fucking word they were saying.

467
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,040
They started swearing,

468
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,760
so I asked Gina to leave.

469
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,760
That was when they started talking
about you, Tom.

470
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,360
They said that Tommy Shelby
was a spent force,

471
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,680
that politics had got to him...

472
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,000
...that he was spent in the head,

473
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,680
that now was a good time to move in

474
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
and did I want to be part of it.

475
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,480
They knew about the money we lost
in America.

476
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,120
They said that you were going to blame me.

477
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,600
That you had a bullet with my name on it.

478
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,560
What did you say, Michael?

479
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,000
I didn't have time to say anything.

480
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,040
Coppers came on board.

481
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,440
Well, I thought they were coppers.

482
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,720
They, er...

483
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,760
They were IRA.

484
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,040
Exactly.

485
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,800
And the first men from Glasgow?

486
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,640
The IRA commander said the men
from Glasgow were called Billy Boys.

487
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,040
Fucking Billy Boys.

488
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,200
I don't know who the fuck Billy Boys are.

489
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,040
They run every man in every coalmine,
on every shipyard east of Glasgow.

492
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,040
They also dabble in politics.

493

You know, muscle for fascist rallies.

494
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,280
But you did no deal, Michael?

495
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
You didn't even know who they were?

496
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,240

The reason Gina and I got married
on the ship was because Gina is pregnant.

You're going to be a grandmother.

Are you fucking mad, hmm?

509
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,920
- You are free to fucking leave, Michael.
- You fucking bastard.

510
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,240
But you're not free, Michael, are you?

You lost this company a lot of money.

512
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,520
I told you to sell...

513
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,680
...but you held on,

514
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,520
and now I want you to pay me back
what you owe me.

There is work you can do,
there are risks you can take.

00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,520
So...

662
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,440
That letter's about me, is it?

663
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,640
Yeah.

664
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,720
- Hmm.
- And about me.

665
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,880
About the future. About the company.

666
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,000
Lizzie and I...

667
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,240
Sat here and made things worse
the last few hours, hmm?

668
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,360
Yeah, and we've come up with a plan.

669
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,520
Oh, you've come up with a plan, eh?

670
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,240
Lizzie says Tommy won't live
two more years if he carries on like this.

671
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,280
He's gone too far.

672
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,960
Is that what Lizzie says, hmm?

673
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,240
Really now?

674
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,000
Well, how far has he gone, hmm, Linda?
How far?

675
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,320
He's lost all the legitimate money
in America.

676
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,680
No. No, that was Michael.

677
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,680
He's fixing races. He's fixing football.

678
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,720
Following the financial crisis,
the Shelby Company Limited

679
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,040
has to find other sources of cash income.

680
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,840
Tommy went into Chinatown.

681
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,440
He's selling out the Communists
to the British intelligence.

682
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,320
And all the time, every day,
he gets more and more famous.

683
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,640
But that's OK.

684
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,920
Because if anyone puts
two and two together...

685
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,240
That wasn't us.

686
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,920
- (CHUCKLES)
- It's not fucking us!

687
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,800
It's going to blow up, Arthur!
It can't sustain.

688
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,280
- You know it.
- Oh, yeah? And what do you know, eh?

689
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,960
You've worked it all out.

690
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,120
You and fucking Lizzie, eh?

691
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,840
Got it all planned out, is that right?

692
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,040
And I tell you,

693
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,120
all you're gonna do
is you're gonna be the good fucking wife.

694
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,920
Yeah, like the perfect couple.

695
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,040
We'll go upstairs, hmm?

696
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,760
We'll go upstairs.

697
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,400
Yeah, make love, hmm?

698
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,520
I spent my day writing two letters
and deciding which one to give.

699
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,440
Looks like I'll have to give
the other one.

700
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,480
What other one?

701
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,440
What fucking other one?!

702
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,000
What did you do with my letter?

703
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,440
I burnt it.

704
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,680
So did Arthur.

705
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,360
- Did you read it first?
- Yes.

706
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,840
That's more than Arthur did.

707
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,320
(GROANS)

708

Didn't help that you can't fucking spell.

709
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,960
I left school too early.

710
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,200
Did you read the bit about the lawyers?

711
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,480
Do you want to fuck?

712
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,040
Didn't think so.

713
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,320
- You don't want to eat?
- No.

714
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,840
- You've got calls?
- Yeah.

715
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,680
It's Ruby's birthday today, Tommy.

716
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,960
Do you know why I took her to Arthur's?

717
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,840
Because she said she's scared of you.

718
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,360
When she knows you're not coming home,
she's a different kid.

719
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,000
But I've bought a cake.

720
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,360
And I want you there.

721
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,760

...and they're coming at me.

It's OK. I want 'em to.

728

Last thing I want is silence.

729
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,920
Standing up there, in silence,

730
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,360
and someone says...

731
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,680
..."Sorry about all that noise.

"And all that fucking blood."

735
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,400
And you say, "Don't be sorry.

736
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,520
"Don't be sorry. It's all I can do now."

737
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,120
You want me to write this down?

738
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,840
Do you want me
to write you a fucking letter?

739
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,520
Me and Arthur can't write it down...

740
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,320
...cos they haven't invented
the fucking words.

741

We don't have the fucking words.

And the worst thing is...

743
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,760
...could've stayed at school.

744
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,160
