1
00:00:01,964 --> 00:00:05,255
- Previously on Gotham...
- Who are you?

2
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:08,188
- Oh, my word.
- Please don't hurt me.

3
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:09,923
- We caught a spy.
- Ivy?

4
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:10,724
No!

5
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:12,392
Watch out!

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,047
Ivy?

7
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:18,749
Gotham listens to me.

8
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:21,251
It's time to round up our friends.

9
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,788
Former war hero.

10
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:27,090
Former white knight
cop. Now bounty hunter.

11
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:29,326
Saving Gotham's not my job anymore.

12
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,562
You are a cop in everything but name.

13
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,565
Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,500
- Wait...
- Shut up for once.

15
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:56,753
When I count to three,

16
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,256
you will all awake and have no memory

17
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,653
of your animal identity.

18
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,561
One, two,

19
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,596
three.

20
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,268
Thank you. Thank you.

21
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:13,604
A magician? Really?

22
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:16,006
Hypnotist. I like him.

23
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,674
Plus, the place is packed. Be happy.

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,035
Just a taste,

25
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:20,344
ladies and gentlemen.

26
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:24,881
But now let us venture
into something more...

27
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,316
arcane.

28
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,785
I'll need a single volunteer.

29
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:34,057
Hmm.

30
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,230
You, sir.

31
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:42,511
Beautiful suit.

32
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:44,179
- Thank you.
- Lawyer?

33
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:46,014
- Uh, doctor.
- Oh.

34
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,149
Your mistress?

35
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:49,117
- My-my wife.
- Oh, delightful.

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,290
Listen to the watch.

37
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:56,892
The way it's ticking

38
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,661
synchronizes with your heartbeat.

39
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,801
Look into my eyes.

40
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:08,003
Not above them, not around them,

41
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,972
but deep into their center.

42
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:16,556
You are completely relaxed
and are becoming weightless.

43
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:21,049
Are you ready to do
something impossible?

44
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:22,384
Yes.

45
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:30,091
Stand upon the chair.

46
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,230
No.

47
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,298
The back of it.

48
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,401
Remember, you weigh nothing at all.

49
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:43,872
- He'll fall.
- Not at all, my dear.

50
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:53,081
In a hypnotic state,
unburdened by doubt and fear,

51
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:55,417
we can accomplish the impossible.

52
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,752
Now...

53
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,466
one foot.

54
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,528
So you could get him to
do anything you wanted?

55
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:08,824
Did you have something
in mind, Miss Kean?

56
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:12,739
Jump down, sir.

57
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,773
Lock sense away.

58
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,442
Awaken the rascal.

59
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:23,717
When I say it is so,
your home is my castle.

60
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:25,313
Now, I'm going to count down

61
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:26,948
and clap my hands and you will awake.

62
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:28,884
Three, two, one.

63
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:32,454
How do you feel, sir?

64
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:33,889
I feel great.

65
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:36,491
Thank you!

66
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,127
Thank you.

67
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,265
Very impressive, Mr. Tetch.

68
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,034
You have quite the gift.

69
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:47,772
But you didn't answer my question.

70
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:51,339
Can you make people do
anything you tell them to do?

71
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:55,010
Only things they secretly wish to do.

72
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,946
It's surprising what people wish for,

73
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,315
secretly, deep down.

74
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,783
- Mm.
- True.

75
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:03,919
You must be a very popular man.

76
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,487
Oh, I wish.

77
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:08,323
Parties like this help
pay my way, so thank you.

78
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:09,991
And you're new to Gotham?

79
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,860
Yes. Just arrived from up north.

80
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:13,161
You have a place to stay?

81
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:14,517
Not yet.

82
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,257
But something always seems to turn up.

83
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,350
This is weird for me, too.

84
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:37,218
What's-what's your name?

85
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:38,453
Five.

86
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:41,890
Well, 514A, but they call me Five.

87
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:44,159
- At Indian Hill?
- Yes.

88
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,794
And how 'bout before that?

89
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:48,530
I-I don't remember... I don't
remember anything before that.

90
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:49,831
That's convenient, isn't it?

91
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:50,899
I mean, nothing?

92
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,667
I mean, you must have had a home,

93
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:54,302
family, friends,

94
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:55,904
parents.

95
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,205
If I did, I can't remember.

96
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,641
I woke up in that lab over a year ago.

97
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:02,143
I was locked up the
whole time I was there.

98
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:06,481
They gave me books, did tests on me.

99
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,882
Many tests.

100
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,051
I heard the other inmates in the halls,

101
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,253
but I never saw them.

102
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,356
Not until Ms. Mooney broke us out.

103
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:17,025
I'm sorry I surprised
you by coming here.

104
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,867
When-when I saw you...

105
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:21,062
I had to meet you.

106
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,666
You saw me?

107
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,236
On the rooftop.

108
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,671
With that girl.

109
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,740
Selina. She gave me money.

110
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,341
I followed her.

111
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:36,177
You're welcome to stay
here as long as you need.

112
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:38,513
Perhaps we should contact
someone with more expertise

113
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,515
in these matters, Master Bruce.

114
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,684
It's late. That can wait until tomorrow.

115
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,152
I'll make up one of the guest rooms.

116
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,558
Master Bruce,

117
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,727
we have to get rid of that
thing as quick as possible.

118
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:54,729
He's a human being, Alfred.
He's in need of help.

119
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:56,564
Look, I-I understand

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,300
you feel sorry for the boy, but have
a butcher's at him, will you, huh?

121
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:01,436
I mean, he's you. Hugo
Strange made another you.

122
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,671
I reckon it's got something to do

123
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:03,905
with that secret society or something.

124
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,740
So what do we do?

125
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,876
Throw him back on the
street? I-I want to know

126
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,978
who and what and why as
much as you do, Alfred.

127
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:11,946
Better he stays here until we find out.

128
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:13,181
Fine, but tomorrow we call Lucius Fox.

129
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,396
Maybe he'll know what to
do with it. I mean, him.

130
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:39,741
- Valerie.
- James.

131
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:41,342
You want some breakfast?

132
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:43,344
There's a place around the corner.

133
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,846
Pass.

134
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:46,648
I have to be at City Hall in an hour.

135
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:47,682
I have to go home and shower.

136
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:49,117
I have a shower.

137
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:51,119
No, you have a dark hole in the wall

138
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:53,288
with no water pressure
and one damp towel.

139
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:55,123
Right.

140
00:06:57,477 --> 00:07:00,929
Well, I'm collecting my bounty
from the GCPD today, so, uh,

141
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,431
I can stop on my way home, make things

142
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:06,134
a little... nicer.

143
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:08,503
Yeah, good luck with that.

144
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,947
That was fun.

145
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,182
See you around.

146
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,652
Okay. See ya.

147
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:27,388
I'm not gonna get all misty-eyed,

148
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:31,559
but the simple truth is this
department has missed you.

149
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:35,029
God-given talent like
yours is hard to find.

150
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:38,032
Your expertise and your
professionalism is exemplary.

151
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:41,069
I'm very pleased that you're
returning to the GCPD.

152
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:43,738
Where else can you make a
difference like this? Nowhere.

153
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:46,674
- I know. It's not that...
- Look...

154
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,510
now,

155
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:50,645
forgive me if I'm, uh,

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,448
stepping into a delicate minefield,

157
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,617
but if what you're worried
about is Jim Gordon,

158
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:57,852
he no longer works here.

159
00:07:57,888 --> 00:08:00,989
No GCPD affiliation whatsoever.

160
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:06,294
Hey, Harvey.

161
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:08,730
Jim!

162
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,999
Buddy. Pal. Ha-ha.

163
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:12,333
Let's get a cup of coffee.

164
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:13,935
I just came by for my check.

165
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,472
City still owes me for bringing
in the last of Strange's creeps.

166
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,374
- Yeah, you been hustlin'...
- Jim?

167
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:33,955
Hello, Jim. What-what are you...

168
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,258
Hey. You look well.

169
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:38,549
Thanks.

170
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,729
You visiting?

171
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,499
No, we're... um, I'm-I'm moving here.

172
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:47,101
Permanently.

173
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:49,904
With my fiancé.

174
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:58,012
He's been offered head trauma
position at Gotham General.

175
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,014
A doctor. Good call.

176
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,752
Captain Barnes has been
nice enough to offer me

177
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:06,754
my old job back. Here. Um...

178
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,323
I haven't decided yet.

179
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:11,125
Well, if you did, you'd see me.

180
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,661
I'm here now and again getting paid.

181
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:17,594
It's good to see you, Lee.

182
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:24,409
I guess I better get going.
The movers are due any minute.

183
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,642
Be well, Jim.

184
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:34,582
Jim.

185
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:38,887
Where's my money, Harvey?

186
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:55,603
Hello?

187
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,672
Lock sense away.

188
00:09:57,707 --> 00:09:59,674
Awaken the rascal.

189
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,209
When I say it is so,

190
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:04,145
your home is my castle.

191
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:07,782
Go to the door.

192
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,867
Honey?

193
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:07,513
Wh-Who are you?

194
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:10,088
Who am I?

195
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,069
I haunt your dreams like a ghost,

196
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:17,971
for I know what scares you most.

197
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,708
So you run, run!

198
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:22,976
As fast as you can!

199
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:26,380
There's no escape from the magic man.

200
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,654
Jolly good.

201
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:35,989
Now, get some plastic,

202
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,991
wrap her up and bury her in the garden.

203
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:40,928
Oh, and I'm gonna need
you to kill yourself, too.

204
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:42,429
Chop-chop.

205
00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:00,013
My sweet sister.

206
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,082
Alice.

207
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:04,484
I've traveled so far.

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,487
So come out, come out,

209
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:09,489
wherever you are.

210
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,029
Alice!

211
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:18,632
Hey! Alice!

212
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:29,176
This time, no excuses.
My money... where is it?

213
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:31,311
I'll get it for you.

214
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:32,613
You said that last week,

215
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,414
the week before that.

216
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,417
I should have known you're a liar.

217
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,052
- A cheat!
- I lost my job.

218
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:42,689
Then get another! Don't cheat me!

219
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:49,229
But, uh, perhaps...

220
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:51,865
we work something out, eh?

221
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,233
If you're a nice girl?

222
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:55,669
Are you a nice girl?

223
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,070
Stay away from me.

224
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,673
- Oh, be nice to me.
- Stop, you don't understand.

225
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,741
Be nice...

226
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:02,609
Oh!

227
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:15,555
I'm so sorry.

228
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:16,923
You shouldn't have done that.

229
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,925
You brought this on yourself.

230
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,296
Since the death

231
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,298
of Galavan, the office of mayor

232
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,266
has been governed by
the elected officials

233
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,101
you see behind me.

234
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:31,305
This city desperately needs experienced,

235
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,606
seasoned leadership.

236
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:34,107
And so, in their wisdom,

237
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,642
they have persuaded me...

238
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,344
Much against my will...

239
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:39,413
To resume the office of mayor

240
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:40,981
until elections can be organized

241
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:42,816
in the new year.

242
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,484
Stop!

243
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:51,024
This proceeding is a sham.

244
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,093
- Security, remove this criminal!
- Criminal?

245
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:56,630
I was jailed illegally
by a corrupt system.

246
00:13:56,665 --> 00:14:00,567
A corrupt system that was
put into place by this man,

247
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:02,936
who has the audacity

248
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:05,872
to put himself back into
the position that he brought

249
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,674
so much shame and dishonor to.

250
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,142
How dare you?

251
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:10,877
No, how dare you

252
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,814
waltz up there and
announce yourself mayor?

253
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:18,352
The people demand to have a say
into who will represent them,

254
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:20,687
- who will protect them.
- Yeah! Yeah!

255
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:23,623
- Yeah!
- It was I...

256
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:27,361
I alone... who drove out the
monsters that plagued our city.

257
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:30,197
Oh, please. Where were you then,

258
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:33,734
while I faced peril at the
hands of those abominations?

259
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,204
Sir, are you challenging
James's appointment to office?

260
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,139
I most certainly am.

261
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,243
You better get a close-up.

262
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:49,983
To govern this city, one
should be legally elected,

263
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:52,419
which is why I, Oswald Cobblepot,

264
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:55,422
announce my candidacy
for the office of mayor.

265
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:56,757
And I demand,

266
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,492
and the people demand,

267
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:02,696
that an emergency election
be held forthwith!

268
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:09,603
Cobblepot! Cobblepot! Cobblepot!

269
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,590
Good, good, good.

270
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:18,759
One more time, one more time.

271
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,794
And again.

272
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:24,895
Good boy.

273
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:27,666
One more time.

274
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:28,842
Good morning.

275
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,734
Did you sleep well?

276
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:31,735
Yes.

277
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:35,939
Would you like to try?

278
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,474
Uh, I don't think

279
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,109
that's a particularly good
idea, do you Master Bruce?

280
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:41,311
Come now, Alfred, I think a
little exercise before breakfast

281
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:42,479
might be just what he needs.

282
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:44,414
Fine.

283
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,617
I'll go easy on you. Pop these on.

284
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:48,752
Right hand in. And the other one.

285
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:50,921
Like that. All right, step up.

286
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:52,723
Now, just remember...

287
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,826
Let's see what you got,
no, keep your gloves up.

288
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:58,128
Protect the chin at
all times, all right?

289
00:15:58,163 --> 00:16:00,797
Ready? Here we go. Bosh.

290
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,766
Ready?

291
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,001
Come on.

292
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,104
- Sorry. Sorry...
- No,

293
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,805
ab-absolutely fine.

294
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:11,041
Let's see if we can do that again.

295
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:12,042
Here I come.

296
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:17,657
Bloody hell.

297
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:20,651
Who taught you how to do that then?

298
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,234
No one.

299
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,917
If they did, I... I don't remember.

300
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:29,826
Right, well, let's see
what you got, sunshine.

301
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:31,561
Here we go again. Here we go.

302
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:35,832
Oh.

303
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:38,735
Oh, dear. I'm frightfully sorry.

304
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,504
What for?

305
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,572
- Your nose.
- Didn't you feel it?

306
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,043
No.

307
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:47,480
Should I?

308
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,847
Right, well, I think that's, uh...

309
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:53,917
quite enough for today,
don't you, Master Bruce?

310
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:55,185
Here you are.

311
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,720
Press that hard against your nose.

312
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:59,589
All right? Here you go.

313
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,073
Stem the flow.

314
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:02,808
Good lad.

315
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:10,248
Well, that's a very nasty scar.

316
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,449
Where'd you get that?
Or can't you remember?

317
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,824
What did they do to you in there?

318
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,168
Good day, Mr. Gordon.

319
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,519
Tea?

320
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:32,537
How'd you find me?

321
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,106
Oh, you're famous, sir.

322
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:36,041
Your name's in the papers.

323
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:37,909
The fearless bounty hunter.

324
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:45,884
I want you to find my sister.

325
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,520
We're very close.

326
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:51,823
We lost our parents at an early age.

327
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,025
I became her guardian.

328
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,961
But her condition proved

329
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:57,478
too much for me. I sought help.

330
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,131
The worst kind.

331
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,500
The fiend, Professor Strange.

332
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:03,468
Her condition?

333
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,737
Some poison in her blood.

334
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:08,707
Very rare. Unique, in fact.

335
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,075
He took her in.

336
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,377
Said she needed constant supervision.

337
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:14,312
He wouldn't let me see her.

338
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:15,814
You go to the police?

339
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:17,749
Useless.

340
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:20,141
This is Gotham after all.

341
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,355
The years passed and I lost hope.

342
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,257
But then I heard about the breakout.

343
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,425
I assumed she escaped with others.

344
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:28,560
But now she is out there.

345
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:29,628
Alone.

346
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:30,662
Afraid.

347
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:34,239
Indian Hill escapees get
five grand from the GCPD.

348
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,747
You able to top that?

349
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:38,503
I'll double it.

350
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:40,679
I'll see what I can do.

351
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,506
Thank you very much.

352
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,640
Leave your number.

353
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,463
You've seen so much pain and tragedy,

354
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:07,098
Mr. Gordon.

355
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:09,167
I hope it hasn't left you too alone.

356
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:13,972
I'm not being negative.

357
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,675
I'm just saying, it's a big step.

358
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,878
Holy crap.

359
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:20,879
Headquarters, let me
just say one thing first.

360
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:23,882
Gotham is rife with crime, Butch.

361
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,750
Who better than a
criminal to clean it up?

362
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,419
Okay. Look,

363
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:29,654
you know I've faced the
worst Gotham has to offer,

364
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,057
but politicians, they scare me.

365
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,592
The people of Gotham are with me.

366
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:35,427
They are scared, which means angry.

367
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,462
And who have they got to turn to?

368
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,297
Aubrey James?

369
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,298
Please.

370
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:42,634
That man is a hack.

371
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,938
This is my opportunity
to create a legacy.

372
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:49,674
One that my father would be proud of.

373
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,676
- Mr. Cobblepot?
- Oh.

374
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:53,511
What do you think?

375
00:19:57,985 --> 00:19:59,217
You got my vote.

376
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:03,121
Mr. Cobblepot, I have Aubrey James.

377
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:05,023
He'd like to meet you, alone.

378
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:07,959
Hmm.

379
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:29,714
What are you looking for?

380
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,284
The scars on your back are distinctive.

381
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,718
I was hoping to find a reference,

382
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,854
a clue as to why they were made.

383
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,689
You need to hide.

384
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:39,391
What?

385
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:43,728
She won't understand.

386
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:47,165
What are you doing?

387
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,366
Homework.

388
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:53,079
Is something wrong?

389
00:20:57,044 --> 00:20:58,910
Ivy's missing.

390
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:03,036
She'll turn up somewhere.

391
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,383
Doesn't she always?

392
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,720
This time, she fell.

393
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:12,490
And it was a long way down into water.

394
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:13,925
And maybe she survived.

395
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,196
I got a bad feeling.

396
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,497
No offense, but...

397
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:24,202
it's not like you to care.

398
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:27,205
She had nothing, that kid.

399
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,207
I was it.

400
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:32,077
No one else would even talk to her.

401
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,727
I shouldn't give up, right?

402
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,996
Maybe take one more
look at the shelters,

403
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:53,631
our favorite hiding spots?

404
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,633
Sure.

405
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:57,235
Good idea.

406
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:01,106
Will you come with me?

407
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:06,378
If I had a car, I could
get around much quicker.

408
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:11,282
Uh, yeah, I mean... no.

409
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:14,085
- No. Not-not right now. I just...
- What?

410
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,153
That's too much to ask?

411
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:16,888
After everything I've done for you?

412
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:19,290
- Selina, it's not like that. I...
- Forget it.

413
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:21,960
It was stupid of me to even come here.

414
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:24,330
Sel... I just... It's-it's
just not a good time.

415
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,569
You're a selfish son of a
bitch. You know that, right?

416
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,708
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:40,145
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:45,517
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:51,089
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:05,325
Selina?

421
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:07,856
What do you want? I'm looking for
someone. I think you may have seen her.

422
00:23:07,891 --> 00:23:09,858
And if I have, why would I tell you?

423
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:13,395
She's in trouble, and I can pay you.

424
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:20,168
I don't need your money.

425
00:23:20,203 --> 00:23:23,204
- So what do you need?
- Ivy.

426
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,739
She's missing.

427
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:26,274
- For how long?
- Too long.

428
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:30,045
Just... keep an eye
open for her, would you?

429
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,447
Will do.

430
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:34,582
She's from Indian Hill.

431
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:35,999
Yeah.

432
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:41,523
I saw her with Mooney,
but only for a day or two.

433
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:44,026
Last I heard, she got a
job at The Narrows Bar.

434
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,646
All right. Thanks.

435
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,092
Who the hell are you?!

436
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,095
You a cop?

437
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:22,530
Nope.

438
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:25,200
Well, if you're looking to rob
the place, you're too late.

439
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:27,277
Fire took everything I had.

440
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,312
I'm looking for someone.

441
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:31,281
Her name's Alice.

442
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:32,649
This some kind of joke?

443
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:35,110
No. What's funny?

444
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:37,821
That crazy bitch is the
one who started the fire.

445
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:41,149
- Why'd she do that?
- How the hell do I know?!

446
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:43,918
Said she cut herself. "Clean
yourself up then," I say.

447
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:45,120
"You don't understand," she says.

448
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:46,788
"My blood is on the
counter." Next thing I know,

449
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:48,892
the whole damn kitchen's in flames.

450
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:51,426
Someone's got to pay for this damage.

451
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:54,829
You tell me where she
is, my client will pay.

452
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:57,031
- Who's your client?
- You know where she is?

453
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,933
If I did, would I be talking to you?

454
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:02,604
Thanks for your time.

455
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,639
I say when we're done.

456
00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:07,308
Time to teach you some manners.

457
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,686
You had enough?

458
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,321
Not yet.

459
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:28,363
Now I have.

460
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:40,657
I'm sorry for the delay.

461
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:42,710
Gotham Friday nights keep us busy.

462
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:45,513
- How you feeling?
- Uh. I'll be fine.

463
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:47,248
Might want to take your shirt off.

464
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:48,716
Don't want to bloody it up.

465
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:00,195
James Gordon, the policeman.

466
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,896
Used to be.

467
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,500
I don't need to tell you

468
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:07,335
it's gonna hurt a little bit.

469
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:10,772
There we go.

470
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:12,907
Oh. Yeah.

471
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,151
Lee speaks very highly of you.

472
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,457
I'm Mario, Lee's fiancé.

473
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:35,763
That's nice of her.

474
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,833
Look, Jim,

475
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:41,269
I don't know where your
head's at with all this,

476
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,706
but I want you to know
that I love her very much.

477
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,841
I'm gonna take good care of her.

478
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,746
Good to know.

479
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:53,915
So we're okay?

480
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,150
Yeah. sure.

481
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,886
Why wouldn't we be?

482
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:00,388
Lee and I are old news,
water under the bridge.

483
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,724
Won't get any problem from me.

484
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:07,228
Uh... wish you both
nothing but the best.

485
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:09,097
Thank you.

486
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:10,532
All done.

487
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:22,110
But, uh...

488
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:24,846
you ever were to hurt her,

489
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,588
I'd have to hunt you down and kill you.

490
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:33,655
Hey, uh, look, um,

491
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,457
about three days ago, a
girl might have come in here

492
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:37,759
with burns on her.

493
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,460
Ring any bells? I need an address.

494
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:40,770
Look familiar?

495
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,544
A public place. Smart.

496
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,180
Knowing your flare for the dramatic,

497
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:00,448
I felt it necessary.

498
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:03,151
How flattering.

499
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:06,654
But why exert myself needlessly?

500
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,723
The public sees me as a man

501
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:10,992
of action, of change. You...

502
00:28:11,027 --> 00:28:14,495
You are yesterday's sad joke.

503
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:17,452
While Galavan humiliated
this city, where were you?

504
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,535
In a warehouse with a box on your head.

505
00:28:22,772 --> 00:28:24,405
You're an unstable lunatic, Penguin,

506
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:27,141
and people are gonna
see right through you.

507
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:30,979
I've got the judges,
the unions, the GCPD,

508
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:33,181
and a whole team of
legal experts behind me.

509
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,682
What do you got?

510
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:36,451
I have me.

511
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:41,222
You're psychotic!

512
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:48,896
Not this time, Penguin.

513
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:51,065
My head will not be put in a box again.

514
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:55,550
Oh, you.

515
00:28:55,589 --> 00:29:00,202
So smart. Always one step ahead.

516
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,750
Never three.

517
00:29:09,853 --> 00:29:12,787
Relax. I do not want you dead.

518
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:14,389
Besides, what kind of
fun would an election be

519
00:29:14,424 --> 00:29:17,595
if I were the only candidate, huh? Oh.

520
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:21,242
You're right about one thing, though.

521
00:29:21,264 --> 00:29:23,091
I do need a little help,

522
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:26,709
and I have just the
right person in mind.

523
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:32,782
Hello?

524
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:40,415
Hello?

525
00:29:55,098 --> 00:29:58,274
No one lies to me! Don't lie!

526
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:04,639
Any of his blood get on you?

527
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:05,807
No.

528
00:30:07,176 --> 00:30:08,556
Hello, Alice.

529
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,549
I wasn't sure how he turned.

530
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:13,356
Turned? What's wrong with him?

531
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:15,158
He's infected.

532
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:17,460
Infected with what?

533
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:20,129
With me. Who are you?

534
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:21,881
Why are you here?

535
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:23,594
Your brother's looking for you.

536
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:28,663
He can't... find me.

537
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,499
Alice. Alice!

538
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:30,603
He's gone.

539
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,406
He's taken some of your clothes

540
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:35,008
and the keys to the Roller.

541
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,876
Cut his hair, too.

542
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:38,912
To look more like you.

543
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,749
We have to go after him.

544
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:45,151
I'm not sure

545
00:31:45,187 --> 00:31:48,580
who scheduled this
meeting, Mr. Cobblepot,

546
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,391
but as you can see, I have been burdened

547
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:53,893
with restoring order to this facility,

548
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:56,596
and that is no easy task.

549
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:59,666
A man of your reputation
should not have been sent here

550
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,100
to clean up Strange's wreckage.

551
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,335
Indeed.

552
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,571
Get off me! Let me go!

553
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:07,373
You are aware of my ambitions?

554
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:09,342
For office?

555
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,077
Oh.

556
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,046
Once mayor, I will grant you

557
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:15,849
whatever position you care to request.

558
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:17,650
Gotham's Head of Psychiatry,

559
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,353
a chair on Gotham's Board of Health?

560
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:22,021
In exchange for what exactly?

561
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:26,392
Even though my victory is inevitable,

562
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:30,363
I fear my campaign is
missing one key element.

563
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:33,233
A colleague of mine is
locked up here. Unfairly.

564
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:36,736
Are you suggesting that I
release a convicted criminal

565
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:38,338
out onto the street?

566
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,307
Well, yes. For your betterment.

567
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:43,142
That would take extensive

568
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,476
patient analysis, uh,
probational hearings,

569
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,113
appeals...

570
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:49,983
Lockdown is now in full effect.

571
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:51,317
Repeat, lockdown...

572
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:53,786
Of course, there's always plan B.

573
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:56,322
I give you nothing...

574
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:58,191
but I make sure you remain here forever.

575
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,059
Not as a warden, no.

576
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:04,063
I would see you scrub floors

577
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,431
and empty inmates' latrines.

578
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:06,532
Oh...

579
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,669
Options.

580
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,544
Look into my eyes.

581
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,846
Not around them,

582
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,116
not above them, but into their center.

583
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:26,586
Now sleep.

584
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:31,691
Now, what would we like to see

585
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,159
the lovely Miss Kean do?

586
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:35,328
Physical feats?

587
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,463
A trip into her psyche?

588
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,632
She said we needed more whimsy.

589
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,937
Barbara?

590
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:46,339
When I count down from three,

591
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:47,674
you will find me irresistible.

592
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:49,642
You will be madly

593
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:50,677
in love with me.

594
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:53,446
Three...

595
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:55,214
two...

596
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,817
one.

597
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,687
Barbara?

598
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:02,155
Do you care for me?

599
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,389
Oh, yes.

600
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:05,889
Do you love me?

601
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:09,128
Very much.

602
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,267
- Ooh...
- But...

603
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,755
what if I can't feel the same?

604
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:20,206
- Oh, dear.
- What if I love another?

605
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:21,374
I'm sorry,

606
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,409
Barbara, my dear, but...

607
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:28,815
Three, two, one, awake.

608
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,717
She's a bit sensitive to rejection.

609
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:36,723
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great Jervis Tetch.

610
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:40,760
Bravo!

611
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,315
- Did you find her?
- I found her.

612
00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:56,817
Lost her.

613
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:59,186
She shot a man and set fire to his body.

614
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:00,687
Said she had an infection.

615
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,389
Also said, she doesn't want anything

616
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:03,857
to do with you.

617
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,571
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on?

618
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,996
It's complicated.

619
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:12,099
My next stop will be the GCPD.

620
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:13,567
You can explain it to them.

621
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:15,669
Please, don't do that.

622
00:35:15,704 --> 00:35:17,604
Let's talk somewhere private.

623
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,040
Allow me to explain the situation.

624
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,821
So what does Alice have in her blood

625
00:35:33,856 --> 00:35:35,155
that makes it so infectious?

626
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:36,690
She doesn't look sick to me.

627
00:35:37,726 --> 00:35:39,259
She's not sick.

628
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:41,895
- She's powerful, sir.
- Powerful how?

629
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,565
- I need answers, Tetch!
- You deserve some.

630
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,999
Do you hear my watch ticking?

631
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:49,136
Yeah.

632
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:51,572
Listen closer.

633
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,940
The ticking,

634
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:56,343
it synchronizes with
your heartbeat, yes?

635
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:02,850
Look into my eyes.

636
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:05,485
Not above them, or around them,

637
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,354
into their center.

638
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:09,523
Are you asleep, Jim?

639
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:10,691
Yes.

640
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:11,892
Show me.

641
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:14,561
Take out your gun and
put it on the ground.

642
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:24,104
Good.

643
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:25,806
Now walk to the edge

644
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,307
and climb onto the wall.

645
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:33,714
Been such a long,

646
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:36,717
hard road for you, Jim Gordon.

647
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:41,421
You are so very tired
of life, aren't you?

648
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:43,457
Yes.

649
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,692
Now you can rest, Jim.

650
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:51,298
Close your eyes.

651
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,881
Sleep forever.

652
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,505
Deep down, you want to die, Jim.

653
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:13,130
You want to end this miserable,

654
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:16,179
empty, loveless life, don't you?

655
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:17,902
- Yes!
- Yes.

656
00:37:17,928 --> 00:37:19,060
Let me help you.

657
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:21,129
I'm going to count to ten.

658
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:22,664
When I reach ten,

659
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,499
you will simply

660
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,167
step off the ledge

661
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:29,170
and you will find everlasting peace.

662
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:34,150
Ready? Yes.

663
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:36,644
One.

664
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,179
Two.

665
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:39,781
Three.

666
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:41,115
Four.

667
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:43,816
- Five.
- Stop!

668
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:45,166
Alice?

669
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:46,367
Thank God!

670
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:47,835
At last, I've found you!

671
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:49,604
Tell that man to get off the ledge.

672
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,672
Never mind him.

673
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:52,674
- Put down the gun.
- Mister!

674
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:53,841
Get down!

675
00:37:53,877 --> 00:37:55,944
He can't hear you.

676
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:57,011
Don't come near me.

677
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:00,548
Why are you here

678
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:02,050
if you don't want to talk?

679
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:05,420
Put the gun down, Alice.

680
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:06,988
You're evil.

681
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,456
Leave me alone!

682
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:10,016
Or I'll kill you!

683
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:14,201
But, Alice, I love you.

684
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:43,024
Thank you.

685
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:59,140
I'm sane.

686
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:00,275
Absolutely.

687
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,810
100%. I examined you myself.

688
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:04,979
And the murder of Miss Kringle?

689
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:06,547
Committed while you were insane.

690
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,749
- Officer Dougherty.
- Insane.

691
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:09,050
- Officer Pinkney.
- Insane.

692
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:10,518
- And now I'm...
- Sane.

693
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:13,388
And not responsible for any of the acts

694
00:39:13,423 --> 00:39:14,922
perpetrated during your sickness.

695
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:17,325
You're a free man, Edward.

696
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,060
Not to look a gift horse in the mouth,

697
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,728
but how did you...

698
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:30,405
Never mind.

699
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:36,744
Hello, old friend.

700
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,133
Still thinking about
your meeting with Jim?

701
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:47,167
No.

702
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,669
There's nothing left to say.

703
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:49,836
It's all in the past now.

704
00:39:49,872 --> 00:39:50,837
It's been less than a year.

705
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:52,539
I think there's plenty to say.

706
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:54,341
After all you went through with him,

707
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:55,709
I just need to know that
nothing's left unsaid.

708
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:57,945
Well, you should speak
to him yourself, then.

709
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,447
- I did.
- You did?

710
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,215
- Mm-hmm.
- Something you could have mentioned

711
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:03,784
the moment we sat down.

712
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,018
When? How?

713
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:06,520
It's not like I wasn't gonna tell you.

714
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:08,522
He came into the ER, he needed stitches.

715
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:09,723
Of course.

716
00:40:09,758 --> 00:40:12,359
So I took the opportunity
to introduce myself.

717
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:15,596
He didn't make the connection
at first, because, um...

718
00:40:15,631 --> 00:40:18,098
you hadn't told him my name.

719
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,268
It never came up.

720
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:23,737
Right.

721
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:25,672
What do you mean, "right"?

722
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:29,543
Did I enter at a bad time?

723
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:34,147
Glad you could make it, Dad.

724
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:36,350
I'm honored that you invited me.

725
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:46,493
When Mario was born,

726
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,894
I promised my wife

727
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,963
that he would never
be part of our thing.

728
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:53,266
That we'd raise him to
lead a good, honest life.

729
00:40:53,302 --> 00:40:55,836
And we did.

730
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,237
And he has.

731
00:40:58,307 --> 00:40:59,673
He can't use the Falcone name,

732
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,275
but he's brought true
honor to the family.

733
00:41:02,311 --> 00:41:04,978
My wife is looking down on us now,

734
00:41:05,014 --> 00:41:06,446
and she's so proud and happy.

735
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:07,614
She would love you, Lee.

736
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,083
You're exactly the kind of woman

737
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,785
she would have wished for her son.

738
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,754
Thank you.

739
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:16,790
There's only one thing
that would've worried her.

740
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:18,086
Oh?

741
00:41:18,597 --> 00:41:20,927
My wife would say you're
a little too beautiful.

742
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:25,499
All the great tragedies
start with a face like yours.

743
00:41:27,192 --> 00:41:29,102
Makes men fall in love
when they shouldn't.

744
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:32,172
Makes them do crazy things.

745
00:41:32,207 --> 00:41:33,940
Dad, really?

746
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:35,809
You're referring to Jim Gordon.

747
00:41:38,013 --> 00:41:39,980
I've spoken with him.

748
00:41:40,337 --> 00:41:42,149
He's moved on.

749
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:43,950
I'm fine; he's fine.

750
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:45,719
We both have.

751
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,654
You've got nothing to worry about.

752
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,394
Here's to both of you.

753
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,988
A blessed union.

754
00:42:25,027 --> 00:42:26,460
What the hell are you doing here?

755
00:42:26,495 --> 00:42:28,161
I wanted to apologize

756
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:30,297
for the way I treated you last night.

757
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:35,068
I'm sorry. I was insensitive and rude.

758
00:42:35,104 --> 00:42:37,504
Hmm.

759
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:39,940
Does Alfred know you have his car?

760
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,374
No.

761
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,852
Why tell him? It's mine, not his.

762
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,063
Would you like to go for a ride?

763
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,350
Are you hungry?

764
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:51,918
What's with you?

765
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:55,222
You seem...

766
00:42:55,257 --> 00:42:57,157
different.

767
00:42:57,847 --> 00:42:59,431
Is that a bad thing?

768
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,195
Mm.

769
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:03,830
I could eat.

770
00:43:05,634 --> 00:43:07,874
Don't wait up, losers.
