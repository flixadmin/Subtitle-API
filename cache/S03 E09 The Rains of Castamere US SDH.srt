1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,801
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,324
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

3
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:08,628
Catelyn:
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

4
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,172
No.

5
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,383
It's dangerous.

6
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,512
If we take Tywin's
castle from him,

7
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:21,182
the lords of Westeros
will realize he's
not invincible.

8
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,517
Take his home,

9
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,644
take his gold,
take his power.

10
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,980
Why are you telling me?

11
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,360
You begged me
not to send Theon

12
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,573
to negotiate with his father
and I ignored your advice.

13
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,535
Now Winterfell is burnt
to the ground,

14
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,787
the North is overrun
with ironborn,

15
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,123
and Bran and Rickon
are gone.

16
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,627
So Casterly Rock...

17
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,717
I'm asking your advice.

18
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,142
We have enough men?

19
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,689
If Walder Frey cooperates.

20
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,901
If Walder Frey
cooperates.

21
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,909
If reinforcements arrive
from King's Landing

22
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>before we take</i>
<i>the castle...</i>

23
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,666
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

24
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,466
We'll lose the war and die
the way Father died.

25
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,635
Or worse.

26
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,435
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

27
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,218
Walder:
<i>My honored guests...</i>

28
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,180
be welcome
within my walls

29
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,099
and at my table.

30
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,478
<i>I extend to you</i>
<i>my hospitality</i>

31
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:34,565
and protection
in the light of the Seven.

32
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,402
We thank you for your
hospitality, my lord.

33
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,992
I have come to make
my apologies, my lord,

34
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,827
and to beg
your forgiveness.

35
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,122
Don't beg my forgiveness,
Your Grace.

36
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,002
It wasn't me you spurned.
It was my girls.

37
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,100
<i>One of them was supposed</i>
<i>to be queen.</i>

38
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,768
Now none of them are.

39
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,314
This is Arwyen
my daughter.

40
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,986
<i>My daughter Walda,</i>
<i>my daughter Derwa,</i>

41
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,655
<i>my daughter Waldra.</i>

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,412
My eldest granddaughters

43
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,749
<i>Ginia and Neila.</i>

44
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,588
<i>Serra and Sarra,</i>
<i>granddaughters, twins.</i>

45
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,256
You could have
had either.

46
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,468
<i>Could have had both</i>
<i>for all I care.</i>

47
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,095
My granddaughter
Marianne.

48
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,140
<i>My granddaughter Freya.</i>

49
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,810
My granddaughter...

50
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,729
Wertha.

51
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,817
<i>Waldra.</i>

52
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,819
Waldina.

53
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,530
- I'm Merry.
- Fine.

54
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,534
And here's my youngest
daughter Shirei,

55
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,454
<i>though she hasn't</i>
<i>bled yet.</i>

56
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,624
Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.

57
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,293
My ladies.

58
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,922
All men should
keep their word,
kings most of all.

59
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,551
I was pledged
to marry one of you
and I broke that vow.

60
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,470
<i>The fault</i>
<i>is not with you.</i>

61
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,057
<i>Any man would be lucky</i>
<i>to have any one of you.</i>

62
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,018
<i>I did what I did</i>
<i>not to slight you,</i>

63
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,812
but because I loved another.

64
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,688
<i>I know these words</i>
<i>cannot set right</i>

65
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,857
<i>the wrong I have done</i>
<i>to you and your house.</i>

66
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,152
I beg your forgiveness

67
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,322
and pledge to do
all I can to make amends

68
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,325
so the Freys of the Crossing
and the Starks of Winterfell

69
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,410
may once again be friends.

70
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,628
Walder:
<i>Very good.</i>

71
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,507
There she is.

72
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,676
<i>Come closer.</i>

73
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,845
Let me have a look at you.

74
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,937
Still can't see you.

75
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,231
Old eyes.

76
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,747
Love.

77
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,793
<i>That's what the Starks</i>
<i>of Winterfell call it, eh?</i>

78
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,879
( chuckles )

79
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,922
Very honorable.

80
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,341
I call it a pretty face.

81
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,595
Mmm, very pretty.

82
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,599
Prettier than this lot,
that's for sure.

83
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,144
Very shapely as well.

84
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,899
<i>Oh, you try to hide her</i>
<i>under that dress.</i>

85
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,775
If you wanted to hide her,

86
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,570
you shouldn't have brought her
here in the first place.

87
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:14,911
I can always see

88
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,997
what's going on
beneath a dress.

89
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,583
<i>Been at this a long time.</i>

90
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,712
<i>I bet when you take</i>
<i>that dress off,</i>

91
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,673
everything stays
right where it is.

92
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,634
Doesn't drop an inch.

93
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,805
Your king says he betrayed
me for love.

94
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,892
I say he betrayed me
for firm tits

95
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,394
and a tight fit.

96
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,189
And I can respect that.

97
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,985
When I was your age,
I'd have broken 50 oaths

98
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,822
to get into that
without a second thought.

99
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,371
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

100
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,414
We'll set up
tents outside

101
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,833
with food and ale
for the rest of your men.

102
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,253
Thank you, my lord.

103
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,924
Well, let's get ready.

104
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,884
The wine will flow red

105
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,513
<i>and the music</i>
<i>will play loud</i>

106
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,558
and we'll put
this mess behind us.

107
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,728
-<i> ( horse neighs )</i>
<i>- ( weapons clang )</i>

108
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,653
Where?

109
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,238
There.

110
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,872
There.
It's a back gate.

111
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,917
My men use it
when they visit
Yunkai's bed slaves.

112
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,752
Your men,
but not you?

113
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,337
Daario:
<i>I have no interest</i>
<i>in slaves.</i>

114
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,715
A man cannot make love
to property.

115
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,678
This is where
we enter the city.

116
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,054
Very few guards.
They know me.

117
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,597
They let me inside--

118
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,725
We're not gonna sneak
an army through a back gate.

119
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,644
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men

120
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,315
and lead them
through the back streets,
which I know well,

121
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,358
and open the front gates.

122
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,943
Then comes the army.

123
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,654
Once the walls
are breached, the city
will fall in hours.

124
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,699
Or perhaps you'll lead
Grey Worm and me
to the slaughter,

125
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,035
cutting the head
off our army.

126
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,537
<i>The masters of Yunkai</i>
<i>will pay you your fee</i>

127
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,205
and you won't have
to split it three ways

128
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,291
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

129
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,543
You have
a very suspicious mind.

130
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:31,047
In my experience,
only dishonest people
think this way.

131
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,384
You command the Unsullied.

132
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,511
<i>What do you think?</i>

133
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,264
<i>( Daenerys speaking</i>
<i>Valyrian )</i>

134
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,901
You leave tonight.

135
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,778
Very good.

136
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,946
We'll prepare.

137
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,661
Ser Jorah.

138
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,040
You can use
an extra sword.

139
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,709
You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan.

140
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,753
Your place
is by the queen.

141
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,089
If we are truly
her loyal servants,

142
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,132
we'll do whatever
needs to be done

143
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,637
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

144
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,892
We're west
of Castle Black,

145
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,936
but the Nightfort's
closest to us.

146
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,939
It was the first
castle on the Wall.

147
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,651
The Watch abandoned
it during the reign
of King Jaehaerys I.

148
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,279
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.

149
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,698
Other than
Castle Black itself,

150
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,118
the Nightfort's
the perfect castle for us.

151
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,788
It's got a secret
sally port,

152
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,207
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

153
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,044
No one's used it
in centuries most likely.

154
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,630
It leads through the Wall

155
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,799
right down
into the Nightfort,

156
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,634
if one knows
how to find it,

157
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,887
which, it just
so happens, I do.

158
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,853
How do you know
all that?

159
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:13,023
I read about it
in a very old book.

160
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,864
You know all that

161
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,908
from staring
at marks on paper?

162
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,036
Yes.

163
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,873
You're like a wizard.

164
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,806
Our father
used to tell us

165
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,519
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

166
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,980
Here we are.

167
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,483
Alive.

168
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,947
<i>( donkey braying )</i>

169
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,293
Remember what happens
to children who run.

170
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,379
I'm your father
and I'll do the talking.

171
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,433
The roads have gone
right to hell, haven't they?

172
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,644
Cracked three spokes
this morning.

173
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,854
- Need a hand?
- Need about eight hands.

174
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,648
Oh!

175
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,733
Got to get this
salt pork to the Twins

176
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,569
in time for the wedding.

177
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,113
Many thanks.

178
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,909
Don't!

179
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,077
Don't kill him.

180
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,162
Dead rats don't squeak.

181
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,830
You're so dangerous,
aren't you?

182
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,874
Saying scary things
to little girls.

183
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,752
Killing little boys
and old people.

184
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,254
A real hard man you are.

185
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,256
More than anyone
you know.

186
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,092
You're wrong.
I know a killer.

187
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,636
- A real killer.
- That so?

188
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,388
You'd be like
a kitten to him.

189
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,765
He'd kill you
with his little finger.

190
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,017
That him?

191
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,521
- No.
- Good.

192
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,440
Don't kill him.

193
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,734
Please.

194
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,820
Please don't.

195
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,449
You're very kind.

196
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,618
Someday it'll
get you killed.

197
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,996
( groaning )

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,043
( grunts )

199
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,804
Where are we?

200
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,639
The Gift, I think.

201
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,474
Brandon the Builder
gave all this land

202
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,685
<i>south of the Wall</i>
<i>to the Night's Watch</i>

203
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,646
for their sustenance
and support.

204
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,982
Maester Luwin
taught me that.

205
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,861
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

206
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,698
It's good land
and there's no war up here.

207
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,408
Why leave?

208
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,076
Wildlings.

209
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,453
Sorry.

210
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,623
But they come over
the Wall and raid,

211
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,333
steal, carry off women.

212
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,585
Old Nan said they turn
your skull into a cup

213
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,754
and make you drink
your own blood from it.

214
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,050
That's what Old Nan said.

215
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,551
There's a storm coming.

216
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,680
- I don't see any--
-<i> ( thunder rolling )</i>

217
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,935
It's as good a place
to shelter as any.

218
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,358
We can drink some blood
while we wait.

219
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,526
I don't need much.

220
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,404
( screeching )

221
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,707
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

222
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,710
What's one old man
doing with eight horses?

223
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,545
He breeds them
for the Watch.

224
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,631
How's he keep folks
from stealing them?

225
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,092
The Watch protects him.

226
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,344
Not today they don't.

227
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,888
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

228
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:16,308
- Tormund:<i> And proper steel.</i>
<i>- Let's carve him up.</i>

229
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,851
We just take
the horses and go.

230
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,437
The old man's no threat.

231
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,856
I keep telling you.

232
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,900
He's an old man.

233
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,528
A spear through the heart's
a better way to die

234
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,030
than coughing up
your last with no one
but your horses to hear.

235
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,743
The Watch might send a few men
looking for a horse thief.

236
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,746
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

237
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,707
I hope so.

238
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,668
Killing crows
in their castle is tough.

239
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,753
Killing them out here
in the open,

240
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,422
that's what we do.

241
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,090
Spread out.

242
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,759
Surround the hut
and move in.

243
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,745
- ( sword clangs )
- ( snorts )

244
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,372
( neighing )

245
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,803
Ygritte!

246
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,516
Man:
<i>Clear the barn!</i>

247
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,890
No one's going to believe
you're a hog farmer
if you eat them all.

248
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,434
Best part of the animal.

249
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,191
Don't worry.
They're still there.

250
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,860
I know
they're still there.

251
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,612
You check
every five minutes

252
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,448
like you're afraid
they're gonna move.

253
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,158
I'm not afraid.

254
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,494
Of course you are.

255
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,538
You're almost there

256
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,332
and you're afraid
you won't make it.

257
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,627
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

258
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,297
No point in trying to hide
behind that face.

259
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,259
<i>I know fear</i>
<i>when I see it.</i>

260
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,177
Seen it a lot.

261
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,139
I knew fear
when I saw it in you.

262
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,269
You're afraid of fire.

263
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,895
When Beric's sword
went up in flames,

264
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,022
you looked like
a scared little girl.

265
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,987
And I know why, too.

266
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,116
<i>I heard what</i>
<i>your brother did to you.</i>

267
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,660
Pressed your face
to the fire

268
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,413
like you're a nice
juicy mutton chop.

269
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,377
That give you some ideas?

270
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,883
Might do.

271
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,093
Go ahead, then.

272
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,470
You might get away.

273
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,848
Might even make it
there on your own.

274
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,310
They're just over
the river.

275
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,478
The closest you've
been to family

276
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,857
since Ilyn Payne
snipped your daddy's neck.

277
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,946
Someday I'm gonna put
a sword through your eye

278
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,698
and out the back
of your skull.

279
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,378
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

280
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,298
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

281
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,643
How are we going
to get past the Wall?

282
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,728
My uncle said
it's 700 feet high.

283
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,689
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

284
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,735
How did you get past it?

285
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,325
Got in a boat and rowed
past the Bay of Seals.

286
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,703
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

287
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,580
Some climb
straight up the ice.

288
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,292
Even Hodor's not strong
enough to climb the Wall
with me on his back.

289
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,295
Hodor.

290
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,839
- 19 castles
guard the Wall.
-<i> ( thunder booms )</i>

291
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,343
- Only three
are still manned.
- Hodor!

292
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,679
One of those abandoned
fortresses will give us
a way through.

293
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,889
My uncle said
the gates were sealed
with ice and stone

294
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,432
when the castles
were deserted.

295
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,435
Well, we'll have
to open them up again.

296
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,187
<i>( hoofbeats, horse neighs )</i>

297
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,107
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Meera:<i> There's a rider</i>
<i>out there.</i>

298
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,318
- Just one?
-<i> ( thunder crashes )</i>

299
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,153
- Meera:<i> There's more.</i>
<i>- Hodor!</i>

300
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,321
<i>( horses neighing )</i>

301
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,823
Shh. Shh.

302
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,701
- It's just thunder,
sweet giant.
- Hodor.

303
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,161
Man:
I yield.

304
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,830
-<i> I yield.</i>
<i>- Wildlings.</i>

305
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,791
<i>( men shouting )</i>

306
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,461
Where's Shaggydog
and Summer?

307
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,547
- Hunting.
-<i> ( horses neighing )</i>

308
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,549
-<i> ( thunder crashes )</i>
<i>- Hodor!</i>

309
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,759
- Shh, quiet, Hodor.
- Hodor!

310
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,720
Make him shut up.
If they hear us...

311
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,055
- Hush, Hodor.
No-- no more Hodoring.
- Hodor!

312
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,725
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

313
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,351
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

314
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,770
-<i> ( Hodor shouting )</i>
<i>- Bran: Hodor, be quiet.</i>

315
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,105
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

316
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,274
- Ah! Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

317
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,527
- Hodor! Hodor!
- Hodor, be quiet!

318
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,426
What did you do?

319
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,095
Nothing.

320
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,014
I don't know.

321
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,266
<i>( horse screaming )</i>

322
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,811
What's that?

323
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,440
That's a horse dying.

324
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,577
Man:
<i>Bring them over here.</i>

325
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,955
Man #2:
<i>That was the last of them.</i>
<i>The rest are dead.</i>

326
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,458
Orell:
<i>I heard shouting up there.</i>

327
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,460
Thunder.

328
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,129
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

329
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,549
Maybe it's ghosts.
( laughs )

330
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,346
( eagle screeching )

331
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,853
That won't
help you, grandpa.

332
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,651
Where you riding?

333
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,736
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

334
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,447
No, it doesn't
matter now.

335
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,744
Cut his throat or he'll
tell the crows we're here.

336
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,168
You understand.

337
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,087
Let me stand at least.

338
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,841
<i>Let me go</i>
<i>with a bit of dignity.</i>

339
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,514
Make the crow kill him.

340
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,437
You're one of us now.
Prove it.

341
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,236
The wolves are out there.

342
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,532
I can't do it by choice.

343
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,703
I don't know how.
It happens in my dreams.

344
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,872
You're a warg, Bran.

345
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,040
It's in your blood.

346
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,625
I can't.

347
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,502
You just did with him.

348
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,754
A wolf is nothing
compared to that.

349
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,055
She looks sharp.

350
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,352
( muttering prayer )

351
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,567
Do it.

352
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,944
Do it.

353
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,406
I told you.
He's still one of them.

354
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,118
Go on, boy.

355
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,372
Go on!

356
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,006
( groans )

357
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,758
He's a crow.

358
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,635
<i>He'll always be a crow.</i>

359
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,095
And here's his crow wife
guarding him.

360
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,682
He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.

361
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,812
- Kill him.
- ( Jon shouts )

362
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,869
( screaming )

363
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,038
- He's one of them.
- No!

364
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,748
Do you hear me?

365
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,375
( screams )

366
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,966
You're not gonna die
for one of them.

367
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,136
Do it.

368
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,013
They'll find us
if you don't.

369
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,100
<i>( swords clanging )</i>

370
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,190
( breathing heavily )

371
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,526
( growling )

372
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,994
( Orell shouts )

373
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,584
( gasps )

374
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,670
You were right
the whole time.

375
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,505
( gasps )

376
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,549
( eagle screeches )

377
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,599
( Jon screaming )

378
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,448
Hyah!

379
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,844
Daario:
<i>When you hear a songbird's</i>
<i>whistle, you come.</i>

380
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,890
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

381
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,856
- ( guard shouts in Valyrian )
- Daario Naharis.

382
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,831
<i>( whistling )</i>

383
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,136
Daario:
<i>That one was quick.</i>

384
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,599
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

385
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,685
The Yunkish prefer
to let their slaves do
their fighting for them.

386
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,854
( guards shouting )

387
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,900
That's what you call
a few guards?

388
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,031
( guards shouting )

389
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,708
<i>( men shouting )</i>

390
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,218
Come on!
What do you got, huh?

391
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,847
( cheering )

392
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,836
Lord Edmure...

393
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,924
I hope I'm not
a disappointment to you.

394
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,551
( chuckles )

395
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,768
You're a delight
to me, my lady.

396
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,896
You may now cloak
the bride

397
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,232
and bring her under
your protection.

398
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,679
In the sight of the Seven,

399
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:33,516
I hereby seal
these two souls,

400
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,020
binding them as one
for eternity.

401
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,231
<i>Look upon each other</i>
<i>and say the words.</i>

402
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,944
Both:
Father, Smith,

403
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,322
Warrior, Mother,

404
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,408
Maiden, Crone,
Stranger...

405
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,493
- I am hers...
- I am his...

406
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,662
-<i> and she is mine...</i>
<i>- and he is mine...</i>

407
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,791
Both:
<i>...from this day</i>
<i>until the end of my days.</i>

408
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,591
- Is that safe?
- They're long gone.

409
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,348
You were right.

410
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,892
I can get inside Summer's
mind whenever I want.

411
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,894
Of course you can.

412
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,605
North of the Wall
there are wildlings

413
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,524
who can control
all sorts of animals.

414
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,277
<i>But you did a lot</i>
<i>more than that.</i>

415
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,907
You got inside
Hodor's mind.

416
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,993
They can't do that
north of the Wall?

417
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,414
No one can do that...

418
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,707
<i>anywhere.</i>

419
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,675
When I was looking
through Summer's eyes,

420
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,551
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

421
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,220
He was with the wildlings.

422
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,222
They tried to kill him,
but he got away.

423
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,848
Osha:
<i>He'll be heading back</i>
<i>to Castle Black, then.</i>

424
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,642
That's where we should go.

425
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,061
For all we know,
Castle Black's already
under attack.

426
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,106
- If this many
wildlings got through--
- I already told you.

427
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,108
I'm not going
north of the Wall.

428
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,361
Everything Jojen
told me is true.

429
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,323
You saw what I did
to Hodor.

430
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,409
<i>I have to find</i>
<i>the three-eyed raven.</i>

431
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,910
Listen to me,
little lord.

432
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,203
Don't worry.

433
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,623
I'm not asking you
to come with me.

434
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,043
It won't be safe
for Rickon.

435
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,296
Me?
I'm coming with you.

436
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,507
No.

437
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,343
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

438
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,763
The Umbers
are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

439
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,473
I'm coming with you.

440
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,350
I'm your brother.

441
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,894
I have to protect you.

442
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,607
Right now I have
to protect you.

443
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,944
Robb's at war
and I'm going
beyond the Wall.

444
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,447
If something
happens to us,

445
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,782
you're the heir
to Winterfell.

446
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,453
Would you know how
to find the Last Hearth?

447
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,956
You southerners
build your big castles
and you never move.

448
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,791
You're easy to find.

449
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,419
We're not southerners.

450
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,505
And I don't want
to leave you.

451
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,216
Shh, shh.
Come here, little soldier.

452
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:17,430
You and me,
we're gonna have
some adventures.

453
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,807
You don't have to do
any of this.

454
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,975
( crying )

455
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,643
Your family
took me in

456
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,979
and was good
to me when they had
no cause to be.

457
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,315
<i>Shh.</i>

458
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,650
We'll be fine,
you and me.

459
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,736
The Umbers
are great warriors.

460
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,530
Even I heard
about them growing up.

461
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,824
They'll teach you
how to swing a sword.

462
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,787
I know how
to swing a sword.

463
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,500
( kisses )

464
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,171
You're leaving now?
It's the middle
of the night.

465
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,256
I learned to walk
in darkness.

466
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,469
Say your good-byes,
little man.

467
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,729
Keep this one safe.

468
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,525
He means
the world to me.

469
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,048
We've been waiting
a long time.

470
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,094
Haven't we?

471
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,847
I don't know,
you tell me.

472
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,307
How long does it take
to sack a city?

473
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,442
It was just as you said.

474
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,821
They did not believe
until it was too late.

475
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,739
Their slave soldiers

476
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,743
threw down their spears
and surrendered.

477
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,333
And Daario Naharis?

478
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,841
<i>( footsteps )</i>

479
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,273
The city is yours,
my queen.

480
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,526
<i>( music playing )</i>

481
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,195
<i>( people laughing,</i>
<i>chatting )</i>

482
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,756
They're good,
aren't they?

483
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,841
They ought to be
because they cost enough.

484
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,343
( laughs )

485
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,136
( laughs )

486
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,268
- Look at the crowd there.
- ( Catelyn laughs )

487
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,649
He complained
about this marriage

488
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,984
the entire ride
from Riverrun,

489
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,527
<i>and now look at him.</i>

490
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,655
Blackfish:
<i>The gods love</i>
<i>to reward a fool.</i>

491
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,032
- Uncle.
- What?

492
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,077
He's my nephew.
I love him.

493
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,162
And he's a damned fool.

494
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:30,790
( chuckles )

495
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,753
Don't you drink,
Lord Bolton?

496
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,297
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.

497
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,508
That's the point.

498
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,301
Didn't you marry
one of these Frey girls?

499
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,719
Aye.

500
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,721
Lord Walder let me
choose any of his
granddaughters

501
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:50,017
and promised me
the girl's weight
in silver as a dowry.

502
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,894
So I have
a fat young bride.

503
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,771
( laughs )

504
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,815
I hope she makes you
very happy.

505
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,692
Well, she's made me
very rich.

506
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,403
Pardon, my lord,
my lady.

507
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,114
I need to find
a tree to piss on.

508
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,368
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton.

509
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,703
I should rescue her.

510
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,705
Your mother is less
in need of rescue

511
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,581
than any woman
I've ever met.

512
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:13,791
Be kind.

513
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,085
She's finally starting
to like you.

514
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,380
And I like her.

515
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,675
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

516
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,845
playing my harp and you
would be sitting over there

517
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,889
<i>eating blackberries</i>
<i>out of Roslin Frey's hand.</i>

518
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,225
Perhaps I've made
a terrible mistake.

519
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,643
( scoffs )

520
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,106
Striking your king
is an act of treason.

521
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,986
No, don't.

522
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,697
Don't insult them.

523
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,410
Your Grace.

524
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,621
( pounding on tables )

525
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,958
<i>( pounding stops )</i>

526
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,920
The septon has prayed
his prayers,

527
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,381
<i>some words were said,</i>

528
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,091
and Lord Edmure

529
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,011
has wrapped my daughter
in a cloak.

530
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:11,640
But they are not yet
man and wife.

531
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,185
A sword needs a sheath.

532
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,438
( guests laughing )

533
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,191
( laughs )

534
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,903
- And a wedding
needs a bedding.
-<i> ( guests cheering )</i>

535
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,654
What does my sire say?

536
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,991
( guests chanting )
To bed! To bed! To bed!

537
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,665
If you think the time
is right, Lord Walder,

538
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,753
by all means,
let us bed them.

539
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,880
<i>( guests cheering )</i>

540
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,174
<i>( music playing )</i>

541
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,262
( chanting )
To bed! To bed! To bed!

542
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,854
Man:
<i>Go on!</i>

543
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,333
Oh!
Careful now, ladies.

544
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,460
Once you set
that monster free,

545
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,130
there's no caging
him again.

546
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,842
( chanting continues )
To bed! To bed! To bed!

547
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,805
Poor girl.

548
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,641
Every bride
suffers the same.

549
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,519
I'm sure you endured
yours with grace.

550
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,688
Oh, Ned forbade it.

551
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,275
He said it wouldn't be right
if he broke a man's jaw
on our wedding night.

552
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,569
( chuckles )

553
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,703
That is a very
strange custom.

554
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,538
I suppose it does
seem strange

555
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,456
from a foreigner's
perspective.

556
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,458
It seems normal
to you?

557
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,836
It's a tradition.

558
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,424
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

559
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,926
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

560
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,597
But there are other ways
of providing proof.

561
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,767
Boy or girl?

562
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,521
I don't know.

563
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,733
But if it's a boy,
I know what we should
name him.

564
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,693
Oh, do you?

565
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,655
It seems to me the father
should have some say in
his son's naming.

566
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,948
Eddard.

567
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,704
Don't you want to teach
little Ned Stark

568
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,081
how to ride horses?

569
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,459
I do.

570

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Where are you going?

578
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,084
Got salt pork
for the feast.

579
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,169
The feast is over.

580
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,755
Hound:
<i>Doesn't sound</i>
<i>like it's over.</i>

581
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,550
If I tell you
it's over, it's over.

582
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,721
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

583
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,889
Got pig's feet, too.

584
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,059
Are you soft
in the head?

585
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,936
Turn this cart around.

Please.

We will take
no vengeance.

You already swore me
one oath right here

would marry my daughter!

let him do that?

your wife's throat.
