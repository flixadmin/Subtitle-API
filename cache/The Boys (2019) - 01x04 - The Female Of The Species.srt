1
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,057
- Come on.
- Mm-mm.

2
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:45,892
- Just come with.
- Nuh-uh.

3
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:49,021
- Please?
- No fucking way.

4
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:52,065
This may be
their last reunion tour ever.

5
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:54,317
Yeah, I fucking hope so.

6
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,610
They're the best band.

7
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:57,404
Oh, come off it.

8
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,823
Look, I ain't stopping you.
If you really want to go,

9
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:01,992
I'll buy you front row seats.
You can take Rachel.

10
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,827
I don't want to take Rachel.

11
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,329
I want you to come with me.

12
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,498
I would be forced to chop
my fucking ears off.

13
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,268
- I'll make a mess everywhere.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:11,877
Then I would just have
to clean it up.

15
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:13,545
- You would?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:15,547
Smart-ass.

17
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:17,215
You love it.

18
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:19,217
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.

19
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,719

- Hi.
- Good morning.

38
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:12,956
Morning, Deputy Director.

39
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,337
How did you get in here?

40
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,381
You're like the fucking mold

41
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:22,924
on my laundry room tiles.

42
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:25,927
You scrape it off,
comes right back.

43
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:30,223
Sounds like you got a little bit
of a moisture problem, luv.

44
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:32,392
Security, please.

45
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:34,853
I can stop 'em getting Supes
in the military.

46
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:36,855
What makes you think I care?

47
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:39,983
Personally, I can't wait
until they're in Syria.

48
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,277
Yeah, I'll bet.

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,863
Last week.

50
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,073
A-Train, mainlining

51
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:48,700
before the big race.
His fuck buddy,

52
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,118
Popclaw,

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,662
pinning the same stuff.

54
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,456
They call it Compound V.
It's some kind of

55
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:56,208
booster or steroid for Supes.

56
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,417
Jacks 'em right up.

57
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,502
Now, word gets out that Supes

58
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:01,254
are nothing but a bunch
of juice junkies,

59
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:03,924
no one's gonna want 'em
in national defense.

60
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:05,175
Mm-hmm.

61
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:07,219
Got a sample?

62
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,012
Not yet.

63
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:10,013
Mm.

64
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,514
This could be heroin.

65
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:13,225
It could be anything.

66
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,559
You don't trust me.

67
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,603
Susan, I am shocked and saddened
by that.

68
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:17,604
Really?

69
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:18,772
I'm sure.

70
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,398
Speaking of which,

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,901
I haven't seen Translucent
around anywhere.

72
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:26,488
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

73
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:27,906
Cunt's invisible.

74
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,741
He could be standing
in that fucking corner,

75
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,993
plugging one out right now,
for all we know.

76
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:36,289
Look, you think Supes
are cunts now?

77
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:38,500
You just wait till
they're wearing camo.

78
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,252
I mean, what's to stop
Sergeant Homelander

79
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,504
from killing a couple
of hundred thousand Chinese?

80
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,673
How are you gonna try him
for war crimes?

81
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,108
He's gonna murder
the bloody lot of us

82
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,926
before he steps one foot
in The Hague.

83
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:50,220
I mean, you might as well
hand the bloody launch keys

84
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:51,680
over to Vought right now.

85
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,645
You're really working
this one, huh?

86
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:01,815
Just being
an upstanding citizen, luv.

87
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:04,025
Oh, I know.

88
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:07,028
Okay.

89
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,322
You get me some hard proof,

90
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:12,450
something actionable
that I can use,

91
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:16,413
and maybe I'll throw you
a few bucks.

92
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:18,540
For your operating costs.

93
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:25,422
But if you fuck me on this,

94
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:28,300
for the rest of your life,
you'll be drinking your own piss

95
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:31,136
at a black site.

96
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,555
Say you understand.

97
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:38,518
See, now, Susan, this is why
it never went anywhere with us.

98
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,187
You can't have two alpha males,
'cause inevitably someone's...

99
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,400
Say you fucking understand.

100
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:49,487
I understand.

101
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,781
Remind me, what was our deal?

102
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:54,743
- What?
- What was our fucking deal?

103
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:58,413
Go to hell. I already told you,
A-Train runs the Compound...

104
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:00,999
Yeah, runs the Compound V to
the noodle shop up on Division.

105
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,793
We've been up on it all week
and we ain't seen fuck all.

106
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:05,962
Well, wherever he's going,
it's around there,

107
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:07,839
because every time
he leaves with the V,

108
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,109
he comes back with the sesame
noodles. That's all I know.

109
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,843
Well, you'd better
be right, love,

110
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:14,387
or you and your dearly
departed landlord

111
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:16,181
are gonna find yourselves
on Pornhub

112
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:18,058
in the Fatal Cunnilingus
section.

113
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,352
You son of a bitch,
if you even...

114
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:26,524
Sorry, baby, just, work's

115
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,401
just been a motherfucker lately.

116
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:30,379
You know I'd much rather be
at home, rubbing on them toes

117
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,839
than out here breaking up
yard fights,

118
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:34,199
but you know, a brother
got to get paid, right?

119
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,742
Oh, most definitely.

120
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:38,203
Payday comes, we gonna be
all up in Kay Jewelers,

121
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:39,996
tearing it down.

122
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:41,581
Champagne showers.

123
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,294
I know, I know,
I'm just kidding.

124
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,463
All right, sweetheart.
Talk to you.

125
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,803
Say something.

126
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,432
Well, you know,
Jean-Paul Sartre said

127
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:03,520
marriage stifles
our essential male urges.

128
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:06,523
Jean-Paul Sartre also died
a old, lonely motherfucker.

129
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:08,233
Not to mention his girl

130
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:09,818
was shacking up
with some other dude.

131
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,903
Uh, oui.
They were free to explore.

132
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:14,197
Explore what? Gonorrhea?

133
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:16,199
Come on, Frenchie.

134
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,576
Why work so motherfucking hard
if you don't have somebody

135
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,620
to go home to and sleep
next to at night?

136
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:23,456
Well, I go to sleep next to
someone different every night.

137
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:25,351
Yeah, and that's 'cause you're
an old, lonely fucker, too.

138
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,377
- And you're gonna die by yourself.
- Mm.

139
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,379
Well, if you and Monique
have something so pure,

140
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:32,424
why are you lying to her
about where you are?

141
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,853
Noodle Guy. He's packing.

142
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:47,313
About time we see something.

143
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:30,064
We got to go in there, don't we?

144
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,983
Don't be scared, petit Hughie.

145
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:35,278
Will you stop calling me that?
I'm, like, six feet tall.

146
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,751
Let's hurry up, let's go.

147
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:34,170
Check those boxes.

148
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,886
Frenchie, look for the V.

149
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,687
Frenchie, come on, let's go,

150
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,730
Check these boxes.

151
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:59,612
Come on, Frenchie,
what are you doing?

152
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:01,739
Are you deaf?

153
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,785
Jesus.

154
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,710
Who's that?

155
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,712
I think we should let her go.

156
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:18,798
No, no, no, no, no, uh-uh. We're
here for the V, and we get out.

157
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,508
This isn't a rescue.

158
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,552
You sound like Butcher.

159
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:24,887
I sound like a motherfucker
that wants to be breathing.

160
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:30,310
Goddamn it, Frenchie,
what the...

161
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,646
Hey! Don't set her free!

162
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:42,530
Oh, my God!

163
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:57,045
Oh, fuck.

164
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:59,088
Hughie, let's go!
Let's go, Hughie!

165
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,256
Come on!

166
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:27,283
Couple weeks ago,
we were all getting...

167
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:29,327
we were all getting wasted
in the common room.

168
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:31,746
It was, like,
Super Bowl, I think.

169
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,542
And I don't know.
Maybe I was just drunk, but...

170
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:41,214
you know, I tried.

171
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,927
I-I really tried...

172
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:48,054
to talk to the guys.

173
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:50,056
About...?

174
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:52,850
Dolphins.

175
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:54,977
Did you know, in Japan,
that they

176
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,522
hunt down and slaughter
20,000 dolphins a year?

177
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,524
Intelligent animals.

178
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:02,860
Yeah,
that have regional accents, and

179
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:05,113
a great sense of humor.
I mean, they're...

180
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:07,115
They're hilarious.

181
00:12:07,156 --> 00:12:10,118
Yeah.

182
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,037
And that night, A-Train

183
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:18,501
thought it'd be funny to stick
a blow-up dolphin in my bed.

184
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,003
With lipstick on its blowhole.

185
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:23,297
Yeah, real creative pricks.

186
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:28,761
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:30,930
That must have hurt.

188
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:36,436
Yeah, I'm-I'm...
I'm the diversity hire.

189
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:38,813
I'm a joke.

190
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:44,777
I mean, yeah,
I can talk to fish. So what?

191
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:49,115
How often do you need to be
saved by a school of salmon?

192
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:52,243
Kevin, that's just not true.

193
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,955
Where would that Carnival
cruise ship be without you?

194
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:59,917
Yeah. I know.

195
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:06,424
Okay, I need to...
self-actualize,

196
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,675
show more confidence.

197
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:10,970
After all, who are you?

198
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,139
I'm one of The Seven.

199
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:14,766
And what does that mean?

200
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,434
I can do anything
I set my mind to.

201
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:19,312
What do you want
to set your mind to?

202
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:48,966
What a mess.

203
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:52,303
You all right?

204
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:53,596
I mean, just when you think

205
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:55,032
this shit can't get
any more horrible...

206
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,432
Nah, don't worry.

207
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:59,644
It can get a lot more horrible.

208
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:21,082
Butcher, come check this out.

209
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,713
Take a look.

210
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:31,551
V.

211
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,596
So, A-Train's running it here,

212
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:37,974
and these blokes are dosing
the Asian bird with it.

213
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,284
Yeah, back when
they had eyeballs.

214
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:41,561
Yeah, but why?

215
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:44,188
Is it a Vought thing or,
like, a side hustle?

216
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,940
Came gift-wrapped in this.

217
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:51,404
Find out where it came from.

218
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:53,531
I'll shake a few trees.

219
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,534
Why the hell were they
dosing her?

220
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:58,744
Why don't we ask
foie gras over here?

221
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:00,746
He's the one that let her out.

222
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:02,832
- She looked innocent.
- Innocent?

223
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:06,377
She's locked up
in a cage, underground,

224
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:07,879
with two armed guards?

225
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,547
I had a feeling about her.

226
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,841
Nah, Frenchie,
you just didn't follow the plan.

227
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:13,259
You never follow the plan, man.

228
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:15,052
You need to unclench
your asshole.

229
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,554
You need to eat
my clenched asshole,

230
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,282
- how 'bout that?
- Why are you two carrying on

231
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,391
like a bunch of fucking twats?

232
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:21,785
We're sniffing down
a shit sandwich

233
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,185
the size of Watergate.

234
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:26,147
Vought and the Supes are both
gonna be looking for her.

235
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:29,317
All we got to do is
find the female first.

236
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:36,741
Keep looking.

237
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:41,162
Who's that, then, eh?

238
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:43,080
It's nobody.

239
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:51,297
"Annie?" Starlight?

240
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,341
Yeah, it's nothing.
I mean, we were supposed to

241
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:54,592
go on a date.

242
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,802
Not a date, just, she asked me

243
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,804
if I wanted to ask her
for her number,

244
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,073
and then we just
kind of platonically

245
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:01,366
exchanged information, but the...

246
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,768
The word "date" was
never mentioned.

247
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,811
Call her back right now.
You're fucking going.

248
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:10,316
As a rule, I don't usually
go out after a gory massacre.

249
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:12,151
Listen, here's the job.

250
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:13,611
You're gonna hot mic her phone.

251
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:15,947
From now on, we hear
everything she says.

252
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,324
I mean,
this is a golden opportunity.

253
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:21,702
And after all you done,
piece of cake.

254
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:25,748
Yeah, she's not a...
She's not a bad person.

255
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,419
She's a Supe, Hughie.

256
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:33,005
Just like the fucking rest
of them.

257
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,845
Okay, we are not gonna be able
to cover this up forever.

258
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:42,264
Translucent does not
show his face soon,

259
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:43,683
people are gonna start
to notice.

260
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:44,952
What if we just
get in front of it?

261
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:46,894
Tell the world
he died tragically

262
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:48,396
in the service of his country.

263
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,898
We could have an amazing
funeral, bigger than Kennedy's.

264
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,192
I don't know, admit that
one of our unkillable

265
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:54,860
superheroes just got killed?

266
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,612
Kiss that military bill
good-bye.

267
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:58,155
Let's not overthink it.

268
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,074
We just say he's on
a classified mission.

269
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:03,953
We can't say where, in the
interest of national security.

270
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,389
All we can say is
he's fighting MS-13.

271
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:06,664
Ooh, yes. That's good.

272
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,207
Simple. Done. Boom.

273
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,334
MS-13. I like it.

274
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:12,753
Hello?

275
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:17,925
What? When?

276
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:22,555
How many people know?

277
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:24,223
Seven minutes ago,

278
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,600
Trans-Oceanic Flight 37
from Paris to Chicago

279
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:28,811
was hijacked mid-air.

280
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:30,229
- Seven minutes ago?
- Yeah.

281
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:31,897
A source from NORAD
gave us a heads up.

282
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:33,149
How many hijackers?

283
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,233
Well, looks like three.

284
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,027
Did they scramble F-16's?

285
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:37,737
Yep, as we speak.

286
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:40,489
But you can get there quicker.

287
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,242
Can I please have the room?

288
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,329
Oh, middle of the Atlantic.

289
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:49,749
- Yep.
- No-man's-land.

290
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,709
You can't operate
on foreign soil,

291
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,961
but a plane hijacked
over international waters...

292
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:56,756
If you intercept,
no one will protest.

293
00:17:56,797 --> 00:18:00,259
If you bring those passengers
back alive,

294
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:02,511
not one congressman
will have the balls

295
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,472
to vote against our bill.

296
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:06,432
Mm-hmm.

297
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:13,147
This is our chance.

298
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:16,442
More important than Translucent.

299
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:19,320
More important than anything.

300
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,450
Concentrated halothane.

301
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:28,954
It's not a guarantee,

302
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:31,290
but it should knock out
your girl.

303
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:33,209
Merci, pumpkin.

304
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,211
I must go; This girl,
she's got a head start.

305
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:38,964
Hey, I miss you.

306
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:41,342
I got us a pied-á-terre
on the Bowery.

307
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:44,720
When will you be coming by?

308
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:48,766
As soon as I can.

309
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:49,767
Promise.

310
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:50,809
- Promise?
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:56,524
Don't make me use
that gas on you,

312
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,400
huh, pumpkin?

313
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,027
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

314
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:02,279
- Okay.
- Mm. Oh...

315
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,323
Mm.

316
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:30,599
Fuck!

317
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:36,355
When will they intercept?

318
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,399
Corporal, I don't care
who is in the room with you,

319
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,152
I need a goddamn update.

320
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:43,070
Jesus.

321
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:45,072
Hey. Do you have a second?

322
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:46,782
It is not really a good time.

323
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:49,076
I'd really appreciate it.
Super quick.

324
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:51,662
- Pretty please? Thank you.
- No... Oh, okay.

325
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:55,624
So... I found a mission.

326
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,834
Uh-huh.

327
00:19:56,876 --> 00:20:00,671
And I think
it's really important.

328
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:03,299
And I'd like to do it,
with your permission, of course.

329
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,634
What? Where?

330
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:08,721
- Oceanland.
- Oceanland?

331
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:13,350
Yeah. So, get this,
the dolphins there,

332
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:17,730
I mean, they are really underfed
and abused.

333
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:21,567
To be quite honest,
they're really frustrated.

334
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:24,403
And I'd like to, you know,
just shine a light on it.

335
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:26,739
I think people would
really respond to that.

336
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,492
You do realize that you are
at the centerpiece

337
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:32,786
of the Oceanland fall campaign?

338
00:20:32,828 --> 00:20:34,997
Yeah, well, I mean, we could
just bail on that, right?

339
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,498
The deal sucks anyways.

340
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,042
No, we can't.

341
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,627
Listen, I'd just like to,
you know,

342
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:42,588
maybe do something
with a little more substance.

343
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,548
Okay.

344
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,716
- Yeah?
- I hear you. Yes.

345
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:46,800
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

346
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:49,887
Deep...

347
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,180
play to your strengths.

348
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:08,948
Hey. Baby.

349
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:10,866
Hey...

350
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:18,123
What'd you do?

351
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:20,876
What the hell are you
talking about?

352
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:23,295
Who did you tell about
Compound V?

353
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:27,049
Nobody. Why? What...

354
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:30,052
Because you're the only
person who knew, other than me,

355
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:33,514
that I had it...
where I was taking it.

356
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:37,184
I-I didn't tell anyone anything.

357
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,519
You're being paranoid.

358
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,562
Who else did you fucking tell?!

359
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,778
Don't yell at me.

360
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,282
Listen to me.

361
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:52,324
Sit down.

362
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:07,089
Look, I love you. You know I do.

363
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:09,633
I've loved you since
the first time that we met.

364
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:12,803
Oh, really?
I heard you at the race.

365
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,764
No girlfriend. Open to offers.

366
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:17,683
Come on, I have to say
those things.

367
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:20,978
You know this. They make me.

368
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,522
It's my brand.

369
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:27,901
Come here.

370
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:31,405
Come here.

371
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:38,495
You remember when you relapsed?

372
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:39,913
Yes.

373
00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:42,291
And I stayed and I rubbed
your back.

374
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,626
Cleaned up your puke.

375
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:49,590
I'm there for you, always.

376
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:56,263
I know, baby.

377
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,976
Please,

378
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:03,771
tell me who you told.

379
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:06,440
'Cause we're in trouble.
We're in a lot of trouble.

380
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:17,034
I didn't tell anyone.

381
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:34,426
Either way, you're gonna
have to pack a bag,

382
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:36,970
so get everything that you need.

383
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:39,098
Why? Where are we going?

384
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:41,141
I'm gonna take care of this,

385
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:43,143
but until I do,
I got to get you somewhere safe,

386
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:45,187
before Homelander finds out.

387
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:49,483
I love you.

388
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,448
I love you, too.

389
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:26,270
Mani? Pedi? Special deal.

390
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:35,070
The hilarious
Dolphins Ahoy Extravaganza,

391
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:37,698
starring these two knuckleheads.

392
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:41,785
So this fall, remember, go Deep.
Go Oceanland.

393
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:44,371
All right, let's see
what you got.

394
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:01,096
You said you, uh,
you bowled before?

395
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:03,724
Yeah, I'm just a little rusty.

396
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:07,060
- You?
- Uh, yeah. Here, actually.

397
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:08,729
My whole life.

398
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,397
I had my first kiss
with Amy Seeler

399
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,107
in the men's bathroom
when I was 14.

400
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:15,110
- It was really romantic.
- Yeah.

401
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:18,155
I'm sure that's exactly how
she pictured her first kiss.

402
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:20,073
Excuse me.
Where was your first kiss?

403
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:21,074
Prom.

404
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:23,827
It was amazing.

405
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:26,997
Wait, senior prom?

406
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,999
So your first kiss
was when you were 18?

407
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,834
Mm-hmm.

408
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,461
Which you're not joking about,

409
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:34,463
and that's fine, that's great.

410
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:37,508
Yeah, I had a very
Jesus-centric childhood.

411
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:44,515
Yeah!

412
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:49,353
He never asked me out again.

413
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:52,147
Sorry. Um, what were you saying?

414
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:55,067
No, just about prom.

415
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:57,486
- What was it... what about...
- Nothing.

416
00:25:57,528 --> 00:25:58,820
It's-it's stupid.

417
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:03,450
Um, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna throw one.

418
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:08,830
Ah! Ah.

419
00:26:08,872 --> 00:26:11,208
So what's, uh,
what's Translucent like?

420
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,628
That's a conversational
left turn.

421
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,380
Yes, it was.
I'm sorry about that.

422
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:18,048
Sorry. Yeah, it just
popped into my head.

423
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,800
As a kid, he was my favorite.

424
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:22,553
You said the other ones
were dicks; Is he a dick, too?

425
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:27,474
Well, I mean, he's not great
with privacy or boundaries,

426
00:26:27,516 --> 00:26:29,518
I will say that.

427
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,312
But otherwise,
he seems like a loner.

428
00:26:32,354 --> 00:26:34,773
He spends most of his free time
with his son.

429
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:41,238
- He's got a son?
- Yeah. Early divorce, I think.

430
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,156
He's about ten.

431
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:46,118
Hunter or Maverick
or something like that.

432
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:15,731
It's okay.

433
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:54,394
All right, everyone,
it's all over.

434
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:58,774
It's all safe.
You're all gonna be fine.

435
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:02,235
Thank you, Homelander!

436
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:05,906
Oh, no, no.

437
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:08,450
Come on, now. You guys.

438
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:10,452
You guys made it.

439
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:12,329
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

440
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:13,538
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

441
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,539
Good for you.

442
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:16,875
You guys are amazing, fantastic.

443
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:17,918
Go, Maeve!

444
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,503
Hey, let's get
a round of applause

445
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:20,879
for Queen Maeve.

446
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:22,130
Yeah!

447
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,389
Captain?

448
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:33,392
Stop. Stop.

449
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,268
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, easy, fella.

450
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,854
Take it easy.

451
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:39,981
There you go, just relax.

452
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:54,037
ATC!

453
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,747
It's dead!

454
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,375
Can you fly a plane?

455
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,419
Wouldn't matter if I did!

456
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,882
What do we do?

457
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:19,646
All right, everyone,
remain calm.

458
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:23,108
Stay in your seats.
Everything's under control.

459
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,986
You got to go out there,
lift the plane up.

460
00:29:26,027 --> 00:29:29,156
Lift the plane? How?
There's nothing to stand on.

461
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:30,365
It's fucking air.

462
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:32,159
I don't know, fly at it,
ram it straight.

463
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,288
No, that kind of speed, either
the plane goes ass over tit

464
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:38,290
or I'll punch straight
through the hull, or...

465
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:45,172
Whoa! Whoa, that was a big one!

466
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,883
Everything's fine,
don't worry about it.

467
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:53,805
Okay. Okay.

468
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:56,475
You take everybody, one by one,
you fly them to the ground.

469
00:29:56,516 --> 00:30:00,312
And what? Come back 123 times?

470
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:02,355
Maeve, think.

471
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:07,611
We're done here.

472
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:10,697
- Please.
- Everything's fine, guys.

473
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:14,075
- Everything's fine. You're okay.
- Wait, you're leaving us?

474
00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:16,495
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just
seeing something down the back.

475
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:19,706
Oh, my God, you're leaving.

476
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:21,458
- He's leaving us.
- I said I'm not...

477
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,169
Whoa!

478
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:26,213
Homelander,
are you going to save us?

479
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:29,174
Oh, sweetheart, of course
I'm gonna save you,

480
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:30,842
you betcha.

481
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:32,928
I'm gonna save everyone here,
don't worry about it.

482
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:36,723
- Ma'am, relax, hands off me.
- It's okay. It's okay.

483
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:42,270
Maeve!

484
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:06,628
Okay, you two,
take off your masks. Come on.

485
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,422
Now!

486
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,594
- Take these two!
- No, no.

487
00:31:14,636 --> 00:31:16,197
- Just these two! Please!
- No! What, so they

488
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:17,681
can tell the world that we left

489
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,140
the rest of them to fucking die?

490
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:22,269
- Come on!
- No, Maeve. No. You stay back!

491
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,604
All of you, stay back.

492
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:27,524
You stay the fuck back
or I'll laser you, goddamn it!

493
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:29,776
I will laser every
fucking one of you!

494
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:32,153
Stay back!

495
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:34,155
Let's go.

496
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:37,242
No, Maeve, no!

497
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:39,160
- Please stay!
- I'm sorry.

498
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:40,328
- Take us!
- Maeve!

499
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,914
Please, don't leave us. Please!

500
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:44,749
Maeve!

501
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:47,794
Don't die with them.

502
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:49,629
Maeve.

503
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:51,882
- What is wrong with you?
- Please, Maeve!

504
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:55,135
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

505
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:56,928
Please take her.

506
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,305
Take my daughter!

507
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,102
- Please! Please take her!
- Please.

508
00:32:04,144 --> 00:32:05,937
Take her!

509
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,593
Oh, look at this.

510
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:39,763
- Homicide.
- You got here fast.

511
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:42,766
- Yeah, it was on the squawker.
- What's with the accent?

512
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,225
What's with yours?

513
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:47,395
You ever seen her here before?

514
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:50,273
Maybe a year ago.

515
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:56,321
It's a gang hit.

516
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,033
A gang hit?

517
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:03,828
- And who told you that, eh?
- I'm not arguing with him.

518
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,997
I'm looking into it.

519
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:08,917
Excuse me.

520
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:13,922
Cheers, mate.

521
00:33:31,314 --> 00:33:34,693
A-Train saw me
a fucking week ago.

522
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:38,196
- What if he made me?
- He didn't see you.

523
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:40,782
Listen, that's easy for you to
say, Butcher, but I got people.

524
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:42,951
Oh? And I don't?

525
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:49,457
Look, Vought don't send a Supe
to do a gang hit, all right?

526
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:51,042
He was after the female.

527
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:53,670
Hey, man, who was the woman?

528
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,422
Roberta Cho, mother of four,

529
00:33:55,463 --> 00:33:58,967
loved Mexican food, and smuggled
in a ton of immigrants

530
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:02,095
- from all over the Pacific.
- Eh, like our girl.

531
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:03,513
A-Train, can I get a selfie?

532
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:07,100
I got it.

533
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:11,563
That wanker can cover
all of Manhattan in 30 minutes.

534
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:13,565
He's gonna find her
before we do.

535
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:15,692
No, he won't.
I know where she's going.

536
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:19,237
Penn Station.

537
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:22,449
She's working her way backwards.
She's trying to get home.

538
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:30,790
I'm Ezekiel, and I want you
to join me at the BELIEVE EXPO,

539
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:33,001
June 6 to 10 at the Fairgrounds.

540
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:34,961
Sponsored
by Samaritan's Embrace.

541
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:36,588
We're gonna have music,

542
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:39,299
we're gonna have worship,
food trucks and,

543
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,886
oh, yeah, Christ.

544
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:46,598
Featuring Homelander
and Starlight from The Seven.

545
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,558
- Hey.
- I know.

546
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,019
Look, I'm not down to convert
the masses or anything,

547
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:53,938
I'm just...
I'm doing a panel for teens.

548
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,524
And, uh, I'm donating
my appearance fee

549
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:58,151
to the Covenant House.

550
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,779
You are literally
the nicest person in the city.

551
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,490
No, seriously.

552
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:06,034
Every other nice person
can fuck off and go home.

553
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:08,411
I mean, that's why I do it.

554
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:12,415
Vindictive personal glory.

555
00:35:15,543 --> 00:35:18,088
You okay?

556
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:21,424
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

557
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:26,638
You seem a little...

558
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,515
I don't know.

559
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:48,910
Hmm.

560
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,705
Okay.

561
00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:56,835
I'll come clean.

562
00:35:56,876 --> 00:36:00,255
If I'm being honest...

563
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:01,840
I'm a little suspicious of you.

564
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:04,134
You are?

565
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:07,512
Yeah. I mean,
you say you bowled a lot.

566
00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:11,015
And you know, you have,
like, superpowers,

567
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:13,726
yet you are
a remarkably shitty bowler.

568
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:17,856
You know what
I think is happening?

569
00:36:17,897 --> 00:36:20,608
I think you're holding back
for some weird,

570
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,280
"not gonna show me up
on a first date" reason.

571
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:28,533
You want to quit stroking my ego
and show me what you really got?

572
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,502
Holy shit.

573
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:43,756
Now that's a strike.

574
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,468
Yeah.

575
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,723
Yeah, that's great, man.

576
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:53,558
Good looking out. Thanks.

577
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,560
Well? Don't leave us hanging.

578
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:57,979
Okay, so Deshawn's a brother
that grew up on my block,

579
00:36:58,021 --> 00:36:59,397
but now he delivers packages.

580
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:00,940
Yeah, not the part
I'm interested in.

581
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:02,817
He ran down the account number

582
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:05,778
and the box containing the V
came from Samaritan's Embrace.

583
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,488
Ezekiel's Supe charity?

584
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,074
What the fuck's
that Jesus-thumping,

585
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:12,327
elastic bastard
got to do with it?

586
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:15,371
Maybe we find the girl,
we find out.

587
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,373
Yeah. All right.

588
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:20,335
Platforms, ground floor,
I'll take upstairs.

589
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,271
Whoever pings her, get onto
Frenchie and stick with her

590
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:23,535
till we use the gas, all right?

591
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,019
If you're just tuning in,

592
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:40,730
authorities have lost
all radar and satellite imagery

593
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:44,734
of hijacked Flight 37
and fear the worst.

594
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:46,694
Search planes have begun
to fan out

595
00:37:46,736 --> 00:37:48,529
over the flight path
off the Atlantic...

596
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:54,095
Non, non.

597
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:01,436
It's okay. It's gone.

598
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:05,023
It's gone, you see?

599
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:07,984
I'm not here to hurt you.

600
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,825
You like music, huh?

601
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:19,579
Well, me, too.

602
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:25,626
C-Can I tell you a secret
I never told anyone?

603
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:33,551
When I was a boy,

604
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:35,845
my father, he stole me
from Mamma.

605
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:40,475
In Marseilles, middle of the
night, just broke in, took me.

606
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:42,477
Kept me with him for years.

607
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,520
Hotel after hotel.

608
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:48,900
Every few nights,
take me out for a walk.

609
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:53,446
Smoke a Gauloise,
tell me he loved me, then...

610
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:02,955
I tried to run away
so many times.

611
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:10,380
I jumped buses, trains.

612
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:13,841
Anything to get back
to Marseilles.

613
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:17,345
To Mamma.

614
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:21,224
But every time, he find me.

615
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,688
So I know what it's like
to want to go home.

616
00:40:34,362 --> 00:40:37,365
You see, I know your secret.

617
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:42,412
You're not a bad person.

618
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:46,999
Just a scared one.

619
00:40:53,423 --> 00:40:55,633
Let me help you.

620
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:06,811
Reports of suspicious
activity...

621
00:41:13,776 --> 00:41:14,944
Coming through.

622
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:22,869
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no...

623
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,663
Frenchie. Did you see her?
Which way did she go?

624
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:27,099
- I don't know.
- Did you try to gas her?

625
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:28,416
- No.
- Why not?

626
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,227
- It didn't seem right, huh?
- You went off plan

627
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:33,171
- because it didn't seem right?
- I'm sorry, okay?

628
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:40,094
Ah, Sean Jakowski.
Cross-country team.

629
00:41:40,136 --> 00:41:43,431
- Mm.
- I had such a huge crush on him,

630
00:41:43,473 --> 00:41:45,808
and he finally asked me out
to this party.

631
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,978
My hair looked cute,
we held hands, it was perfect.

632
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,647
Then, all of a sudden,
this senior shoved Sean,

633
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:53,065
and then he hit him.

634
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:56,110
So I stepped in,
I kicked the guy's ass.

635
00:41:56,152 --> 00:41:57,945
- Good for you.
- Mm.

636
00:41:57,987 --> 00:41:59,655
Want to know
how Sean thanked me?

637
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:01,741
- How?
- Never spoke to me again.

638
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:03,743
Not one word.

639
00:42:03,784 --> 00:42:06,329
And that's when I learned,

640
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,415
never show your strength
to a boy you like.

641
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:12,627
Well, to be honest,

642
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:15,379
Sean Jakowski had
a tiny little baby dick.

643
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:23,554
It doesn't bother you that I
could whip your ass in bowling?

644
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:26,974
And in everything?

645
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:28,518
And bench-press you?

646
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,686
Oh, my God, is that
a threat or a promise?

647
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:34,565
- Hmm.
- And no. No. I-I...

648
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:39,612
I really think it's awesome,
the real you.

649
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,661
Um, you got... ketchup.

650
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:48,913
Mm? Oh.

651
00:42:48,955 --> 00:42:51,332
What? You don't like that?

652
00:42:51,374 --> 00:42:53,334
Doesn't work for you?

653
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:06,472
Save my spot.
I'll be right back.

654
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:42,842
- Hey.
- Hey.

655
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:48,389
So where's the girl, Frenchie?

656
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:50,641
Since you're the psycho chick
whisperer all of a sudden.

657
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:53,644
Maybe subway. Maybe she wants
to find a train, no?

658
00:43:53,686 --> 00:43:55,372
Oh, yeah? How deep up your ass
did you pull that out?

659
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:56,915
Well, it depends.
How deep does your tongue go?

660
00:43:56,939 --> 00:43:58,524
Listen, you lost her, man.

661
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:00,210
We had orders,
we're supposed to follow them.

662
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:02,194
We're professionals
and we count on each other.

663
00:44:02,236 --> 00:44:05,740
But you're on some fucking
bohemian flaky drug shit.

664
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:07,742
Even Hughie,
who's a fucking white Urkel,

665
00:44:07,783 --> 00:44:09,553
- is more professional than you.
- I understand it's hard

666
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:11,537
for someone who's anally OCD
to understand.

667
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,331
Okay, then help me
understand, Frenchie.

668
00:44:13,372 --> 00:44:14,850
What happened the night
that Mallory had you

669
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:16,393
- tail Lamplighter?
- Oh, that's enough.

670
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:19,712
Mallory was our boss, man.
We had orders.

671
00:44:19,754 --> 00:44:21,339
And you were supposed
to follow him.

672
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,899
You were supposed
to follow Lamplighter,

673
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:25,718
- tail him, but you let him go.
- I didn't know.

674
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,220
And Lamplighter goes
and torches Mallory's grandkids.

675
00:44:28,262 --> 00:44:30,264
- I didn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

676
00:44:30,306 --> 00:44:33,809
You didn't follow orders
and it costs some lives.

677
00:44:35,686 --> 00:44:37,730
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

678
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:40,149
- Knock it off.
- You know what?

679
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:42,068
Fuck this, Butcher.

680
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:44,612
And fuck you. I'm done!

681
00:44:44,654 --> 00:44:48,074
- Stupid fucker...
- M.M., wait.

682
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:51,035
You said this time
would be different.

683
00:44:51,077 --> 00:44:54,497
But this motherfucker's still
here doing the same old shit.

684
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:57,958
And we're all gonna
fucking end up like Mallory.

685
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,336
- Yeah, fuck off. Come on.
- Fuck this.

686
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:01,962
Oi, both of you.

687
00:45:02,004 --> 00:45:04,215
- M.M.
- What?

688
00:45:04,256 --> 00:45:07,468
What's Sporty Spice up to?

689
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,428
Who?

690
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,764
Sporty fucking Spice.
What is she up to?

691
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:16,644
I don't know.

692
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:19,271
Exactly. How about Posh?

693
00:45:19,313 --> 00:45:21,440
- You know what she's doing?
- I don't understand.

694
00:45:21,482 --> 00:45:23,984
Making clothes
for anorexics. Right?

695
00:45:24,026 --> 00:45:25,778
Not exactly a growth market.

696
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,989
And Baby?
You know what she's doing?

697
00:45:29,031 --> 00:45:32,702
Fuck all. Not even page six
of the Daily Mail.

698
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:35,121
And Scary Spice?

699
00:45:35,162 --> 00:45:38,207
Up to her eyeballs
in lawsuits and sex tapes.

700
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:41,293
Ginger, on the other hand,
has released three albums.

701
00:45:41,335 --> 00:45:45,715
Passion, Schizophonic and
Scream If You Wanna Go Faster.

702
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:49,301
They'll all make
your ears bleed.

703
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:51,804
You see, when they're apart,

704
00:45:51,846 --> 00:45:53,806
they're absolute
fucking rubbish.

705
00:45:53,848 --> 00:45:58,936
But, you put them together,

706
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:02,982
they're the goddamn
fucking Spice Girls.

707
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,989
How do you know so much
about the Spice Girls?

708
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:14,535
Look, the point is,

709
00:46:14,577 --> 00:46:18,664
that we're all shite
by ourselves.

710
00:46:18,706 --> 00:46:20,541
We need each other.

711
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:24,128
We need each other, or we're
fucking dead in the water.

712
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,797
Now, you guys can beat
the living fucking shit

713
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,799
out of each other,
I really don't care,

714
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:31,302
it ain't gonna change the past.

715
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:41,061
What do you say we go find
that dirty little bitch,

716
00:46:41,103 --> 00:46:44,648
gas her ass,
then get the fuck out of here?

717
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:51,655
Jesus, he gives
the worst pep talks.

718
00:46:51,697 --> 00:46:53,365

That's right.

724
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:06,462
Next stop, the Atlantic Ocean.

725
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:09,089
That's right. That's right.

726

727

Okay. Okay, yeah.

728
00:47:17,306 --> 00:47:20,559
I mean, let's just focus on the
escape first and, uh, you know,

729
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:22,728
we can talk about that
some other time.

730
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,857
Well, uh, I like you, too.

731

But let's not, you know,
rush into anything too fast.

733
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,201
All right, seriously,
now is not the appropriate time.

734
00:47:37,243 --> 00:47:39,954
Plus, you're making things
awkward.

735
00:47:39,995 --> 00:47:42,957
Okay, okay!

736
00:47:42,998 --> 00:47:44,959
If I just touch it,
will you shut up?

737
00:47:48,128 --> 00:47:51,048
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

738
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,800

Shit...

745
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:32,566
- Let's go.
- No, Frenchie.

746
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:34,234
Forget it, mate. She's fucked.

747
00:49:37,363 --> 00:49:38,948
A-Train!

748
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:41,283
Over here! Look, everybody!

749
00:49:41,325 --> 00:49:42,719
- It's A-Train right over here!
- A-Train's here?

750
00:49:42,743 --> 00:49:44,244
- No way.
- Look, it's A-Train!

751
00:49:46,246 --> 00:49:48,332
Hey.

752
00:49:48,374 --> 00:49:50,250
Cool, look who's here.

753
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:52,836
Shit, what's up, A-Train?

754
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:55,089
A-Train, hey.

755
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,548
Hey, can we take a selfie?

756
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,467
Oh, sure, absolutely.

757
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:00,260
I can take one or two.

758
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:02,262
A-Train, over here.

759
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:30,332
No. Let me talk to her.

760
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:32,167
Don't be fucking stupid.

761
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:37,589
What if she's a Spice Girl?

762
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:40,092
Frenchie.

763
00:51:00,654 --> 00:51:03,073
Let me help you go home.

764
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:42,112
She ain't no Spice Girl.

765
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:27,574
Once again,
the horrific wreckage

766
00:52:27,616 --> 00:52:29,701
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37

767
00:52:29,743 --> 00:52:31,745
just beginning to wash up
on shore.

768
00:52:31,787 --> 00:52:34,915
Every passenger on board
presumed dead.

769
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,169
They didn't have to die.

770
00:52:40,796 --> 00:52:43,382
We have Homelander
and Queen Maeve on the scene.

771
00:52:43,423 --> 00:52:46,385
Do you have a comment?

772
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:49,096
I said they didn't have to die.

773
00:52:49,138 --> 00:52:52,766
We arrived three minutes
after the plane went down.

774
00:52:52,808 --> 00:52:55,477
And why?

775
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,063
Because we're not
in the chain of command.

776
00:52:58,105 --> 00:53:02,192
If NORAD called us
before they scrambled jets,

777
00:53:02,234 --> 00:53:04,027
then we could've saved them.

778
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:08,031
123 men, women and children.

779
00:53:08,073 --> 00:53:10,075
Excuse me.

780
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:19,042
But if they let us
into the military,

781
00:53:19,084 --> 00:53:22,045
then this will
never happen again.

782
00:53:22,087 --> 00:53:25,632
That is my solemn promise
to you.

783
00:53:25,674 --> 00:53:27,676
Right, Maeve?

784
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,181
Talk to your congressmen.

785
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:33,974
Talk to them.
They'll listen to the people.

786
00:53:34,016 --> 00:53:36,476
And together,

787
00:53:36,518 --> 00:53:39,688
together, we will make sure
that this never happens

788
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:42,733
to our great nation ever again!

789
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:48,113
God bless you.

790
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:50,324
God bless America.

791
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:52,159
We hear you, Homelander!

792
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:55,370
And I hear you, brother!
I hear you!

793
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:58,373
And the world hears you!

794
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:02,294
And very, very soon, my friend,

795
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:05,839
whoever did this to us
will hear from all of us!

796
00:54:05,881 --> 00:54:08,175
Homelander!

797
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:11,345
Homelander! Homelander!

798
00:54:11,386 --> 00:54:15,766
Homelander! Homelander!
Homelander!

799
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:19,228
Homelander! Homelander!

800
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:23,899
Homelander! Homelander!
Homelander!

801
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:26,818
Homelander! Homelander!

802
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,820
Homelander!
