1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,080
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,720
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,520
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,200
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,640
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,720
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,040
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>but if we succeed,
they will be remembered as legends.</i>

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,280
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,400
You need to learn to embrace
your human side.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,920
And what if that side of me is gone?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
What if she doesn't exist anymore?

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,600
No, this is a dictatorship.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,440
You get to call all the shots,
and I get to take all the shots.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,640
The most powerful evil
the world has ever known

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,960
has just gone Red at the height
of the Cold War.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,040
Valentina Vostok?

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,560
She's trying to build
a Soviet Firestorm.

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Your comrade here tells me
you know quite a bit

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,640
about this project of mine.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,000
You're hanging us out to dry, Rip!

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,320
I need backup!

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,520
Half the team is gone.

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,840
I'm gonna remember that, comrade.

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,120
You and Dr. Vostok have much
work to do in the morning.

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,240
Incredible. This is the exact formula

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,240
for the thermocore that's needed
to build a new Firestorm.

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
How did you manage to arrive
at something

29
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,440
that took decades to produce?

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,840
But here's what I don't understand.

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,080
The Firestorm Matrix is unstable.

32
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,840
The thermocore reacts exponentially

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,400
to the rate of fission
in the host body.

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,560
Well, fortunately...

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Dr. Wells developed
the Quantum Splicer

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
to address that very problem.

37
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,880
I... I'm so happy to see that you're
taking an interest in my work.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
What can I say, sir?

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
Nuclear physics is my passion.

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,720
"Sir"?

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
The Cisco I know never dwelled
on formality.

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,880
What's more, your hair is different,

43
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,960
your wardrobe neat,
your comportment gentlemanly.

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,920
Oh, yeah, you like?

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,880
I just subscribed to "GQ."

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,200
A snide attempt at humor
almost Cisco-like.

47
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Almost.

48
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,520
What are you implying?

49
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,480
What I am stating
unequivocally, sir...

50
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,680
is that you are not Cisco,

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,280
which means I am not
in S.T.A.R. Labs.

52
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,320
Furthermore, I will never,
never give you the formula.

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,200
Bravo, Professor Stein.

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,600
What cocktail of hallucinogens
have you given me, Doctor?

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Don't worry.

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,000
I would never dream of damaging
that beautiful mind of yours.

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
I simply want to open it.

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
Finish the formula, and these
little games of ours can stop.

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,520
You'll never trick me
into giving up my research.

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,720
And since you also cannot kill me

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,280
and destroy any hope of creating
a Soviet Firestorm,

62
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,080
I would like a hot shower
and a change of clothes.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,200
And I thought I gave a good speech.

64
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,920
I'm sorry. Have we met?

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,480
11 years ago...

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,160
you bought a nuclear warhead
off me in Norway.

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
And then you and your time-traveling
friends tried to kill me.

68
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,880
Just like me, you haven't aged a day.

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,800
I have a good hairdresser.

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,160
In my long life,

71
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,680
I have met some of the most skilled
interrogators in history,

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,080
but, but since we are
in the Soviet Union,

73
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,360
let me tell you a story
about a friend of mine...

74
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Joseph Stalin.

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,920
He became quite skilled
at breaking a man...

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,640
carefully aimed strikes
to the bridge of the nose...

77
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,920
along the shoulder blades,
and right underneath the chin.

78
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,560
Stalin gave me this as a gift.

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,120
So it's to be torture, then?

80
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Get on with it.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No.

82
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,640
Nothing so prosaic for you,
Professor.

83
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,680
There are infinite ways
to break a man...

84
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,120
and I have an infinite
amount of time.

85
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,720
Firestorm is my life's work.

86
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,240
I will never allow you to pervert it
in pursuit of global conquest.

87
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,720
This is going to be so much fun.

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,840
<i>Jefferson! Jefferson!</i>

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Jax?

90
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,680
What are you doing in here?

91
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,080
Hey, are you all right?

92
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,360
Yeah, I...

93
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,240
{\an5}I haven't been able to sleep
the past two nights.

94
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,080
{\an5}I prescribed Mr. Jackson
some mild medication.

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,120
{\an5}Which don't seem to be doing
a damn thing.

96
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
What's wrong?

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
It's Stein.

98
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,640
They started in on him again.

99
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,480
{\an5}He's scared to death.
I... I can feel it.

100
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,880
{\an5}- He's trying to be strong, but...
- We're gonna get him back.

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Ray and Rory too.

102
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm sure Captain Hunter has a plan.

103
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
It's my fault he got captured.

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,880
{\an5}If... if he wasn't trying
to protect me,

105
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,160
he would have never gone
in there alone.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,720
It's gonna be okay, Jax, I promise.

107
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,000
{\an5}You don't know what kind of place
they got him locked up in.

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,880
<i>Labor Camp Number 54,</i>

109
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,480
{\an5}<i>formerly known as the Koshmar
or "Nightmare" gulag.</i>

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
<i>Built in the 18th century...</i>

111
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,040
Can we skip past the Wikipedia crap

112
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,760
{\an5}and get to the good stuff,
like how to break in?

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,280
Perhaps you didn't register
that as a question, Gideon.

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,320
{\an5}<i>I understood,
but in its 200 years of operation,</i>

115
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,720
{\an5}<i>no one has successfully
escaped from...</i>

116
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
No offense, Gideon,

117
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,880
{\an5}but I never met a building
I couldn't break into.

118
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,160
Well, I hope you're right.

119
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,040
{\an5}Savage knows
that Stein created Firestorm,

120
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,840
{\an5}but if he finds out
that he is Firestorm...

121
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Always Savage with you, isn't it?

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,920
My partner's in prison too.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
{\an5}- And Ray.
- Yeah, whatever.

124
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,120
{\an5}The point is you didn't lift
a finger.

125
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,680
{\an5}You know damn well
it was never my intention

126
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,880
{\an5}to get them thrown into a gulag,
but I had no other option.

127
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Besides, I doubt that it's
Mr. Rory's first time in prison

128
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,480
or second or, I imagine, tenth.

129
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,240
All right, arguing is not gonna
bring the team back any faster.

130
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,520
And Rip's right.

131
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,000
Criminals usually do feel
more at home in prison,

132
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,840
{\an5}and they know it
better than anyone else.

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,960
So?

134
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,760
So what if the key to breaking in

135
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,240
{\an5}is asking someone who's been
in and out of Soviet prisons

136
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,440
their whole life?

137
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,120
And who might that be?

138
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,040
Are you familiar with the Bratva?

139
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
The Russian Mob?

140
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,320
In 1986, they would have ruled
the criminal underground

141
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,320
inside every prison.

142
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Your tattoo.

143
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,800
{\an5}It stands
for "Menia Ispravit Rasstrel,"

144
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
if I'm not mistaken.

145
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,280
{\an5}In English, it translates to,
"Execution Will Reform Me."

146
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,880
{\an5}What brings you
to the banya, little man?

147
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
The name's Rip.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,920
{\an5}I understand that you're familiar
with the Koshmar Gulag.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,680
We need to break into that prison.

150
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,680
And can you make it fast?
I despise the heat.

151
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,840
{\an5}A man by the name of Vandal Savage
runs a secret operation out of it,

152
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,520
{\an5}a prison within a prison,
if you will.

153
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,480
I've heard of this Savage.

154
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,920
He has no respect

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,600
for my country's rich
criminal traditions.

156
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,080
So you'll help us?

157
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,760
You men have no tattoos.

158
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,120
{\an5}And a man who has no life story
cannot be trusted.

159
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,360
Igor! Andrei!

160
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,480
Don't all volunteer at once.

161
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,040
Igor and Andrei seem
to be a bit preoccupied.

162
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,080
Now, about that gulag...

163
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
No matter.

164
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,120
In this life,
a man fights for himself.

165
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
Perhaps you'd like this one.

166
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,640
He's all yours.

167
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,320
So you like having Vandal Savage

168
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,240
run his evil empire
from your country?

169
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,480
As much as a pig enjoys
being Christmas dinner.

170
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,600
Help us, and we will destroy
his entire operation.

171
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,120
I just took out six men.

172
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,320
You guys couldn't handle one?

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,440
- You killed my men?
- They're not dead yet.

174
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,240
And neither are you,
assuming you help us.

175
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,240
My organization runs
black-market goods into Koshmar.

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,400
Three of our, well, comrades
are being held there by Savage.

177
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,520
Koshmar is not a hotel
for petty criminals.

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,240
If your friends are there,

179
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,440
they must be insane,
ruthless animals.

180
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,760
Hey. Howdy.

181
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,880
- How you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?

182
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,080
Just being friendly.

183
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,520
This must be where they keep
the VIPs.

184
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,840
This is prison, jackass.

185
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,720
There are no VIPs.

186
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,280
Some of these guys
have been here for a while.

187
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,120
Hey, maybe this guy knows
where Stein is.

188
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,280
{\an5}The only thing you should be
worrying about, Pretty,

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,960
is lasting the night.

190
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,760
Stein needs help.
He's in real trouble.

191
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,760
Newsflash, so are we.

192
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
Think they'll bring us
blankets later?

193
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,880
Now, according to Yuri,
this is where his men have access.

194
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Got it?

195
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,680
This isn't my first prison break.

196
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,920
We got it covered.

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,240
- So how can we help?
- By staying on the ship.

198
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,760
We don't need any more casualties.

199
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,280
Besides, Mr. Snart and Sara
have got it covered.

200
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,520
Whoa, man.

201
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,800
Why does it feel like
we're on the JV team all of a sudden?

202
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,640
What you are is one half
of everything Savage needs

203
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,200
to change the face of the Cold War.

204
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,480
And you are the only person
who can kill him.

205
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Yeah, so you can't just...

206
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,000
I am not going to gift-wrap
the two people in the world

207
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,360
that Savage wants the most.

208
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,600
We should get going.

209
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, Ms. Lance,
could I borrow you for a moment?

210
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,160
I have something that might
help you out with the mission.

211
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,240
So what did you really want
to talk to me about?

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,560
Gideon, will you please show
Ms. Lance the projection of 2016

213
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,720
should our rescue mission fail?

214
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,120
<i>I'd be happy to, Captain.</i>

215
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,440
So this is what will happen to Russia
if we don't get Stein back?

216
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Not Russia.

217
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,560
This is Star City.

218
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
The rest of world
doesn't look much better.

219
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
That's impossible.

220
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,320
Not if Stein creates a stable
Firestorm for the Soviets.

221
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Here in 1986,
they're already perilously close

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
to creating a prototype.

223
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,040
Listen to me, Sara.
Everything, everything we've tried

224
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,800
to achieve so far could be lost.

225
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,280
And not only will my family die
150 years from now,

226
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
but your family, your city...

227
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,680
your entire 21st-century world
will suffer.

228
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,840
That's why we're gonna get Stein back
before Vostok can break him.

229
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Well, I, I hope so,
but we need a contingency plan.

230
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,320
What are you saying?

231
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,720
I'm saying that if at any point
throughout the operation

232
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,040
it becomes clear that Martin is...

233
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,880
beyond our reach...

234
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,960
You want me to kill Stein?

235
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,400
Impressive how many weapons
you can fit in that outfit...

236
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,480
And how much stupidity Raymond
can squeeze into this one.

237
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,200
The plan is to save him too,
not just Stein and your partner.

238
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,200
Oh, I'm gonna save Raymond,
all right,

239
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,240
so I can beat some sense into him.

240
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,640
And what about you?

241
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
What about me?

242
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,920
Clearly I'm not the only one
with a side mission.

243
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,400
What did Rip keep you
after class to talk about?

244
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,920
He just wanted to go over
a few details of the plan.

245
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,320
He wants you to take out
the old man, doesn't he?

246
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
It's the obvious play.

247
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,520
It's also heartless.

248
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,160
The plan is to save Stein.

249
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,360
And if, for whatever reason,
we can't...

250
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,240
Rip showed me what will happen
to my home in 2016, to our families.

251
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,520
If Stein breaks,
the damage is irreversible.

252
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,200
Been on a lot of heists,
and even when things got rough,

253
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,760
I never took out one of my own.

254
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,360
Well, this isn't a bank heist.

255
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,640
First, he left my partner
twisting in the wind.

256
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,280
Now he's gonna have you
ice old silver-top.

257
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,240
We're all just pawns, Sara.

258
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,560
Come on, I'm the crook,
you're the assassin...

259
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,400
He's not just asking me to kill.

260
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,240
He's asking me to save the future.

261
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,960
And if, for whatever reason,
we can't save Stein,

262
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
then I'm gonna do
what needs to be done.

263
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,360
It's just like scout camp.

264
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,880
Man, the food was terrible.

265
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,600
There was one time
they gave us Salisbury steak...

266
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,920
You ever stop talking?

267
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,120
What I wouldn't give
for a little Salisbury steak now.

268
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,440
Hey. Ray Palmer.

269
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Put your hand down.

270
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,280
He might know where Vostok
is keeping the Professor.

271
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,400
Shut up and eat.

272
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Do you know if there's
any other place

273
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,920
where they keep prisoners here?

274
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,160
We're looking for a friend.

275
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,880
There is a place.

276
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,240
They send you there,
you never come back.

277
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,600
You can hear the screams all night.

278
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,760
This place, where is it?

279
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,920
Who said you could eat?

280
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,960
Hey, he's not hurting anybody.

281
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,120
Who is this American
with the pretty teeth?

282
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,400
Must be a comedian,da?

283
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,160
I'm sure we can handle this
like adults.

284
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Sooka!

285
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,200
I brought you something
to eat, Professor.

286
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,960
If this is a bribe,
I politely decline.

287
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,920
So stubborn, so proud, so American.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,440
You've already built a thermocore,
so just build another one.

289
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,920
It'll only take you
eight to ten years.

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,960
You thought that, what,
your friends stealing

291
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,680
the thermocore would save the West?

292
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,400
As if I would only build one.

293
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,160
We're so close, Professor.

294
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
All I need to learn now
is how to stabilize the thermocore,

295
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,920
and my dream of creating
a nuclear man will be achieved.

296
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,120
To what end?

297
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,120
If you launch a Soviet Firestorm,

298
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,280
the United States
will have no choice but to retaliate.

299
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,840
Both countries will be annihilated.

300
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
And out of the ashes,
we will rise stronger

301
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
just as we did
when the Nazis invaded.

302
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,280
But America is weak

303
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,480
with your Big Mac,
MTV, movie-star president.

304
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,840
Do you really think Vandal Savage
cares about the Cold War?

305
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,280
He's just using you, Doctor.

306
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,000
Do not think of insulting
Mr. Savage in front of me.

307
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,120
Hey, what's wrong?

308
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,560
Something's changed.

309
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,360
Grey thinks we've abandoned him.

310
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,200
He's starting to lose it in there.

311
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,560
I can't take this.

312
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,880
We've got to tell Rip.

313
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,120
The guy who benched us?

314
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
He'll just tell us to sit tight.

315
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,880
No, I hate feeling so helpless.

316
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,120
This is exactly what it was like
when I blew out my knee.

317
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,080
I could barely walk,
recruiters stopped calling,

318
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,600
my mom always crying.

319
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,680
I just wish there was something
I could do.

320
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Wait.

321
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,520
Your connection with Stein,
it goes both ways, right?

322
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,480
- Yeah.
- So maybe we can send him a signal.

323
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,560
Grey did tell me about this one time
he and Ronnie...

324
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
Get a knife.

325
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
You need to cut me.

326
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
Tell me how to stabilize Firestorm.

327
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,320
If Einstein had the opportunity,
he would have traveled back in time

328
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,840
to prevent the creation
of the atomic bomb.

329
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,840
How can I in good conscience
lead the world

330
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,000
to the invention of something
far more destructive?

331
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,400
You don't really have a choice.

332
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,200
This toxin, it's not lethal...

333
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,000
but it will make you wish
that it were.

334
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,760
Are you sure about this?

335
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,760
So, Professor...

336
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,360
Would you like to talk,
or would you prefer to scream?

337
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Do your worst, Doctor.

338
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,000
Hey, Pyro, what was that there
back in the yard?

339
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,240
Just your typical prison alpha.

340
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,040
He didn't like you
threatening his reputation.

341
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,240
Not that. I mean you sitting there
while I was getting my ass kicked.

342
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,520
None of my business.

343
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
None of your business?
None of your business?

344
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,480
We're supposed to be a team.

345
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,760
The only team
I'm on is mine and Snart's.

346
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,320
Besides, you had
that beatdown coming.

347
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,360
Oh, well, I can't sit back

348
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,640
and watch an old man
get pushed around.

349
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
Then you're a bigger fool
than I thought.

350
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
These are the ones I want.

351
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,360
Remember me?

352
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,960
Identification papers.

353
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,480
Yuri the Bear sent me.

354
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,320
Remember, we get Stein first.

355
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,200
And if the plan fails,
you'll kill him.

356
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,160
- You want my advice?
- No.

357
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,760
Don't use your gun.
Do it with your hands.

358
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
Do it while you're looking
right into Stein's eyes.

359
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,280
You're talking about a member
of our team.

360
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,560
I just don't want you to forget
who we're talking about.

361
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Thank you.

362
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,920
Valentina has failed
to make you talk.

363
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,920
Now it's my turn.

364
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Colonel...

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
let's begin.

366
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,080
So are you still planning,
what did you threaten before?

367
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,120
To go all "Rocky IV" on my ass?

368
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,080
I've changed my mind.

369
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,240
Ivan Drago lives at the end
of the movie.

370
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,040
Isn't he supposed to ask us
some questions?

371
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,840
They don't care what we got to say.

372
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,240
We're just part of the show.

373
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Stein.

374
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,080
Professor, we're okay.

375
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,800
Don't tell these bastards anything!

376
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,120
If you think I have a sentimental
attachment to them,

377
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,160
you are as foolish as you are mad.

378
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,240
You held up longer than expected.

379
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,800
But if 4,000 years of life
has taught me one thing,

380
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,280
it is patience.

381
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,880
- When I get out of here...
- That is your mistake

382
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,880
thinking that you'll get out of here.

383
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Hey.

384
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,480
Can I get some water in here?

385
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Something to drink?
I'm a little thirsty.

386
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,160
A sandwich would be nice,
a little turkey and mayo.

387
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,200
They have mayo in Russia?

388
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
No.

389
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,280
At least in America,
you get a last meal.

390
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,520
This Communism really sucks.

391
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,320
What are you doing, Boy Scout?

392
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,080
Yes, Boy Scout, what are you doing?

393
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,880
Nothing compared to what I did
to your mother last night.

394
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,240
You have quite a mouth on you.

395
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
So does she.

396
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,440
Enough! You're killing him!

397
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
- That's it?
- Oh, but the colonel will think

398
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,160
that we are cheating him.

399
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll tell you
how to stabilize Firestorm.

400
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,760
Just let them live, please!

401
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
So how does it feel to be dead again?

402
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Take the next left.

403
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
You can't be down here, comrade.

404
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,800
I was ordered to take
this corpse to the incinerator.

405
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,320
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

406
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,200
Dr. Vostok used him for one
of her smallpox weapons trials.

407
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,200
Highly contagious.

408
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,040
All right, this duct
should take us to solitary.

409
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,320
- We get to Stein...
- Yeah, I'm not going.

410
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,000
- That's the plan.
- That's Rip's plan.

411
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,920
My priority is Mick.

412
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
Fine. Forget it.

413
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,880
So much for your code, crook.

414
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,560
Anytime, assassin.

415
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,000
Of all the dumb things
I've seen in my life,

416
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,200
you getting that guy
to beat on you takes the cake.

417
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
You're welcome.

418
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,360
You think you proved
something back there?

419
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,000
Proved I wasn't scared.

420
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,880
Proved you make a great piñata.

421
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,840
He could have beaten you to death.

422
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,520
There are some things that are
more important than survival,

423
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,360
like standing up
for what you believe in,

424
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,440
your principles, your team.

425
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,440
There must be something
you're willing to die for.

426
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,480
The perfect score.

427
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Well...

428
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,960
only difference between us
is how we define "score."

429
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,840
<i>I'm sorry to inform you, Captain.</i>

430
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,480
<i>The probability of the United States</i>

431
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,640
<i>losing the Cold War
has risen to 99 percent.</i>

432
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,600
<i>Star City,
the seat of the resistance,</i>

433
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,960
<i>is predicted to fall in 2003.</i>

434
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,280
Come on, Sara.

435
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,280
You mentioned the Quantum
Splicer earlier, Professor.

436
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,080
Your friends are counting on you
to make the right decision.

437
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,480
I have eyes on Stein.

438
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,920
The future is cementing.

439
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,760
You must extract Stein
before he enters the lab!

440
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Kill her!

441
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,800
<i>What's happening, Ms. Lance?</i>

442
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,240
I couldn't rescue Stein.

443
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,880
<i>Have they moved him into the lab?</i>

444
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,240
<i>Yeah, where Savage has every guard
in the gulag watching him.</i>

445
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,120
Well, if that's the case...

446
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,680
I know what I have to do.

447
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,160
The formula for stabilizing
Firestorm, Professor.

448
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120
This may surprise you,
but in my youth,

449
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,520
I longed to visit Russia.

450
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,400
I was obsessed by your culture...

451
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,040
Rachmaninoff, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy.

452
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,920
Stop stalling.

453
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,880
It's a shame I, I never got to see it
before the collapse.

454
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,240
What sort of nonsense
are you talking about?

455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,400
In 1991, your economy fails,
and your empire crumbles.

456
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,880
But the truth is the world
is better off.

457
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,320
In my time, crooks and thieves
rule your country,

458
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,040
desperate to hang on to power
and the riches

459
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,000
they divide amongst their cronies.

460
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,560
My country is by no means perfect,

461
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,520
but at least we are free
to criticize our government,

462
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,760
vote in fair elections,
and love whom we choose.

463
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,400
I, hate to break this to you,
Dr. Vostok.

464
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,960
You are on the wrong side of history.

465
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
For now.

466
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,720
But you will help us change history.

467
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Proceed.

468
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,560
Gideon, are you able to detect

469
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,000
the Professor's life
functions remotely?

470
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,720
<i>Yes, Captain.
His pulse is still strong.</i>

471
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,320
Yeah, not for much longer.

472
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,280
Rip, Jax and I need to talk to you.

473
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,000
Now is really not a good time.

474
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,520
Yeah, this will only take a minute.

475
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,120
I know you think
you can't risk losing us,

476
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,680
but that's assuming we'd fail.

477
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,800
And we won't.

478
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm not afraid anymore.

479
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,480
I can do this.

480
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,280
And I don't got to be Firestorm
to be a part of this team.

481
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,880
Look, I am not prepared
to risk anyone else.

482
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,080
- Ever since...
- Carter?

483
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,200
- His death wasn't your fault.
- I know.

484
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,040
But Stein's will be.

485
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,000
All I got to do is touch him,
and we can fly out of there.

486
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,440
Yeah, once you've scaled a 50- foot
fence topped with razor wire,

487
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,720
gotten past eight sharpshooters,

488
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,760
and entered a gulag full
of the most dangerous criminals

489
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,320
in the U.S.S.R.

490
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,080
Okay, so you create a distraction,

491
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,360
and I'll fly Jax in,
and no one will see us.

492
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,560
Listen, you're playing chess
without all your pieces on the board.

493
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Maybe you're right.

494
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,520
So that's a "yes"?

495
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
You call that a flame?

496
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Nice costume.

497
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,720
Got one for you too.

498
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,120
Wakey, wakey.

499
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,560
Time to shrink or not.

500
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,200
- Let's go.
- What about him?

501
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,040
We can't ditch him. He won't survive.

502
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,040
Two guards walking out of here,
not suspicious.

503
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,680
Two guards carrying him out,
suspicious.

504
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
He took a beating for me.

505
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,320
Raymond would take a beating
for a total stranger.

506
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,920
Mick, if our time
in the can taught us anything,

507
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,560
it's we look after each other.

508
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,560
It's you and me, right?

509
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,520
So, if we enter here,
we can cut the circuit breaker.

510
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,800
Shutting off all the power.

511
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,000
Distracting the guards
and giving us time to save our team.

512
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,800
The probability of this plan
being successful...

513
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,800
There is a 15-second window

514
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,840
where the sharpshooters on the tower
aren't covering the breaker.

515
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,720
Which means that somebody
would have to run 120 yards

516
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,200
in less than 12 seconds.

517
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,000
Given Mr. Jackson tore
his anterior cruciate ligament...

518
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,280
Have a little faith, Gideon.

519
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,880
You can do this.

520
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,000
I know you can.

521
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
It's done.

522
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,920
You know, I've never seen
a theorem so simple,

523
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,480
so poetic before.

524
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,960
With this, I can decelerate
the subject's rate of fission

525
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,480
and decrease core body temperature.

526
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,920
Yet something's missing.

527
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,120
I'm telling you,
that is the equation,

528
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,840
everything you need
to build a Quantum Splicer.

529
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
"We're coming"?

530
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Explain.

531
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,840
- I cut myself.
- Impossible.

532
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,840
You've been monitored
ever since your arrival here.

533
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
So, unless some...

534
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,880
So, unless someone else was cut...

535
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,320
yet it appears on your body...

536
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,920
- That's preposterous.
- No, no, no.

537
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,520
You are somehow connected
to the Burning Man.

538
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,280
That's how you were able to absorb
the nuclear energy at Luskavic.

539
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
You are mistaken.

540
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,160
No, you didn't only create Firestorm.

541
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,880
You are one half of Firestorm.

542
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,040
That's ridiculous!

543
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,320
Bring the core online.

544
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,160
And to think, all this time...

545
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,080
- you were the missing link.
- Listen to me.

546
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,440
It is extremely rare to find
two people who are compatible,

547
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,560
and without the Splicer...

548
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,920
Have you ever merged
with a woman before, Professor?

549
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,520
I think you and I are gonna make
a wonderful Firestorm.

550
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,840
What the hell are they doing?

551
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,600
What I should have done
from the start, helping rescue Stein.

552
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,840
<i>What about the time line?</i>

553
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,040
I have a plan.

554
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,720
<i>Forget about the fail-safe.</i>

555
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,480
Isn't it a little late for plan C?

556
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,960
<i>Not if Jax can reach
that circuit breaker.</i>

557
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,080
I can't believe you're risking
your life for this idiot.

558
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,840
Okay, okay.

559
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,000
You got this.

560
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,840
12 seconds, open field,
done it a million times.

561
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,600
Barry Allen who?

562
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Electromagnetic locks.

563
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,800
We're dressed as guards.

564
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,040
Run.

565
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,720
Everyone back in your cells!

566
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,840
Enjoy your new cellmate!

567
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
No!

568
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,960
That door leads to the loading bay.

569
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,640
From there,
you can get to the jump ship.

570
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,480
Hey, Mick,
this is a strange kind of hug.

571
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,800
- Where are you going?
- I got something to do.

572
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,280
Mr. Savage, I need to get you
to the helicopter.

573
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,200
Make sure the Professor
enters the reactor.

574
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,680
His nuclear-mate is waiting for him.

575
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,720
Take the core to full power.

576
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,080
There seems to be a riot going on.

577
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,840
You might want to reconsider
your orders.

578
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,000
Vostok knows Stein
is the other half of Firestorm.

579
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,640
She's trying to merge with him.

580
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,640
Rip, once Stein
is inside the reactor,

581
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,400
he will become Soviet Firestorm.

582
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,600
Do you copy?

583
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,240
I have the shot.

584
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,840
<i>- Sara, don't do it.</i>
- I don't have a choice.

585
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,040
It's the only way
to save Star City, the future.

586
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,880
<i>That's how a killer thinks.</i>

587
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,560
And that's not you anymore.

588
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,240
Our energy...

589
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,080
It yearns to be whole, Professor.

590
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,040
Without the Splicer...

591
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,400
<i>Without the Splicer,
you'll never be able to control</i>

592
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,120
<i>our nuclear reaction.</i>

593
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,120
<i>You have to listen to me,
Dr. Vostok.</i>

594
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
<i>Unless we un-fuse,
you'll end up killing us both!</i>

595
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,320
Rip Hunter must be a fool
to send you into my arms.

596
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Come with me, Chay-Ara,

597
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,200
and I will find a way
to prolong your life.

598
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,520
We will live together in eternity.

599
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
No.

600
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
No?

601
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,440
My answer will always be "no."

602
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Go.

603
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,840
You want to kill me again?

604
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,800
Doesn't this game ever get
too old for you, Gareeb?

605
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
It's Captain Hunter,
if you don't mind.

606
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,040
I'm here to make sure
you never build a Firestorm...

607
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,680
and for my watch, actually.

608
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,440
You stole it from me
during a pagan blood ritual

609
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,000
back in 1975.

610
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Ring any bells?

611
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Slowly.

612
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,640
I have no desire to kill you.

613
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,720
I want you alive.

614
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,440
I want you to see the world burn.

615
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,600
I have looked so often at your wife
and son these last 11 years,

616
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,360
Miranda and Jonas,
their faces etched into my mind.

617
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,120
And when I finally get to meet them,
I will let them know

618
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,600
that you and your friends
are responsible for their suffering.

619
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,120
Not if I see you first.

620
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,840
How's it going up there?

621
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,160
Sara? Sara, are you there?

622
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,560
Now you're on the comm?

623
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,360
We need to get out of here.

624
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,400
Don't shoot! Grey's in there!

625
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,920
Lot of good it would do anyhow.

626
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,680
Man, screw this!

627
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,280
What are you doing?

628
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,240
I'm getting Stein back.

629
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,360
We'll cover you.

630
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,640
I know you're in there, Grey!

631
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,760
And he's begging for you
to save yourself.

632
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,120
I wasn't talking to you.

633
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,000
I was talking to Professor Stein.

634
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,680
Your mind is stronger
than hers, Grey.

635
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,520
I get it.

636
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,400
I know why you've been so hard on me.
You're trying to protect me.

637
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,360
You don't want to lose me
like you lost Ronnie.

638
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,120
And that's why I know
you're not gonna let her kill me.

639
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,800
'Cause I've had you
inside of my head,

640
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,400
and I know what a tough,
old son of a gun you can be.

641
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,840
So you got to fight her,

642
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,320
because you and me,
we're Firestorm, Grey.

643
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,760
You and me!

644
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Jefferson!

645
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,080
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

646
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,720
- Yeah.
- Not for long.

647
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,120
I tried to warn her.

648
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,360
Without the Splicer and myself,

649
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,680
her nuclear powers
are dangerously unstable.

650
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,360
It appears Dr. Vostok
is having a bit of a meltdown.

651
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,200
It's, it's fascinating.

652
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,920
I think what he means
to say is "run."

653
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,320
<i>I'll have the jump ship
waiting just beyond the main gate.</i>

654
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,360
Courtesy of Yuri the Bear.

655
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,160
How did you even have time
to steal this?

656
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
There's always time to steal.

657
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Thank you.

658
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,040
And just so you know,
I know you're more than just a thief.

659
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,280
You took a beating for me.

660
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,440
We're even. End of story.

661
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,800
Well, thank you.

662
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,480
More drinking, less feeling.

663
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,120
A toast to the first time

664
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,800
we haven't completely ruined
the time line.

665
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,600
Please tell me that's true, Gideon.

666
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,840
The projections of the future
are back to normal.

667
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,000
- I'll drink to that.
- To Rip.

668
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,320
To things not going
according to his plan.

669
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,120
- To the Captain.
- To the Captain.

670
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,680
- All right.
- Hold on, Jefferson.

671
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,280
- You're not quite 21.
- Yo...

672
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,000
In 1986, the drinking age
in Russia was 12, so...

673
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,200
Well, perhaps we can
let it slide this one time.

674
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,440
After all, you were the hero today.

675
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
- You saved my life.
- Oh, that?

676
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,760
That was no biggie.

677
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,240
Having merged with an insane
Russian scientist,

678
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,600
I now know how lucky I am
to have you as my partner.

679
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Partners.

680
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,040
Stein doesn't know, does he?

681
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,760
That I almost killed him?

682
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,600
That I advised you to kill him.

683
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,000
It's funny.

684
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,320
When I was in the League
of Assassins,

685
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,120
failure to follow through
on a hit was unforgivable,

686
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,640
a thousand times worse than death.

687
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,200
Maybe I'm losing my edge.

688
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,480
Or gaining a new one.

689
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,600
The fact that you didn't pull
the trigger speaks volumes.

690
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,880
You know, the safe move
was to kill Martin

691
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,160
with the Cold War hanging
in the balance.

692
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,480
I would like to think
it was your humanity

693
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
that stayed your hand.

694
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,640
I'd like to think that too,
but I had some help.

695
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
What was that?

696
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,120
<i>We have been struck
with an explosive projectile.</i>

697
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,920
- No kidding.
- Everyone get strapped in now!

698
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,560
We're in the Temporal Zone.
I don't understand.

699
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,840
No one should be able to...

700
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,560
You were saying?

701
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,200
<i>A scan of the vessel suggests that it
is the bounty hunter Chronos.</i>

702
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,800
Oh, man,
this guy has impeccable timing.

703
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,880
<i>He appears to be following us.</i>

704
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,240
<i>Firing countermeasures.</i>

705
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
<i>Countermeasures effective.</i>

706
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,640
- Have we lost him?
<i>- Yes, but not his missile.</i>

707
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,040
<i>Our aft shield
is gravely compromised.</i>

708
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,720
Initiating evasive maneuvers.

709
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,880
The vodka was a bad choice.

710
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,680
<i>Impact in three, two, one.</i>

711
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,920
<i>Sir, we've just been
knocked out of the timestream.</i>

712
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
What does that mean?

713
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,600
It means we're crash-landing
in place and time.

714
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,720
Gideon, camouflage the ship.

715
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,440
This doesn't look like
the type of place

716
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,120
we want to linger out in the open.

717
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,320
That looks a lot like
a Palmer Tech building,

718
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,600
but why does it have
a Smoak logo on it?

719
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,360
Wait. This is Star City.

720
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,240
I thought you said
the time line was safe.

721
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,040
Yeah, Star City was intact in 2016.

722
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
This...

723
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,640
this is 2046.

724
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,760
Don't move!

725
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,320
Oh, thank God.

726
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,840
I said don't move.

727
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,920
It's me.

728
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,800
It's Sara.

729
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,160
Hey, Oliver, look,

730
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,080
I, I know it's been a long time,
but don't you remember

731
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,440
that Rip Hunter recruited us
to become legends?

732
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,840
I never heard of any legends.
