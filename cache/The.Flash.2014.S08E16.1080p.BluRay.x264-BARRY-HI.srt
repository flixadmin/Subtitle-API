You okay?

11
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:41,876
Don't worry about that guy.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,586
I just dropped him off at C.C.P.D.

13
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,797
Saved by Mr. Flashy himself!

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,883
Oh, I gotta give you a nice, big reward.

15
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:49,883
No, that's not necessary.

16
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,220
I can't accept your money.

17
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,845
But it's butterscotch.

18
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:53,929
[The Flash] Oh.

19
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:55,597
Thank you.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,849
That's very sweet of you.

00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,327
[Chester] <i>Hey, Flash,
we're getting hit hard.</i>

00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,477
<i>We're not gonna make it.</i>

23

[The Flash] <i>Hold on, Chester.
I'm on my way.</i>

24
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:14,200
Nineteen! Critical hit.

25
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,370
Urvakk the Cleric
attacks with the Sacred Flame.

26
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,330
Way stronger than my glaive.

27
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:22,917
Urvakk vanquishes the Lich,
saving our merry band of adventurers.

28
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,377
Radiant damage. Am I right?

29
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,089
What the hell is going on?

30
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,024

...pinning the warrior to the ground.

34

There's no escape for him now.

35
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,576
Save him! Somebody save him!

36
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,538
Help me, Karash the Orc.
You're my last hope.

37
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,581
My turn?

38
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,643
Use your vorpal sword.
Use your vorpal sword.

39
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,627
My what?

40
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:07,170
What do you do, Karash?

41
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,423
I tell the thing
to raise its little claws

42
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,008
and read its Miranda rights.

43
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,886
- Come on.
- Guys, this game is not for me.

44
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,129
- I'm sorry.
- All right, Joe.

45
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,240
- All right. Let's take a break.
- Don't be like that, Joe.

46
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,141
Let's take a break.
Refill our goblets.

47
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:22,560
Man, you were acting, brah.

48
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,686
Sorry.

49
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,980
No, I get it. I get it.

50
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:29,651
It is a little different
for family game night.

51
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:33,071
A little? It's got
a 600-page instruction booklet.

52
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,174
Well, I read the whole thing
in, like, two seconds.

53
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,717
[mimicking] "Well, I read that in,
like, two seconds."

54
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:37,659
I don't sound like that.

55
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,788
Look, I was a little intimidated, too,
but Iris made me give it a try

56
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:45,625
and we wound up having
a great time that night.

57
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,294
That sounds like my baby girl.

58
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,048
Any sign of her?

59
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,510
Nora says that Iris is still
in the future, which means she's okay.

60
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,929
The path we're on now
should lead us to her.

61
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,890
Well, the timeline has split
you and Iris up before

62
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,934
and it never holds. So...

63
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,330
I need to have faith
in that just like you do.

64
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,563
[cell phone vibrating]

65
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,443
Hey, uh...

66
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,655
I gotta go to C.C.P.D.

67
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,864
Kramer needs you?

68
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,201
No, not Kramer.

69
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,367
You're trying to make me feel like
I ran back in time?

70
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,671
What can I say, Allen?
This will always be home.

71
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,790
Don't worry, I covered for you.

72
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:40,012
While the Flash was out
stopping robberies in Central City,

73
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,765
Barry Allen has been
in his lab all day with me.

74
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,684
Captain Kramer
will never suspect a thing.

75
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,312
Thanks, Chief, but it's fine.
She already knows I'm the Flash.

76
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:51,357
What? You told her already?
She just got here.

77
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:53,693
Actually, she figured it out on her own.

78
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,936
Well, I figured it out first.

79
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:56,571
You did.

80
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,239
I mean, good for her.

81
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,408
Uh, so you said you had a case for me?

82
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,617
[clears throat] Yes.

83
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,079
A high-profile theft
at Mercury Labs came across my desk.

84
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,456
What is it?

85
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,726
We thought it was a simple
smash-and-grab job by a thief

86
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,002
who wiped the security cameras
clean before they left.

87
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,839
But the inventory report says they
made off with a gamma absorption array.

88
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,257
And Mercury tech unit says

89
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,886
a device like that in the wrong hands
can cause all kinds of damage.

90
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,096
Yeah, they're right.
I mean, arrays like this

91
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,683
use bursts of gamma radiation
to interact with cellular structures.

92
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,602
It could be used for almost anything

93
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,396
from growing super crops
to taking out an entire army.

94
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,484
So the only way to solve
our mystery is to catch our thief.

95
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,871
I will never get used to that.

96
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:47,954
[Barry chuckles]

97
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,001
So, tire prints from the crime scene
have traces of residual calcium plates.

98
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,562
It's most commonly found in barnacles,

99
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,296
which grow directly onto
a hard substrate,

100
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,714
like a boat or a dock.

101
00:04:56,798 --> 00:05:01,886
So the perp is probably hiding out
somewhere near the shipyard.

102
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,555
Okay. I will get
Captain Kramer up to speed.

103
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,432
Great work, as usual.

104
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,516
Thank you.

105
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,646
So you know what happens now?

106
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,399
Oh, I bring in our mystery thief.

107
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,446
That I'm used to.

108
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,210
[The Flash] <i>Chester, bring up the plans
for the shipyard warehouses.</i>

109
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,551
<i>Our perp is hiding somewhere out here.</i>

110
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:28,579
Might as well list the whole area
on villainhideouts.com.

111
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,958
<i>These warehouses
haven't been in use in seven years.</i>

112
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,126
I think I found something.

113
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,339
[panting]

114
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,302
Tire treads match those
from the crime report.

115
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,100
[Chester] <i>Great gamma gadget.</i>

116
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,037
Barry, that van must have been shielded
'cause as soon as you opened it up,

117
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,741
radiation readings
spiked through the roof.

118
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,940
It's the gamma array.

119
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,944
Whoever stole this
made some seriously advanced mods.

120
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,530
I'm gonna run it back
for a full analysis.

121
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,156
[man laughing]

122
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:11,914
Oh, you won't be running anywhere
much longer.

123
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:13,999
Hey.

124
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,004
You're the bad guy, aren't you?

125
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,298
You wanna save us both some time

126
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,926
and tell me what these mods do
before I take you to prison or after?

127
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,846
Why don't I show you?

128
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:30,891
[The Flash screaming]

129
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:35,804
[Chester] <i>Flash, are you okay?</i>

130
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,189
<i>Flash!</i>

131
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,486
[chuckles]

132
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,157
Enjoy what time you have left, Flash.

133
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,667
[Barry] Oh! What hit me?

134
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,351
[Chester] Gideon, run a full diagnostic.

135
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,630
[Gideon] <i>Commencing
full-body diagnostic scan.</i>

136
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:03,883
[system bleeping]

137
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,928
<i>Multiple biological abnormalities
detected.</i>

138
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,012
What?

139
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,514
What kind of abnormalities?

140
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,018
[Gideon] <i>Moderate signs of arthritis,
hearing loss, osteoporosis,</i>

141
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,895
<i>high cholesterol and heartburn.</i>

142
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,062
That's what that is.

143
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,773
Holy Benjamin Button, Barry!

144
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,859
Every cell in your body
has deteriorated suddenly.

145
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,987
It says here that
you've aged 30 years overnight.

146
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,573
How is that possible?
He looks exactly the same.

147
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,742
It looks like the blast that hit Barry

148
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,545
was mostly absorbed
by his internal biology.

149
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,873
Organs, cardiovascular system,
bones, joints.

150
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,042
He may look young on the outside,

151
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,920
but on the inside,
things are very different.

152
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:42,837
Can we reverse it?

153
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:47,218
Maybe, but I'd need the device
that whammied you to even try.

154
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,345
All right, let's find
Dr. Creep-face and get it.

155
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,807
But why build an "old gun" anyway?

156
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,785
I don't know, but whatever
the reason, it's probably dangerous.

157
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,954
I'm gonna go back
to his warehouse and search for clues.

158
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,039
Hang on. Hang on.
Do you really think it's a good idea

159
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,856
for you to go out in the field
like this?

160
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,109
Do we even know...
has this affected your powers?

161
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,573
Gideon run a meta efficiency test.

162
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,866
[Gideon] <i>Test initiated.</i>

163
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,118
We'll start with phasing.

164
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:23,837
[groaning]

165
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:24,840
[exclaims] Oh.

166
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:25,923
[wincing] Come on.

167
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,258
[Gideon] <i>Phasing unsuccessful.</i>

168
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,467
Phasing's pretty advanced.

169
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,383
- Yeah.
- [Barry] Um, yeah.

170
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,513
Okay, let's try something easier.

171
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,514
Wind arms.

172
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,435
Wind arms are easier.

173
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,398
Oh, my.

174
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,485
[grunting in frustration] Come on!

175
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,338
- [Gideon] <i>Test complete.</i>
- I almost had it.

176
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,741
<i>- Meta ability has decreased by 29%.</i>
- [groaning]

177
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,746
Okay, Barry, honey,
why don't you come sit down?

178
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:54,826
I'm fine.

179
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:56,453
I'm fine.

180
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:59,415
I can...
I can feel the Speed Force inside me.

181
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:04,879
I just need to stretch my legs,
get them moving...

182
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:06,755
[Barry groaning]

183
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,051
Figure out what I can still handle.

184
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:11,801
[crashing]

185
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,764
- [all muttering]
- [Barry groaning]

186
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,019
[Barry groaning] I'm okay.

187
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,606
[Joe] I already updated the software.

188
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,483
Now I've got to give
the damn thing a name.

189
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,318
How about "vacuum"?

190
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,488
There's the Joe West I know.

191
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,239
It's good to see you, man.

192
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:33,323
Hey, David.

193
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,241
Hey.

194
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,494
[David grunting]

195
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,537
Barry told me you'd be around.

196
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,724
Sorry, I've just been screaming
at electronic equipment

197
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,124
for the last couple hours.

198
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,852
I wanted to see
how retirement was treating you.

199
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,421
I was expecting all-day football
or a wine and jazz room,

200
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,882
not an appliance minefield.

201
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,843
Yeah, ever since
Jenna's been to pre-school,

202
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:56,097
I've had more time on my hands.
A lot more.

203
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,058
You know, you could just use
some of this time to find ways to relax.

204
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,144
When Rob's mom retired,
she took up meditation.

205
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,897
That sounds like a whole lot
of sitting around doing nothing.

206
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,818
Plus all these little projects
keep me busy.

207
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:14,615
The problem is, each one of them comes
with a novel-long instruction booklet.

208
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,577
I mean, you have to learn how to program
a computer to just use a mop.

209
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:20,954
You know what?

210
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,874
Rob and I got his mother
one of these last Christmas.

211
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,902
Let's see what you're working with.

212
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,926
[electricity cracking]

213
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
- Hey!
- Hi.

214
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,477
You look better. How do you feel?

215
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,855
I'm just a little tired.

216
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:49,441
But as long as I keep it under Mach 10,
I can maintain control of my speed.

217
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,877
And that's more than
fast enough to catch this guy.

218
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:54,822
Right, but we know that Allegra
can handle herself out in the field.

219
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,284
So when crazy scientist guy comes back,
then she and Chester can handle it.

220
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,285
And I can even help out...

221
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:02,288
Cecile, I can't risk any of you
getting hit with that machine.

222
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,890
And you heard Chester,
the only way to cure me

223
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:04,975
is to get the gamma array back,

224
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,001
and the best way to do that
is with my speed.

225
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,421
But are you sure that
this is the right way to do it?

226
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,799
It just feels like you're racing
past some red flags here.

227
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:17,261
I mean, is everything okay?

228
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,265
[Chester] <i>Guys, we've got a break-in
at Magnus Labs.</i>

229
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,809
Another tech facility.
Guess we found our guy.

230
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:27,479
Chester, get ready to adjust
that gamma array when I get back.

231
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,606
I won't be long.

232
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,024
[sighs]

233
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:34,862
[alarm blaring]

234
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,155
[device beeping]

235
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,200
High velocity object incoming.

236
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,584
I assumed correctly you would
recognize a thermal detonator, Flash.

237
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,544
[Chester]
<i>Barry, that's no ordinary grenade.</i>

238
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,796
It's got major bad energy
emanating from it.

239
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,049
He modified it to pack a serious punch.

240
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,515
This isn't the answer
to getting what you want.

241
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,680
There is only one way
to get what I want,

242
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,641
and it's in here.

243
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,268
I am going to obtain a power
more precious

244
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:09,980
than any ever wielded by a "superhero."

245
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,317
How's this for power?

246
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:20,365
Cute.

247
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,033
My turn.

248
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,039
[Chester] His heart rate's spiking.

249
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,099
Barry?

250
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,517
<i>Barry!</i>

251
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:58,070
[Chester] Well, there's no permanent
damage, but you're nearsighted now.

252
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,864
Why did your vision go bad?

253
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,636
You didn't have this problem earlier.

254
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,284
[stutters]

255
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,744
That's not the only new thing.

256
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,289
It's just, like...

257
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,668
I thought he was only supposed
to be old on the inside.

258
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:20,426
Hey, Chester, run my scan results
through Gideon's bio-algorithm

259
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,219
and let's take a detailed look.

260
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,222
Done. And if I'm reading this right...

261
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,181
Um...

262
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,226
You aged another ten years.

263
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:31,729
[Cecile] What?

264
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,148
How? Was it the grenade blast?

265
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,607
I don't think so.

266
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,986
It looks like the gamma radiation
inside Barry's cells

267
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,989
is activated by his Speed Force energy.

268
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:45,909
Chuck, are you seriously saying
that the more the Flash runs...

269
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,995
The more he ages.

270
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,456
Barry, you gotta stop using your speed.

271
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,458
Cecile, I have to find this guy.

272
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,334
[sighs]

273
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,546
Hold on. Maybe Cecile's right.

274
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,090
You almost had a heart attack
back at Magnus Labs.

275
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,092
Plus, if your aging's
showing on the outside,

276
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,762
I can't even imagine
what's going on inside your body.

277
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,930
Guys, I won't let this guy get away.

278
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,366
We still don't even know
what he's planning.

279
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,110
What if he uses this device
on someone else?

280
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,020
And what if you die of old age
before you can stop him?

281
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,188
I won't.

282
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,939
Look, we just need to
track this guy down

283
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,524
as soon as possible and end this.

284
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,318
And I think I know how to start.

285
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:22,905
You found out who he is?

286
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,657
Yeah, he wiped the security cameras
at his first crime scene,

287
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,868
but I showed up
before he had a chance to do it again.

288
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,180
Pulled this photo from the footage
and ran a background check.

289
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,705
[Chester] Dr. Pytor Orloff.

290
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:35,834
Former technician at a small R & D lab,
Corbin Taft Industries.

291
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:39,004
Says here he was fired
for using company resources

292
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,547
on unsanctioned research.

293
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:44,218
I'm gonna check his old lab at Taft.
See if Dr. Olsen left any clues.

294
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,679
Barry, it's Dr. Orloff, remember?

295
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,679
That's what I meant.

296
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,476
And I'm gonna need
those contacts, Chester.

297
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,558
Yeah.

298
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,601
Thanks.

299
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,895
Okay, I'm gonna go with you.

300
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,478
Cecile...

301
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,500
Look, this guy has surprised us
a couple of times already,

302
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,401
and my powers will feel him coming

303
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,903
if he decides to show up
while we're at his lab.

304
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,903
Okay.

305
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,323
Great! Oh! Uh...

306
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,451
Real quick. This time...
We're gonna take my car.

307
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,043
"Now, use the provided
triangular hex bracket tool

308
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,670
to fasten the side brushes."

309
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,439
Yeah, I couldn't find
whatever the hell that is.

310
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,507
So I'm using my trusty,
dusty socket wrench.

311
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,901
Are you sure
that it's going to fit the...

312
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,677
- [tool squeaks]
- Uh...

313
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,513
Just a little elbow grease.

314
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,197
All right,
let's see if this thing works.

315
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,355
[beeps]

316
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,275
Oh!

317
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:43,693
Damn it!

318
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,242
Why do we need robots
for a man's job, anyway?

319
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,411
Jenna's going to have
to learn what chores are.

320
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,746
[Joe sighs]

321
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,664
Joe...

322
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,960
I love you, man, but...

323
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,505
I've not seen you
this frustrated since...

324
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,385
Do you remember the Steve Palmer case?

325
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:12,473
Look, man, I would spend months
and months and months on a case

326
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,575
if that's what it took, right?

327
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,560
I mean, obviously it wasn't easy,
but I loved it.

328
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,811
I loved it.

329
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,192
Now, I'm...

330
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,699
Uh, okay, that's enough of that.

331
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,284
I'm calling in a 10-85.

332
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,745
Delay due to coffee break.

333
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,473
You, my friend, need to
get out of this house badly.

334
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,707
Man, let me just clean up
this vacuum mess.

335
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,375
Oh, no, Joe, I'm not asking.

336
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,295
This is an order
from the Chief of Police.

337
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:45,796
Let's roll.

338
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,133
All right. You're buying.

339
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:50,801
[Captain] Don't I always?

340
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,303
True.

341
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,199
[Barry] Look for Orloff's
old work files.

342
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,608
Maybe they could tell us where he's
hiding or what he could be planning.

343
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,441
Usually, these facilities
have strict record-keeping.

344
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:10,905
I got it.

345
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:16,494
Okay.

346
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,505
What was that?

347
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,968
I think it was a facial ID scan.
Like how your phone unlocks.

348
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,658
That's a countdown
to wipe the hard drive.

349
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,952
If we don't hack past this now,
all the data's going to be erased.

350
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,176
I need to run this to Chester.

351
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,603
Wait, no, Barry, you can't.

352
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,540
I don't have a choice. We need
to find out what's on this hard drive.

353
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,958
Well, then there's gotta be another way.

354
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,209
Let's just take a second and think...

355
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,169
I don't have time.
We need to run this to C.C.P.D.

356
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,193
C.C.P.D.?

357
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,444
You mean S.T.A.R.?

358
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,090
Barry, that's the second time
you forgot something.

359
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,554
I didn't forget it. I misspoke, okay?
We need to go right now.

360
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,042
Where did you take us?

361
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,714
[Cecile gasps]

362
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,843
Barry...

363
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,928
We are a long way from home.

364
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:16,929
Barry!

365
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,019
How did we get here?

366
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,613
[Gideon] <i>Connections in the hippocampus
are showing gradual decay.</i>

367
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,033
<i>While cognitive functions
have returned to normal levels,</i>

368
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:39,411
<i>Barry Allen's memory loss
will likely be a recurring event.</i>

369
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,833
Barry...

370
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,753
How you feeling?

371
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,341
I feel like we don't have time for this.
I'm fine now.

372
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,635
Barr, I don't think you get
how serious this is.

373
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,888
Look, according to your latest
bio-scan results from Gideon,

374
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,683
if you use that much speed
again, it could kill you.

375
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,729
Okay.

376
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,776
Then we need to find Orloff
more than ever.

377
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,570
Getting his gamma array
is still the only way to cure me

378
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,155
and stop whatever he's planning.

379
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,574
Chester, were you able
to save his laptop?

380
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,824
[sighs]

381
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,661
I managed to stop the countdown,

382
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,289
but it's going to take
some more time for me to hack inside.

383
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,813
Okay. Well, let me know when you do.

384
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,848
In the meantime,
everyone watch satellites

385
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,252
for gamma ray spikes in the city.

386
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,797
Right now, that's our only
other means to find Orloff.

387
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,675
I'm gonna visit the Starchives.

388
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,344
See if I can find anything
to safely hold the gamma emitter

389
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,428
when I bring it back.

390
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,939
[Joe] <i>Sometimes I feel like
time's chasing me.</i>

391
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,603
I spend half my day

392
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:52,192
trying to keep up
with the changes all around me.

393
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,444
Like I had to set a reminder on my phone

394
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,490
to pick up Jenna
from her playdate an hour from now.

395
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,639
It's like I don't recognize my life.

396
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,493
All right.

397
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,957
Maybe that's what happens when
you have more years behind you

398
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,750
than you have ahead of you.

399
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,545
You spend so much time looking back that

400
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,964
it is really hard to move forward.

401
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,258
Hmm.

402
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,010
Joe...

403
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,762
Um...

404
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,974
Your life isn't the problem.

405
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,060
Retirement isn't the problem.

406
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,061
It's you.

407
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,441
You don't want to move forward.

408
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,818
You've always been like this.

409
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:36,862
Stuck in your ways.

410
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,282
Not really willing
to embrace anything new.

411
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:45,537
My ways put hundreds
of criminals behind bars.

412
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,539
Mm.

413
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:55,547
Do you know why it took us so long
to close the Steve Palmer case?

414
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,108
It wasn't just 'cause of the dead ends.

415
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,804
It was because you refused to learn
the new C.C.P.D. computer system.

416
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,685
Listen now,
my file folders worked just fine.

417
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:09,769
Maybe.

418
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,566
And maybe you spent a lot
of extra time filling out forms.

419
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,112
Time you could have spent
doing the job you love instead.

420
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,491
Joe, your life has always been changing.

421
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,618
Think about it.

422
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,953
You were a single father

423
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,290
who took in a traumatized boy
who just lost both of his parents.

424
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,086
And you raised that boy to be
one of the most extraordinary humans

425
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,296
to ever walk the Earth.

426
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:44,428
Joe,

427
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,099
you raised the Flash.

428
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:54,022
And he didn't get his greatest
superpowers from a bolt of lightning.

429
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:59,402
He got them from the man who embraced
an unexpected time in his life.

430
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:05,867
He got them from you, Joe West.

431
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:14,209
Now imagine all the amazing new things
Joe West can still do with his life.

432
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:23,801
Yeah.

433
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,003
Hey.

434
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,267
I've been looking for you. I thought
you were going to the Starchives.

435
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,970
Barry?

436
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,728
I... Forgot where it was.

437
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:22,027
Okay. All right. Come on, talk to me.

438
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,542
Barry, what's going on with you?

439
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,544
You're not normally this stubborn.

440
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,798
And what are you trying to prove, honey?
You know you're scaring all of us.

441
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,387
I'm scared, too, Cecile.

442
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,601
Orloff's still out there and I can't...

443
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:57,686
[sighs in exasperation]

444
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,942
I feel myself withering.

445
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:07,614
When I run, my bones ache,
like they're made of glass and...

446
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,118
My hands won't stop shaking.

447
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,956
I'm always out of breath
and it's getting harder.

448
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:20,834
[mutters]

449
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:27,550
It's getting harder
to remember the people I love.

450
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:31,679
My friends.

451
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,351
Nora, Bart, Joe.

452
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,522
Even Iris.

453
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:52,450
What if I forget who she is
before she comes back?

454
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:03,753
I thought I had plenty
of time to get Iris back...

455
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,091
And live my life with her.

456
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:13,513
Now it's all fading away, like my body.

457
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,767
And now, with my mind going, too,

458
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:25,442
it's like losing everyone you love...

459
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:28,945
all at once.

460
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,834
You know, you're not the first superhero
that I've seen go through this.

461
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:50,550
No... I knew one badass fighter
through and through.

462
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,677
My grandmother.

463
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:02,937
And, just like you, she was always
running from one adventure to the next.

464
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:05,564
[chuckles]

465
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,651
Not just when
she was young and spry, either.

466
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:13,698
Oh, no, no. I mean, I'm talking
well into her golden years.

467
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,328
She never lost her love for life and...

468
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:23,875
that inspired me to do more with my own.

469
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,297
She sounds like an amazing woman.

470
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,383
Here's the thing, though.

471
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:40,183
She never feared getting old.

472
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,351
Mm-mm.

473
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,687
She made a choice.

474
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,984
She knew if she was gonna
run out of time, then, damn it,

475
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,628

the encryption code on Orloff's laptop.</i>

483
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,449
So I took a look through
Orloff's notes on the gamma array.

484
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,618
He is a next-level genius, no doubt,

485
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:44,289
but unfortunately he's planning
something seriously dangerous.

[system bleeping]

487
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,090
This is what he stole
from his second lab raid.

488
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:54,048
It's an energy amplifier that could
boost his machine's output 100-fold.

489
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,467
So he wants to make everyone old? Why?

490
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,094
His research is obsessed

491

with finding the scientific equivalent
of the Fountain of Youth.

492
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,644
He just wants to be young again
and I think he's figured out how.

the amplifier to the gamma array?

No, it's not gonna be that easy.
I mean, look at these readings.

If we shut it down too suddenly,

516
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,193
there'd be a cascading
degradation cycle in the gamma isotopes.

517
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,736
Meaning we can't just turn it off.

518
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,530
It's already built up
too much of a charge.

519

In a few minutes, it'll be
charged enough to affect the whole city.

523
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,768
Is there any way we can slow it down?

No.

525

all day.

00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,511
But if we fed it more energy
than it can handle...

530
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,680
The amplifier would have
to kick into overdrive

00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,682
to match the high energy
consumption rate.

532

It would burn out the machine.

00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,205
Yes!

636
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:07,625
What if Karash the Orc

637
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:11,629
used Vorion root-induced Barbarian rage

638
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:14,090
and his vorpal sword

639
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:19,595
to kick some Dungeon Kraken ass?

640
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,721
Yes!

641
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:23,808
I've been doing a little light reading
in that handbook there, children.

642
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:26,060
And once I show you all
how to play this game,

643
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,736
I'mma teach you all spades and
you're all gonna need a manual for that.

644
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,024
That's my man!

645
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:34,985
I'm sorry, I gotta take this.
Hold on, you guys keep...

646
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,195
Okay.

647
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,279
You shall not pass!

648
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,781
[all laughing]

649
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:41,784
Carla, hey, what's up?

650
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,039
No, I thought Caitlin was with you.

651
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:02,637
Caitlin?

652
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:18,737
[Caitlin] Barry?

653
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:22,700
Caitlin, are you okay?

654
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,076
What are you doing here?

655
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,763
Your mom called, trying to find you.
You said you were staying with her,

656
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:28,956
but she says
she hasn't seen you since the funeral,

657
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,479
that you haven't returned her calls.

658
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,877
I changed my mind.

659
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:38,299
Okay. What is going on?

660
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:43,220
I've been working on some stuff.

661
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:45,805
What is it?

662
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:50,269
You know you can ask
for my help with anything.

663
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,814
I know I can, but...

664
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:56,941
But what?

665
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,236
Caitlin, talk to me.

666
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:01,905
[exclaims softly]

667
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,679
- Okay...
- What's this doing here?

668
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:08,913
I know how this looks.

669
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,265
Caitlin, what's this doing here?

670
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:11,289
Barry, just listen to me.

671
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:16,504
The Mirror Gun split Frost and me
into two people once before.

672
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:19,799
It took her from my subconscious
and gave her a body.

673
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:24,261
So I've been running tests
over and over again.

674
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,056
And there must still be
a piece of Frost inside of me,

675
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:31,560
so if I can access those latent pieces
in my subconsciousness,

676
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:34,814
then I can bring her back.

677
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,073
[stuttering] Okay,
I know what you're thinking,

678
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:47,326
and frankly, if I was in your shoes,
I'd probably be thinking the same thing.

679
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,953
But just for one second,

680
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:52,498
imagine this isn't Frost
that we're talking about.

681
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,479
What if we could bring your mom back?

682
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,169
Or your dad?

683
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:03,634
What would you do to make
that possibility a reality?

684
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,517
We don't have to say goodbye to Frost.

685
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,314
Caitlin, losing someone you love
can make it really hard to move on.

686
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:22,278
But as difficult as it is,
you have to accept that Frost is gone.

687
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,864
And that she's not coming back.

688
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:29,702
But I don't want to.

689
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,037
I know.

690
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,001
But it's the only way
to start living again.

691
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,631
I can do this.

692
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,175
I have to.

693
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:56,644
I'm sorry.

694
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,942
Barry... Barry, please.

695
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:05,278
Barry, don't!

696
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:34,767
[sighing]

697
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,611
I'm sorry.

698
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,286
[sighs]
