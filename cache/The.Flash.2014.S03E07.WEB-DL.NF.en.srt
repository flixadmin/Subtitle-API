806
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:36,337
I got hit pretty hard,

807
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,131
and I don't have the foggiest

808
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,841
who even kidnapped me at all.

809
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,094
- [sighs]

810
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,429
Thank you, man.

811
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,724
Thank you.

812
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,561
- There is one thing
you can do for me, mate.

813
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,188
- Anything.

814
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,898
- Quit.

815
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,108
- What?

816
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,400
- Tender your resignation

817
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,902
from the Central City
Police Department,

818
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,695
effective immediately.

819
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,950
I can overlook
the unexplained absences,

820
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,745
the constant disregard
for the rules and regulations,

821
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:12,582
but your moral compass is
broken, my friend.

822
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,585
I point-blank refuse

823
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,088
to work with someone
whose sense of right or wrong is

824
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,132
as flippant as the weather,

825
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:24,469
someone who thinks friendship is
more important than justice.

826
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,931
You are unfit to be CSI.

827
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:31,810
Barry Allen has no place
in law enforcement.

828
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,818
Now, do we have an agreement,

829
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,070
or would you like the detective
to meet that girl?

830
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,076
- All right.

831
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,535
- [sighs]

832
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,753
- He's all yours.

833
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,549
- Hey, Albert.

834
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,843
- Hey.
- So, what can you tell me

835
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,096
about our...our meta friend?

836
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,307
- I don't really remember
anything.

837
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,518
To be honest with you,
it's all a bit of a blur, so...

838
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:19,941
- [sighs]

839
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,736
- Hey.
- Hey.

840
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,363
- We just heard from Singh.

841
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,866
You quit?
What...what is going on?

842
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,660
- I, um...

843
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,662
didn't really have a choice.

844
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,081
- What do you mean,
you didn't have a choice?

845
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,624
- Julian.

846
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,794
You quit, he keeps his mouth
shut about Caitlin.

847
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,587
- That son of a bitch.

848
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,048
- I don't know.
I mean, he said I couldn't

849
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,799
do something
like protect Caitlin

850
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,259
and still be a good CSI,

851
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,303
and maybe he's right.

852
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,263
- No, he's not.

853
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,182
Barry, you are
an incredible CSI,

854
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,641
and no one
in this building cares more

855
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,476
about helping people
find justice than you.

856
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,354
And that was
long before you were The Flash.

857
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,356
This lab...it's your life.

858
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,067
- You're my life.

859
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,776
Both of you.

860
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:07,405
And Wally and Caitlin,

861
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,656
Cisco.

[sighs]

863
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,826
If these past few months
have taught me anything,

864
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,080
it's that I would give up
everything I have

865
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,248
to keep you all safe.

866
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,332
No regrets.

867
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,917
- Every time I think you've

868
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,460
run out of ways to be a hero,

869
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,921
you show me another one.

870
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:27,800
You hungry?

871
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,801
- Yeah.

872
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,387
Yeah, let's get out of here.
