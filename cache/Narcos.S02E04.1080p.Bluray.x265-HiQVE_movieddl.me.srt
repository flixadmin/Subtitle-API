(Valeria) 'Who is "he"?
'Do you remember his name?'

- Escobar trained the kid.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

42
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:25,811
Whether he did it or not
is beside the point.

43

Colombia is tired of Escobar.

She has no credibility
in this country.

46
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,946
I need to know if Carrillo
killed that boy.

47
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:40,910
If we say she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo,

48
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:42,203
they'll believe us.

49
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:46,791
But if the press finds out
you spoke to Carrillo...

50
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,751
They'll assume it's true.

51
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,836
Exactly.

52
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:00,763
- What do you propose?
- (Sighs)

53
00:05:00,888 --> 00:05:03,432
That we don'<i>t</i> play
Escobar's game.

54
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:05,893
And that we leave things
as they are...

55
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:07,061
For now.

56
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:13,984
I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

57
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:18,113
- No, no, no. No violence.
- That's not what I mean. <i>I...</i>

Of course.

60
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,205
It's just the president
has denied it ever happened,

61
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,208
and the American media
haven'<i>t</i> even mentioned <i>it.</i>

62
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,793
Of course.

Hmm.

71
00:05:57,111 --> 00:06:00,823
I'm writing to the editors
of the biggest newspapers

72
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:05,411
to tell them how that boy
came to me, scared for his life.

73
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:10,165
The world must know the monster
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.

74
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,544

would want American witnesses.

Exactly what he wants.

97

start asking questions.

00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:04,871
You think I buy labs because
I loved Chemistry in school?

165
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,957
You're going to put
chemists out of business.

166
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:10,502
I'm more interested in
putting Pablo out of business.

167
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:14,381
Now's the time
to move in on Miami.

168
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:19,761
It won'<i>t</i> be hard for us
to take that business.

169
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:22,431
Don'<i>t</i> you think it's too early?

170
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:24,224
Pablo's in hiding.

171
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:28,145
The Search Bloc's killing his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

172
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,523
and I want us to be
in an advantageous position.

173
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,734
Can you take care of that?

174
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,737
Yes, of course.

175
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:40,574
But don'<i>t</i> make it too obvious.

176
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:45,620
I don'<i>t want</i> Judy Moncada asking shit
and negotiating for a piece.

177
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:49,207
Then you should call Pablo

178
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:54,713
and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

179
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:57,674
We'll dump her
in the same ditch as him.

180
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,384
(Soft chuckle)

181
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:15,484
(Velasco) Guys.

182
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:20,572
The Search Bloc
took another Moncada lab.

183
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:23,325
The sons of bitches killed
three of the Prisco brothers.

184
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,868
Ricardo got away.

185
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:26,787
- When was this?
- Last night.

186
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:31,625
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

187
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,586
(Man) Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

188
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:37,464
Since when do we hide, brother?

189
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,842
Let's trust the boss.

190
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,346
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

191
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,434
(Phone ringing)

192
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:52,604
- Hello?
- 'Get me Don Pablo.'

193
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:54,231
- Who's this?
- 'Fernando Duque.'

194
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:55,399
- Fernando.
- 'Get him!'

195
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:58,985
Yes, sir, right away.
Limón, please.

196
00:15:06,827 --> 00:15:08,120
(Limón) Boss?

197
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:10,956
Your lawyer, Mr Duque.

198
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,502
How many were published?

199
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:20,841
(Fernando) 'Don Pablo,
we sent them all to the newspapers.'

200
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:27,264
How many of my letters
were published, Fernando?

201
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,224
Yes. Uh, none.

202
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:31,810
'They're very, very well written.'

203
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:35,147
It's not about how well-written
they were, Fernando.

204
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:38,233
It's about the fucking truth!

205
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:46,450
(Sighs)

206
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:56,418
(Steve) 'If it seemed like Escobar's world
was crashing down around him,

207
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:59,045
'it was actually about to get worse.

208
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:03,258
'Remember when Pablo collaborated
with M-19 communists

209

'during the Palace of Justice siege?

210
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:09,806
'By doing that,
he pissed off the Autodefensas,

212

'that was in direct conflict
with the communist guerrillas.'

213
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:20,066
(Man speaks Spanish) That's why
we've been forced to take up arms

214
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,610
and defend ourselves...

(Steve) 'The leaders
of the Autodefensas

- Good to see you, my friend.

235
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:40,981
- Welcome. Have a nice trip?
- Thank you. As always, as always.

236
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,942
(In Spanish)
All right. Very good.

237
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:49,364
(Speaks English) Ha! These weapons
are better than the last ones.

238
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,575
- They should be.
- Thank you, Mr Green,

239
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,494
for the continued support
of your country.

240
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:57,330
I haven'<i>t</i> used that name
since the School of the Americas.

241
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:01,459
I know you're waging a great war
against communism in these jungles.

242
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:05,088
We will not stop
until the last communist is dead.

243
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:07,382
(Bill) Another struggle is emerging.

244
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:11,595
One that is essential to our, uh...

245
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,471
shared cause.

246
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:17,809
- Escobar.
- (Carlos) Escobar deserves to die.

247
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:22,522
But our fight is here in the jungle,
against the guerrilla.

248
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:25,984
Yes, and Pablo's still strong in Medellín.

249
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,195
Yeah, strength is exceedingly relative.

250
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:40,582
An alliance is forming...
with the objective of taking out Escobar.

251
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:41,791
Who?

252
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,169
Rival elements
from the trafficking world.

253
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:49,424
Look, what matters most is that
when Escobar's taken off the board,

254
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:53,470
the right parties are in a position
to make sure order is maintained.

255
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:57,307
And that strategic Colombian resources
and revenue streams...

256
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,310
don'<i>t</i> fall into the wrong hands.

257
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,552
(♪ Up-tempo Latin music playing)

258
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:46,523
(In Spanish) Guys.

259
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:48,858
Ms Judy.

260
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:57,701
All right, now... I'd like to know
the reason for this meeting.

261
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:01,538
- You don'<i>t</i> see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

262
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,707
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

263
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:08,920
We know you all joined forces
against him.

264
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:12,924
And we want to know if my brother
and I can join the cause.

265
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,843
Why?

266
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:17,595
What do you want out of this?

267
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:20,724
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it?

268
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,185
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

269
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,771
is also allied with the guerrilla,

270
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:29,691
whom he has helped
on many occasions.

271
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,778
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is a patriotic act.

272
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:37,824
(Carlos) Imagine, Pacho,
your financial resources

273
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:43,329
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

274
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:48,209
- with our military experience...
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

275
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:52,464
No, no, no, Mrs Moncada.
A death squad? No.

276
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,466
An army.

277
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:56,718
And when this army gets to Medellín,

278
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:59,679
Pablo Escobar's death
won'<i>t</i> be a matter of months.

279
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:02,140
It'll be a matter of weeks.

280
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,684
What do you say, Mr Pacho?

281
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,271
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

282
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:19,115
All of this sounds... interesting.

283
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,160
With all due respect, gentlemen,

284
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:27,457
our organisation already
has a strategy in place, and it's working.

285
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:30,251
It doesn'<i>t</i> seem to me like it's working.

286
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:33,630
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

287
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:37,300
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

288
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:46,017
I'll share this conversation
with my partners.

289
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:49,854
But I think that, for now,
the answer is no.

290
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:54,150
Excuse me.

291
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:02,534
(Rooster crows)

292
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:04,285
(Mooing)

293
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:17,090
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

294
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:19,342
I'm not going to hurt you,
I promise.

295
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:23,137
And La Quica?

296
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:25,765
He's not here. He's back there,
looking for you.

297
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:32,480
If he finds out I'm here, he'll want
to kill me too. Let's talk. Relax.

298
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,527
Because of you,
I can never go back to Medellín.

299
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:38,987
- Maritza!
- Because of you,

300
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:42,156
- my daughter and I have to hide!
- Relax, relax, relax!

301
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:47,954
I really am sorry, and I'm here
because I want to help you.

302
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,707
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around?

303
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:53,877
- I had nothing to do with <i>that.</i>
- Why would I believe you?

304
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:57,088
Because you know me,
and I wouldn'<i>t</i> do something like <i>that.</i>

305
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,258
You killed me, Jhon.

306
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:03,511
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

307
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:07,974
You knew how badly I needed money
and you took advantage of <i>that.</i>

308
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,602
I really am sorry, Maritza.

309
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:13,688
Believe me, I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

310
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:14,856
What is it?

311
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:18,651
We'll give them what they <i>want.</i>
We'll give them Escobar.

312
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:21,321
(Scoffs)

313
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:25,700
What the fuck are you saying?

314
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:27,744
Believe me, Maritza.

315
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:31,122
I'm the one who drives Escobar and
knows when he's without his <i>sicarios.</i>

316
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:34,000
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on?

317
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,878
Mum, go back inside. Go inside.

318
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:41,758
Doña Liliana.

319
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:45,053
- I don'<i>t</i> trust the police.
- Listen to me.

320
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:48,598
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

321
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:50,767
so you can leave with your daughter.

322
00:23:55,939 --> 00:24:00,109
(Sighs) And you?
What do you get out of this?

323
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:04,072
Working for Escobar isn'<i>t what it</i> seems.
They're killing all of his men.

324
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:05,865
I'm afraid.

325
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:11,955
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

326
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:58,918
(Tata chuckles)
All right. My turn.

327
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:01,004
(Pablo) Mmh.

328
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:03,506
You both look beautiful.

329
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:13,099
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

330
00:25:29,907 --> 00:25:33,077
- Why didn'<i>t</i> you tell me?
- What?

331
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,124
Velasco told me.

332
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:03,608
(Pablo sighs)

333
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,028
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

334
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:10,364
Yes, Pablo...

335
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:12,366
20 strangers.

336
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:15,787
Let's see.

337
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:18,831
How do you hold it?

338
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:33,471
What?

339
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:36,432
You sure you want to laugh at your wife
while she's holding a gun?

340
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,602
It's not a joke, Pablo.

341
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:41,354
Tata.

342
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:45,024
Those 20 men out there
don'<i>t</i> care what happens to us.

343
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:49,779
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

344
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,992
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

345
00:27:04,627 --> 00:27:06,170
All right.

346
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:12,009
But I think you need
more practise with that.

347
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:35,783
(In Spanish) Javi, it's Gabriela.

348
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:37,160
'What's up?'

349
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:39,704
It's been a while
and I want to see you.

350
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:43,040
Well, I'm working right now.

351
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,918
Don'<i>t</i> be like that.

352
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:57,388
All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

353
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:01,142
(In English) Got the lecture
from Messina about not leaving base?

354
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,852
Yeah.

355
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:05,646
Crosby must've really laid
into her on that one.

356
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:19,368
- Where you going?
- Out. Off base.

357
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:23,664
OK, I guess it means, "Fuck that."

358
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,291
(Knocking)

359
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:32,465
- I've got half an hour.
- Wait. Javi.

360
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,635
- Javi, Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

361
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:40,056
Hello.

362
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:42,099
Hi.

363
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:44,018
She's a friend of a friend.

364
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:47,313
Maritza, meet Javier.

365
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:50,733
And...

366
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:54,862
Why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

367
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:57,698
She's in trouble.

368
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:00,409
- Just hear her out.
- (Sighs)

369
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:03,704
Goddammit, Gabby.
You could've told me over the phone.

370
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,831
- I knew you wouldn'<i>t</i> come.
- I'm leaving.

371
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:07,750
- Bye!
- No, no, no.

372
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,670
Wait. It's important.

373
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:13,047
Please.

374
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:15,466
Hear her out.

375
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:26,394
What's your name? Maritza?

376
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:35,486
What kind of trouble are you in?

377
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:38,531
Who are you in trouble with?

378
00:29:39,615 --> 00:29:41,659
- La Quica.
- La Quica.

379
00:29:42,702 --> 00:29:44,745
You know La Quica?

380
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:50,334
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

381
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:52,712
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

382
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:56,674
Why does he want to kill you?

383
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:01,554
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

384
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:11,772
And how are you going to do that?

385
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:16,110
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

386
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,702
(In English)
Her name is Maritza Rincón.

387
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:27,955
She works across from the brothel
where the girls were killed.

388
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,666
Where we almost had La Quica
and the other guy...

389
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:34,045
Jhon Burgos. Goes by "Limón."

390
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,215
He used to drive the girls around until
La Quica made him Escobar's chauffeur.

391
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:42,053
This girl Maritza was actually
in the back seat serving as a cover

392
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:44,055
while Escobar was in the fucking trunk.

393
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,224
- And he knows her how?
- They grew up together here.

394
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,810
(Carrillo scoffs)

395
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:54,023
So this guy Limón,
there's no record of him.

396
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:56,942
There's no known connection
between him and Escobar,

397
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,986
yet somehow he ends up the driver.

398
00:30:59,111 --> 00:31:02,281
Makes sense to hire someone
the police didn'<i>t</i> know about.

399
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:04,658
What does she want?
A ticket to Disneyland?

400
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:07,745
She knows she doesn'<i>t</i> get shit
if it doesn'<i>t</i> pan out.

401
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:12,708
(In Spanish) She can tell us when
Limón and Escobar go somewhere.

402
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,964
(In English)
You were there. You trust her?

403
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,135
Yeah.

404
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:25,513
Yeah, I do.

405
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:35,856
When we get the location, I want
Centra Spike up in the air to confirm.

406
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:38,401
(In Spanish) Let's go.

407
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:44,281
- (In English) All right. This is good.
- Let's go.

408
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,705
(In Spanish)
Can you explain this?

409
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:56,877
A subpoena.

410
00:31:57,002 --> 00:32:00,965
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

411
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,135
You mean your witch-hunt.

412
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:08,848
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

413
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:13,519
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

414
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:18,274
How many times do I have to tell you
that I don'<i>t</i> know how Escobar escaped?

415
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,569
He must have paid someone off.

416
00:32:21,694 --> 00:32:25,656
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

417
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:33,122
This is about transparency.
The truth. The law.

418
00:32:33,873 --> 00:32:38,669
And I sense
from your reluctance to speak

419
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:43,591
that the truth will not be kind to you
or to our dear president.

420
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:51,682
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

421
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:55,394
I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

422
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,731
but we're talking about a national crisis.

423
00:32:58,856 --> 00:33:05,279
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

424
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:06,447
(Sighs)

425
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:11,118
Look, sir... (Clears throat)
I ask you to please trust me.

426
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:16,457
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

427
00:33:16,582 --> 00:33:19,460
is destroying the life
of a very good human being.

428
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:21,295
Our president.

429
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:27,176
Well, let's hope it doesn'<i>t</i> come to <i>that.</i>

430
00:33:28,928 --> 00:33:30,971
(Resumes typing)

431
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:34,141
(Phone rings)

432
00:33:41,774 --> 00:33:44,568
- Hello?
- (Softly) Hello, Maritza. It's me.

433
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:48,948
- I spoke with Peña.
- Pay attention.

434
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:53,494
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant in the south.

435
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:58,499
I need you to give the gringos
the address.

436
00:33:58,624 --> 00:33:59,833
Understand?

437
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:04,129
Are we really turning in Pablo Escobar?

438
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:07,174
Yes, Maritza.

439
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:10,135
We're going to do this together.

440
00:34:10,803 --> 00:34:13,138
But I need you to trust me.

441
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:16,892
Give me the address.

442
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:19,144
Write it down.

443
00:34:20,229 --> 00:34:24,024
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

444
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:28,904
Got <i>it.</i>

445
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,002
...my love. Do it again.

446
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:44,628
(Laughing)

447
00:34:45,546 --> 00:34:48,048
I'm sorry, boss.
It's getting late.

448
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,175
Thank you, Limón.
A kiss.

449
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:54,638
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and... (Grunts)

450
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:08,587
Everything all right, boss?

451
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:25,688
- (Phone rings)
- Peña.

452
00:36:26,563 --> 00:36:30,317
9th Street. 98-3.

453
00:36:30,442 --> 00:36:32,611
OK. Got <i>it.</i>

454
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:38,992
(In English) I need to know
if there's activity around this address.

455
00:36:39,118 --> 00:36:41,745
You get a match on a voice,
you find me immediately.

456
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,163
You got <i>it.</i>

457
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:04,059
(Distorted Spanish voices over tape)

458
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:07,396
- This was recorded five minutes ago.
- You can barely hear it.

459
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:08,564
Let me clean it up.

460
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:16,655
(Pablo speaks Spanish)
'Now turn off the satellite phones.'

461
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,449
- That's Pablo.
- We have to move now.

462
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:21,160
- Yeah.
- (Messina) You two are staying here.

463
00:37:21,285 --> 00:37:22,661
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

464
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:25,539
If Crosby finds out you went
on another raid, we all go home.

465
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:28,208
Crosby doesn'<i>t</i> have to know shit.

466
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,668
It's not negotiable.

467
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:35,382
We'll be in radio contact.

468
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,219
Jesus.

469
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,192
(In Spanish) We'll be there
in 20 minutes. So be on alert.

470
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:54,651
Yes, Colonel.

471
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:57,988
(Man)
Attention! We're headed out!

472
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:14,463
(Indistinct chatter over radios)

473
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,310
(In Spanish)
We're on San Juan.

474
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:31,063
(In English)
Copy <i>that.</i> Watch your six, guys.

475
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:33,690
'How's it looking out there?'

476
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:35,442
(In Spanish) 'Everything's calm.

477
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:38,362
'Murphy, you're buying
the drinks tonight.

478
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:39,738
(Chuckles)

479
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:41,281
(In English)
Cheap bastards.

480
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:45,077
<i>Don't forget to pick me and Peña up
some cigars on the way.</i>

481
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:47,329
(In Spanish) Sure, blondie.

482
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:55,254
(Indistinct shouting over radio)

483
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:02,761
Reverse!

484
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:05,305
(Man shouts in Spanish) Look above!

485
00:39:07,307 --> 00:39:08,475
It's an ambush!

486
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:12,813
(Indistinct shouts)

487
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:13,981
Sabada!

488
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:17,234
(In Spanish) Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! You copy?

489
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,111
(Rapid fire and shouting)

490
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:20,612
(Men yelling)

491
00:39:22,948 --> 00:39:24,408
Son of a bitch!

492
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:27,119
(In English) Goddamn it, speak to me!
We need people.

493
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:28,662
Carrillo!

494
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:31,248
(Grunts)

495
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:33,500
(Man, in Spanish)
Go, go, go! Come on!

496
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,468
(Rapid fire)

497
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,014
Fuck!

498
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,093
(In Spanish) Look at me.

499
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:30,974
Look at me!

500
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:47,240
You asked a child to give me this.

501
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:01,838
You can have it back.

502
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:09,471
And this...

503
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,934
is for my cousin, Gustavo.

504
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:17,604
(Whispers) Coward.

505
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:19,231
Son of a bitch.

506
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:33,078
(Sirens wailing in distance)

507
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:34,556
Don'<i>t</i> worry. It's going to heal well.

508
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:40,479
(In English) I'll go back to Bogotá
with the body until the funeral.

509
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:44,024
They called his wife?

510
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:46,193
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.

511
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:51,573
This ain'<i>t</i> on you, Javi. It's on Escobar.

512
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:54,034
And one way or another, he pays.

513
00:42:55,786 --> 00:42:58,830
We all do. Right?

514
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,559
(Ambulance siren wailing)

515
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:33,406
(Knocking at door)

516
00:43:49,214 --> 00:43:51,341
This isn'<i>t</i> your fault, Peña.

517
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:53,760
- No?
- No.

518
00:43:59,057 --> 00:44:02,102
- I got played.
- We all got played.

519
00:44:02,227 --> 00:44:05,105
We all had the information,
it was backed up by Centra Spike...

520
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,731
Stop.

521
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:10,360
(Whispers) Just...

522
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:15,740
You know, you come in here...

523
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:20,495
you say all the right things.

524
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,877
Doesn'<i>t</i> make a damn bit of difference.

525
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:36,636
Colonel Carrillo's funeral
will be tomorrow.

526
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:40,473
(Door closes)

527
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:42,642
I don't do funerals.

528
00:44:44,811 --> 00:44:48,690
(♪ Mellow Latin guitar music)

529
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:08,311
(In Spanish) They say
Pablo himself killed Carrillo.

530
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:10,397
Next, he'll come after the <i>two</i> of you.

531
00:46:12,357 --> 00:46:15,986
Or me, or you, Pacho.

532
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:19,072
No, no. We need another plan
right now.

533
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:22,492
Another approach.
Another way of doing things.

534
00:46:24,286 --> 00:46:27,747
Pacho, we need to call the Castaños.

535
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:32,669
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

536
00:46:39,718 --> 00:46:42,304
(Rain pattering)

537
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:43,722
(Approaching footsteps)

538
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:48,810
(Thunder rumbles)

539
00:47:03,992 --> 00:47:06,369
Carrillo hasn'<i>t</i> been buried yet...

540
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,914
and they're already asking for my head.

541
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:14,127
They want a scapegoat.

542
00:47:15,628 --> 00:47:17,714
And we have to give them one.

543
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:24,012
(Sighs)

544
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:30,435
We're going to say you were
poorly advised by your vice minister.

545
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:36,858
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

546
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:38,443
We're going to say

547
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:41,988
I acted alone and without authorisation
when I entered La Catedral.

548
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:47,911
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

549
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:57,253
I don'<i>t</i> accept your resignation.

550
00:47:57,379 --> 00:48:01,424
Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

551
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:04,052
We have to do it, César.

552
00:48:05,512 --> 00:48:10,767
You know <i>it.</i> The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

553
00:48:10,892 --> 00:48:13,853
everyone's looking for someone
to blame. All of them.

554
00:48:14,813 --> 00:48:16,481
And it's not going to be you.

555
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:28,159
It's been my honour serving you
and the people of Colombia.

556
00:48:45,176 --> 00:48:46,886
Good luck.

557
00:48:58,064 --> 00:49:00,442
(Bell tolling)

558
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,543
Limón told me you have a daughter.

559
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:05,632
How old?

560
00:50:09,344 --> 00:50:12,347
- Two.
- And what's her name?

561
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:18,186
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

562
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,446
This is the second time
that I'm indebted to you.

563
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:35,912
Now, Maritza...

564
00:50:36,996 --> 00:50:39,666
our daughters will be safe.

565
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:42,544
Thank you.

566
00:50:44,629 --> 00:50:46,589
Know <i>that...</i>

567
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:49,467
I'm your friend.

568
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,901
What did you do?

569
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:11,197
I took care of <i>it.</i>

570
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:13,992
You're safe now.

571
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:15,577
(La Quica) Limón.

572
00:52:12,383 --> 00:52:13,843
Hey.

573
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:17,764
What are you doing here?

574
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:24,103
Where's Olivia?

575
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:27,190
She's at home. With my sister.

576
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,452
Hey, you OK?

577
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,462
- (Whimpers)
- Hey.

578
00:52:56,052 --> 00:52:57,595
(Sobs quietly)

579
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:19,659
(In Spanish) What now?

580
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:21,494
What the fuck do you want?

581
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:24,038
I want to help you.

582
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:27,583
Oh, yeah?

583
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:31,504
Come with me and I'll show you.

584
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,100
(Don Berna)
Make yourself at home.

585
