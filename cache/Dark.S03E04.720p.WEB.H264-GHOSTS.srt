1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:16,069
THE ORIGIN

2
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:04,879
We are attracted
to the dark like moths to the light.

3
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,295
The dark is what we are born out of,
and so we return to it.

4
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:28,819
You've grown, Tronte.

5
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,110
Do I know you?

6
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:34,402
I knew your mother.

7
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:37,235
But that was long ago.

8
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,985
You take after her.

9
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,652
Your eyes.

10
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:49,736
Who are you?

11
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,735
I don't have a name.

12
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:58,319
I was never given one.

13
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:04,277
But back then it was me
who chose what to call you.

14
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,194
It belonged to your mother.

15
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,319
I think you should have it now.

16
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:53,444
I've got to go.

I don't know if you'll like it, but...

41
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:33,152
Can I put it on you?

42
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,444
You don't like it?

43
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,110
No, I...

44
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:51,485
I do. It's gorgeous.

45
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:53,694
I don't know.

46
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:56,754
I haven't felt like myself all week.

47
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:58,527
You look pale.

48
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,194
Maybe you should see a doctor.

49
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,402
Will you come back here?

50
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:07,277
I... I don't know yet. It's...

51
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:11,110
It might be best
for me to stay home tonight.

52
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:15,111
Katharina...

53
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:24,235
I'm glad you decided to stay here.

54
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:27,110
In Winden.

55
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,110
You're beautiful.

SENSATIONAL NUDE PHOTOS

62
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,235
Look at her expression.

63
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:14,694
Where did you get it?

64
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:20,819
- It was in my father's things.
- Ines, Claudia. We're already late.

65
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:24,610
My father says
you don't learn anything at school.

66
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,069
You learn from life.

67
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:30,735
Why don't they have these
with men in them?

68
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,735
- That's not fair, is it?
- You're crazy.

69
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,069
Ever seen one?

70
00:07:39,403 --> 00:07:41,712
- One that's not your father's?
- Ines!

71
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,485
Jana, come on.

72
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:52,444
What did it look like?

73
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:54,860
A little odd.

74
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:58,069
Like it wasn't a part of him.

75
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:01,569
Tronte?

76
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,402
I think he's kind of weird.

77
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,277
Has his mother returned?

78
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:22,777
It's strange, don't you think?
To just vanish like that.

79
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,277
POLICE

80
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:35,278
Doris.

81
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:38,735
What brings you here?

82
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:41,711
I wanted to talk.
And Kahnwald let me in here.

83
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:45,652
Where have you been?
I thought you left early to write reports.

84
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,819
It's, um...

85
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:52,985
Well...

86
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:56,069
There's something that came up.

87
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,819
Today...

88
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:04,235
I was washing clothes
and I found something.

89
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:12,444
Here. It was with her blouses.
I thought it could be important.

90
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,712
She said her husband was with the church.

91
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:36,004
And maybe it's just a coincidence,

92
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,402
but the minister who disappeared
at the same time...

93
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,254
his name is Hanno Tauber.

94
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:43,485
H.T.

95
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,170
WINDEN WELCOMES ITS NEW MINISTER
HANNO TAUBER FROM VECHTA

96
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,194
I...

97
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:53,444
I thought her husband was dead.

98
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,694
It's three months now.

99
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:00,277
You don't just leave your child alone
without saying a word.

100
00:10:06,153 --> 00:10:08,712
You should go home. We'll take care of it.

101
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:11,420
Egon, I know something's going on here!

102
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,110
Why would she have left all this behind?

103
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:20,004
Who knows what goes on
inside a woman's head.

104
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:30,860
Doris!

105
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:41,254
MISSING SINCE JUNE 26, 1954
MRS. AGNES NIELSEN

106
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,569
Agnes, you have chosen the correct side.

107
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:01,527
Don't forget that.

108
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:13,004
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN WOODS

109
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:15,069
You must give this to Claudia.

110
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:18,485
When it's time.

111
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:30,110
To live is a gift.

112
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:34,444
For those who know how to use it.

113
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:39,319
You'll tell Martha then?

114
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,402
What the origin really is?

115
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,735
After all these years I've wondered...

116
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:26,819
why you abandoned us in 1888.

117
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,027
Why you gave us
the material to create it...

118
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,444
and then just disappeared.

119
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,462
Who would've thought 33 years later

120
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:54,902
it would be us who gave you the order.

121
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:57,444
Magnus.

122
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,277
I'm so sorry.

123
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,319
It doesn't matter anymore.

124
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,444
Adam is waiting for us.

125
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:30,610
This is your future.

126
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:35,569
Thirty-three years from your yesterday.

127
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,235
That door in the cave...

128
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,485
What is that?

129
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:54,819
It is a path
that connects past and future.

130
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,402
Why are these names crossed out?

131
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:12,527
It means that they will die.

132
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:14,902
All of them.

133
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:19,069
- "All". What does that mean?
- In two days.

134
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,402
The apocalypse in his world.

135
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,527
It also happens in ours.

136
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:27,277
This is not real.

137
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:35,694
You're not real.

138
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,652
This is your future.

139
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:43,277
If you...

140
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:47,027
If you both fail to stop the apocalypse.

141
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:58,985
You came recently to Winden?

142
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:02,944
Three months ago. I like it here.

143
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,610
It's less complicated
than where I come from.

144
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:10,652
Well, that may be about to change.

145
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:13,319
You're pregnant.

146
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:19,504
At your age,
a pregnancy is not without its risks.

147
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,920
You should take care of yourself.
No strenuous activity.

148
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:33,444
That can't be right.

149
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:39,944
Listen.

150
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:45,110
Some gifts
come into our lives unexpectedly.

151
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:51,110
And yet they're still gifts.

152
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:25,236
Mrs. Doppler.

153
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,027
How can I help you?

154
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:40,027
I would like to know
if any news has come in.

155
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,069
Sadly...

156
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:45,110
Sadly, no.

157
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:50,920
Unless Helge decides
to tell us where he was...

158
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:51,944
That is...

159
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,902
who he was with,

160
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:57,504
we're not going to get anywhere with this.

161
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,610
This isn't about Helge.

162
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:04,569
This is about the missing minister.

163
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,609
If nobody looks after the church...

164
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:14,359
it leaves the door open for the devil.

165
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:18,234
You knew the man?

166
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:21,234
The minister?

167
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:26,569
Did he...

168
00:17:30,486 --> 00:17:33,902
Have you ever seen him
in the company of a woman?

169
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:38,485
How dare you ask that.

170
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:43,652
I want you to find the man.

171
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:46,319
Hanno Tauber.

172
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:24,652
Sorry to disturb you.

173
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:31,235
Are you the new minister?

174
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,360
I used to be.

175
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:36,110
But that was long ago.

176
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:42,527
The thing is, I'm looking for someone.

177
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:45,860
Um... My husband and I are...

178
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:50,027
Our daughter is very talented.
Last winter, we sublet the guest room.

179
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:53,920
So we could save up money for Claudia,
for when she goes to college.

180
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:58,444
The lady who lived with us...
Well, she vanished, three months ago.

181
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:01,569
Her husband was a man of God.

182
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,587
She said her husband was dead,

183
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,879
but, I don't know why,
I just felt like that wasn't true.

184
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:14,069
And the man who worked here
vanished at the same time, so...

185
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,652
What if he was her husband,

186
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:19,235
and she went back to him?

187
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:22,527
I don't think she liked him very much.

188
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,235
Not all human bonds

189
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:28,360
are the result of fondness.

190
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:34,402
Well, it's about the child.
It's her boy, and...

191
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:36,444
I think a boy needs his mother.

192
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:40,944
Each lie we tell

193
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:45,337
comes at a cost to the human soul.

194
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,485
I don't understand.

195
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:51,694
You're not interested in the boy.

196
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:54,402
You're interested in the woman.

197
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:00,212
I don't think you understood what I...

198
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:03,235
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

199
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:11,110
It wants what it wants.

200
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:15,902
Just ask your husband.

201
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:18,402
He'll tell you the same thing.

202
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,610
My husband?

203
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:28,277
Haven't you asked yourself
why he's been leaving the house so early?

204
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:32,319
And working so late?

205
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,360
What if there's another woman there?

206
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:50,027
It's difficult for us to let go...

207
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:56,819
of our deepest desires, inside.

208
00:21:58,569 --> 00:21:59,610
Hello, Tronte.

209
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:04,569
Hello.

210
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:22,235
What's that?

211
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:24,319
It's wonderful.

212
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,152
Why weren't you at school today?

213
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,610
What are you doing here?

214
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:45,819
I like it here.

215
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:48,110
It's so...

216
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:50,027
desolate.

217
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,152
I like to write, you know?

218
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:02,778
Stories.

219
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:09,444
You have a nice smile.

220
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:22,027
POLICE

221
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,444
Why are you here?

222
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:45,860
You can't just show up here.

223
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:49,152
What if someone sees you?

224
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:54,735
Is everything all right?

225
00:23:58,569 --> 00:23:59,985
I'm pregnant.

226
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,485
I thought you were taking precautions.

227
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:43,277
Is it mine?

228
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,110
Is it yours?

229
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:02,485
What do you think I do all day long?
Fuck around?

230
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:05,254
Do you think it was me
who chose all of this?

231
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,360
Living in this shithole forever? Huh?

232
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:11,527
I thought you were different,
but you're all the same.

233
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:14,920
You all think you own the world.
That you can take what you want.

234
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:17,610
You eat and fuck
and think that you're God.

235
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:21,254
Wherever you go,
always the same smug fucking assholes.

236
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:23,152
You don't know what you're saying.

237
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:36,694
It's best if I drive you home now.

238
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:53,360
The coal industry
has him around its finger.

239
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:56,504
I don't care how long it takes!

240
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:59,004
We'll submit
another building permit request.

241
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:03,254
Nuclear power is the future.

242
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,652
And the future cannot be stopped.

243
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:09,610
I don't care what the mayor says!

244
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:16,194
Oh, Claudia.

245
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:22,027
Look at you.

246
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:25,277
All grown up, aren't you?

247
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:27,902
A real lady now.

248
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:31,694
Pretty. Smart as a whip.

249
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:34,485
Helge will be pleased to see you.

250
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:41,860
And naturally,
you'll be rewarded for your services.

251
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,944
That's too much to offer.

252
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:53,444
I've some advice for you, Claudia.
A lesson.

253
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:57,652
If you really want something,
then you must take it.

254
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:01,902
Things will never happen on their own.

255
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:04,860
Thank you.

256
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:17,694
NUCLEAR POWER AND PEACE

257
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:24,652
TOWN HALL

258
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,569
Is Heinz sick, or...?

259
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:57,110
What's all this?

260
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,962
What exactly
is the coal industry paying you

261
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,694
to block the plans for the nuclear plant?

262
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:25,027
I have no idea what you're saying.

263
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:28,444
Did Doppler send you?

264
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:32,902
Do you know what gold cannot get you?

265
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:35,194
The future.

266
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:39,569
More precisely, your future.

267
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,694
We think we're all immortal,

268
00:28:44,528 --> 00:28:47,485
but in reality
there's often only one heartbeat...

269
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,027
separating us from the hereafter.

270
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,569
What do you want from me?

271
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:09,652
WINDEN BUILDING AUTHORITY

272
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:13,194
BUILDING PERMIT

273
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:16,110
The building permit
for the nuclear plant. This is...

274
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:24,902
To the future.

275
00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:32,277
You can change it.
You both can change it.

276
00:29:32,444 --> 00:29:36,045
The barrels at the nuclear plant,
they start the apocalypse.

277
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,652
You must prevent them from being opened.

278
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,110
What do we do then?

279
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:45,920
Eve said there's a way to undo this knot.

280
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:49,152
That there's a way to let Martha live.
That's my Martha!

281
00:29:52,778 --> 00:29:54,152
She lied to you.

282
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,652
There is no way to save both worlds.

283
00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:02,652
You must choose one of them.

284
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,985
The apocalypse, in two days...

285
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:10,152
it can get stopped here.

286
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:13,694
You both have to stop it.

287
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:16,610
They can live. All of them.

288
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:18,277
Mikkel...

289
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:20,069
can live.

290
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,527
Isn't that what you wanted?

291
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:26,819
But you'll have to let her go.

292
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:29,360
Your Martha.

293
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:31,444
Your world.

294
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:34,944
You've seen what becomes of you there.

295
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:36,944
What you'll do there.

296
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:39,985
What Adam will do.

297
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:45,194
You've both lost it.

298
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:48,629
I'll go to the house and wake up in my bed

299
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:50,985
and realize this was just a shitty dream.

300
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:57,277
Jonas, this is exactly what you wanted.

301
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:59,027
You and Martha.

302
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:02,402
In this world the two of you can work.

303
00:31:13,194 --> 00:31:14,194
Martha!

304
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:20,985
Wait!

305
00:31:24,528 --> 00:31:25,569
Hey.

306
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:28,277
Hey.

307
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:40,902
You believe all of this?

308
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:43,902
That they're all doomed?

309
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:00,610
That's crazy.

310
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:04,444
I'm crazy. That's...

311
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:22,902
Trust me,
I know exactly what it feels like.

312
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,860
It's all true?

313
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:36,277
All the things that she said are real?

314
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,962
But I know there's a way.

315
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:48,444
A way to make all of this right again.

316
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,110
And I want to continue
looking for that way.

317
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:57,735
I think she does too.

318
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,819
The Martha who brought me here.

319
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:25,944
It's time.

320
00:34:17,028 --> 00:34:19,652
So you have no idea where your mom is?

321
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:23,652
And the man earlier today...

322
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:26,860
You think that could be your father?

323
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:29,652
My mother didn't talk much about him.

324
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,110
She had said...

325
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:34,235
he was just bad.

326
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:38,194
For a while I was in a home.

327
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,235
What's it like in a home?

328
00:34:54,028 --> 00:34:56,110
Can you keep a secret?

329
00:34:57,736 --> 00:35:00,402
That man, at the cave...

330
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:03,235
I don't even want to know
if he is my father.

331
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:05,819
And I'm glad that my mother is gone.

332
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:10,319
You can have it if you want.

333
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,652
Jana?

334
00:35:23,694 --> 00:35:25,360
What are you doing here?

335
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,319
Didn't you go home hours ago?

336
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:39,152
We're already late.
Mom will be waiting with dinner.

337
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:45,027
See you around.

338
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:47,402
Maybe tomorrow.

339
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:05,819
What do we do now?

340
00:36:18,194 --> 00:36:19,277
Don't worry.

341
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:20,985
I won't keep it.

342
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:29,860
Why do some people get to have it all?

343
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,069
And others get nothing?

344
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:34,444
Hm?

345
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:38,962
Why does destiny preordain
so much for some and not for others?

346
00:36:56,528 --> 00:37:00,110
All my life, I've been trying
to hold onto things that I just can't.

347
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:04,277
But now I finally understand.

348
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:08,985
I need no one.

349
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:13,860
None of you.

350
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:21,819
I think you should go now.

351
00:37:44,778 --> 00:37:45,985
Last year...

352
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:53,485
Daniel told me about it.

353
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:57,277
She does it properly.

354
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:13,777
I'm sorry.

355
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:38,694
So they're on their way?

356
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:50,694
The beginning is the end.

357
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:54,360
And the end is the beginning.

358
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:58,069
We are all born of him.

359
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:01,485
You gave him his life.

360
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,694
And now he will give us ours.

361
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:08,069
Him.

362
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:10,069
Agnes.

363
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:11,527
Tronte.

364
00:40:12,153 --> 00:40:13,402
Jana.

365
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:14,902
Ulrich.

366
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,569
Katharina.

367
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:20,986
You.

368
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:26,819
A line with no start or end.

369
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:32,235
An unending circle.

370
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:55,485
Doris?

371
00:40:57,319 --> 00:40:58,569
Are you okay?

372
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:41,444
I...

373
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:43,402
I'm sorry for what I said.

374
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:46,944
For this morning.

375
00:41:50,236 --> 00:41:52,735
I know you just wanted to help out.

376
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:00,652
Lately, I've...

377
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:07,027
I'm not sure I've been myself.

378
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:09,777
This job and...

379
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:15,444
Well, I'm sorry.

380
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:22,277
I know what you've done.

381
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:26,527
With that girl.

382
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:30,652
What do you mean?

383
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:35,360
I want a divorce.

384
00:42:37,528 --> 00:42:40,319
What... What are you saying right now?

385
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:47,944
We should have done it earlier, really,
but I...

386
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:49,819
I thought...

387
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,902
I don't know what I thought, I...

388
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:57,194
All the secrets we have, it's...

389
00:42:59,153 --> 00:43:00,610
not how I want to live.

390
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:03,528
I...

391
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,944
I can explain it.

392
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:12,860
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

393
00:43:14,736 --> 00:43:16,235
It wants what it wants.

394
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:41,985
Hello.

395
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:46,527
I... I'm here to see Mrs. Obendorf.

396
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:07,110
You must wait.

397
00:44:27,528 --> 00:44:29,235
My mother says...

398
00:44:30,903 --> 00:44:32,569
they'll be in hell.

399
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:36,194
The ones...

400
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:38,360
that are gotten rid of.

401
00:44:39,194 --> 00:44:40,610
I don't believe in hell.

402
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:45,694
Hell's what we make for ourselves here.

403
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:53,069
I'm Helene.

404
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:57,235
Helene Albers.

405
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:12,610
Katharina.

406
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:16,985
That's such a nice name.

407
00:45:22,778 --> 00:45:24,902
Saint Christopher.

408
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:31,027
That's a good thought.

409
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:35,110
Someone carrying us on our journey.

410
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,777
Someone to watch over us.

411
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:46,610
All right, come.

412
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:01,360
Hello, Dad.

413
00:47:10,653 --> 00:47:12,652
Where's Mom?

414
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:22,402
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

415
00:47:28,903 --> 00:47:30,444
It wants what it wants.

416
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:43,944
Come on.

417
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:46,152
Let him be.

418
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:04,527
WINDEN BUILDING AUTHORITY

419
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:10,777
BUILDING PERMIT

420
00:48:55,278 --> 00:48:56,819
You made a promise.

421
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:03,402
I've kept up my end of the deal.

422
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,735
Now you have to keep up yours.

423
00:49:15,944 --> 00:49:20,277
You want to know where the origin is
and how you might destroy it.

424
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:27,485
You will do it.

425
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,777
It was 66 years
before I finally understood...

426
00:49:35,944 --> 00:49:38,860
how everything we know is bound together.

427
00:49:50,778 --> 00:49:51,944
You're right.

428
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:55,360
It's time you understood, too.

429
00:50:40,986 --> 00:50:42,235
At school...

430
00:50:46,028 --> 00:50:47,985
At the door when you came in...

431
00:50:49,694 --> 00:50:51,027
I got this feeling.

432
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:56,485
It was as if we knew each other.

433
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:05,277
From a dream.

434
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:07,735
Or...

435
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,527
I am sorry.

436
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,152
For everything.

437
00:51:28,361 --> 00:51:29,819
In your world...

438
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:34,860
What was I like there?

439
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,319
Was I different?

440
00:53:31,944 --> 00:53:34,795

Why are we here?

479
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:33,694
Because this...

480
00:57:34,194 --> 00:57:36,610
is where everything began.

481
00:57:38,736 --> 00:57:39,860
In your world.

482
00:57:40,903 --> 00:57:42,319
What are you saying?

483
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,545
Your older self,

484
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:58,152
she sent you and Jonas back

485
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:00,610
for a single purpose.

486
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:15,902
You were never supposed to stop
the apocalypse.

487
00:58:17,986 --> 00:58:21,277
You were to create the seed.

488
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:39,402
This is the origin.

489
00:58:42,403 --> 00:58:44,235
What's going on inside you

490
00:58:44,486 --> 00:58:46,504
is the bridge between both worlds.

491
00:58:46,528 --> 00:58:48,319
No, you're wrong.

492
00:58:48,903 --> 00:58:52,212
It is the beginning of the knot.

493
00:58:52,236 --> 00:58:54,360
And eventually also its end.

494
00:58:58,778 --> 00:59:00,360
Your son.

495
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:04,194
He is the origin.
