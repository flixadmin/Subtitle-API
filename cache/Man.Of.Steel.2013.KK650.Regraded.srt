1
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,020
Hurry!

2
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,970
Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.

3
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,540
We may only have a matter
of weeks. I warned you.

4
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,300
Harvesting the core was
suicide. It has accelerated...

5
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,280
- the process of implosion.
- Our energy reserves...

6
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,890
were exhausted. What
would you have us do, El?

7
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,560
Look to the stars,
like our ancestors did.

8
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,690
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.

9
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,660
Are you seriously suggesting
that we evacuate the entire planet?

10
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,340
No. Everybody
here is already dead.

11
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,700
Give me control of the Codex. I
will ensure the survival of our race.

12
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,730
There is still hope.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
I have held that
hope in my hands.

14
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,560
This council has been disbanded.

15
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,900
On whose authority?

16
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,390
Mine.

17
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,440
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

18
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,210
- What are you doing, Zod? This is madness.
- What I should have done...

19
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,910
years ago.

20
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,200
These lawmakers...

21
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,720
with their endless debates...

22
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,930
have lead Krypton to ruin.

23
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,950
And if your forces prevail...

24
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,850
- you'll be the leader of nothing.
- Then join me.

25
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,190
Help me save our
race. We'll start anew.

26
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,450
We'll sever...

27
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,460
the degenerative bloodlines
that led us to this state.

28
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,970
And who will decide which
bloodlines survive, Zod?

29
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,530
You?

30
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,600
Don't do this, El.

31
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,310
The last thing I want
is for us to be enemies.

32
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,210
You have abandoned the
principles that bound us together.

33
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,560
You've taken up the sword...

34
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,910
against your own people.

35
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,390
I will honor the man
you once were, Zod...

36
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,790
not this monster you've become.

37
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,430
Take him away.

38
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,930
Sir? Is everything all right?

39
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,470
Out of the way.

40
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,330
I said...

41
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,850
Get me Lara.

42
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,350
Jor. Behind you.

43
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,260
Lara, you have to
ready the launch.

44
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,160
I'll be with you
as soon as I can.

45
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,140
H'Raka!

46
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,990
Hyah!

47
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,320
- Can you see the Codex?
- It's just beneath the central hub.

48
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,750
But I'm compelled to warn you.

49
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,230
Breaching the genesis
chamber is a Class-B crime...

50
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,060
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.

51
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,900
Jar-El, by the authority
of General Zed...

52
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,000
surrender the Codex.

53
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,610
Unh!

54
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,340
Ahh!

55
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,540
Easy, H'Raka.

56
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,740
Did you find a world?

57
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,640
- We have.
- Orbiting a main sequence yellow star...

58
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,180
Just as you said it would.

59
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,480
A young star.

60
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,510
His cells will
drink its radiation.

61
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,890
It's a seemingly
intelligent population.

62
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,880
He'll be an outcast.

63
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,330
A freak.

64
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,550
They'll kill him.

65
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,030
How?

66
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,100
He'll be a God to them.

67
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,570
What if the ship
doesn't make it?

68
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,530
He'll die out there...

69
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,270
alone.

70
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,840
I can't do it.

71
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,450
I thought I could, but...

72
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,450
- Lara.
- now that he's here...

73
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,610
Krypton is doomed.

74
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,690
It's his only chance now.

75
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,950
It's our people's only hope.

76
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,620
What is it, Kelex?

77
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,860
Five attack ships
converging from the east.

78
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,430
Citadel's defenses are
being scanned and evaluated.

79
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,690
I'll upload the Codex.

80
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,770
No, wait.

81
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,390
Lara.

82
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,370
Just let me look at him.

83
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,270
We'll never get to see him walk.

84
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,620
Never hear him say our names.

85
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,460
But out there...

86
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,620
amongst the stars...

87
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,490
he will live.

88
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,850
Goodbye, my son.

89
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,720
Our hopes and
dreams travel with you.

90
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,230
Concentrate fire
on the main doors.

91
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,570
Lady Lara.

92
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,850
- The phantom drives are coming online.
- Proceed to ignition.

93
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,610
General.

94
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,260
We have identified an engine
ignition within the citadel.

95
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,630
A launch.

96
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,200
Hold this platform, commander.

97
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,550
I know you stole
the Codex, Jor-El.

98
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Surrender it...

99
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
and I'll let you live.

100
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,110
This is a second
chance for all of Krypton...

101
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,720
not just the bloodlines
you deem worthy.

102
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,420
What have you done?

103
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,960
We've had a child, Zod.

104
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,330
A boy child.

105
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,590
Krypton's first natural
birth in centuries.

106
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,260
And he will be free.

107
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,240
Free to forge his own destiny.

108
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,580
Heresy.

109
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,470
Destroy it.

110
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,180
Ah!

111
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,620
Lara...

112
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,170
listen to me.

113
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,030
The Codex is Krypton's future.

114
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,740
Abort the launch.

115
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,690
No!

116
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,890
Your son, Lara...

117
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,090
where have you sent him?

118
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,360
His name...

119
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,690
is Kal...

120
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,200
son of El.

121
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,640
And he's beyond your reach.

122
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,780
Bring that ship down.

123
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,500
Target locked.

124
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,680
Lay down your weapons.

125
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,010
Your forces are surrounded.

126
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,590
General Zod...

127
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,590
for the crimes of murder
and high treason...

128
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,030
the Council has sentenced
you and your fellow insurgents...

129
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,660
to three hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

130
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,970
Do you have any last words?

131
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,350
You won't kill us yourself!

132
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,840
You wouldn't sully your
hands! But you'll damn us...

133
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,280
to a black hole for eternity!

134
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,380
Jor-El was right.

135
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,320
You're a pack of fools,
every last one of you.

136
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,390
And you.

137
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,560
You believe your son is safe?

138
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,990
I will find him.

139
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,530
I will reclaim what
you have taken from us.

140
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,530
I will find him.

141
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,840
I will find him, Lara.

142
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,470
I will find him!

143
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,060
Argh!

144
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,810
Lady Lara, shouldn't
you find refuge?

145
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,590
There is no refuge, Kelor.

146
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,490
Jor-El was right.

147
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,330
This is the end.

148
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,280
Make a better
world than ours, Kal.

149
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,570

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

150
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,930
Watch it, dumb-ass!

151
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,700
Keep your eyes open or
you're gonna get squashed.

152
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,150
Where the hell did they
find you, greenhorn?

153
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,880
Let's get this trap in the air.

154
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,640
Gentlemen, secure the deck.

155
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,910
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

156
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,450
Secure the deck.

157
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,720
All civilian boats, stand clear.

158
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,620
The sub-sea valves failed
and the rig is about to explode.

159
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,230
Roger, Coast Guard. What
about the men left inside?

160
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,800
- Forget them. They're dead.
- Greenhorn...

161
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,100
fetch me my binoculars.

162
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,970
Greenhorn.

163
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,840
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't
know how much longer we can hold out.

164
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,930
This is Coast Guard 6510. We'll
make one more pass then get out.

165
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,860
Wait, wait. I got some
guys on the helipad.

166
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,130
Right here!

167
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,140
Come on, come
on! Let's go! Let's go!

168
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,140
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

169
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,850
Get that last guy loaded.

170
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,490
We have got to go.

171
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,390
Hey, let's go. What
are you doing?

172
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,630
Go! Go!

173
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,830
Argh!

174
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,010
Argh!

175
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,570
When Kansas became a territory?

176
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,770
Clark.

177
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,740
Are you listening, Clark?

178
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,860
I asked if you could
tell me who first...

179
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,110
settled Kansas.

180
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,530
Are you all right, Clark?

181
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,380
Clark.

182
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,910
Clark.

183
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Clark!

184
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,620
Clark, come out of there.

185
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,230
Leave me alone.

186
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,820
Clark, I have
called your mother.

187
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,230
Clark?

188
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,160
Ah!

189
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,330
I'm here.

190
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,570
Clark, honey, it's Mom.

191
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,000
Will you open the door?

192
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,250
- What's wrong with him?
- He's such a freak.

193
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,470
Crybaby.

194
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,020
His parents won't even
let him play with other kids.

195
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,270
I know.

196
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,510
Sweetie.

197
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,650
How can I help you
if you won't let me in?

198
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,260
The world's too big, Mom.

199
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,120
Then make it small.

200
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,760
Just, um...

201
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,690
focus on my voice.

202
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,210
Pretend it's an island...

203
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,270
out in the ocean.

204
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,110
Can you see it?

205
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,840
I see it.

206
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,170
Then swim towards it, honey.

207
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,300
What's wrong with me, Mom?

208
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,390
Clark.

209
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,160
Clark.

210
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,700
- Did you get everything I need?
- Yep.

211
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,600
Hold it, hold it.

212
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,980
Hey, ass-wipe.

213
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,220
What do you think?
You see the game?

214
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,950
- Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?

215
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,890
I wanna hear what he has to say.

216
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,930
Come on...

217
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
dick-splash.

218
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
My son was there.

219
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,270
He was in the bus.

220
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,340
- He saw what Clark did.
- I know he did.

221
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,270
- I'm sure what he thought he saw was...
- Was an act of God, Jonathan.

222
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,710
This was providence.

223
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,510
I think you're blowing
it out of proportion.

224
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,020
No, I'm not. Lana saw it too.

225
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,250
And the Fordham boy.

226
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,720
This isn't the first time...

227
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,900
Clark's done
something like this.

228
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,080
I just wanted to help.

229
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,280
I know you did, but
we talked about this.

230
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,810
Right?

231
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,980
Right? We talked
about this. You have...

232
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,930
Clark, you have to keep
this side of yourself a secret.

233
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,260
What was I supposed
to do? Just let them die?

234
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,470
Maybe.

235
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,250
There's more at
stake here than just our

236
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,400
lives, Clark, or the
lives of those around us.

237
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,750
When the world...

238
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,680
When the world finds out what you can
do it's gonna change everything. Our...

239
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,510
Our beliefs, our notions of...

240
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,490
what it means to be
human. Everything.

241
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,520
You saw how Pete's
mom reacted, right?

242
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,990
She was scared, Clark.

243
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Why?

244
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,670
People are afraid of what
they don't understand.

245
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,930
Is she right?

246
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,810
Did God do this to me?

247
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,870
Tell me.

248
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,320
We found you in this.

249
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,230
We were sure the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep...

250
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,470
but no one ever came.

251
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,640
This was in that
chamber with you.

252
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,550
I took it to a metallurgist...

253
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,150
at Kansas State.

254
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,990
He said whatever it was
made from didn't even...

255
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,690
Didn't even exist
on the periodic table.

256
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,890
That's another way of saying...

257
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,330
that it's not from
this world, Clark.

258
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,700
And neither are you.

259
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,930
You're the answer, son.

260
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,580
You're the answer to "Are
we alone in the universe?"

261
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,180
I don't wanna be.

262
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,280
And I don't blame you, son.

263
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,580
It'd be a huge burden
for anyone to bear.

264
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,260
But you're not just anyone, Clark,
and I have to believe that you were...

265
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,260
That you were sent
here for a reason.

266
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,090
All these changes that you're
going through, one day...

267
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,650
One day you're gonna
think of them as a blessing.

268
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,700
When that day comes...

269
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,370
you have to make a choice.

270
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,600
A choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not.

271
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,040
Can't I just keep
pretending I'm your son?

272
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,650
You are my son.

273
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,110
But somewhere
out there you've...

274
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,050
You have another father too,
who gave you another name.

275
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
And he sent you here...

276
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,990
for a reason, Clark.

277
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,430
And even if it takes you the rest
of your life, you owe it to yourself...

278
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,800
to find out what that reason is.

279
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,850
Bound by wild desire

280
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,110
I fell into a ring of fire.

281
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,450
Wait a second. Aren't
you here fer the exercise?

282
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,350
No, there was a
change in the plans.

283
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,690
Somebody found something
strange on Ellesmere.

284
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,920
- Aircom's making runs out there all week.
- That rat hole?

285
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,260
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know. It's crazy.

286
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,200
The Americans are
there too, lots of them.

287
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,030
- Anything else?
- They're calling it an anomalous object.

288
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,540
- Whatever that means.
- Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.

289
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,610
- Oh, come on, Chrissy.
- Knock it off.

290
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,280
- Sit down.
- Let me go.

291
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,170
Hey. Leave her alone, man.

292
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,210
Or what, tough guy?

293
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,190
Or I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

294
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,450
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

295
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,950
Ooh.

296
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,070
Oh, there he is.

297
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,370
It's not worth it, sweetie.

298
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,890
Hey, asshole,
don't forget your tip.

299
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,860
Strike.

300
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,810
Thanks.

301
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,880
Hi.

302
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,810
Miss Lane. How you doing?

303
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,280
- Good.
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.

304
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,780
How far to the station?

305
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,320
- Camp's just over the rise.
- I'll walk you over. - Great.

306
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,790
Joe can take your bags. Joe.

307
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,290
Help her out.

308
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,060
Careful with those.
They're heavy.

309
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,130
I gotta confess, Miss Lane...

310
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,240
I'm not a fan of
the Daily Planet.

311
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,600
But those pieces you wrote when you
were embedded with the 1st Division were...

312
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,680
Well, they were
pretty impressive.

313
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,910
Well, what can I say? I get writer's
block if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.

314
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,610
Miss Lane.

315
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,490
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S.
Northcom. Dr. Emil Hamilton...

316
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,850
from DARPA.

317
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,290
- You're early.
- Hi.

318
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,000
We were expecting you tomorrow.

319
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,700
Which is why I showed up today.

320
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,530
Look, let's get one thing
straight, guys, okay?

321
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,640
The only reason I'm here is
because we're on Canadian soil...

322
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,310
and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

323
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,670
So if we're done
measuring dicks...

324
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,280
can you have your people
show me what you found?

325
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,480
NASA's EOS satellites...

326
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,480
pinged the anomaly first.

327
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,190
The ice shelf plays hell
on the echo soundings.

328
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,790
- But there's something there.
- A submarine, maybe?

329
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
Soviet-era?

330
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,650
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.

331
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,870
Considerably larger than anything
we know they built back then.

332
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,360
But here's the spooky part.

333
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,040
The ice surrounding
the object...

334
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,370
it's nearly twenty
thousand years old.

335
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,830
Miss Lane?

336
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,310
Try not to wander.

337
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,640
Temperatures drop to
minus 40 at night around here.

338
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,150
Wouldn't find your
body till after spring.

339
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,650
And there you go.

340
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,690
What if I need to tinkle?

341
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,020
There's a bucket in the corner.

342
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,390
Where the hell are you going?

343
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,100
Hello?

344
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,690
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's all right.

345
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,880
You're hemorrhaging
internally...

346
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,510
and if I don't
cauterize this bleed...

347
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,340
How can I?

348
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,140
I can do things that
other people can't.

349
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,280
Now hold my hand.

350
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,680
This is gonna hurt.

351
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,510
What Colonel Hardy
and his team surmised...

352
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,250
was a Soviet-era submarine...

353
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,960
was actually something
much more exotic.

354
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:39,060
An isotope analysis of the surrounding
ice bores suggests that an object...

355
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,130
had been trapped in the
glacier for over 18,000 years.

356
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,930
As for my rescuer?

357
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,570
He disappeared during
the object's departure.

358
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,370
A background check
revealed that his work history...

359
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,700
and identity had been falsified.

360
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,810
The questions raised
by my rescuer's...

361
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,910
existence are
frightening to contemplate.

362
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,770
But I also know what I saw.

363
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,280
And I have arrived at the
inescapable conclusion...

364
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,550
that the object
and its occupant...

365
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,720
did not originate on Earth.

366
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,760
I can't print this, Lois. You
might have hallucinated half of it.

367
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,150
What about the civilian
contractors who corroborated...

368
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,900
my story?

369
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,500
The Pentagon is denying
that there was a ship.

370
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,600
Of course they are.
They're supposed to.

371
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,330
It's the Pentagon.

372
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,270
Perry, it's me
we're talking about.

373
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,170
- I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.
- Then act like it.

374
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,570
- Print it or I walk.
- You can't.

375
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,840
You're under contract.

376
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,310
I'm not running a story about
aliens walking among us.

377
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,190
Never gonna happen.

378
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,830
That's a Scotch,
straight-up, for the lady.

379
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,360
I'm sending you the article.

380
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,110
My editor won't print it,
but if it leaked online...

381
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,640
Got it.

382
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,310
But didn't you once
describe my site...

383
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,340
as a creeping
cancer of falsehoods?

384
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,510
I stand by my words,
Woodburn, but I want this story...

385
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,940
- out there.
- Why?

386
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,320
Because I want my mystery
man to know I know the truth.

387
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,640
Recursive diagnostics complete.

388
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,670
Guiding presence authenticated.

389
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,470
All systems operational.

390
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,490
To see you standing there
having grown into an adult...

391
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,560
If only Lara could
have witnessed this.

392
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,890
Who are you?

393
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,870
I am your father, Kal.

394
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,100
Or at least a shadow of him.

395
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,340
His consciousness.

396
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,200
My name was Jor-El.

397
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,510
And Kal?

398
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,950
That's my name.

399
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,050
It is.

400
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,790
I have so many questions.

401
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,120
Where do I come from?

402
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,730
Why did you send me here?

403
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,440
You came from Krypton.

404
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,140
A world with a much harsher
environment than Earths.

405
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,580
Long ago...

406
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,050
in an era of expansion...

407
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,490
our race spread out
through the stars...

408
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,450
seeking new
worlds to settle upon.

409
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,090
This scout ship was one of
thousands launched into the void.

410
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,260
We built outposts
on other planets...

411
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,240
musing great machines to
reshape environments to our needs.

412
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:16,440
For 100,000 years, our
civilization flourished...

413
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,970
accomplishing wonders.

414
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,780
What happened?

415
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,850
Artificial population
control was established.

416
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,190
The outposts on space
exploration were abandoned.

417
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,360
We exhausted our
natural resources.

418
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,630
As a result, our planet's
core became unstable.

419
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,630
Eventually, our
military leader...

420
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,780
General Zod, attempted a coup.

421
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,880
But by then it was too late.

422
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,780
Your mother and I foresaw
the coming calamity...

423
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,820
and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

424
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,520
This is a genesis chamber.

425
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,520
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

426
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,500
Every child was designed to fulfill a
pare-determined role in our society...

427
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
as a worker...

428
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,970
a warrior, a leader and so on.

429
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,470
Your mother and I believed
Krypton lost something precious.

430
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,910
The element of
choice, of chance.

431
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,570
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something...

432
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,340
other than what society
had intended for him or her?

433
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,480
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

434
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,250
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

435
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,990
Krypton's first natural
birth in centuries.

436
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,760
That's why we risked
so much to save you.

437
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,330
Why didn't you come with me?

438
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,600
We couldn't, Kal.

439
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,660
No matter how much...

440
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,100
we wanted to.

441
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,600
No matter how much we loved you.

442
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,750
Your mother, Lara, and I...

443
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,110
were a product of the failures of
our world as much as Zod was...

444
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,050
tied to its fate.

445
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,350
- So I'm alone.
- No.

446
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,750
You're as much a child of
Earth now as you are of Krypton.

447
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,190
You can embody the
best of both worlds.

448
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,060
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

449
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:24,580
The people of Earth are
different from us, it's true.

450
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,740
But, ultimately, I believe
that's a good thing.

451
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,410
They won't necessarily make
the same mistakes we did.

452
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,620
Not if you guide them, Kal.

453
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,240
Not if you give them hope.

454
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,820
That's what this symbol means.

455
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,890
The symbol of the
house of El means hope.

456
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,620
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief...

457
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:51,800
in the potential of every
person to be a force for good.

458
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,960
That's what you can bring them.

459
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,990
Why am I so different from them?

460
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,750
Earth's sun is younger and
brighter than Krypton's was.

461
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,030
Your cells have
drunken its radiation...

462
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,300
strengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.

463
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,830
Earth's gravity is weaker, yet its
atmosphere is more nourishing.

464
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,140
You've grown stronger here
than I ever could have imagined.

465
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,970
The only way to
know how strong...

466
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,180
is to keep testing your limits.

467
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
Unh!

468
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,180
Uh... Oh.

469
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,080
Whoa!

470
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,430
You will give the people of
Earth an ideal to strive towards.

471
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,910
They'll race behind you.

472
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,550
They will stumble.

473
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:46,910
They will fall.

474
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,880
But in time...

475
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,050
they will join you
in the sun, Kal.

476
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,250
In time...

477
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,190
you will help them
accomplish wonders.

478
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,550
How do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks?

479
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,540
You start with the
urban legends...

480
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:30,150
- that have sprung up in his wake.
- That's Joe.

481
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,790
The friends of a friend...

482
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,010
- who have seen him.
- He worked here.

483
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,120
For some he was a guardian
angel. For others, a cipher...

484
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,120
a ghost who never quite fit in.

485
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,500
Well, I was saying we were...

486
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,960
coming towards the oil rig.

487
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,330
As you work your way back in
time, the stories form a pattern.

488
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,130
I'm looking for a Pete
Ross. Do you know him?

489
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,210
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road...

490
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,130
Pete Ross?

491
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,380
I'd like to talk to you about an
accident when you were younger.

492
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,140
A school bus that
went into the river.

493
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,750
Dusty. Shh-shh-shh.

494
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,990
Mrs. Kent?

495
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,860
I'm Lois Lane. I'm
from the Daily Planet.

496
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,920
Quiet.

497
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,730
I'm from the Daily Planet and I'd
like to talk to you about your son.

498
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,850
I figured if I turned over enough
stones you'd eventually find me.

499
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,460
Where are you from?
What are you doing here?

500
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,070
Let me tell your story.

501
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,430
What if I don't
want my story told?

502
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,470
It's going to come
out eventually.

503
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,770
Somebody's going to get a
photograph or figure out where you live.

504
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,980
- Then I'll disappear again.
- The only way you could disappear...

505
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,240
is to stop helping people altogether,
and I sense that's not an option for you.

506
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:18,420
My father believed that if the
world found out who I really was...

507
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,420
they'd reject me...

508
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,790
out of fear.

509
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,900
I'm tired of safe.

510
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,230
I just wanna do something
useful with my life.

511
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,070
So farming, feeding
people. That's not useful?

512
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,300
I didn't say that.

513
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,500
Our family's been farming
for five generations.

514
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,680
Your family, not mine.

515
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,920
I don't even know why I'm
listening to you. You're not my dad.

516
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,750
You're just some guy
who found me in a field.

517
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,950
Clark.

518
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:48,990
It's all right, Martha.

519
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,920
He's right. Clark has a point.

520
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,520
We're not your parents.

521
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,330
But we've been
doing the best we can.

522
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,970
And we've been making this
up as we go along, so maybe...

523
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,610
Maybe our best isn't
good enough anymore.

524
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,670
Look, Dad...

525
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,380
Hold on.

526
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,830
Go for the overpass.

527
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,730
Go for the overpass!

528
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,700
Take cover! Take cover!

529
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,350
- Over there. Just follow them.
- Take cover.

530
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,250
She's stuck.

531
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,690
Hank's still in the car.

532
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,550
Hank's in the car.

533
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,560
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No, no.

534
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,330
Get your mom to the overpass.

535
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,520
Hank! Hank! Come!

536
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,620
- Jonathan!
- Mom, it's okay.

537
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,090
- Jonathan!
- Mom, stay here.

538
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,400
Dad!

539
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,010
I let my father die
because I trusted him.

540
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,820
Because he was
convinced that I had to wait.

541
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,750
That the world was not ready.

542
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,120
What do you think?

543
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,660
You better watch out, Lois.

544
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,470
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

545
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,470
He knows you're Wood burns anonymous source
and cannot wait to rip you a new one.

546
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,280
Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha.

547
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,810
I told you not to run with
this, and what do you do?

548
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,540
You let Wood burn just
shotgun it all over the Internet.

549
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,690
Now the publishers
want me to sue you.

550
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:12,190
Well, if it makes a
difference, I'm dropping it.

551
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:13,450
Whoa, just like that?

552
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,690
Yep.

553
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,360
What happened to your leads?

554
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,660
They didn't pan out.
The story is smoke.

555
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:21,840
Or it didn't get the
traction you hoped?

556
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
Two weeks leave...

557
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,900
no pay, that's your penance.

558
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,840
You try something
like this again...

559
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,740
- you're done here.
- Fine.

560
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,710
Let's make it three weeks
since you're so willing to agree.

561
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,470
- Perry.
- No, no. Don't. Don't.

562
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,820
I believe you saw
something, Lois.

563
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:42,320
But not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold.

564
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:46,050
So whatever your
reasons are for dropping it...

565
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,930
I think you're
doing the right thing.

566
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:50,730
Why?

567
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,730
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

568
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,440
if they knew there was
someone like this out there?

569
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,590
Go get him.

570
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,060
Well, look at you.

571
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,920
A reporter came by here.

572
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,720
She's a friend. Don't worry.

573
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:52,790
Oh.

574
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,720
Mom.

575
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,490
- Heh, heh, heh.
- What?

576
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,490
- I found them.
- Who?

577
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:02,830
My parents.

578
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,340
My People.

579
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,440
I know where I come from now.

580
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,110
Wow.

581
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,950
That's wonderful.

582
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,250
I'm so happy for you, Clark.

583
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,620
- What?
- It's nothing.

584
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,270
When you were a baby I used
to lay by your crib at night...

585
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,870
listening to you breathe.

586
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,540
It was hard for you.

587
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,140
You struggled.

588
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,210
And I worried all the time.

589
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,310
You worried the
truth would come out.

590
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,050
No.

591
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:54,620
The truth about
you is beautiful.

592
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,490
We saw that the moment
we laid eyes on you.

593
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,790
We knew that one day, the
whole world would see that.

594
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,860
I'm just...

595
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,570
I'm worried they'll
take you away from me.

596
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,180
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.

597
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,510
I promise.

598
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,880
General Swan wick, sir.

599
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:31,890
What am I looking at,
doc? Comet? Asteroid?

600
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,060
Comets don't make
course corrections, general.

601
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,830
Wanted you to see this
before some amateur

602
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,860
with a telescope creates
a worldwide panic.

603
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,910
The ship appears to have...

604
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,910
inserted itself into a
lunar synchronous orbit...

605
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,340
though I have no idea why.

606
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,420
Have you tried...
communicating with it?

607
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,680
Well, they haven't
responded as of yet.

608
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:04,950
I'm just speculating, but I think
whoever? At the helm of that thing...

609
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,720
is looking to make
a dramatic entrance.

610
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:16,070
Anybody know where
we keep the toner?

611
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,940
- What's going on?
- It's all over the news.

612
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,140
You gotta see this.

613
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:49,630
Clark.

614
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,130
Yeah?

615
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,740
Coming.

616
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,100
This is a breaking
news. An unidentified...

617
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,050
You are not alone.

618
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:43,060
You are not alone.

619
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,220
You are not alone.

620
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:55,500
You are not alone.

621
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,420
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.

622
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,560
You are not alone.

623
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,230
It's on my phone too.

624
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:31,840
My name is General Zod.

625
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,440
I come from a
world far from yours.

626
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,840
I have journeyed across an
ocean of stars to reach you.

627
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,950
For some time, your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.

628
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,790
I request that you
return this individual...

629
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,190
to my custody.

630
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,420
For reasons unknown, he has
chosen to keep his existence...

631
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,530
a secret from you.

632
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,770
He will have made
efforts to blend in.

633
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,040
He will look like you.

634
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,370
But he is not one of you.

635
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,410
To those of you who may know...

636
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,640
of his current location...

637
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:18,440
...fate of your planet...

638
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,380
rests in your hands.

639
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:25,490
To Kal-El, I say this:

640
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:30,230
Surrender within 24 hours...

641
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:37,470
or watch this world
suffer the consequences.

642
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,400
Ah!

643
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,220
We hardly know anything
about him, isn't that right?

644
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,250
If he truly means us no harm...

645
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,480
he'll turn himself in and
face the consequences.

646
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,320
And if he won't do that...

647
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,590
then maybe we should.

648
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,800

Lane knows who this guy is.

649
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,900
And I think that she's the
one we should be questioning.

650
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:11,670
- Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane...
- Hello?

651
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,430
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

652
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,980
For once I agree with
Woodburn. Have you seen him?

653
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,510
- Do you know where he is?
- No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.

654
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:23,950
The entire world is
being threatened here.

655
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,810
This is not time
for you to fall...

656
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,390
back on journalistic integrity.

657
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,130
This is serious, Lois.

658
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:33,330
The FBI is here. They're throwing
around words like "treason".

659
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,220
I gotta go.

660
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,710
FBI. Hands up.

661
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,750
Drop the bag. Now.

662
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,890
Regarding the visitors
themselves we know...

663
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,590
very little. According
to government officials...

664
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,330
the visitors do not
represent a threat...

665
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:11,730
despite the ominous
tone of their message.

666
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:14,490
Then of course there's the
question on everyone's mind:

667
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:18,540
"Who is this Kal-El person?
Does he actually exist?

668
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,440
How could he have remained
hidden from us for so long?"

669
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,380
Come on, Kent.

670
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,550
Come on. Fight back.

671
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,380
Get up, Kent.

672
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,060
So is that it?

673
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,020
Is that all you've got?

674
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,190
Come on, Kent.

675
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:49,800
Come on!

676
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,560
Did they hurt you?

677
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,240
You know they can't.

678
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:25,470
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?

679
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,780
I wanted to hit that kid. I
wanted to hit him so bad.

680
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,480
I know you did. I mean...

681
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,440
part of me even wanted
you to, but then what?

682
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,310
Make you feel any better?

683
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,680
You just have to decide what kind of
man you want to grow up to be, Clark.

684
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:47,660
Because whoever that man
is, good character or bad, he's...

685
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:51,430
He's gonna change the world.

686
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:57,700
What's on your mind?

687
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:05,040
I don't know where to start.

688
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:07,270
Wherever you want.

689
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,550
That ship that
appeared last night.

690
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,690
I'm the one they're looking for.

691
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,690
Do you know...

692
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,620
why they want you?

693
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:25,460
No. But this General Zod...

694
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:29,700
even if I surrender, there's no
guarantee he'll keep his word, but...

695
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,970
if there's a chance I can save
Earth by turning myself in...

696
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:36,700
shouldn't I take it?

697
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,080
What does your gut tell you?

698
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,510
Zod can't be trusted.

699
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:46,710
The problem is...

700
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,350
I'm not sure the people
of Earth can be either.

701
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,340
Sometimes you have to
take a leap of faith first.

702
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:04,760
The trust part comes later.

703
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,630
All right. You've
got our attention.

704
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,120
What is it you want?

705
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,200
I would like to
speak to Lois Lane.

706
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:36,710
What makes you think she's here?

707
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:39,700
Don't play games
with me, general.

708
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:43,940
I'll surrender, but only if you
guarantee Lois's freedom.

709
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,990
Why are you surrendering to Zod?

710
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,820
I'm surrendering to
mankind. There's a difference.

711
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,900
You let them handcuff you?

712
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,070
Wouldn't be much of
a surrender if I resisted.

713
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,600
And if it makes them
feel more secure...

714
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,510
then all the better for it.

715
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,110
What's the S stand for?

716
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,310
It's not an S.

717
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,350
On my world it means hope.

718
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:32,820
Well, here, it's an S.

719
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:36,420
How about...

720
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,760
Super...

721
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:43,030
Sir?

722
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:46,640
- Hi, my name is Dr. E...
- Emil Hamilton.

723
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,850
I know, I can see your ID
tag in your breast pocket.

724
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,140
Along with a half-eaten
roll of Lifesavers.

725
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,650
I can also see the
soldiers in the next room...

726
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:58,180
preparing that
tranquilizing agent of yours.

727
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,890
You won't need it.

728
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:03,180
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions.

729
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,860
You could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

730
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,560
Been here for 33 years, doctor.

731
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:11,730
- Haven't infected anyone yet.
- That you know of. We have legitimate...

732
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:15,370
security concerns. You revealed
your identity to Miss Lane over there.

733
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,570
Why won't you do
the same with us?

734
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,870
Let's put our cards on
the table here, general.

735
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:25,050
You're scared because
you can't control me.

736
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,170
You don't, and you never will.

737
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:30,990
But that doesn't
mean I'm your enemy.

738
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:32,710
Then who is?

739
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,390
Zod?

740
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:36,420
That's what I'm worried about.

741
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:38,720
Be that as it may...

742
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,760
I've been given orders
to hand you over to him.

743
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:44,860
Do what you have to do, general.

744
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,660
Thank you.

745
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,560
For what?

746
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,270
For believing in me.

747
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,370
Didn't make much
difference in the end.

748
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,740
It did to me.

749
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,900
They're coming.

750
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,200
You should leave now.

751
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,870
Go, Lois.

752
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,150
Kal-El.

753
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,710
I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.

754
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:50,660
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

755
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:59,790
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

756
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,000
General Zod would
like this woman...

757
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,860
to accompany me.

758
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:05,970
You asked for the alien.

759
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,350
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

760
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,710
Shall I tell the general
you're unwilling to comply?

761
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:15,850
I don't care what you tell him.

762
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,250
It's all right.

763
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,550
I'll go.

764
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:09,240
The atmospheric composition on
our ship is not compatible with humans.

765
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:10,870
You need to wear a breather...

766
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,770
beyond this point.

767
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,920
Kal-El.

768
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:42,430
You have no idea how long...

769
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,730
we've been searching for you.

770
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,160
I take it you're Zod?

771
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:47,570
General Zod.

772
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,610
- Our commander.
- It's all right, Faora.

773
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:52,510
We can forgive Kal
any lapses in decorum.

774
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,680
He's a stranger to our ways.

775
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:55,970
This should be 'cause...

776
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,280
for celebration, not conflict.

777
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:01,680
- Unh.
- Not conflict.

778
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,150
I...

779
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,620
feel strange.

780
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:10,660
Weak.

781
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,000
What's happening to him?

782
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,800
He's rejecting our
ship's atmospherics.

783
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,630
Clark.

784
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:20,540
You've spent a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology...

785
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:21,740
but never adapted to ours.

786
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,830
Help him.

787
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,640
I can't. Whatever's happening...

788
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:27,110
- has to run its course.
- Clark.

789
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,780
Help him.

790
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:32,710
Help him.

791
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,890
Hello, Kal.

792
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,630
Or do you prefer Clark?

793
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,740
That's the name they gave you.

794
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,300
Isn't it?

795
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,310
I was Krypton's
military leader...

796
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:58,980
your father our
foremost scientist.

797
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,650
The only thing we agreed on...

798
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:03,650
was that Krypton was
dying. In return for my efforts...

799
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:06,410
to protect our civilization...

800
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,750
and save our planet...

801
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:13,020
I and my fellow officers were
sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

802
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:19,230
And then the
destruction of our world...

803
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:20,990
freed us.

804
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,670
We were adrift,
destined to float...

805
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,850
amongst the ruins
of our planet...

806
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,950
Until we starved.

807
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,440
How did you find
your way to Earth?

808
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:41,210
We managed to retrofit the
phantom projector into a hyper drive.

809
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:44,890
Your father made a similar modification
to the craft that brought you here.

810
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,020
And so the instrument
of our damnation...

811
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,870
became our salvation.

812
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,300
We sought out the
old colonial outposts...

813
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,770
looking for signs of life.

814
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,050
But all we found was death.

815
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,610
Cut off from Krypton,
these outposts...

816
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,080
mwithered and died long ago.

817
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,560
We salvaged what we could...

818
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,490
armour, weapons...

819
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,660
even a world engine.

820
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,300
For 33 years we prepared...

821
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:29,570
until finally we detected
a distress beacon...

822
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:31,600
which you triggered...

823
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:34,070
when you accessed
the ancient scout ship.

824
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:38,000
You led us here, Kal.

825
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,480
And now it's
within your power...

826
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:44,350
to save what
remains of your race.

827
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:50,350
On Krypton...

828
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:53,250
the genetic template for
every being yet to be born...

829
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,020
is encoded in the
registry of citizens.

830
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,830
Your father stole
the registry's Codex...

831
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:01,930
and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

832
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,630
For what purpose?

833
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:07,270
So that Krypton
can live again...

834
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,670
on Earth.

835
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,630
Where is the Codex, Kal?

836
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:35,130
If Krypton lives again...

837
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,670
what happens to Earth?

838
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:42,200
The foundation has to
be built on something.

839
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,240
Even your father
recognized that.

840
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:54,020
No, Zod.

841
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,390
I can't be a part of this.

842
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:58,920
Then what can you be a part of?

843
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,720
No!

844
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,920
Zod!

845
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,020
No!

846
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:07,530
No!

847
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,700
Your father acquitted...

848
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:16,930
himself with honor, Kal.

849
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,780
You killed him?

850
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,520
I did.

851
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:27,520
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

852
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,220
But if I had to do
it again, I would.

853
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:34,920
I have a duty to my people...

854
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:39,190
and I will not allow anyone to
prevent me from carrying it out.

855
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,280
What's the sit-rep, major?

856
01:21:57,910 --> 01:22:00,290
DSP pinged two bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

857
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,650
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

858
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,150
There it is.

859
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,420
Re-task lkon-4...

860
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,900
- and get me a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

861
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:09,220
Command, the word...

862
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,560
of the day is trident.

863
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,890
We have two alien craft
on aggressive approach.

864
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,760
Ikon-4 coming online.

865
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:15,990
Air speed?

866
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:17,470
380 knots, entering Kansas...

867
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:19,730
airspace. Not
responding to our hails.

868
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,170
You're wasting your efforts.

869
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,440
The strength you derived
from the Earth's sun...

870
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:27,770
has been neutralized
aboard our ship.

871
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,580
Here...

872
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:31,410
in this environment...

873
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,660
you are as weak as a human.

874
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,250
Unh!

875
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,260
Unh!

876
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,050
Where did you come from?

877
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,020
The command key, Miss Lane.

878
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,690
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
to the ship's mainframe.

879
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:40,910
Who are you?

880
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,150
I am Kal's father.

881
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:45,820
Can you help us?

882
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,360
I designed this ship.

883
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:51,760
I can modify its
atmospheric composition...

884
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,760
to human compatibility.

885
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,020
We can stop them.

886
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:57,570
We can send them back
to the Phantom Zone.

887
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,170
How?

888
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,930
I can teach you.

889
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,010
And in turn, you can teach Kal.

890
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:04,940
Will you help me?

891
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,090
The ship's crew are alerted.

892
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:21,390
We need to move quickly.

893
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,290
Retrieve the command key.

894
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,970
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up her sidearm.

895
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,750
What's happening?

896
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:06,400
To your right.

897
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:07,630
Fire.

898
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:09,830
Behind you.

899
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,120
Secure yourself
inside the open pod.

900
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:28,430
Safe travels, Miss
Lane. It's unlikely...

901
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:30,260
we'll see each other again.

902
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:34,930
Remember, the phantom drives
are essential in stopping them.

903
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,030
Move your head to the left.

904
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:06,530
Is it true what Zod
said about the Codex?

905
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,040
Strike that panel.

906
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:13,870
We wanted you to learn...

907
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:16,240
what it meant to
be human first...

908
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:20,510
so that one day, when the time
was right, you could be the bridge...

909
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,510
between two peoples.

910
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,240
Look.

911
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,420
Lois.

912
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:32,050
You can save her, Kal.

913
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,060
You can save all of them.

914
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,500
You'll be safe here.

915
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,410
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

916
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,120
I'm sorry.

917
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,830
I didn't wanna tell them anything,
but they did something to me.

918
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,250
- They looked inside my mind...
- It's okay, Lois.

919
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,260
They did the same thing to me.

920
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:29,670
Clark!

921
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,450
The craft he arrived in...

922
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:42,150
where is it?

923
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,220
Go to hell.

924
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:57,530
There.

925
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,900
Unh!

926
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,660
The Codex is not here.

927
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,030
Argh!

928
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:27,590
Ah!

929
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:30,430
Where has he hidden it?

930
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,330
I don't know.

931
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,670
Where is the Codex?!

932
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,040
Ahh!

933
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,620
You think you can
threaten my mother?!

934
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,220
Ah!

935
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:33,900
What have you done to me?

936
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,570
My parents taught me to hone...

937
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:38,270
my senses, Zod.

938
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,570
Focus...

939
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:43,840
on just what I wanted to see.

940
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,140
Without your helmet...

941
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,970
you're getting everything.

942
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:48,170
Unh!

943
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,650
And it hurts...

944
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,620
doesn't it?

945
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:03,990
Argh!

946
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,730
Get away from the window.

947
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,500
Get inside. It's not safe.

948
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:50,710
Ail players, this is Guardian. I
am airborne mission commander.

949
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:53,000
I have previously
encountered and observed...

950
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,380
the beings we're
about to engage.

951
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:58,350
They are extremely dangerous
and we have been authorized...

952
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:00,080
to use deadly force.

953
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,030
Roger, Guardian, we
are inbound to target.

954
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:10,890
Cleared hot. Weapons free.

955
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,760
Copy, 11. Weapons free.

956
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,330
Thunder 11...

957
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,590
tally three targets.

958
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,110
Unh!

959
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:36,210
Thunder 11...

960
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:38,690
good hit. Request
immediate re-attack.

961
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,050
Roger, Guardian. We'll
make a second gun run...

962
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,390
on a heading of 212 degrees.

963
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:51,390
Thunder 11, eject!

964
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:52,970
Eject!

965
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:54,930
Thunder 11, eject!

966
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,650
I have a bogey incoming!

967
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,920
Oh, shit.

968
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:24,830
Argh!

969
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,100
You are weak...

970
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:29,340
son of El.

971
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,740
Unsure of yourself.

972
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:38,950
The fact that you possess
a sense of morality...

973
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,950
and we do not...

974
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,750
gives us an
evolutionary advantage.

975
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,750
And if history has
proven anything...

976
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:03,200
it is that evolution
always wins.

977
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:05,870
Ragh!

978
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:11,480
Unh!

979
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,020
CCT, we're approaching...

980
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:28,130
LZ Jay hawk. Get down in five.

981
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,200
Let's go. Go to the LZ.

982
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:32,170
Roger, sarge. Let's go!

983
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:11,070
All rangers, I need you...

984
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,510
to engage the targets.

985
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,120
Guardian, this is Badger 01.

986
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:15,610
What about the guy in blue?

987
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:16,910
I said engage...

988
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:18,350
all targets.

989
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,550
Contact. Contact.

990
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:35,920
Ah!

991
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:41,730
You Okay?

992
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:49,410
We're auto-rotating,
going in hard.

993
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:51,310
Brace for impact.

994
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:53,250
Brace for impact.

995
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,480
We're going in hard!

996
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:02,040
Fallen angel. Fallen
angel. Guardian is down.

997
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:03,550
I repeat, Guardian is down.

998
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:26,980
Guardian, do you read?

999
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,590
Thunder 12, calling Guardian.

1000
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:30,150
- Do you read?
- Thunder 12...

1001
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,410
this is Guardian.

1002
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:33,960
Put down everything you've
got north of my position.

1003
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:36,360
- This will be danger-close.
- Copy, danger-close.

1004
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:37,860
Good luck, sir.

1005
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:20,570
A good death is its own reward.

1006
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,550
You will not win.

1007
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,520
For every human you save...

1008
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:41,420
we will kill a
million more. Unh!

1009
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,910
Do we have an all clear?
Do we have an all clear?

1010
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,420
Alpha team, sit-rep. Alpha team.

1011
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,250
Do you copy? Alpha team.

1012
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,970
This man is not our enemy.

1013
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:35,970
Thank you, colonel.

1014
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:54,820
Mom?

1015
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,630
I'm all right.

1016
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,650
Nice suit, son.

1017
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,010
I'm so sorry.

1018
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,350
It's only stuff, Clark.

1019
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,920
It can always be replaced.

1020
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:24,650
But you can't be.

1021
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:28,390
Mom, Zod said this Codex...

1022
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:30,930
he's looking for can
bring my people back.

1023
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,930
Isn't that a good thing?

1024
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,660
I don't think they're
interested in sharing this world.

1025
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,500
Clark.

1026
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:43,230
Clark.

1027
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,880
I know how to stop them.

1028
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:50,380
What happened down there?

1029
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:53,450
He exposed a temporary weakness.

1030
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,190
It is of little consequence...

1031
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:00,460
because I have
located the Codex.

1032
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,530
It was never in the capsule.

1033
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,790
Jor-el took the Codex...

1034
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,540
the DNA of a billion
people, then he bonded it...

1035
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,570
within his son's individual...

1036
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:11,790
cells.

1037
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,570
All of Krypton's heirs...

1038
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:17,240
living hidden in
one refugee's body.

1039
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,280
Does Kal-EI need to be alive...

1040
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:26,710
for us to extract the
Codex from his cells?

1041
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,250
No.

1042
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:37,430
Release the world engine.

1043
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:10,650
What just happened?

1044
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:11,930
The ship just split in mo.

1045
01:42:12,150 --> 01:42:15,260
Track one is heading east, track
two to the southern hemisphere.

1046
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:17,940
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching...

1047
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,610
Mach 24 and accelerating.

1048
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:22,500
It's gonna impact somewhere
in the Indian Ocean.

1049
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,860
The rest of the
ship is descending.

1050
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:44,990
Put it on the board now.

1051
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,290
Yes, sir.

1052
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,500
Oh, my God.

1053
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,770
Bring the phantom drive online.

1054
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:55,230
We are now slave
to the world engine.

1055
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,370
Initiate.

1056
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:35,840
- What have they hit us with?
- Looks like some kind of gravity...

1057
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:38,640
weapon. It's working in
tandem with their ship.

1058
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:43,140
Somehow they're
increasing the Earth's mass...

1059
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:45,510
clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

1060
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,850
Oh, my God.

1061
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:51,180
They're terraforming.

1062
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:52,950
What's that?

1063
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:54,690
Planetary engineering...

1064
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:58,160
modifying the Earth's
atmosphere and topography.

1065
01:44:58,420 --> 01:44:59,660
Turning Earth into Krypton.

1066
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:03,500
- But what happens to us?
- Based on these readings...

1067
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:06,760
there won't be an "us".
General Swan wick, sir.

1068
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:08,540
I'm on with the control tower.

1069
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,040
Colonel Hardy's on his way
and he's got Superman in tow.

1070
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:12,840
Superman?

1071
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:14,540
The alien, sir.

1072
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,180
That's what they're
calling him. Superman.

1073
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,880
We have a plan, general.

1074
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:25,630
Is that what I think it is?

1075
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:28,560
It's the ship he arrived in.

1076
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:32,860
This ship is powered by
something called a phantom drive.

1077
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,570
It bends space.

1078
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:38,800
Zod's ship uses the same technology, and
if we can make the two drives collide...

1079
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:40,870
A singularity can be created.

1080
01:45:41,130 --> 01:45:42,170
- Like a black hole.
- Yes.

1081
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,200
So if we open up this doorway...

1082
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:46,070
they should be pulled back in.

1083
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,840
So you want us to
bomb them with that?

1084
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:51,050
General, that craft maxes out...

1085
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:54,690
17,000 pounds, we
can drop it from a C-17.

1086
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:56,050
It's a viable plan.

1087
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:58,420
If I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean...

1088
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,390
the gravity field
will continue...

1089
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:01,990
to expand.

1090
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,530
If that thing is making
Earth more like Krypton...

1091
01:46:10,890 --> 01:46:12,430
won't you be weaker around it?

1092
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:15,540
Maybe.

1093
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,880
I'm not about to let
that stop me from trying.

1094
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,040
You might want to
step back a little bit.

1095
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:25,240
Maybe a little bit more.

1096
01:46:57,710 --> 01:46:58,710
Faora.

1097
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:00,410
Take command.

1098
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:03,780
- Yes, sir.
- I need to secure the genesis chamber...

1099
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:06,960
and pay my respects
to an old friend.

1100
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:16,830
Guardian en route
to Metropolis...

1101
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:18,830
package in tow.

1102
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:27,010
Be advised, F-35s
inbound to rendezvous point.

1103
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,440
You should have
visual contact now.

1104
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:18,130
Command key accepted.
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.

1105
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:19,520
Stop this, Zod...

1106
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:21,830
while there's still time.

1107
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:26,370
Haven't given up lecturing
me, have you, even in death?

1108
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:28,730
I will not let you use
the Codex like this.

1109
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,710
You don't have the
power to stop me.

1110
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:34,000
The command key I have
entered is revoking your authority.

1111
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:37,150
This ship is now
under my control.

1112
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:10,240
Norlhcom,
Lightning 1, request...

1113
01:49:10,510 --> 01:49:12,920
- permission to unleash the hounds.
- Lightning 1...

1114
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:16,620
you are clear to engage. Send battle
damage assessment when able. Out.

1115
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:32,570
Avionics are going
haywire. The gravity field...

1116
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,140
is pulling our missiles
down. We gotta get closer.

1117
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,270
All right, everybody...

1118
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:44,420
we're leaving. We're
leaving the building now.

1119
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,440
I just lost my wingman.

1120
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:12,940
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

1121
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:26,490
Everybody, this way! Come on!

1122
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,820
Everybody, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving.

1123
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:37,690
Jenny!

1124
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:42,660
Oh, my God.

1125
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,770
Perry!

1126
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,150
Go! There! Go!

1127
01:50:56,010 --> 01:50:57,510
Our people can co-exist.

1128
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:02,150
So we can suffer through years of
pain trying to adapt like your son has?

1129
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:04,660
- You're talking about genocide.
- Yes.

1130
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:07,490
And I'm arguing its
merits with a ghost.

1131
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,670
We're both ghosts, Zod.

1132
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:14,400
Can't you see that? The Krypton
you're clinging onto is gone.

1133
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:17,230
Ship, have you managed to
quarantine this invasive intelligence?

1134
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,500
- You'll fail.
- I have.

1135
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:20,050
Then prepare to terminate it.

1136
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:22,080
- I'm tired of this debate.
- Silencing me...

1137
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:23,750
won't change anything.

1138
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:27,320
My son...

1139
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:29,490
is twice the man you were.

1140
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,150
And he will finish
what we started.

1141
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,320
I can promise you that.

1142
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,900
Tell me...

1143
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:46,730
you have Jor-El's
memories, his conscience.

1144
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:48,430
Can you experience...

1145
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:49,840
his pain?

1146
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:55,440
I will harvest the Codex
from your son's corpse...

1147
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:58,210
and I will rebuild Krypton...

1148
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,940
atop his bones.

1149
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:30,580
Argh!

1150
01:52:58,630 --> 01:52:59,340
Jenny.

1151
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:02,340
- Jenny. Jenny, where are you?
- I'm here!

1152
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:03,640
- I'm here. Here.
- Jenny.

1153
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,410
Hold on, hold on.

1154
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:06,640
I'm stuck.

1155
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,520
- I can't get free. I'm stuck.
- Okay.

1156
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:11,310
We'll get you out of there,
all right? Just sit tight.

1157
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:12,150
No, no, no!

1158
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:14,220
- Don't leave me.
- We're not gonna leave you.

1159
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:15,520
- Okay.
- Lombard!

1160
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:19,130
- Get your ass over here and help me.
- Damn it.

1161
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:23,100
- We just gotta move this.
- Here.

1162
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:25,360
Slide that in. You
push, I'll pull, okay?

1163
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:26,660
Go.

1164
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:32,170
- Push!
- Oh, my God.

1165
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,040
It's getting closer!
Come on, push!

1166
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:38,310
Northcom, this is
Guardian. Are we cleared?

1167
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,840
Negative, Guardian.

1168
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:07,010
Come on! Push!

1169
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,200
Ahh!

1170
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,180
Argh!

1171
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:00,360
He did it.

1172
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:03,800
Northcom, this is Guardian.

1173
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:06,300
We're passing through
phase line red. Good to go.

1174
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:07,560
Godspeed, Guardian.

1175
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:10,140
Arm the package.
You are cleared hot.

1176
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,470
We're lining up
for the final run.

1177
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:15,270
It's up to you and Hamilton now.

1178
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,400
You gotta be kidding me.

1179
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:57,860
Loadmaster, is the package...

1180
01:55:58,110 --> 01:55:59,110
ready to drop?

1181
01:55:59,350 --> 01:56:00,620
Negative, Guardian.

1182
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:02,630
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.

1183
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:04,430
What's it supposed to do?

1184
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:07,690
- It's supposed to go in all the way.
- Let me take a look.

1185
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:09,530
Co-pilot's aircraft.

1186
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,760
Co-pilot's aircraft.

1187
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,170
We are lined up for the
drop. What's the hold up?

1188
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,440
We've had a setback.

1189
01:56:38,190 --> 01:56:39,690
Target that aircraft.

1190
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:45,000
Target locked.

1191
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:55,800
Stop!

1192
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:58,010
If you destroy this ship...

1193
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,910
you destroy Krypton!

1194
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:05,890
Krypton had its chance.

1195
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:09,190
Argh!

1196
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:01,750
Miss Lane! It's
not safe for you...

1197
01:58:01,970 --> 01:58:02,970
over there!

1198
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:04,100
Miss Lane!

1199
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:06,550
Ah!

1200
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:35,340
Move now! Go!

1201
01:58:56,190 --> 01:58:57,190
A good death...

1202
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:59,030
is its own reward.

1203
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,010
Ah!

1204
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:30,630
Ah!

1205
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:48,820
Argh!

1206
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:02,930
Are they gone?

1207
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:05,500
I think so.

1208
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,740
He saved us.

1209
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:37,430
You know, they say it's all
downhill after the first kiss.

1210
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:43,930
I'm pretty sure that only counts
when you're kissing a human.

1211
02:01:13,290 --> 02:01:14,770
Look at this.

1212
02:01:17,070 --> 02:01:18,980
We could have
built a new Krypton...

1213
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:20,980
in this squalor.

1214
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:24,340
But you chose the
humans over us.

1215
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:27,310
I exist...

1216
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:29,990
only to protect Krypton.

1217
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:35,750
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born.

1218
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:39,120
And every action I take...

1219
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:41,360
no matter how violent...

1220
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:43,330
or how cruel...

1221
02:01:44,530 --> 02:01:46,940
is for the greater good...

1222
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,110
of my people.

1223
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:54,850
And now...

1224
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:57,380
I have no people.

1225
02:02:00,810 --> 02:02:02,380
My soul...

1226
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:08,020
that is what you have taken...

1227
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,890
from me.

1228
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:19,290
I'm going to make
them suffer, Kal.

1229
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:22,970
These humans you've adopted,
I will take them all from you...

1230
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:26,180
- one by one.
- You're a monster, Zod...

1231
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,010
and I'm gonna stop you.

1232
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,690
Argh!

1233
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:52,990
Argh!

1234
02:04:11,610 --> 02:04:12,310
There's only...

1235
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:13,920
one way this ends, Kal.

1236
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:15,990
Either you die...

1237
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,240
or I do.

1238
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:39,200
Unh!

1239
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:50,820
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

1240
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:53,320
Trained my entire life...

1241
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:55,390
to master my senses.

1242
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:59,490
Where did you train? On a farm?

1243
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:52,900
Argh!

1244
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:09,860
If you love...

1245
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,460
these people so much...

1246
02:07:13,190 --> 02:07:15,460
you can mourn for them.

1247
02:07:19,930 --> 02:07:21,000
Don't do this!

1248
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:25,200
Stop!

1249
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:32,370
Stop!

1250
02:07:34,710 --> 02:07:35,850
Never.

1251
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,340
Ahh!

1252
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:11,920
Are you effing stupid?

1253
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:13,880
It's one of your
surveillance drones.

1254
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:16,610
That's a $12,000,000
piece of hardware.

1255
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:17,810
It was.

1256
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:21,150
I know you're trying to find
out where I hang my cape.

1257
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:23,230
- You won't.
- Then I'll ask...

1258
02:09:23,450 --> 02:09:24,760
the obvious question:

1259
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:28,220
How do we know you won't one
day act against America's interests?

1260
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:30,770
I grew up in Kansas, general.

1261
02:09:31,230 --> 02:09:33,400
I'm about as
American as it gets.

1262
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:34,660
Look...

1263
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,270
I'm here to help...

1264
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,740
but it has to be
on my own terms.

1265
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:40,810
You have to convince
Washington of that.

1266
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:45,070
Even if I were willing to try, what
makes you think they'd listen?

1267
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:47,740
I don't know, general.

1268
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:50,850
Guess I'll just
have to trust you.

1269
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:01,800
What are you smiling about?

1270
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:03,970
Nothing, sir.

1271
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:09,110
I just think he's kind of hot.

1272
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:13,370
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.

1273
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:26,550
He always believed you
were meant for greater things.

1274
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:28,320
And that when the day came...

1275
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:31,360
your shoulders would
be able to bear the weight.

1276
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:35,470
Yeah, I just wish he could have
been here to see it finally happen.

1277
02:10:35,890 --> 02:10:37,870
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1278
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:28,220
What are you going to do
when you're not saving the world?

1279
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:32,190
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually. Heh, heh.

1280
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:37,790
I gotta find a job where I can
keep my ear to the ground.

1281
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:45,090
Where people won't look twice...

1282
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:49,140
when I want to go somewhere
dangerous and start asking questions.

1283
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:06,280
Come on, Lois. When are
you gonna throw me a bone?

1284
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:09,220
Courtside seats
to the game tonight.

1285
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:11,220
- What do you say?
- I say...

1286
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:13,990
you should go back to
trolling the intern pool.

1287
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:17,630
You'll probably have
more luck. Sorry.

1288
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:20,100
Courtside?

1289
02:12:20,330 --> 02:12:22,070
- Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.

1290
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:25,110
Lombard, Lane, I want
you to meet our new stringer.

1291
02:12:25,330 --> 02:12:28,580
I want you to show him
the ropes. This is Clark Kent.

1292
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,110
Good luck, kid.

1293
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:32,910
Hey. Steve.

1294
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:34,410
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1295
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:35,640
Hi.

1296
02:12:36,410 --> 02:12:37,750
Lois Lane.

1297
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:40,120
Welcome to the Planet.

1298
02:12:43,850 --> 02:12:45,830
