[notification chirping]

2
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:57,392
Guys, I saw the alert.
Meta attack downtown. I'm on my way.

3
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:01,104
- [woman] <i>Sounds good, Flash.</i>
- Kamilla? Is that you?

4
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,399
- Uh, yeah.
- And Chester P. Runk, sir.

5
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,026
Ready to assist you
in all your superhero needs.

6
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,921
[The Flash] <i>Why are you two on comms?</i>

7
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,281
- Uh, Kamilla let me in.
- We're the only ones here.

8
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:13,366
Frost is at A.R.G.U.S.,
checking on Bloodwork.

9
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,827
Cisco's off the grid
cataloging post-Crisis metas.

10
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:17,287
Iris is on a story.

11
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,682
[The Flash] <i>And Ralph is who knows where
tracing down Sue Dearbon.</i>

12
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:23,084
<i>- Okay, no worries. I'll do this solo.</i>
- Are you sure you don't want some help?

13
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:26,713
'Cause, I mean, I am... I am ready,
willing and caffeinated, sir.

14
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,299
- Put me in, coach.
- Thanks, Chester, but I'm good.

15
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:34,012
[all clamoring]

16
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:58,286
Hartley Rathaway.
Since when are you a diamond thief?

17
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,538
It's Pied Piper, Flash.

18
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,665
And you're really gonna ask me that

19
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,389
after what you and your friends
did to me?

20
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,670
Uh, what did we do?

21
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:12,717
[chuckles] Wow, Flash, my brother.
That is epically cold.

22
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,136
How do you not remember?
It was really bad.

23
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,972
Oh, great. Another Crisis change.

24
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,391
Apparently, there's something else
you don't remember.

25
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,229
The gauntlets are
just my backup singers.

26
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,521
Wait. What...

27
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:29,818
[roof shatters]

28
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,363
Great. He can fly now.

29
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:36,032
No worries, Flash.
P-Runk is all over it.

30
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,284
That sonic boom had
a specific frequency.

31
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,995
If I scan for the same wavelength,
I think we can...

32
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,079
[chuckles, kisses]

33
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,667
<i>- Voil√†!</i>
- Flash, Rathaway's at 52nd and Palm.

34
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,517
All right, I'm on it.
I'll take Broadway.

35
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:50,547
- Uh, I wouldn't do that, sir.
- [The Flash] <i>Why not?</i>

36
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,650
[Kamilla] <i>Because there's a...</i>

37
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:54,300
[train horn blaring]

38
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,594
[gasps, panting]

39
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,765
- Since when was there a train here?
- [Chester] <i>Since always.</i>

40
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:26,332
[Gideon] <i>System update complete.
Is there anything else, Barry Allen?</i>

41
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:27,958
Uh, just one more tweak.

42
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,801
In the meantime, I wouldn't mind knowing
everything that Crisis changed

43
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,199
before I run back into the field.

44
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,300
[Gideon] <i>Calculating. Calculating.</i>

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,970
<i>- Calculating.</i>
- [groans]

46
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,142
[Chester guffawing]

47
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,146
Barry Allen is the Flash.

48
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:49,314
[Chester laughing]

49
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,858
- Yeah, I already knew that.
- What?

50
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,506
Actually, you know what? When I think
about it, it does kind of make sense.

51
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,574
The whole S.T.A.R. Labs super-facility.

52
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:04,037
Plus the same voice every time
the Flash came to visit me at the MAC.

53
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,666
And that jawline, though?
Very distinctive.

54
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,836
Hmm. Listen, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm kinda... I'm kinda busy right now.

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,397
- Well, what are you working on?
- [Barry] Uh...

56
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,298
[Gideon] Analysis complete, Barry Allen.

57
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:19,469
I've calculated
approximately 3.725 trillion changes.

58
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,930
Would you like to hear them
in order of causality?

59
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,733
[chuckles] Is this a mobile interactive
artificial intelligence unit?

60
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:28,394
Uh, yeah, it is. I'm...
I'm just trying to upgrade it.

61
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,896
- Really?
- [Barry] Mmm-hmm.

62
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,024
You know, if you just flip
the positronic solenoid right...

63
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,610
Hey! Please. Um, don't mess with that.

64
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,739
It's, uh, sensitive stuff
and you're not on the team, Chester.

65
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,074
Yeah, totally. Uh...

66
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,954
I guess I'll cross the whole
"superhero tech support"

67
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,002
off my list of career possibilities.
[chuckles]

68
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,961
Anyways, uh, if you'll <i>excusez-moi,</i>
I'm Jitters-bound.

69
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,421
[Barry sighs]

70
00:04:56,798 --> 00:05:00,468
- He's just trying to help.
- I know. I know. I just...

71
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,722
So much has changed after Crisis.
[sighs]

72
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,786
You know, this morning
when I got the meta-alert,

73
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,605
I was trying to find my parents' graves.

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,401
But there's not even
a cemetery there anymore.

75
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:22,073
I've searched every graveyard in
Central City. I still can't find them.

76
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:27,578
[sighs] Just feels like a piece of me
is missing.

77
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,792
And friends like Hartley Rathaway
are enemies now.

78
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,837
Just everything is so different.

79
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,776
I'll bet hearing different voices
on comms doesn't help either.

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,884
[Kamilla chuckles]

81
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:45,054
You want something familiar.
That's not us.

82
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:49,350
- I didn't mean it like that.
- It's okay, Barry. I understand.

83
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,645
Just maybe take it easy on Chester.

84
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,608
If he seems a little over-eager,
it's because he idolizes the Flash.

85
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:58,984
You're his hero.

86
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:03,281
I'll, uh, let you get back to it.

87
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:12,373
[Iris West] There's gotta be
some sort of logic to it.

88
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,335
Walk me through the night of the
particle accelerator explosion again.

89
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,212
What were you doing?

90
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,966
[sighs] Like I told you...

91
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:28,765
<i>I was starting R-CEM tests that night.
I'd just finished the prototype.</i>

92
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,808
<i>My life's work was ready.</i>

93
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,895
Wait. You'd finished
building your machine?

94
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,648
- Yeah.
- Can you build one here?

95
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:41,527
- I did, but we can't use it.
- Eva, we at least have to try.

96
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,241
What are you so afraid of?

97
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,994
I...

98
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,666
Eva, I get it.

99
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,962
I do. But I've read your research.

100
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,218
You were brilliant.
You were the best in your field.

101
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:06,969
[sighs]

102
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,097
And that is good enough for me.

103
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,724
You're so brave.

104
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,229
I guess we'll be brave together then.

105
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:17,939
[snickers]

106
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:24,153
So, this is a Residual Particle Catcher.

107
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:29,575
It can detect and detain
molecular afterglow of things.

108
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:31,577
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

109
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,162
And you need me to do what?

110
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,432
Oh, I need you to help me charge it,
so I can catch him.

111
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:39,085
Them. The particles.
Catch the particles.

112
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,586
Why are you so nervous?

113
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,564
And what are these "particles"
you're trying to catch?

114
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,298
They're just... They're...

115
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:48,219
[sighs] They're scientific anomalies.
You wouldn't understand.

116
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,931
[scoffs] There's the Nash Wells we know
and can barely stand.

117
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,394
And I'm guessing anomalies
because of Crisis?

118
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,231
Boss lady told me.

119
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:03,776
[chuckles] You never did like being kept
in the dark, did you?

120
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,488
Why do you always act like
you've known me forever? It's weird.

121
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,115
[sighs]

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I...

123
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:16,747
don't know what you're talking about.

124
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,140
[Sherloque]
Well, that's not true, is it?

125
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:23,921
You're such a liar.

126
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,926
What? I mean... It's... Yes.

127
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:32,221
The Residual Particle Catcher is ready.
Thank you.

128
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:36,475
So, if you would...
Please, can you, uh, help me charge it?

129
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,437
Just blast it with
an ultra-powered UV ray right there.

130
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,856
- Where?
- There. Right...

131
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,943
[sighs in exasperation]
Just aim for the absorption panel

132
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,227
on the front pylon. Thank you.

133
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:51,824
- Okay. Keep your panties on.
- That contraption is not going to work.

134
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,330
[low humming]

[panting]

138
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,519
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Who the hell is she?

139
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:23,355
She...

140
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,483
[stammering]

141
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,544
That's... It's just someone
I used to know.

142
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,862
Well, she looks a lot
like my doppelganger.

143
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,965
- Why do you have a picture of her?
- It doesn't... it doesn't matter.

144
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,743
It does to me. Dude, this is too weird.

145
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,914
You know, I had a feeling something
was off with you from the beginning.

146
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,417
But I kept ignoring it, because I was
just happy to find another person

147
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,794
who actually believed in me.

148
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:45,795
[chuckling] Okay...

149
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:48,382
But this whole time,
when you looked at me,

150
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,341
you saw this other person.

151
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,552
God, that is messed up, you know?

152
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:54,928
[stutters]

153
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,356
Okay. All right.

154
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,317
Let's try this again, Gideon.

155
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,488
[electricity buzzes]

156
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,950
[grunts]

157
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,385
What the hell?

158
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:53,362
- Oh, good. You're awake.
- Oh, Caitlin.

159
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,032
Thank God. What the hell is going on?

160
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,302
[stammers] One minute
I'm in the speed lab fixing Gideon,

161
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,536
the next thing I know I'm here.
My speed's gone.

162
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,748
Quite the little chatterbox today,
aren't we?

163
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,583
What?

164
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,504
Why are you talking to me like that?
[chuckling] And why am I in a cage?

165
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,259
Caitlin. Let me out of here.

166
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:18,846
[Eobard] Easy, killer.

167
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,438
- Thawne.
- You're quite the specimen, aren't you?

168
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:32,276
Go to hell. I don't know how you
managed to drag me back to the past.

169
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,947
Whatever all this is, I will stop you.

170
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:41,369
Cranky.
Why, did you offer him the B-word?

171
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,955
Hmm. Maybe he just needs some privacy.
I'm gonna go check on Ronnie.

172
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,079
He's working on a new space
he's very excited about.

173
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,251
He's calling it The Pipeline.

174
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:50,335
[Eobard] Hmm.

175
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,171
The Pipeline.

176
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,508
- I like the sound of that.
- [Barry] Caitlin?

177
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,551
- [Eobard] I'll come with you.
- [Barry] Caitlin?

178
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,346
Caitlin! Do not trust him!

179
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:04,475
[knock on door]

180
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,144
Hey, baby girl.

181
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:10,648
To what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

182
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,650
- Well, a good lead, hopefully.
- Mmm.

183
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,487
I am working on our Black Hole story
and I have reached a major dead end,

184
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,507
and I was hoping
that maybe you found something new

185
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,800
on Joseph Carver that could help.

186
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:25,788
Ah, as a matter of fact, I have,
but I can't share it with you.

187
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,165
[laughing]

188
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,586
Are you being serious?

189
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,966
Look, this Carver case
has become a RICO investigation.

190
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,260
I have to report directly
to Chief Singh.

191
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,823
We have to do everything by the book.

192
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,073
Barry told me that you were the one
that gave him the advice

193
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,992
to trust me with the Mirror Gun, and now
you can't even trust me with this?

194
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,311
Oh, Iris, that weapon
was Team Flash territory.

195
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:52,440
This is C.C.P.D. business
and it has to stay that way,

196
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,942
otherwise Carver could skate
with a collusion charge.

197
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,236
Dad, Carver is mine.
You can't just shut me out.

198
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,899
- Ooh.
- [exhales forcefully]

199
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,492
I didn't... I didn't mean that.
I, um...

200
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,538
This just...
It really means a lot to me.

201
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,081
I can see that.

202
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,378
But, baby girl, there is nothing
I can do. My hands are tied. I'm sorry.

203
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,425
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

204
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:21,593
[chuckles]

205
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,513
We both have a job to do
and I respect that.

206
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:25,597
Hmm.

207
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,435
I, um... I'm about to get some lunch.

208
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,521
Do you maybe wanna join me for some
Big Belly Burger? My treat.

209
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,567
Now that, I would love.
But I got few things to finish, okay?

210
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,611
Yeah, no worries.
You wanna meet me there at noon?

211
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,030
That's perfect. See you there.

212
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,323
- Okay.
- All right.

213
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,870
Oh, come on. Come on, just one game.

214
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,831
I just spent the last two hours
at A.R.G.U.S. talking to Ramsey.

215
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,458
I do not want to play pinball.

216
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,811
Besides, I know the only reason
you're hanging around

217
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,438
is 'cause you want to
work things out with Barry.

218
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,131
- So just go do it.
- [stammers] I'm working my way up to it.

219
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:02,301
It's just, you know, up until today,
the worst thing I'd ever done before

220
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,470
was drown my grandmother's car.

221
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,308
Uh, don't try to build a hovercraft
at age 11. Doesn't work out.

222
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:13,646
Didn't you create
a literal black hole over Central City?

223
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:14,771
[chuckles]

224
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,066
Wait. You think Barry's
still mad about that, too?

225
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,318
Would you stop?

226
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,546
No, no. I wasn't even awake
when that happened.

227
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,050
I mean, it's not like you killed him.

228
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,117
[screams]

229
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,202
Barry.

230
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,828
Barry?

231
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,254
[Caitlin sighs] I can't help you
if you won't talk to me.

232
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,173
- Use your signs.
- What are you doing?

233
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,468
[sighs in exasperation]

234
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,177
Nothing?

235
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:50,103
Well, everybody's got good days
and bad days. Gorillas are no different.

236
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,234
[Barry gasps]

237
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,947
[gasps]

238
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,783
This isn't the past.

239
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,536
It's a mindscape.

240
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,415
- I'm in...
- [Grodd] That's right, Barry Allen.

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,793
You're in Grodd's mind now.

242
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,531
[Barry] What's the matter, Grodd?

243
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:33,267
Get lonely at A.R.G.U.S., so you decided
to break out, come visit me?

244
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,936
[Caitlin and Grodd]
Grodd is still in his prison,

245
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,689
in the mental coma
you and your team put him in.

246
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,733
Hmm.

247
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,070
So what, the cage is payback?

248
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,322
What, you want vengeance?

249
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,534
[Eobard and Grodd]
Not vengeance. Understanding.

250
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,413
Grodd wants Barry Allen
to see what it's like to have nothing.

251
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,168
No powers. No freedom. Only captivity.

252
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,463
[Caitlin and Grodd]
Caitlin used neural inhibitor

253
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,714
to shut down Grodd's cerebrum.

254
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,217
Caitlin betrayed Grodd.

255
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:12,348
But you gave her the authority.
This is your doing, Flash.

256
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:16,393
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
Your mind is a weapon.

257
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:20,105
[Eobard and Grodd] You take a weapon
from a man, he is still a man.

258
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,026
You took Grodd's mind.
Grodd's greatest gift.

259
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,029
That is not punishment.
That is cruelty. Pure cruelty.

260
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,491
No. No. Not from where I'm standing.

261
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,371
Does that great mind of yours remember
how many people you've hurt?

262
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,498
Huh?

263
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:43,212
You marched an army of gorillas
through Central City.

264
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,132
<i>You forced me
into a gladiator arena with Solovar.</i>

265
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,552
<i>You weaponized
King Shark's telepathic crown</i>

266
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,888
<i>so you could control
thousands of innocent people.</i>

267
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,517
Face it, Grodd.
You got what you deserved.

268
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,467
[Eobard and Grodd] You are right.

269
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,278
[Caitlin and Grodd] It took Grodd
a year to find the strength

270
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,072
to think intelligently again.

271
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:16,495
And in that time,
Grodd had many primitive thoughts.

272
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,182
[Eobard and Grodd] And without
the power of higher thinking,

273
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,625
Grodd could no longer lie to himself,

274
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,462
and was forced to confront
the truth of his actions,

275
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:29,133
his wrongdoings, his crimes.

276
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,511
[Caitlin and Grodd] Your accident
allowed Grodd to enter your mind.

277
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,099
Not to harm Flash,
but to ask for Flash's help.

278
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,183
[scoffs]

279
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,328
[Caitlin and Grodd]
The neural inhibitor put a Gatekeeper

280
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,395
in Grodd's mind.

281
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:46,191
The portal that Gatekeeper guards
is the only way out of this prison.

282
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:48,986
Help Grodd.

283
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:54,616
Grodd is sorry. Grodd has changed.

284
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,955
Says the super-intelligent gorilla
who just kidnapped me.

285
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,207
[scoffs]

286
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,001
Who won't even show his face.

287
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,222
[Grodd] Grodd wants Flash to trust him.

288
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,728
Your powers are returned.

289
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:28,692
Please, Flash,
help Grodd defeat the Gatekeeper.

290
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,209
Nice try, Grodd.

291
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,711
But you'll never change.

292
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,672
You're exactly where you belong.

293
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,304
[Chester] That's one crazy
cappuccino maker.

294
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,305
Close.

295
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:01,308
Sherloque's machine was developed
to put one person's mind

296
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,810
into another person's memories.

297
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,312
Wait. You think Barry is in
someone else's mind?

298
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,314
I mean, we've had experience
with this before.

299
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,400
Based on Barry's pulse,
his rapid eye movement and his vitals,

300
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,278
and the two brainwaves
are a dead giveaway.

301
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,155
[Chester gasps]

302
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,951
This is so awesome. Awesome, awesome...

303
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,040
I mean, this is just awful.

304
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,001
- We should fix that. [clears throat]
- Yeah.

305
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,255
When Ramsey decided to take
a little vacation inside Barry's brain,

306
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,508
Cisco and I decided to work
on the Memory Machine

307
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,676
just in case Bloodwork
decided to resurface.

308
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,959
[Chester] How's this all work?

309
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,764
In a mindscape,
the host transmits neural signals

310
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,808
to the guest's primary motor cortex.

311
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,519
If we can sync up
with those neural transmitters,

312
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,396
I think we can communicate with Barry.

313
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,148
- Like sliding into his mind DMs.
- Sweet.

314
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,358
[computer calculating]

315
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,030
Come on, Barry.

316
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,951
Frost. You and me. Outside. Let's go.

317
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,709
- Harrison Wells is alive?
- That's a really long story.

318
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,503
Okay.

319
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,505
Make it fast or I'm out.

320
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,465
So, it turns out that Allegra,

321
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,887
through a, you know, series of
unfortunate events, she has discovered...

322
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,570
That she's your daughter's doppelganger?

323
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,449
Not my daughter exactly.
More like an employee, right?

324
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,913
An ex-employee.
How do you know that?

325
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,685
Whatever. I'm guessing it didn't go well

326
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:30,022
because she found out
rather than you explaining it to her.

327
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,292
So now it's time
for some good old-fashioned honesty.

328
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,232
Oh, come on.

329
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,086
Whatever happened between
you and your daughter...

330
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,528
Not my daughter exactly, okay?

331
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,756
More like an employee.
An ex-employee who made a bad call.

332
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,032
Just explain it to her.

333
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,843
Yeah, but she said
it was too late for that.

334
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:45,287
Well, as my life coach, Ralph,
would say, you can't let that stop you.

335
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,335
Ralph is your life coach?

336
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,092
Oh, finally, there it is.

337
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,846
[panting]

338
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,056
Time to get out of here.

339
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,310
Solovar?

340
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:10,978
You're the Gatekeeper?

341
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,898
[roaring]

342
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:25,160
Solovar, listen.
We do not have to fight.

343
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,622
As far as I'm concerned,
Grodd can stay in this coma forever.

344
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,917
[Solovar] I am the warden
of this prison, Flash.

345
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,879
None shall escape. Not even you.

346
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,506
[softly] Great.

347
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:38,923
[roars]

348
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,095
[The Flash grunts]

349
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:46,974
[monitor beeping]

350
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,370
Barry's body is reacting to
whatever's happening in the mindscape.

351
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,270
So, if he dies in there,
he dies out here, too?

352
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,082
- [Killer Frost] Correct.
- Do you have any sedatives?

353
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:57,275
- No. Those don't work on speedsters.
- [stammers] No. I meant for me.

354
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,652
[groaning]

355
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,366

[roaring]

357
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,419
[monitor beeping rapidly]

358
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,592
Uh, Frost,
you've got that look Cisco has

359
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,445
before he throws
a bunch of science words at us

360
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,697
that basically means we're fracked.

361
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,890
The signals traveling to Barry's cortex
are moving at a hyper-neural speed.

362
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:32,352
We've only seen one other brain
whose neurons can fire this fast.

363
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,316
- Barry's in Grodd's mind.
- Gorilla Grodd?

364
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,820
Damn. Yo, he is, like,
my favorite supervillain ever.

365
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:45,449
He's, like, super strong
and super smart,

366
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,827
and Barry's super trapped in his mind.

367
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,370
Which is very bad.

368
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:54,166
We modified Grodd's telepathic crown
to keep him in a coma at A.R.G.U.S.

369
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,462
<i>But its neural inhibiting capabilities
can only sustain one mind.</i>

370
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:02,007
<i>Before long, the mindscape
will overload and crumble.</i>

371
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,885
If that happens
and Barry's still inside...

372
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,011
He would die.

373
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,906
Well, can't we just call A.R.G.U.S.
and ask them to shut it off?

374
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,643
Uh, no. If we do that while Barry's
still connected to Grodd's mind,

375
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,103
he'll be trapped in there forever.

376
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,646
[stutters]

377
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:18,869
I still don't understand
how this happened.

378
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,443
How did Grodd get inside Barry's mind?

379
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,028
Because of me.

380
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,949
When I tweaked this earlier,
I adjusted its hypothalamic connection.

381
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,619
By a factor of 900%.

382
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,830
Okay, well, that's more
than enough signal

383
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,499
for another brain to piggyback on.

384
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,918
And Barry was wearing that
when he was whammied.

385
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,382
I am so sorry. I...
I never should have came here.

386
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,426
This is all my fault.

387
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,102
Hey.

388
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,815
How is you running away gonna
help us get Barry out of Grodd's mind?

389
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,085
Because if I'm not around,
at least I can't make things worse.

390
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,860
[scoffs] Look,
I hate to break it to you,

391
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,987
but accidentally putting
Barry's life in danger

392
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,989
is kind of a rite of passage
around here.

393
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,700
We've all done it. Cisco, me, Ralph.

394
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,283
Even that janitor who put
too much wax on the floor.

395
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,413
But then,
after we put his life in danger,

396
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,457
we figure out a plan
to get him out of it.

397
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,667
So now it's your turn.

398
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,631
You know, in the sixth grade
I got into the science fair

399
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,301
with a <i>Millennium Falcon</i> that I built
out of used vacuum parts.

400
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:32,514
[chuckles] I mean, it flew
and everything, like a drone.

401
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,560
But on the day of the fair,
it didn't fly.

402
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,398
Uh, rust in the intake manifold
was preventing air

403
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,041
from getting into the combustion,
which was then causing it to...

404
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,612
Sorry.

405
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,614
Anyway...

406
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:55,579
I had begged my teacher to let me fix it
and then fly again the next day.

407
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,083
He said no. You know why?

408
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,256
He was an old-school brother,

409
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,844
and he said that in the real world...

410
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,055

411
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,517

any idea what your life has been like,

414

and I know that some
of the stuff we do in here

415
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,329

will penetrate the mirror's surface,

between the worlds. It will fail.

we can to get out of here, right?

No. [stammers]

When Flash sees Grodd,
he sees an enemy from his past.

Grodd wants Flash
to see a face he can trust.

451
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:52,109
And having me fight Solovar
was supposed to make me trust you?

452
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,008
Grodd thought Flash could beat him.

453
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,969
You were wrong! He almost killed me.

454

- But that was your plan, wasn't it?
- No.

What's that?
What's happening? Is that Solovar?

This world is crumbling.

The neural inhibitor can no longer
take the strain of two minds.

458
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,531
What happens
to this mindscape if it fails?

459
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,035
Both Grodd and Flash die.

460

Together.

00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,081
You wanted revenge so badly

462
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,375
that you were willing to die
just to take me with you?

463
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,626
No.

464
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,674
Grodd has changed.

465
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,677
Nothing could ever make you change.

466
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,098
Not even the Crisis of infinite worlds?

467
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,186
How do you know about Crisis?

468
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:53,149
Grodd's mind wasn't affected
by the merging of the multi-verse,

469
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:58,113
but Grodd can still sense
changes in this reality.

470
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:00,281
Changes like Gorilla City.

471
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,700
City is here now.

472
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,746
The gorillas are here now.
Grodd knows this.

473
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,458
- Grodd wants to return home.
- Why?

474
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,270
So you can create another army
to attack Central City?

475
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:14,796
Just destroy everyone in your path?

476
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:19,259
That is who Grodd used to be.
That Grodd wanted power.

477
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,222
Power didn't bring happiness.

478
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:27,307
It brought pain.

479
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,603
New Grodd wants a new path.

480
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,360
Grodd wants to live...

481
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:43,324
in peace, with his own kind.

482
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:51,916
Gorilla City is the only place
Grodd ever, ever felt happy.

483
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,337
You're telling the truth.

484
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,632
You really have changed.

485
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:05,013
Flash didn't believe Grodd before,

486
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,766
but why does Flash believe Grodd now?

487
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,563
You let go of the past.

488
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,942
Maybe I should do the same.

489
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,990
Crisis has changed so much.

490
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:29,954
I've been obsessed with trying to
keep things the way they were before...

491
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,500
but I can't.

492
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,293
[Grodd] Those things don't matter.

493
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:40,924
If Flash can't beat Solovar,
there's no escape.

494
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:46,471
This world collapses, we both die.
That's our fate.

495
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,224
No. We decide our fate.

496
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:52,977
Grodd, Solovar beat me
because I tried to fight him

497
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,480
the exact same way
I fought him three years ago.

498
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:59,435
To get out of here,
we just have to try something new.

499
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:05,031
- We have to run forward. Not backward.
- [Grodd] How?

500
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,783
[growling]

501
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,705
By fighting together.

502
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:22,549
There's our way out.

503
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,469
[distant rumbling]

504
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,472
You ready?

505
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,558
- We can do this, Grodd. Together.
- [snorts]

506
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,060
Grodd is ready.

507
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:39,566
[crackling]

508
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:52,453
What is it?

509
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:55,206
Barry and Grodd,
their cerebral activity is syncing.

510
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,000
[beeping]

511
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,044
Okay, forget sync.
Their neural pathways just merged.

512
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:03,339
Their brainwaves are literally the same.

513
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,009
[roaring]

514
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:10,573
[The Flash] <i>How does it feel?</i>

515
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,474
[Grodd] It feels impossible.

516
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,894
[The Flash] <i>I know. Now, get ready.
This time, we're on the same team.</i>

517
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,273
[roaring]

518
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,191
[roaring]

519
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,028
[Solovar] Grodd will never leave.

520
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,240
[The Flash] <i>You have my powers, Grodd,
and my knowledge of how to use them.</i>

521
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,076
<i>- Now get us out of here.</i>
- [Grodd] Grodd understands.

522
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,086
[growls]

523
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,421
[computer calculating]

524
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,797
The neural comm link is working.

525
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,966
- Barry, can you hear me?
- [The Flash] <i>Frost?</i>

526
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,636
Yes. We've been trying
to get in contact with you.

527
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,430
You're in Grodd's mind.
Is he trying to hurt you?

528
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:55,558
[The Flash] <i>No. We're on the same team.
Grodd and I merged our minds.</i>

529
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,962
<i>Sort of like the mindscape version
of the Firestorm Matrix.</i>

530
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,771
Wait. So you're half gorilla now?

531
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:02,499
<i>Uh, I'll explain later. We're fighting
a Gatekeeper in Grodd's mind.</i>

532
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,775
<i>We need to beat it to escape.</i>

533
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:06,139
<i>- And the only way to do that...</i>
- Is by working together.

534
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,029
[both roaring]

535
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,630
[The Flash] <i>There isn't much time.
The world is gonna split apart.</i>

536
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:16,954
[Grodd] <i>Grodd thinks
lightning can save him.</i>

537
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,956
<i>Nothing can save Grodd.</i>

538
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,293
Uh, Barry, we've got bigger problems
than Solovar right now.

539
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,629
[The Flash] <i>I know.
Grodd's mindscape is falling apart.</i>

540
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,713
Actually, this is worse.

541
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,006
[both growling]

542
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,112
[The Flash] <i>What could be
worse than this?</i>

543
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,429
[roars]

544
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:35,932
According to my scans,

545
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:39,644
if you exit the mindscape
with your brainwaves still merged,

546
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,063
you will end up in one body.

547
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,315
Brundle-Flash. Gross.

548
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:48,945
Yeah. And what's worse
is the resulting physiological conflict

549
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:52,031
will cause every brain cell
to shut down,

550
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,659
- and the resulting form would...
- [The Flash] <i>We'd both die.</i>

551
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:55,702
Yeah.

552
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:57,583
Wait. So we have to somehow
separate their minds

553
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,163
at the exact moment they escape.

554
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:03,209
And I'd have to be accurate to
the millisecond, which isn't possible.

555
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:07,004
Not for us, but it's very possible

556
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,549
for a mobile interactive
artificial intelligence unit.

557
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:11,676
If we sync Gideon's
quantum intelligence network

558
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,428
to Barry and Grodd's bio-analytics,

559
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,722
it'll perfectly time
the neural de-splicing.

560
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:21,144
But I'd have to do
some more augmenting to this puppy,

561
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,397
and my augmenting
is what got Barry into this mess

562
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,358
and I just really don't want
to mess up again, so...

563
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,653
[The Flash] <i>Chester, listen to me.
That tweak you made to Gideon earlier?</i>

564
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,537
<i>In two seconds,
you improved her functionality</i>

565
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,032
<i>more than I did in two hours.
You're a genius.</i>

566
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,452
<i>Maybe it didn't work out
exactly how you planned,</i>

567
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,454
<i>so here's round two. Try again.</i>

568
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:44,000
<i>I need you now, Chester. Please.
You can do this. I believe in you.</i>

569
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,254
- Flash believes in me?
- We all do.

570
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,382
Go ahead. Take your second chance.
Show us your moves.

571
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,216
Right.

572
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,054
It's time for the LeBron James
of the junkyard to do his thing, baby.

573
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,182
Oh, watch out, brothers and sisters,

574
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:02,185
'cause Chester P. Runk
[mimics air boxing] is back.

575
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,479
[The Flash] <i>Great. Now all we have to...</i>

[Solovar] Grodd!

579
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:13,321
There is no escape.

- [grunting]
- [monitor beeping rapidly]

581
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,410
Solovar's winning. Come on, Barry.

582
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,062
- How's it going, Chester?
- [Chester] Please let this work.

[both grunting]

584
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,213
[Solovar] Grodd stinks of fear.

585
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:35,051
Grodd knows Solovar brings him death.

586
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,271
[The Flash] <i>Don't listen to him, Grodd.
You have too much to live for.</i>

- [sighs in relief] Thank Rao.
- You're back.

605
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,086
Yeah, I'm back.

606
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:54,714
Thanks to the team.

607
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,519
So, do you think Grodd
has gone, like, full hero?

608
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,813
Or is this more of, like,
a Captain Cold,

609
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:14,108
former-villain-turned-sorta-good-guy
situation?

610
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,777
Uh, we'll see, I guess.

611
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,989
Lyla had A.R.G.U.S. embed
a tracking polymer in his cerebellum.

612
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,366
She agreed to let him out on probation

613
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,170
as long as we know
where he is at all times,

614
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:28,164
so if he does break bad again,
I'll find him.

615
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,047
Which reminds me.
I'm gonna check in with Lyla

616
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,084
and make sure I understand
A.R.G.U.S.'s protocols.

617
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,062
I want to make sure
they give Grodd a real chance.

618
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,046
[cell phone vibrating]

619
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:36,505
- Yeah.
- Hey, babe.

620
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,593
You're kidding? That's great. When?
Cisco's coming home.

621
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,222
[sighs]

622
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,227
Hey, um...

623
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:55,900
I wanted to say, uh,
I'm sorry I wasn't more welcoming.

624
00:37:57,026 --> 00:38:00,571
[stutters] I mean, I was dealing
with this family thing.

625
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:03,616
I felt like everything
in my life was changing,

626
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:07,620
and I took that out on you.
And I'm sorry.

627
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:09,205
No, it's...

628
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,582
it's all good, Flash.

629
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,959
[chuckles]

630
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:15,461
Um...

631
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,254
By the way...

632
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,740
Kamilla told me about your parents,

633
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:28,224
and I kinda hacked every cemetery
database within a 700-mile radius.

634
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:34,647
[Chester exhales]

635
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,524
I found them.

636
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,654
I don't remember...

637
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:50,746
Thank you, Chester.

638
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,249
[both chuckle]

639
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:54,709
[alarm beeping]

640
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,336
Do you mind manning the comms?

641
00:38:58,254 --> 00:38:59,755
[guffaws]

642
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,257
I thought you'd never ask.

643
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:07,388
According to our satellites,
it is Rathaway.

644
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,641
Pied Piper's back, baby. [chuckles]

645
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,911
Okay, I'm gonna need all the help
I can get to take him down.

646
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,146
- Are you ready?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

647
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,230
All right.

648
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,067
Oh, that's never gonna get old.

649
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:21,277
[chuckles]

650
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,214
[Iris West] Eva, I'm so sorry.

651
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,238
[winces]

652
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,150
Why didn't you tell me
that the machine could hurt you?

653
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:32,913
I wanted to prove I wasn't lying.
Words are worthless.

654
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:36,792
Evidence... evidence is irrefutable.

655
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:40,504
My colleagues ridiculed
my reflective theory.

656
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,258
Even though my research
was bleeding edge,

657
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:47,762
no scientific journal would publish it
because I hadn't shown it to be true.

658
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:49,722
I just...

659
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,267
I couldn't have you doubt me like that.
I just...

660
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,813
- I just needed you to believe me.
- Eva, of course I believe you.

661
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:03,027
I saw you move those mirror pieces.
You're capable of great things.

662
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,110
[sighs]

663
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:07,156
Look, when you're feeling better,
we will...

664
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,494
- We'll find another way.
- Yeah.

665
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,542
I think I have some more, uh,
bandages in the storage room.

666
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,420
- Could you get them?
- Yeah, of course.

667
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,190
What did you do to us?

668
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:45,069
I bought us time.
But there's no need for you to suffer.

669
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,961
[exhales]

670
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,174
Hmm.

671
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,179
[exhales forcefully]

672
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,027
All right. Easy-peasy.

673
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:41,125
He is...

674
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,794
[in hoarse voice] coming.

675
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:46,755
[breathing heavily]
