Anárion told me you deferred twice...

Anárion? What's your brother

00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:20,692
- Nothing.
- Well, slightly more than nothing.

Yes, you did when you got into a scrap

You are more than you claim.

united the scattered tribes

776

That's an odd thing to say
to a man in a cage.

777
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,608
A cage you have landed in because
you chafe under the rags of the common.

778
00:55:56,275 --> 00:55:59,650
And the armor that ought to rest
upon your shoulders

weighs upon your soul.

780

Be careful, Elf.

781
00:56:19,483 --> 00:56:22,817
The heir to this mark
is heir to more than just nobility.

782

For it was my family that lost the war.

And it was mine who started it.

Ours was no chance meeting.

790

Ours was the work of something greater.

791

You must see it.
