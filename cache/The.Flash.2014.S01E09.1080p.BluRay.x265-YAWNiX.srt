1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:07,132
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,802
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,896
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:25,484
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,160
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,412
It isn't a honeymoon without mai tais.

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,082
- Ronnie!
- Caitlin, whatever happens...

12
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,291
Ronnie!

13
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,545
I wanted him to be my husband.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,132
I have watched you be in love with Iris since
you were old enough to know what love is.

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,847
He killed my mom.

16
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,593
Hello! Hello there.

17
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,136
There's only two boxes left.

18
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,805
At this rate, we'll be finished by Easter.

19
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,268
Don't even.

20
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:48,442
Okay, the only red-suited dude
I want in this house right now...

21
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,611
Is Kris Kringle, you got it?

22
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,082
Uh, these ornaments
are not gonna hang themselves.

23
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,792
Grandma Esther's recipe.

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,795
- Light on the bourbon.
- Thank you.

25
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,883
I always loved her definition of "light."

26
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,219
And the Christmas tradition continues.

27
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,180
Detective West. Yeah?

28
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,642
All right.

29
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,314
Sorry, kids.
DA wants to ask me some questions.

30
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,025
Make sure there's nog left
when I get back.

31
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,610
No promises.

32
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,449
- What's happening?
- Heh.

33
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,950
Come on!

34
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,953
Come on. We're doing this already?
Christmas isn't for a few days.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,665
- I couldn't wait any longer. Here.
- Agh. Okay.

36
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,250
Oh, wait! Me first. Heh.

37
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,765
- My mother's wedding band?
- A replica, yeah.

38
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,184
You were devastated
when you lost the real one.

39
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,853
- Ouir fifth grade field trip to the zoo.
- To the zoo.

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,313
You cried for weeks.

41
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,149
Here.

42
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,325
- You remembered.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,287
Steel trap.

44
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,541
I don't know what to say. Oh.

45
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,295
- My gift sucks in comparison, by the way.
- No.

46
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,385
- All right!
- Heh-heh.

47
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:42,639
It's supposed to be the best on the market.
I thought you could use a new one.

48
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,766
- It's lame, I know.
- No!

49
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,685
No. This is great. I love it.

50
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,437
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

51
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,361
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, Barry.

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,114
Nice ring.

53
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,699
It's beautiful, isn't it?

54
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,827
It's an exact replica of my mom's.
Barry got it for me.

55
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,122
Very thoughtful, Bar.

56
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,669
- So are we tree-trimming?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,005
Come on.

58
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,635
Merry Christmas.

59
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:25,599
Just a small token of my gratitude
for everything you guys have done for me.

60
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:30,145
I think I speak on behalf of my colleagues
when I say you've been a gift for us, Barry.

61
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,354
What's that?

62
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,899
This is compliments of Iris.

63
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,151
Grandma Esther's famous eggnog.

64
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,236
That's what I'm talking about.

65
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,032
Ahem. Maybe later for me.
Wouldn't wanna drink and drive.

66
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,787
- Did I say something wrong?
- No.

67
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,538
No, man. He, um...

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,583
This used to be his favorite time
of the year...

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,462
but the accident happened before
Christmas, so it ruined the holidays.

70
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,090
I'm gonna go get him a present.
Maybe that will cheer him up.

71
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,426
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,970
What are you doing for Christmas, Cisco?

73
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,732
The fact I asked you for your shirt size
should in no way indicate...

74
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,152
that I am getting you something
shirt-related for Christmas.

75
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,364
Barry seemed a little odd today.

76
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,325
I'm pretty sure he wasn't psyched
I came by.

77
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,452
You ever think...

78
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,288
he maybe might...

79
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,749
- like you?
- Oh. What?

80
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,752
- No.
- Friends don't give friends wedding bands.

81
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,797
He wasn't...
He wasn't proposing to me, silly.

82
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,049
He and I are just best friends.

83
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,719
Well, then he won't be bothered by this.

84
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,598
A bit early...

85
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,851
but I couldn't wait.

86
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,778
I figured, we'd been together a year now.

87
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,948
You pretty much stay there most nights,
anyway.

88
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,077
I love you.

89
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,289
- That's a yes, I take it.
- Heh.

90
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,380
It was that
or Stephen Hawking's new autobiography...

91
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,341
and we both know how he feels
about Hawking.

92
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,053
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye, Cisco.

93
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,361
- Merry Christmas, doc.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

94
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,071
And to you.

95
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,574
Hey, doc, I know it's a big secret,
but can you give me a hint?

96
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,202
What exactly are you
working on in there?

97
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,663
The future.

98
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,626
Doctor, get inside. Lock down the facility.

99
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,524
Hey.

100
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,900
What are you thinking?

101
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,446
The blood-splatter patterns
and trajectory of the remains...

102
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,032
Only a high-speed collision
could have done this.

103
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,077
But to cause this type of damage
to a human in this space?

104
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,830
Whatever hit them
would have to have been moving fast.

105
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,290
Get this.

106
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,752
The witness says all he saw was a blur.
Sound familiar?

107
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,635
You saw a blur? What was it?

108
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,513
Whatever it was,
it was looking for something.

109
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,140
What did it look like?

110
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,351
Agh. Like a man...

111
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,478
in some kind of yellow suit.

112
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,397
Okay.

113
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,774
I have to check my files.

114
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,652
Joe, you heard him.
The man that killed my mom, he's back.

115
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,739
I know.
He's been in town for a few weeks now.

116
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:55,744
He paid a visit to me at the house.
He took the evidence from your mom's case.

117
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,496
- Why wouldn't you tell me this sooner?
- I couldn't.

118
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,709
- Why?
- Because he threatened to kill Iris.

119
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:16,598
The witness described seeing a yellow blur.
Just like the one that killed Barry's mother.

120
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,684
Then we need to get cracking
and stop this speed psycho.

121
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,187
That... I wasn't trying to give him a name.

122
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,940
The crime scene at Mercury Labs
was on a floor with highly secured vaults.

123
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:30,487
- Witness said he was looking for something.
- He wanted it badly enough to kill for it.

124
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,405
What do you know about Mercury Labs?

125
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:37,285
Mercury was one of S.T.A.R. Labs' major
competitors until our little setback...

126
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,455
and then it catapulted to the forefront,
led by...

127
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,834
Dr. Christina McGee,
brilliant but egocentric physicist.

128
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:50,131
It says here, Dr. McGee has secured half
a billion dollars in private funding...

129
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,803
to develop, and I quote, "prototypes
for the technology of the future."

130
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,054
Well, I'll be...

131
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,515
Tina's messing with tachyons.

132
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,185
- Superluminal particles.
- Of course.

133
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,021
So, what could someone do
with one of those...?

134
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,981
- Tachyons.
- Thank you.

135
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,151
Well, I don't know. Become invincible.

136
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:14,739
If you could devise a matrix stable enough
to harness their power, you could...

137
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,076
- travel faster than light.
- He's gonna try again.

138
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,870
We need to get what Mercury has
and use it as a lure.

139
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,665
Exactly right.
Cisco, Caitlin, start engineering a trap.

140
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,208
- You got it.
- Of course.

141
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,712
Thanks.

142
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,674
Iris.

143
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,301
Caitlin. What are you doing here?

144
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,013
- Oh. It's been a long day.
- It's only noon.

145
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,267
- I didn't sleep much last night.
- Well, me, either.

146
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,478
Um, so I was catching up on your blog...

147
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:51,484
and this story caught my eye about a man
whose head and hands burst into flames.

148
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,111
- The burning man.
- Yeah.

149
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,740
I haven't updated that story in a while,
but there are some reports I could send you.

150
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,826
That'd be great. Thank you.

151
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,411
Can I ask you something?

152
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,164
- Girl to girl?
- Sure.

153
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,125
Barry's been acting different
around me lately.

154
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,003
Like he's keeping
some sort of secret from me.

155
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,673
Is there anything that you know about
that I should know about?

156
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,301
Not that I can think of.

157
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,388
However, if you feel like
Barry's keeping something from you...

158
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,640
you should probably
just ask him yourself.

159
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,059
Yeah. Thanks.

160
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,228
Of course.

161
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,565
- Yes, I need some caffeine.
- Okay.

162
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,236
- Barry Allen. Thank you for coming in.
- Dr. Tina McGee.

163
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,780
I assume this is about
last night's break-in?

164
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,282
Yes and no.

165
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,784
That's usually how things are
with you, Harrison.

166
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,704
Whoever broke in was after
one of your prototypes.

167
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,498
You'll have to narrow that down.
We have hundreds of projects.

168
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,084
One containing tachyonic particles.

169
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,504
We've had encouraging success
with tachyons, yes...

170
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:58,343
but there's still a significant gap between
our prototype and any real-life application.

171
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:03,056
We were hoping you would lend us
your prototype to use as a lure.

172
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,142
Us? You're assisting
the police now, Harrison?

173
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,561
I'm a consultant on this particular case.

174
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,565
Listen, once this man is apprehended
your prototype will be promptly returned.

175
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,569
You know nobody wants to ensure
the future's technology more than me.

176
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,781
I appreciate the C.C.P.D.'s concerns,
Mr. Allen...

177
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,534
but Mercury is quite capable
of protecting its own assets.

178
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,578
Good luck with your manhunt.

179
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,549
Hey, Caitlin, check this out.

180
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,136
I think we can fashion
an electronic barrier. Right?

181
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,224
We set up a ton of super capacitors,
we smooth out the inflection points...

182
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,854
and voila, a kick-ass force field
to trap the Opposite Flash.

183
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,024
That was me testing out a name. Heh.

184
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,442
What do you think?

185
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,989
Are you okay?

186
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,327
Ronnie's alive.

187
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,371
I saw him, Cisco.

188
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,166
- I think he was following me...
- Caitlin.

189
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,336
Ronnie died.

190
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,882
He was vaporized in the accelerator
when it went critical.

191
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,721
Ronnie's alive,
and he's out there, alone and scared.

192
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,433
And I need your help to find him.

193
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,407
Ouch.

194
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,244
- Your bruise is already healing.
- Still hurts, though.

195
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,496
Not for much longer, honey.

196
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,665
Here, come on.

197
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,962
I'll keep the light on for you.

198
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,881
Were you ever afraid of the dark?

199
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,303
If I turn this light off now,
would you be scared?

200
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,556
- No.
- That's because I'm here with you.

201
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,726
See, you're not afraid of the dark, Barry.

202
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,228
You're afraid of being alone in the dark.

203
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,023
And that goes away
when you realize something.

204
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,984
You're never really alone.

205
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,488
Time for bed.

206
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,033
- I'm thirsty.
- Ah, now you're stalling.

207
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,243
But I got you covered, buddy.

208
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,536
Good night, slugger.

209
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,669
Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.

210
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,722
You can turn off the light.

211
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,032
Mom! Mom!

212
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,993
Noral

213
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,538
Barry! Heh.

214
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,375
I called your name, like...

215
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,003
Your mom's case.

216
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,297
I used to study this board every day.

217
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,928
Lately, I haven't looked at it
as much as I should have.

218
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,181
I didn't know you did that.

219
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,935
I guess there's still some stuff about me
you don't know.

220
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,568
Eddie asked me to move in with him.

221
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,404
I said yes. Heh.

222
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,865
Wow. Heh.

223
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,868
You guys are moving pretty fast, huh?

224
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,498
Well, I mean, it's been a year.

225
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,086
Eddie thought you might
feel weird about it. Heh.

226
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,965
Well, I don't...

227
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,259
Why would he say that?

228
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,890
He thinks that you like me.

229
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,183
Romantically.

230
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,187
I mean, honestly,
it sounds even silly suggesting it.

231
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,771
Um...

232
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,232
Eddie's wrong.

233
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,029
And if I've seemed weird before,
it's just that...

234
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,408
this year has gone by really fast...

235
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,412
and I didn't realize how far along
in your relationship you were.

236
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,289
Heh.

237
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,333
That's what I told him.

238
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,838
Well, I guess I should get going.

239
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,217
Bye.

240
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,549
It was you.

241
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,218
You were the one in my house that night.

242
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,846
You killed my mother!

243
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,473
Why?

244
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,642
If you wanna know that...

245
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,728
you're gonna have to catch me.

246
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,752
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

247
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,733
Not fast enough, Flash.

248
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,500
- Who are you?
- You know who I am, Barry.

249
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,177
I don't know who you are.

250
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:00,181
But you do, Barry.
We've been at this a long time, you and I.

251
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,391
But I'm always one step ahead.

252
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,776
It is your destiny to lose to me, Flash.

253
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,905
Just as it was your mother's destiny
to die that night.

254
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,173
He acted like he knew me,
like we'd done this before.

255
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,883
He was antagonizing you, Bar.

256
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,804
I would get close, and he'd pull away.
This was just some sick game to him.

257
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,931
You'll catch him, we'll help.

258
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,934
No, you don't get it, all right?
His speed, it's beyond me.

259
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,103
I'm not the fastest man alive. He is.

260
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,606
So how do we catch somebody
that even I can't keep up with?

261
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,193
The beautiful thing about force fields
is they're impervious to speed.

262
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,570
We're almost finished
fabricating the trap.

263
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,573
All that remains is for Detective West
to procure the bait.

264
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,367
I'm on it.

265
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,744
Barry, why don't you stay here?

266
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,123
No, Joe, today is not the day
to tell me to stay behind.

267
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,048
If the judge was gonna sign this,
he would've done so already.

268
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,886
You don't want this investigation to get
any more public than it's already been.

269
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:26,726
This has Harrison Wells written all over it.
I am not giving you my tachyon prototype.

270
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,938
It was quite the tour
of your facility, doctor.

271
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,733
You were fine
to let us dumb cops walk around...

272
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,985
but I majored in physics
and chemistry...

273
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,530
and I saw a lot of stuff that
Science Showcase Magazine would love.

274
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:44,702
So should I call their editors directly,
or just leave a few posts on their website?

275
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,706
You'll have the device within the hour.

276
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:55,004
I see why Harrison holds you in such
esteem, Mr. Allen. You're very much alike.

277
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,843
Nicely done.

278
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,724
- Hey, Joe, you got a second?
- Not now, Eddie.

279
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,435
I read the witness statement.
The Flash was there.

280
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:13,481
- I know you got something in the works.
- Yeah, but you don't want any part of this.

281
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,901
I got a task force approved to capture him,
and I want in.

282
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,528
I'm not asking permission, Joe.

283
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,738
Excuse me?

284
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,283
If my task force isn't part of this,
I'll go to Captain Singh.

285
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,370
I'll tell him something's going on
and you're not talking. I'm sorry.

286
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,706
You'd do the same thing if you were me.

287
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,084
Fine.

288
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,426
We follow the ionized particles,
and that should lead us right to him.

289
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,137
The CPM's are increasing.

290
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,392
We should have told Dr. Wells and Barry.

291
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,145
No, not until we're sure it's him.

292
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,607
Oh, wow.

293
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:02,780
Look, Ronnie is not
like you remembered him.

294
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:08,452
- What does that mean?
- Just don't freak out when you see him.

295
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,374
Oh, I really wish that was
because the batteries are dead.

296
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,718
Ronnie?

297
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,930
Ronnie.

298
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,891
It's me, Cait.

299
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,646
Look, I brought Cisco with me.
We're here to help you.

300
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,066
You were in an accident.
Do you remember?

301
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,696
I'm not Ronnie.

302
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,782
Yes, you are. You're Ronnie Raymond.

303
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,035
I'm not Ronnie. I told you that.

304
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,787
Now get away from me.

305
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,666
Look, we need to take you back
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

306
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,877
We'll help you remember who you are.

307
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,797
- Agh!
- Firestorm.

308
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,561
The tachyon device is in place.

309
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,689
- You think it'll work?
- It'll work.

310
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,570
So how do we advertise to him
that the prototype's here?

311
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,572
We'll take care of that.

312
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,661
What's the problem?

313
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,665
Look, Barry...

314
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,418
me and Dr. Wells have spoken...

315
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,422
and we think it would be best
if you weren't here for this.

316
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,300
What are you talking about?

317
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,470
- You're too close to this.
- Maybe you're not close enough.

318
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,431
If you hadn't been too scared
and warned me weeks ago...

319
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,558
I could have been prepared for this.

320
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,519
I think we can all appreciate
Joe's concern for Iris, Barry.

321
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,856
That's why I have to be here.
I'm the best chance at catching him.

322
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,108
Not right now, not in this state.

323
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:09,823
This man stabbed my mother through the
heart and sent my father to prison for it.

324
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,951
This is my fight.

325
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,786
Not today, son.

326
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,230
Caitlin...

327
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,316
don't worry.

328
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,026
Hey.

329
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,989
Now that we know he's out there,
we will find Ronnie again.

330
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,573
Why?

331
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,577
So we can throw him in there
with all the other metahuman psychos?

332
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,835
I used to play this game in my head.

333
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,881
What would I give up
for just one more minute with him?

334
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,096
My house, my career...

335
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,765
the rest of my life?

336
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,895
Today I finally got that minute.

337
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,024
And I wish I hadn't.

338
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,319
Seeing him like that, what he's become...

339
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,781
Dear God...

340
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,243
I wish he had just died that day.

341
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,435
Merry Christmas, slugger.

342
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,604
Merry Christmas.

343
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,192
You all right, Barry?

344
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,530
I screwed up, Dad.

345
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,577
After years of searching...

346
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,454
I finally found him.

347
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,041
I found the man who killed mom.

348
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,212
The man in yellow,
the one in the lightning.

349
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,591
He's out there, and I had him.

350
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,928
He got away.

351
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,808
I was so close.

352
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,856
I promised you
that I would get you out of here.

353
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,986
Every day you spent in here
has been because of him.

354
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,114
Until today.

355
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,702
Now you're in here because of me,
and I'm so sorry.

356
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,416
Barry.

357
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,919
Barry.

358
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,130
This is not your fault.

359
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,298
Look at me.

360
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,343
I know what you've given up.

361
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:21,598
Every decision you've made the past 14
years has been because of me and your mom.

362
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:26,520
What you studied, why you became a CSI,
even with Iris.

363
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,315
- Iris?
- You're my son.

364
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,318
You don't think I know how you love her?

365
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,071
But you never pursued her.

366
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,867
You were too consumed with
what had happened to me and your mom...

367
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,535
to let yourself have a life.

368
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,787
Well, let it go now, Barry.

369
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,081
Hear me now.

370
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,918
The man in the yellow suit...

371
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,256
he's taken enough from us already.

372
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,595
Don't let him take any more.

373
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,531
Hey.

374
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,284
Just in time. I am almost done.

375
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:28,457
Agh. Are there awards for tree-trimming?
Because this is award worthy.

376
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,503
Are you okay, Bar?

377
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,185
I love you, Iris.

378
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,479
Oh, I love you too.

379
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:02,032
When we were kids, I loved you before
I even knew what the word love meant.

380
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:07,621
And then my mom died, and I had
to go live with the girl I had a crush on.

381
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,461
Look...

382
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,631
there were so many times
that I wanted to tell you.

383
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,385
Junior prom,
when I went away to college...

384
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,888
when I came back from college,
nights that we stayed up talking...

385
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,349
all the birthdays, all the Christmases.

386
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,228
But I never did. I just... I kept it in.

387
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,857
After I lost my mom and my dad...

388
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,861
I was afraid
that if you didn't feel the same way...

389
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,697
I would lose you too.

390
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:47,244
That's the irony.
I was so scared of losing you that I did.

391
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,499
I know I've had our whole lives
to tell you this...

392
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:56,336
and you're with Eddie now, and I know
my timing couldn't be any worse...

393
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,796
but I just...

394
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,508
I couldn't lie to you anymore.

395
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,515
I'm sorry.

396
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,982
Okay.

397
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,288
Sending out another pulse.

398
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,626
You certain this trap will work?

399
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,004
I've sent up three
charges in open satellite.

400
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,758
If anyone's looking for tachyonic
particles, they'll know we got them.

401
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,526
Let's see what we caught.

402
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,044
Cisco, lights.

403
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,254
Sure thing, Dr. Wells.

404
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,056
Detective Thawne?

405
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,351
Would you like to read him his rights?

406
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,521
Joe, what are you doing?

407
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,315
Getting some answers.

408
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:47,239
Fourteen years ago,
you murdered Nora Allen.

409
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,117
I wanna know why. Why?

410
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,331
Dr. Wells, we meet at last.

411
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,167
What do you want
with the tachyonic particles?

412
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,753
My goals are beyond your understanding.

413
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,005
Oh, I don't know...

414
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,007
I'm a pretty smart guy.

415
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:10,512
I knew you were exceptionally fast. Any trap
we manufactured would have to be invisible.

416
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,683
I knew your cells could repair themselves
at extraordinary speed...

417
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,895
So you could withstand the damage
this is doing to your body right now.

418
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,274
The supercapacitors,
the containment field is fluctuating.

419
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,652
- They need to get out of there now.
- The reason I know all this...

420
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:30,115
Is because your powers are
almost exactly like those of the Flash.

421
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,742
Oh, I'm not like the Flash at all.

422
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,120
Some would say I'm the reverse.

423
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,666
Dr. Wells, evacuate. Get out of there now.

424
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,917
Dr. Wells!

425
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,093
Cisco, turn off the barrier!

426
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,013
That thing's gonna get out.

427
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,223
Cisco, he's gonna kill Wells!

428
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,068
Find him!

429
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,503
Don't move or we will shoot!

430
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,182
I warned you not to hunt me.

431
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,508
Barry!

432
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,401
Our race is not yet done.
See you soon, Flash.

433
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,079
Don't look for me again.

434
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,561
Why did it...

435
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,438
not kill me?

436
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,190
I don't know, Eddie.

437
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,985
But you know more
than you've been telling me.

438
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,211
They're called metahumans.

439
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,797
Metahumans?

440
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,469
People with very powerful abilities.

441
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,472
You and me...

442
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,768
are the only guys on the force
that know what's really going on.

443
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,646
And we need to keep it that way...

444
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,523
So nobody else gets hurt.

445
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,944
Can you do that?

446
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,412
And the Flash?

447
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,457
Do you know who he is?

448
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,341
Yeah, I do.

449
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:22,138
He's the guy
that saved both of our lives tonight.

450
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:36,152
I've been going over the data. I don't know
why the containment system failed.

451
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,279
I must have missed something.

452
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,700
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, Cisco.

453
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,870
But if you both feel a need
to apologize for something...

454
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,207
you might start with not telling me
that Ronnie is still alive.

455
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,169
I asked Cisco not to say anything.

456
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:58,591
Once I saw what Ronnie had become,
I needed...

457
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,929
I needed time to see
if I could make him whole again.

458
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,474
- I'm sorry. I know you're mad.
- No.

459
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,186
I don't know what I would have
done differently in your situation.

460
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,275
I know I've made you a lot of promises.

461
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,111
I know I've not been able to keep them all.

462
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,115
But on my life, I promise you this:

463
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,535
We will bring Ronnie home.

464
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,710
Hey, Bar.

465
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,174
You know, my mom traveled
around the world twice.

466
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,052
She spent a semester abroad in Spain.

467
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,766
She loved it so much that after
she graduated she went to Europe.

468
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:52,187
Didn't stop till she'd been
to a few dozen other cities.

469
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,650
She always wanted to go back,
but she never got a chance.

470
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,654
I offered to send you abroad
when you were in college.

471
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,992
Yeah, I know, I remember.

472
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,912
I couldn't take off.

473
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,665
I mean, the truth is...

474
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,460
I'm stuck here...

475
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,879
in Central City.

476
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,593
Fear has kept me in that living room
for 14 years.

477
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,766
Joe, I'm...

478
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,186
I was mad at you for being scared.

479
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,730
But...

480
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,235
I mean, the truth is,
I was the one that was scared.

481
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,615
I've been afraid of
the man in yellow for...

482
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,659
my whole life.

483
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,703
That's why I lost.

484
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:57,001
When you first moved in with us,
I thought it was gonna be too much.

485
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,296
I'm already a single dad...

486
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,175
finances were tough, and you were
a little boy who just lost his mother.

487
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,011
But, man, was I wrong.

488
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,265
Within two weeks you had changed
the dynamic of the house.

489
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,017
Suddenly the house was filled with this...

490
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,228
light...

491
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,647
this energy.

492
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,733
I mean, you brightened up everything.

493
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,279
You'd seen more darkness
than any man will in a lifetime...

494
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,656
and you never let it dim your soul.

495
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:33,788
So there I was thinking that
I'm changing your life by taking you in...

496
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,040
but the truth is...

497
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,795
you changed mine.

498
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,840
So don't lose that light now, Bar.

499
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,176
The world may need the Flash...

500
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,183
but I need my Barry Allen.

501
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,653
- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

502
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,625
- Hey!
- Hey.

503
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,377
- What are you guys doing here?
- I invited them.

504
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,380
Where's Dr. Wells?

505
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,966
Uh, he wasn't feeling up
to a social gathering...

506
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,302
but he appreciated the invitation.

507
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,096
- Eggnog?
- Yes.

508
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,977
- Merry Christmas, Barry.
- You too, Eddie.

509
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,521
Hey, I...

510
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,859
I just wanted to say...

511
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,029
I heard you're moving in together...

512
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,491
and I'm really happy for you.

513
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,869
Thanks.

514
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,289
Merry Christmas. Heh.

515
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,502
Mm.

516
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,714
A day like today, Grandma Esther's eggnog
seems a little light on the bourbon.

517
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,553
- Hey, Joe.
- Mm?

518
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,932
- I saw something weird tonight.
- Yeah, Cisco, I saw it too.

519
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,142
No, I mean...

520
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,146
when the Flash and the man in yellow
were going bumper cars on each other...

521
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,816
I was watching the electricity
coming off of them.

522
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,901
Yellow and red electricity.

523
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,277
When Barry was a kid...

524
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,906
he saw red and yellow lightning
in his house the night his mother died.

525
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,035
There were two of them.

526
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,540
The man in yellow
may have killed Barry's mother...

527
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,835
but there was another speedster there
that night.

528
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,549
Dad, it's time.

529
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,557
Okay, let's see.

530
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,051
Merry Christmas.

531
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:23,075
