1
00:00:00,688 --> 00:00:02,121
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,123 --> 00:00:04,891
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:08,700
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:11,703
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:14,820
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:17,209
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:21,079
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:23,949
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:26,265
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:28,262
Previously on “The Flash”...

11
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:29,697
I stabbed your mother in the heart

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,232
and I was free.

13
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:32,667
Eddie is his ancestor.

14
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,201
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born.

15
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:36,170
He's being erased from existence.

16
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:37,872
- Gideon?
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

17
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,607
- Where the hell am I?
- I was accepted

18
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:42,732
into the forensic science program
at Midway City University.

19
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:43,889
I'm leaving Central City.

20
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,358
Joe, you have a son.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,293
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

22
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:48,894
These races? That's the only way

23
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,529
that I can pay for my
mom's hospital bills.

24
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:52,398
Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her.

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,633
Daddy? Please help me.

26
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,101
Don't let him take me back there.

27
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,570
I would do anything to get you back.

28
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:02,742
There are many reasons why we run,

29
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:06,412
but usually it's to avoid
what's right in front of us...

30
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:07,713
A decision to be made

31
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:09,815
or a dilemma we have to face.

32
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:14,654
Lately, for me, it feels like
running is all I've been doing.

33
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:16,222
What you got for me, Cisco?

34
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:18,257
You've been playing Good
Samaritan all morning.

35
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,625
Take a break.

36
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:21,661
Are you sure you don't
want to get to CCPD,

37
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:24,015
- give Patty your attention?
- No, I can see her later.

38
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:25,731
'Cause we cannot afford
to waste any more time.

39
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,066
What, 'cause we've just been

40
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,734
sipping Mai Tais since you got here?

41
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:30,302
I don't know what you been
sipping since I got here,

42
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:32,271
but Barry needs to get
better, stronger, faster.

43
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:34,507
We need to train to prepare for Zoom.

44
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,941
Oh, I see.

45
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:37,677
You haven't had your coffee this morning.

46
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:39,445
I had my coffee this morning.
Don't slurp.

47
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,880
Don't. Don't.

48
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:44,083
Don't.

49
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:48,821
Runaway chemical transport
truck heading south on Kester.

50
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:50,089
On it.

51
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,008
Hey, I can't stop the truck!

52
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,510
Somebody rigged it!

53
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:12,845
Sorry!

54
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:14,480
You can't let that truck crash.

55
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:15,915
If you do, you'll take
out a whole city block.

56
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,116
Great. Thank you.

57
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:19,385
Thank you for that.

58
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,190
That was close, that was close.

59
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:26,625
Oh, and the plot thickens.

60
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:27,993
Uh, dead-end up ahead.

61
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:29,195
You got to get out of there!

62
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:30,321
Oh, come on.

63
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,109
Yes!

64
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:53,352
That one was a little close.

65
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:56,796
Nice! Now can you please,
please take a break?

66
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,727
- How's that for training?
- Great.

67
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:02,528
Look, we're gonna catch Zoom.

68
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,363
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

69
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,365
All we got to do is use him
to figure out how to steal

70
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:09,268
Zoom's speed and then we'll
get your daughter back.

71
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,570
That might take longer than we thought.

72
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:12,321
Why's that?

73
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,673
Because Turtle's dead.

74
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,979
Barry, we need you back here stat.

75
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:21,347
All right. I'm on my way.

76
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,486
Gideon.

77
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:29,523
Was the trip a success, Professor Thawne?

78
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:34,626
I believe it was. I've finally figured
out what time period The Flash is from.

79
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:37,642
Now let's figure out a way to get home.

80
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,703
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

81
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:46,281
He better not be pulling a Juliet.

82
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:49,341
Yeah, that's right. I see plays.

83
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:52,244
- He's dead, Cisco.
- How'd this happen?

84
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:55,314
Preliminary brain scan shows
an acute brain aneurysm.

85
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:58,250
The night we captured him.
How's that for timing?

86
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:01,387
What does that mean? You
think I did this, Garrick?

87
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,823
This man is the key to us stopping Zoom,

88
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:05,124
the key to me saving my daughter.

89
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:06,559
Why would I want that?

90
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,527
Never understood why you
do anything, Harrison.

91
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,629
That's fine with me, Garrick.

92
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,883
Guys, look.

93
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,234
We need to figure out how to stop Zoom.

94
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:17,136
Everything we've tried so far has failed.

95
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:18,771
We need to start thinking
outside the box.

96
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:20,072
I mean, we haven't even figured out how

97
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:21,373
to close the breaches yet.

98
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,808
Maybe that's where we should start.

99
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,176
That's a good idea.

100
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:26,078
- I'll get on that.
- I'll help.

101
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:29,415
I've got to get to the CCPD.

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,406
I'll check in with you guys later.

103
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:31,313
Okay.

104
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,688
Every time you think that
Wells is on your team,

105
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,368
something happens that
makes you doubt it.

106
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:44,096
Hey, I just wanted to see if you
could run this trace for me.

107
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:46,432
Someone messed with an ethanol
transport truck this morning.

108
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:49,454
They cut the brake line and
tampered with the gear shafts.

109
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:51,016
Okay, yeah.

110
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:52,629
Okay.

111
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:55,546
Wow. Backed up, huh?

112
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:57,531
I am, yeah.

113
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:00,412
Yeah, I guess I'll find
out what that's like

114
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:01,947
once I finish CSI school.

115
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,227
Yeah, you will.

116
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:04,508
- Yeah.
- I guess.

117
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:08,287
Look, Barry, I know that you're upset,

118
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,875
but I was hoping it wouldn't
be like this between us.

119
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:13,219
Uh...

120
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:16,774
I mean, what did you think
it was gonna be like?

121
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:21,000
I ju... I just thought we could
at least talk before I left.

122
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:22,902
You're moving. I don't know.

123
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:27,041
I mean, it just doesn't feel like
there's much to talk about now, right?

124
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,711
I guess not.

125
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,914
Hi.

126
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,430
- Hey.
- Hey.

127
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:43,589
I sort of overheard some of that.

128
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:45,958
Mm-hmm. Um...

129
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,427
Patty's going to CSI
school in Midway City.

130
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:50,729
She's moving in two days.

131
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:52,765
I mean, you don't have to let her leave.

132
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,300
She's wanted to be a CSI her whole life.

133
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:55,969
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.

134
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:57,336
Hey.

135
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,408
What's wrong?

136
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,141
Just went to see Francine and, uh...

137
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:06,612
she doesn't have much time.

138
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:08,375
I already said my good-byes, if...

139
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:10,641
If you want to do the same.

140
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:22,821
It's not gonna work.

141
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:27,235
Closing the breaches, that's
like solving Einstein's riddle.

142
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,493
I solved Einstein's
riddle when I was ten.

143
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,103
Yeah, well, maybe Earth-2 Einstein

144
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:32,504
wasn't as clever as ours.

145
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:34,438
You realize this Earth
is my Earth-2, right?

146
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:37,735
Listen to this.

147
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:42,748
What if we can figure out
how to control my powers?

148
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,950
We could find Zoom, get the jump on him.

149
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:47,319
That's a good idea. You
should get on that.

150
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:48,821
I need your help, Harry.

151
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:50,589
What you need, Ramon,

152
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:52,324
is to figure out what
triggers your vibes.

153
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:54,360
Exactly, and I don't
know what triggers them.

154
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:56,095
It's completely inconsistent.
Sometimes it's when I touch

155
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:59,264
something that belongs to a breacher,
sometimes it just happens.

156
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,600
There's always a cause. Cause, effect.

157
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:03,135
Doesn't take Einstein to figure that out.

158
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:05,404
Okay, so what is the cause?

159
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:06,939
You saw when I tried to vibe Dr. Light,

160
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:10,059
when I tried to vibe you,
took a while to work.

161
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:12,915
Yes.

162
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:15,571
Yes, it did.

163
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:17,485
Meet me in the Time Vault.

164
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,008
For what?

165
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:28,560
Hello?

166
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:32,211
Hello?

167
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:36,165
Harry?

168
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,342
Of course, now he's gonna make me wait

169
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:46,545
in this freaky-ass braille room.

170
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:51,183
Hi, Cisco.

171
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:53,252
Stop! Don't do that!

172
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:56,586
I figured out your trigger.

173
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:00,257
A rush of adrenaline.

174
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,633
Dopamine floods the brain.

175
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,967
And the quickest way to
achieve that result...

176
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:12,040
Fear!

177
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:17,242
Do not move!

178
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:18,024
You can't be.

179
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:33,292
What did you see?

180
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:36,361
The Reverse-Flash.

181
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:37,293
He's here.

182
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,226
Oh, my God!

183
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:52,461
Christina McGee.

184
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,841
Who are you?

185
00:08:54,843 --> 00:08:57,143
You're coming with me.

186
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:58,177
Flash.

187
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,429
Eobard Thawne.

188
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,514
You know who I am?

189
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:03,516
You died!

190
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:05,318
Good to know.

191
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,186
And guess what, Flash.

192
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,547
I know what time period you're from.

193
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:15,294
So that means very soon... you will die.

194
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:28,875
No.

195
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,031
You okay, Bar?

196
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:33,846
I'm good, yeah. It's just a lot.

197
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,216
Eddie Thawne died, so Eobard Thawne

198
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:40,186
should have been erased
out of existence, right?

199
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:41,805
Not necessarily.

200
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,490
It's possible Eobard was
in the Speed Force,

201
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:46,926
protecting him like a bomb shelter,

202
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:48,661
keeping him alive and
his time line intact.

203
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:50,730
It's what's known as a
“time line remnant”"

204
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:52,231
A what now?

205
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,934
Here, let me... show you.

206
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:56,736
This?

207
00:09:56,738 --> 00:10:00,606
This... is now.

208
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:02,375
Here, today.

209
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:06,045
This is the time Thawne comes from.

210
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:10,183
This is the moment you all
erased him from existence,

211
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:12,585
but since Thawne is from the future,

212
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:15,721
this is where his time line begins.

213
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:17,523
That's why he's still alive.

214
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,258
This Thawne has not yet traveled back

215
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,860
in time to kill Barry's mother.

216
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:23,029
He's here now in this time
period for the first time.

217
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,597
“Time line remnant.”

218
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,299
Explains why nothing's changed.

219
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,609
Yeah, it also explains why
he didn't know my name

220
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,647
or that we have met before.

221
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,738
To him, you hadn't. Not until the future.

222
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,242
If Thawne dies before he
can time travel again,

223
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,610
will that save Barry's mother?

224
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:40,179
No. That's not how it works.

225
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:42,582
In our time line, Barry's
mother is already dead,

226
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,950
and her death is a fixed point.

227
00:10:43,952 --> 00:10:45,218
Nothing can change that.

228
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,986
All right, well, I'm gonna end this,

229
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:49,088
him, in this time once and for all.

230
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,090
Let's find Dr. McGee,
then we'll figure out

231
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,793
what to do about Thawne, okay?

232
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:55,962
I got to go check on Iris.

233
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,141
Ramon.

234
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,204
Caitlin, I know you're
worried about Dr. McGee,

235
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,772
but we're gonna get her back.

236
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:08,664
It's not that. It's Jay.

237
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:09,842
What about Jay?

238
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:12,645
He's sick, and it's getting worse.

239
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:15,181
When Zoom stole his speed,

240
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:18,351
it affected him on a cellular level.

241
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,187
We need to do something about it.

242
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:21,587
All right, like what?

243
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,490
I think we should replace his dying cells

244
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:27,211
with healthy ones
indistinguishable from his.

245
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,262
How do we do that?

246
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:31,697
We find his Earth-1 doppelganger.

247
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:35,234
There.

248
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,669
Tachyons?

249
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,505
A man in a yellow suit tried to steal

250
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:43,075
another tachyon prototype last year.

251
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,077
I must have gotten stuck here once before

252
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,514
and not been able to access
enough of the Speed Force.

253
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:49,815
Tachyons should do it.

254
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,250
I want you to isolate and accelerate

255
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,885
their energetic properties for me.

256
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:54,453
I don't know if I can do that.

257
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:03,029
If you want to stay alive...

258
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:04,397
learn.

259
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,148
Franny.

260
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:18,422
Hey.

261
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,779
How you feeling today?

262
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,906
Better now.

263
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,781
I'm gonna let you two talk, okay?

264
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:29,195
Okay.

265
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,832
Can I get you anything?

266
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,867
Oh, just that brother of yours

267
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:45,297
so all of us can be together
for the first time.

268
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,453
Yeah, he should be here.

269
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:50,703
His mother is leaving him.

270
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,836
Can't blame him for
being angry about that.

271
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,687
I just wish he'd get all that anger out

272
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,640
while I'm here to help.

273
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:02,851
Same thing goes for you, Iris.

274
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,925
One thing you learn when you're dying

275
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:09,187
is not to hold anything back.

276
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:13,206
You want to say something to me?

277
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:16,769
You need to say it while you can.

278
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:29,453
I have so many great memories
from when I grew up.

279
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:33,085
Now when I think about those memories,

280
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,920
I can only wonder what
it would have been like

281
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:36,969
if you and Wally would have been there.

282
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm not angry at you
anymore for what happened.

283
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:48,067
I just wish you would have
come back to us a lot sooner.

284
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,333
Because I would have forgiven you then...

285
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,145
just like I'm forgiving you now.

286
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:58,511
Mm.

287
00:13:58,513 --> 00:13:59,478
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,841
Thank you. Thank you.

289
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,565
I don't know why this is so hard.

290
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,267
I barely even know her.

291
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,709
The facial recognition
software at S.T.A.R. Labs

292
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,211
didn't find anything either.

293
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:34,246
No, but there's still
more databases to check.

294
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,681
We'll find his doppelganger.

295
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:37,049
- Thanks, Barry.
- Yeah.

296
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,871
Hey. Hi, Caitlin.

297
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,021
Hi.

298
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,355
Uh, can we... talk?

299
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:44,990
Uh, yeah, yeah, for sure.

300
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:46,959
Um, I'll let you know what I find.

301
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,215
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

302
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:50,278
What's up?

303
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:53,899
I didn't know you were
working with S.T.A.R. Labs.

304
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,246
Yeah, um, uh, yeah.

305
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,753
Joe and I help out every once in a while.

306
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,073
Really?

307
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,176
Yeah, I probably shouldn't tell you this,

308
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:07,995
but there's a lot of weird
stuff that happens over there.

309
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:13,206
Is that what you came to tell me?

310
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,890
Um...

311
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:21,667
You're just rolling with the
whole “me leaving” thing.

312
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,064
Yeah, well, I don't know
what to tell you, Patty.

313
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:29,568
Everyone in my life that I
love leaves at some point.

314
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,403
Kind of getting used to it.

315
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:35,288
You... never told me you loved me.

316
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:39,245
Yeah, I guess I don't
get that chance now.

317
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:41,372
I don't understand.

318
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,350
What is it? What's going on with you?

319
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:45,951
Why are you being like this?

320
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:48,854
My life is complicated,
and I don't want you

321
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:50,189
to have regrets, all right?

322
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:51,991
I don't want you to miss out

323
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,093
on something that you've
always wanted to do.

324
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:58,497
And I wish that things were different

325
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,107
for both of us.

326
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,458
You know, but they're not.

327
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,805
Sorry.

328
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:09,857
Me too.

329
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:26,692
So what did you do to my goggles?

330
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,195
I added a wavelength trigger

331
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,631
to stimulate the fear
receptors in your brain.

332
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:35,801
Then I took what you already
had to induce slow-wave sleep,

333
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,970
upgraded it to get you
to stage-four sleep.

334
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:39,338
No, this is good.

335
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,168
- This will give us more control.
- Okay.

336
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,842
Now I'll be able to dictate
how long you vibe for.

337
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:45,466
Put 'em on.

338
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,112
What am I gonna see?

339
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:49,114
I don't know. Never done this before.

340
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:51,966
You'll have to tell me so I can
steer you where you need to be.

341
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:56,638
Ramon, you want to find Reverse-Flash,

342
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,075
put on the goggles.

343
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,482
- Okay.
- Attaboy.

344
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:08,982
Go ahead.

345
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,945
Oh-ho-ho, yeah, man.

346
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:22,314
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

347
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:24,583
- What do you see?
- It's hard to explain.

348
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,552
It's different events.

349
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:28,387
Different events in time.

350
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:31,090
Concentrate on The Reverse-Flash.

351
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,225
Okay.

352
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,496
I see him.

353
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:39,698
Move toward him.

354
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,669
Okay, now what?

355
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:48,274
Try to picture him with Christina McGee.

356
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,243
Where the hell am I?

357
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:54,580
It's charged. You can go now.

358
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:56,649
You said you'd release me.

359
00:17:56,651 --> 00:17:59,218
Yes, I did. Didn't I?

360
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,096
No!

361
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:10,885
Well, what is it?

362
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:13,878
She's dead.

363
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,193
Dr. McGee is dead?

364
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:26,091
Harry and I were trying to
hone my powers to find Zoom,

365
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:28,573
and then we ended up using them,
finding The Reverse-Flash,

366
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,326
and that's when I saw him kill her.

367
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,662
And then he left.

368
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:35,464
He left? What do you mean, he left?

369
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:38,100
McGee built him some
kind of speed machine

370
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,869
and he ran into and got
flung back to the future.

371
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,907
You'd need superluminal energy
to send someone through time.

372
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,176
- You mean like tachyons?
- Tachyons.

373
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:50,712
We can track their location
once they've been activated.

374
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,717
Anything? Nothing.

375
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,653
Cisco, you're sure that's what you saw?

376
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:59,254
- I'm positive.
- All right.

377
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:00,756
What else did you see?

378
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:02,558
There was all sorts of
weird tech everywhere.

379
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,892
There was a clock.

380
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,563
What time did the clock say?

381
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:09,097
9:52, I think.

382
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,399
How... how is that relevant?

383
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:13,902
It's 6:00 now.

384
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,871
Are you telling me I can see the future?

385
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:17,372
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

386
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,208
Those goggles are getting
named immediately.

387
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,009
But that means Dr. McGee is alive.

388
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:22,711
- That's right.
- Yeah, okay.

389
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:25,781
We have 3 hours, 52 minutes to
find her and stop Reverse-Flash.

390
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:27,049
Let's do it.

391
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,254
- Spivot.
- Hey.

392
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,022
Can't get away from
those case files, huh?

393
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:36,225
Oh, just following up on a hunch.

394
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:38,107
You're gonna miss the action, right?

395
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:40,020
Maybe. A little.

396
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,317
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Miss you too.

397
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,536
- It's nice to know someone will.
- Wait, we talking about Barry?

398
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:49,638
'Cause it sounds like we're
talking about Barry.

399
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,607
He kept telling me there was stuff

400
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:54,643
he couldn't share with me and
I've been going a little crazy

401
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:56,411
trying to figure out what that stuff is.

402
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:59,685
Yeah, Barry's not great at sharing.

403
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:02,451
- Neither are you.
- What do you mean?

404
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,486
Barry just told me that, you know,

405
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:08,257
sometimes he helps you out with S.T.A.R.
Labs stuff.

406
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:10,859
Yeah, he does when he has
a few extra minutes.

407
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,294
I didn't know that.

408
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,329
I mean, the whole time
I've been working here

409
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:19,268
you never mentioned it to me,
but then I realized why.

410
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,004
I went through some of Barry's old cases.

411
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:25,307
All of them involved The
Flash saving the day

412
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:30,312
with details that Barry couldn't
have possibly even known.

413
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,681
That's weird.

414
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:35,632
Yeah, it... It is weird.

415
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,207
The only thing that does make sense

416
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,990
is that Barry is The Flash.

417
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,261
Have you ever seen Barry run?

418
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:45,928
He waddles like a slow-ass duck.

419
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,596
There's no way he's The Flash, Patty.

420
00:20:47,598 --> 00:20:49,131
You know, when I started this job,

421
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:52,067
you told me I had to learn
how to lie to do it.

422
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:54,202
You're a terrible liar, Joe.

423
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:57,333
See you.

424
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,983
Nice nitrous kit.

425
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:09,451
You're gonna get caught
one of these days.

426
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:11,325
You know that, right? Get thrown in jail?

427
00:21:12,222 --> 00:21:14,825
I'll stop racing when these
hospital bills stop coming in.

428
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,479
I saw Mom today. She says you
haven't been by in a while.

429
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:19,661
Yeah, she knows why.

430
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,385
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

431
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:23,799
I have every right to be angry.

432
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:26,201
Nothing for 20 years,
then out of nowhere,

433
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,270
she tells me I have a sister, I have...
I have a father.

434
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:30,672
Yeah, the same thing happened
to me too, remember?

435
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:32,341
But that shouldn't keep
you from seeing her

436
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:33,677
before you can't anymore.

437
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:36,445
No. Look... that's not what it is.

438
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,252
Then what is it, Wally?

439
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:39,471
I got to go.

440
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,411
Last year, my fiancé died...

441
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,075
unexpectedly.

442
00:21:48,993 --> 00:21:52,778
One moment he was here, the next... gone.

443
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,565
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye to him,

444
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,473
to tell everything he meant to me,

445
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:00,278
That he was my world...

446
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:03,020
that he was loved.

447
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:06,942
But today I got to say
good-bye to your mom.

448
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:08,302
My mom.

449
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,246
And it helped us both find peace

450
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,989
with what happened to our family.

451
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,150
Wally, don't make a mistake
you're gonna regret

452
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:17,085
the rest of your life.

453
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,622
Go see your mom while you still can.

454
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,433
No sign of tachyon activity.

455
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:33,602
We're running out of time.
We've got to find them.

456
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,637
It'll take a few minutes for
the device to reach full power

457
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:37,105
once it's activated, but when we find it,

458
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,007
you're gonna have to get there fast.

459
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,701
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah?

460
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:43,751
Have you found out anything
else about Jay's doppelganger?

461
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,640
There's no Jay Garrick on this Earth.

462
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:49,631
That's so weird. Everyone
has a doppelganger.

463
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,759
Maybe just ask Jay.

464
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:53,596
He's a good guy.

465
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:56,425
Just ask him. I'm sure he'll tell you.

466
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:57,982
Okay.

467
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,388
Hey. Hold on.

468
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:01,982
What's up?

469
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:06,702
We got a problem. Patty
knows you're The Flash.

470
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:08,437
- What?
- She caught me off guard.

471
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:10,806
I mean, I played it off, but
come on, she's a smart girl.

472
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,107
Anyway, she was going
through some case files

473
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:13,341
and you were acting all squirrely.

474
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:14,910
This is my fault now?

475
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:16,878
- No, it's nobody's fault.
- Oh, my God.

476
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:19,382
- Maybe you should tell her.
- No.

477
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:21,583
- Patty's trustworthy.
- It's not even about that, Joe.

478
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:25,387
I-I don't want another person
that Zoom or Reverse-Flash

479
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:28,757
or any of these meta-humans
can use against me.

480
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,827
I don't want it. Patty
can't get hurt over this.

481
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,575
Tachyons! 87th and Avenue J.

482
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:42,437
Must be one of Mercury
Labs' off-site facilities.

483
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,638
Hack into their se...

484
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,207
I've hacked in the security feed.

485
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:47,275
- And once that...
- I'm one step ahead of you.

486
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,163
Uh-oh.

487
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,015
Barry, hurry up!

488
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,051
It's charged.

489
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:59,554
You can go now.

490
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:02,224
You said you'd release me.

491
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:05,026
Yes, I did. Didn't I?

492
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:09,131
He's gonna kill her.

493
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:20,509
- You okay?
- Yeah.

494
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:21,777
Okay, get out of here, all right?

495
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:23,578
Go! Go!

496
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:29,538
That was my way home!

497
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:32,454
You're not going anywhere.

498
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,688
You haven't won here, Flash.

499
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,123
I'll find another way back.

500
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:44,027
You're gonna have to
get through me first.

501
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:46,229
You really think you're
fast enough to stop me?

502
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,798
Let's find out.

503
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
Catch me if you can.

504
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:55,005
Oh, it's on.

505
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:11,921
Get him, Bar.

506
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:24,401
Not fast enough, Thawne.

507
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,102
I will never lose to you again.

508
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:35,845
This war between us, it ends now!

509
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:40,250
Bar, you got to stop!

510
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:42,919
Bar, don't kill him! Just bring him in!

511
00:25:50,462 --> 00:25:51,494
Get the cell ready.

512
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,368
Hey, he can't...?

513
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:03,073
Phase his way out? No, he can't do that.

514
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,175
It's the same cell we used to hold Dr.
Wells last year.

515
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:06,910
Barry, where you going?

516
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:08,730
- I'm going down there.
- No, you're not.

517
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:10,847
The more he learns about you,

518
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:12,248
the more you will alter the time line.

519
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,917
He killed my mom!

520
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,418
He's from the future. He
hasn't done that yet.

521
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,686
He doesn't even know you're The Flash,

522
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,121
and you need to keep it that way.

523
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:19,255
You already said that his mother's

524
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:20,757
gonna die no matter what we do.

525
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,992
There's ramifications
any time anybody messes

526
00:26:22,994 --> 00:26:24,794
with the time line, and
it's impossible to predict

527
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:26,930
what those ramifications are going to be.

528
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,998
Barry, you caught him and you stopped him

529
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,534
from killing Dr. McGee.

530
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,470
In my book, that's a win.

531
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:35,138
This doesn't feel like a win.

532
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,742
I got to go.

533
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,030
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?

534
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:59,968
My dad had multiple sclerosis.

535
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:04,067
Every day for years, I watched

536
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:09,339
this amazingly strong man fight
for his life... and lose.

537
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:13,943
So, I can't sit by and watch
another man I care about

538
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:17,347
fight for his life and not
do something about it.

539
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:19,349
I tried to find your doppelganger.

540
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:22,096
Same DNA, same cellular structure.

541
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:26,827
I could replace your dying
cells with his living ones.

542
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,496
But... you don't have a
doppelganger on this Earth.

543
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:35,171
Caitlin, there is a good explanation.

544
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:38,201
Meet me at Hofherr Park
tomorrow and I'll show you.

545
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:39,536
Why can't you just tell me?

546
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:41,546
Because you need to see for yourself.

547
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,888
How'd you get your suit in your ring?

548
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,024
Who are you?

549
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,659
My name is Cisco Ramon.

550
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:05,094
And we know each other well, don't we?

551
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:06,396
We have a history together.

552
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:07,664
You could say that.

553
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,766
And that's all you want to know?

554
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,635
How I got my suit in my ring?

555
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:15,705
I want you to know that I'm the one

556
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:18,241
who figured out you were back.

557
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:21,010
I helped stop you.

558
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:23,079
Me.

559
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,214
And how'd you do that?

560
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:27,317
I have powers.

561
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,954
And I helped track you down
and I put you in here.

562
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:36,125
That's quite the ability
you've been given.

563
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:39,529
And here's what's so ironic about it.

564
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:41,764
You gave me these powers.

565
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:47,837
Have fun thinking about that
while you rot away ithis cell

566
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,941
that you helped me build.

567
00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:53,343
Bye, Felicia.

568
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,781
Hey.

569
00:29:21,072 --> 00:29:22,138
Hey.

570
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,506
Got your text.

571
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,575
I wasn't sure that you would see me,

572
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,644
considering you've been
avoiding me lately.

573
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:30,593
Patty, I haven't been avoiding you.

574
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:34,132
No, just, uh, busy...

575
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:37,335
you know, speeding around Central City.

576
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:42,792
- I know you're The Flash, Barry.
- Patty, come on.

577
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:44,794
Please don't make me feel any more stupid

578
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:46,229
than I already do.

579
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,897
Look, I'm a detective and
I should have known.

580
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:50,767
I was just... I was so smitten with you.

581
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,702
Okay, look, what...

582
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,452
What you're saying, it's insane.

583
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:57,106
Look, you don't have to
lie to me anymore, okay?

584
00:29:57,108 --> 00:30:01,010
I understand... I understand why
you didn't want to tell me.

585
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:02,512
I understand why you've been distant.

586
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:04,180
Look, I understand everything.

587
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:06,149
But just tell me the truth now.

588
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:07,750
Just be honest with me.

589
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:12,588
Just... admit to me you're
The Flash and I'll stay.

590
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,058
I can't do that. I'm not him.

591
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:21,223
It's too bad. It would
have been nice to stay.

592
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:23,966
Fight crime during the day

593
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:25,768
and be with you at night.

594
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,570
But I was... I was wrong.

595
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:28,771
Take care, Barry.

596
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,929
Is that you, Flash?

597
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:47,663
Why do you hate me so much?

598
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,210
I didn't always.

599
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:55,998
I was obsessed with you.

600
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,209
For so long, I wanted to be The Flash.

601
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:02,574
I spent years figuring
out how you came to be.

602
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:07,843
Duplicated the reaction... and it worked.

603
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,123
I became like you.

604
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:13,765
Right, so what happened?

605
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:19,077
This ability to travel through
time revealed a truth.

606
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:23,092
My fate was to become
your greatest enemy.

607
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:25,600
I was never going to be The Flash,

608
00:31:25,637 --> 00:31:28,638
so I became the reverse of
everything that you were.

609
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:32,835
The more people you saved,
the more you were loved,

610
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:34,904
the more I had to take from you.

611
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:38,061
That is why you killed my mother?

612
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:40,819
That's why you ruined my life?

613
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,380
Because you couldn't be me?

614
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:46,155
I became better than you!

615
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,855
I am the one thing you
cannot stop, Flash!

616
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:55,458
No, no, no.

617
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,926
Not anymore.

618
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,983
Our race is over.

619
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:00,882
And you lost.

620
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:05,902
I've learned what time
period you're from, Flash.

621
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:10,006
And one day soon, I'll learn your name.

622
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:15,148
We need you in the cortex now!

623
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,853
What's happening?

624
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:25,087
He's experiencing an
uncontrollable amount

625
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:26,756
of electrical energy in his brain,

626
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:28,958
putting him in a prolonged
state of chronic seizing.

627
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:30,183
What? Can you stop it?

628
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:31,514
I don't know.

629
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:41,204
- Hold him down!
- We're trying!

630
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:43,172
- Sedate him, Snow, now!
- Come on! Come on!

631
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:45,208
Benzodiazepine. This should do it.

632
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:51,796
Finally.

633
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:53,913
Oh!

634
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:56,116
What? What was that?

635
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:58,251
What's going on? Where the hell am I?

636
00:32:58,253 --> 00:32:59,986
- Cisco!
- It's the time line.

637
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:01,588
What? What are you talking about?

638
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,890
When you... when you
captured Reverse-Flash,

639
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:05,458
we ruptured the time line.
That's what this...

640
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,961
All the blood and the
seizures and that and all...

641
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:10,664
Cisco is being affected to... to...

642
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,265
By the changes to the time line.

643
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:14,000
The changes to the past or the
changes to the present...

644
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:15,468
This is what this is. We
need to do something.

645
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,270
- We need to do it fast.
- Like what?

646
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:18,605
We need to restore the time line.

647
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:20,607
Barry, you need to get Reverse-Flash

648
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:22,609
and send him back to the
future as quickly as possible.

649
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:24,144
- What? Are you...
- Barry...

650
00:33:24,146 --> 00:33:25,779
I just caught him! You
want me to let him go?

651
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:27,814
Keeping him here is killing Cisco!

652
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:29,516
Barry, if this is the
only way we can save him,

653
00:33:29,518 --> 00:33:30,884
you got to do it!

654
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,686
Of Thawne! I can't.

655
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:34,287
Okay, all right, look.

656
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:36,389
I destroyed the tachyon
drive in the speed machine.

657
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,991
There's no way it'll
reach a speed necessary

658
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:39,159
to send him back home.

659
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:40,694
- You can.
- What?

660
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:42,962
Your speed coupled with Thawne's speed,

661
00:33:42,964 --> 00:33:45,398
that'll be enough to catapult
him through the time continuum.

662
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,766
You can do it.

663
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:50,837
All right. All right.

664
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:53,173
Let's do it. Let's do it.

665
00:33:58,413 --> 00:33:59,479
Time to send you home.

666
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,882
The time paradox. Yeah.

667
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:04,757
You've all messed with something
you don't understand.

668
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,754
Can you do me a favor and just shut up?

669
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,760
And how exactly are you
going to send me home?

670
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:14,975
Don't worry about it.

671
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:17,327
You fixed Dr. McGee's tachyon device?

672
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,000
No, I came up with a different method.

673
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:25,238
Is that so?

674
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,340
Uh-huh.

675
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:28,408
Who are you?

676
00:34:32,814 --> 00:34:36,850
No one of consequence.

677
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:39,452
No.

678
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:40,620
I doubt that.

679
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:48,061
I win again, Flash.

680
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:51,231
All you have to do is provide
him with enough momentum

681
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:52,899
to get him past the space-time barrier.

682
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:55,335
- All right.
- Hey, listen to me.

683
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:58,004
Thawne knows about you.

684
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:00,807
Right here, right now.

685
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,643
This is where he learns
about you, all of you.

686
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:05,278
It's how he knows about S.T.A.R. Labs,

687
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,147
how he knows about me...

688
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,948
The Harrison Wells from this Earth.

689
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,384
And there's nothing I can do about it.

690
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:12,986
There's nothing you can do about it.

691
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:16,923
This is his origin story,

692
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:20,327
and it's going to happen
no matter what you do.

693
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:24,780
But right here, right now...

694
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,796
you can send him back to his time.

695
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,637
You can save your friend.

696
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,508
You can save Cisco and then
move on with your life.

697
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,677
This could be a good thing.

698
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,313
You can finally let go of him.

699
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:42,315
I could throw him three
centuries from now.

700
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:43,683
He'll always be a part of me.

701
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:49,222
Time to send you back where you belong.

702
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,764
We'll meet again soon, Flash.

703
00:35:57,766 --> 00:35:59,299
I know.

704
00:35:59,301 --> 00:36:02,101
And every time, I'll be ready for you.

705
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,590
Hurry.

706
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:51,518
He did it.

707
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,440
He's gonna be okay.

708
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:25,203
I don't understand what we're doing here.

709
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:27,067
Well, just like you, I
thought that if I could find

710
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:29,036
my doppelganger on this Earth,

711
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,439
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

712
00:37:32,441 --> 00:37:35,276
And believe me, I was
just as shocked as you

713
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:37,945
when I couldn't find a
Jay Garrick anywhere

714
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:38,991
on this planet.

715
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:45,108
Took me a while to figure it out...

716
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:47,116
but eventually I found him.

717
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,493
His name is Hunter Zolomon.

718
00:37:52,495 --> 00:37:54,061
Hunter Zolomon?

719
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,829
Why doesn't he have the same name as you?

720
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:57,097
From what I could gather,

721
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:59,033
his mother died during childbirth.

722
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:01,035
He bounced around from family to family,

723
00:38:01,037 --> 00:38:03,904
but eventually was adopted
and raised by the Zolomons.

724
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:09,218
But why does that mean he can't help you?

725
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:12,554
My DNA was mutated when
I became a speedster.

726
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:17,351
There's only one way to reverse
what's happening to me.

727
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,655
If we can catch Zoom, I
can get my speed back.

728
00:38:21,657 --> 00:38:25,426
Then let's finally figure out
the best way to do that.

729
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,406
- Wally, hi.
- Hey.

730
00:38:39,408 --> 00:38:41,775
Um, do you want to come in?

731
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,677
No, I-I can't stay. I just...

732
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,180
I wanted to tell you that
I'm gonna take your advice

733
00:38:46,182 --> 00:38:47,452
and go see my mom.

734
00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:49,242
Okay.

735
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:55,823
Iris, I was... I was wondering

736
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:57,970
if you would come with me.

737
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:01,118
Yeah, yeah, I would... I would love that.

738
00:39:01,397 --> 00:39:02,763
- Yeah?
- Okay.

739
00:39:02,765 --> 00:39:03,376
Um...

740
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,899
My head feels like it's in a vise.

741
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,126
What happened?

742
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:22,407
I think you vibed one
too many dimensions.

743
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:24,752
Maybe I should stop doing that.

744
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:27,821
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

745
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:31,792
How did you, um... get
the vibing to stop?

746
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:34,243
We sent Thawne back to his time.

747
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:37,626
You let him go?

748
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,967
I couldn't let him take
another person I cared about.

749
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:46,110
- Thank you.
- Of course.

750
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:50,878
Okay, I think I need a Big Belly burger.

751
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,546
- Anyone?
- I'm good, thank you.

752
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:55,282
- Yeah, no pickles.
- Two triple triples, please.

753
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:56,617
You got money?

754
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:58,352
Mmm.

755
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:00,662
Rest up, all right? I'll be out here.

756
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:07,294
So, Patty... she's on a train
to Midway City right now, huh?

757
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:10,030
Mm-hmm, I had to let her go too.

758
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,534
Mm-hmm, I was thinking
about what you said,

759
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,971
that part of being The Flash
is that you have the ability

760
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:20,941
to do amazing things
that nobody else can do.

761
00:40:20,943 --> 00:40:22,976
And we see now that a
hundred years from now,

762
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:24,745
you'll still be doing them.

763
00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:26,063
But the other part is,

764
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:28,775
you're gonna be loaded with sacrifices,

765
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:32,816
and you're gonna have
hard choices to make,

766
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:36,493
and there's gonna be a lot
of things where eventually

767
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,360
you'll have to let 'em go.

768
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:41,665
You got to be ready for that.

769
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,674
I am. I'm ready.

770
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:49,177
That's my boy.

771
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:56,573
That's weird.

772
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,481
- Hey.
- Barry, I'm on the train.

773
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,282
There's a... there's a man with a gun.

774
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:05,252
All right, hold on.
I-I-I'll get you help.

775
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:15,298
- Is everyone okay?
- Everyone's fine.

776
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:18,839
It was a false alarm, but...

777
00:41:20,669 --> 00:41:22,503
thanks for coming so fast, Flash.

778
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:30,942
Just want to make sure
everything's okay before I go.

779
00:41:32,982 --> 00:41:33,789
Don't worry.

780
00:41:35,217 --> 00:41:36,164
Everything's good.

781
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:54,003
Good-bye, Barry.

782
