00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,259
<i>I was, uh,
I was about nine or ten.</i>

4
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,387
<i>My old man made me...</i>

5
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,598
<i>fight this older kid
in the neighborhood.</i>

6
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,434
<i>He said I was a pussy.</i>

7
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,771
<i>And if I didn't want
to be a pussy my whole life,</i>

8
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,775
<i>I needed to kick this kid's ass.</i>

9
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,573
<i>So...</i>

10
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,575
<i>I beat the kid up.</i>

11
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,663
<i>Beat him to a pulp.</i>

12
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,147
<i>He told me I might not
be a pussy, after all.</i>

13
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,658
Got some product coming in
from New York the next few days.

14
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,285
Need a nice white face
to pick it up and deliver it

15
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,455
- when the time comes.
- What kind of product?

16
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,543
Okay.

17
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,297
Look, I need to know
what the fuck we're bringing up.

18
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,883
No, you ain't fixing
to ask me specifics

19
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,095
about my product, are you, <i>ese?</i>

20
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:24,764
Didn't mean to offend you.

21
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,599
No, no, don't tell me
what you meant.

22
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,435
I fucking heard your ass.

23
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,607
Okay. Okay.

24
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,567
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,112
Now,
don't come in here acting like

26
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,406
you've got some
fucking weight behind your ass.

27
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:42,740
You know the fucking drill.

28
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,827
You either take the fucking job
or you're not.

29
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,499
How's that number?

30
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:52,918
Looks about right.

31
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,920
One of these days
the FBI...

32
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,309
The fuck did you get that relic?

33
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,062
I inherited him from my old man.

34
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,065
A fucking throwback,
right there.

35
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,693
Does it talk?

36
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,779
This dude was the real
deal back in the day, man.

37
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,032
Was ain't is, homes.

38
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,326
Homie past his sell-by date.

39
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,122
Somebody tell this fuckpig

40
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,292
that if he don't stop
staring at me,

41
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,835
I'm gonna have
to break his shoulders.

42
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,796
In the present tense.

43
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,676
Oh, whoa, whoa.

44
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,845
Take it easy, man.

45
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,973
That motherfucker
still got some game, huh.

46
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,684
I like him.

47
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,312
So we got a deal or what?

48
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,648
Deal.

49
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,783
Dude, you really need
to not be saying shit like that.

50
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,367
Do you know who those guys are?

51
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,245
Somebody
had to say something.

52
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,289
Never seen anyone
backpedal so fast.

53
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,959
Hey!
Who's the fucking boss here?

54
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,422
You want
to be a boss one day,

55
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,008
you got to start
acting like one.

56
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,863
You really need that
to find your way home?

57
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,740
No, but my nav system

58
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,743
has real-time
traffic pattern algorithms.

59
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, you can't smoke in here.

60
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,632
Algorithms... Algorithms...

61
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,220
That blow's gonna kill you,
you know that?

62
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,558
You think I'm a tool, don't ya?

63
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,812
No, kid.
I don't think you're a tool.

64
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,064
You're just green is all.

65
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,293
There he is.

66
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,175
So, the kid bargained
a good price?

67
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,763
Uh, he got an okay price.

68
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,683
So, he shit the bed?

69
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,478
I would have been
scared too at his age, boss.

70
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,023
You know, when he managed
to get his degree from BC,

71
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,650
I wanted him
to go to law school.

72
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,443
He had other ideas.

73
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,654
He wants to be a tough guy,
like you.

74
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,074
You know, he set this
whole deal up himself.

75
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,745
He's trying to prove
to everybody he's a shot-caller.

76
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,623
What do you think?

77
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,458
That ain't none of my business.

78
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,877
I'm not sure he's ever
gonna be ready, you know?

79
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,880
He's just not cut out for it,
like you and me.

80
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,467
He just needs some time,
Mister...

81
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,849
You forget
my fucking name again?

82
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,228
You forget my fucking name?

83
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,022
I...

84
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,066
I've been having
some trouble sleeping,

85
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,652
I get these headaches.

86
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,569
All right.

87
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,031
Just make sure the kid
doesn't fuck this one up.

88
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,345
Hey, there he is.

89
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:16,847
Like clockwork.

90
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,724
You late with your rent again?

91
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,893
You got anything or not?

92
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,438
I've got a hot kid
that could use some sparring.

93
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,027
I don't fucking need that.

94
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,259
You okay?

95
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,556
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

96
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,979
What'd you think of the mick?

97
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,939
Yeah, he... He can punch,

98
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,233
he's got some juice.

99
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,110
Bit mouthy.

100
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,741
Ain't you forgetting something?

101
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,498
Oh.

102
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,218
Hey.

103
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,969
Tilda says only single shots

104
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,888
and to cut you off
at three drinks.

105
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,266
I don't see Tilda. Do you?

106
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,293
You can't touch a lady
like that!

107
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,378
Crazy bitch!

108
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,255
Who you fucking calling
a crazy bitch?

109
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,632
You can't talk to
a motherfucking lady like that!

110
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,926
What did I tell you...
I don't give a fuck...

111
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,346
- You'll put me in a bad mood.
- Fuck you. I will kill you!

112
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,807
- I will fuck you up, bitch!
- You're gonna fuck me?

113
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:05,850
Yeah, bitch-ass.

114
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,892
Are you out of your mind?

115
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,977
No.
Fuck, you bit me!

116
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,061
Hey!

117
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,146
You know what happens

118
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,397
- when I get in a bad mood.
-Or what?

119
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,773
You want me to put
my fucking hands on you?

120
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,858
Fuck you.

121
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,152
Come on, pal.
Take it outside.

122
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,320
What'd you say to me?

123
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,114
I said take it outside.

124
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,867
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to your drink...

125
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,331
Hey, you killed him!

126
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,542
He ain't dead.

127
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,586
He's just stupid.

128
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,176
Hey!

129
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,260
Hey, asshole!

130
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,637
Look, lady,
I don't want no trouble.

131
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,474
You knock out my boyfriend
and you don't want no trouble?

132
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,559
He had it coming.

133
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,479
Okay.

134
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,981
Maybe he had it coming.

135
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,110
Who's gonna walk me home?

136
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,451
Easy, babe, easy!

137
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,745
Easy...

138
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,623
No need to be so rough.

139
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,168
We'll get there soon enough.

140
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,420
Promise.

141
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,343
Ah. Easy!

142
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,555
Easy.

143
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,603
Easy.

144
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,691
Easy.

145
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,697
Easy.

146
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,455
How do you get any sleep
living here?

147
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,084
I like the noise.

148
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,086
I mean, that drunk guy,
he screams, like, every night,

149
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,548
so it's like music to me.

150
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,800
I hate silence.

151
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,426
I gathered that back at the bar.

152
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,431
Like, this silence
reminds me of home.

153
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,809
Hmm. Where's that?

154
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,269
Hmm...

155
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,647
Wellesley.

156
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,649
Wellesley? Really?

157
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,484
The good part.

158
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,070
Big house on Cliff Road.

159
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,198
And I was a good girl, too.

160
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,284
Yeah?

161
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,578
What the hell happened to you?

162
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:30,912
Oof...

163
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,790
God save the soul!

164
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,002
Yo, Larry, shut
the fuck up! I've got company.

165
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,713
Congratulations,
have a nice evening!

166
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,305
See, you couldn't do that
in Wellesley.

167
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,932
I guess not.

168
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,518
Hmm...

169
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,358
Get out.

170
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,443
What?

171
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,527
Lupe?

172
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,778
Yeah?

173
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,071
That's my name.

174
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,616
You're kidding me.

175
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,825
Well, I mean,
it's not my real name,

176
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,909
it's my nickname.

177
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,870
Actually,
it's not even my nickname.

178
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,163
When I was at school,

179
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,666
they used to called me loopy
'cause I was so fucking crazy.

180
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,793
So it was kind of close, right?

181
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,086
That's trippy, don't you think?

182
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,006
Yeah, must be fate.

183
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,760
So who is she?

184
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,638
Oh, some whore.

185
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,766
That's not nice.

186
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,851
Listen,
she charged me ten bucks,

187
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,229
so I don't know
what else you would call her.

188
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,816
I thought I was in love.

189
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,069
Got her name
tattooed on my hand,

190
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,571
went back to show her...

191
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,948
She was shagging
two of my friends.

192
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,534
That was the end of that.

193
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,748
That's fucking romantic,
is what that is.

194
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,839
Yeah, boss?

195
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,424
<i>I need for you
to go over to Dr. Gruber's,</i>

196
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,760
<i>pick something up for me.</i>

197
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,136
Uh-huh.

198
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,764
<i>You remember
the address, right?</i>

199
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,599
Of course, I do.

200
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,956
{\an8}
Those are the bombers. 30 mills.

201
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,877
They're all sealed.

202
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,837
That's what you said last time.

203
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,756
Hey, man, they were sealed.

204
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,217
Any tampering happened,
that was on the other end.

205
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,762
You sell this shit, you've got
to put your name on it, doc.

206
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,391
- Any blanks in this batch...
- Okay, okay, I get it.

207
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,645
I'll let 'em go for 15.

208
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,148
Okay, man.

209
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,650
Twelve.

210
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,902
I don't have time
for this shit, doc.

211
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,030
Fine. Ten.

212
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,995
Let me ask you something.

213
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,959
I've been having
some memory issues lately.

214
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,044
Like what?

215
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,506
Ah, forgetting names
and directions. Shit like that.

216
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,758
How bad is it?

217
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,387
I forgot where I lived
for a few minutes this morning.

218
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,265
It's not the first time.

219
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,852
It's not good.
It's not good at all.

220
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,228
You should get that checked out.

221
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,903
Good afternoon.

222
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:56,988
Hey.

223
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,533
Okay.

224
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,582
Have you heard of CTE?

225
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,670
Stands for Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy.

226
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,633
Lots of football players
and boxers develop it.

227
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,718
Too many blows to the head.

228
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,803
Punch drunk.

229
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,097
That's what
they used to call it.

230
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,141
Have you sustained

231
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,228
multiple concussions
over the course of your life?

232
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,689
You could say that.

233
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,609
Starting at what age?

234
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,444
I don't know.

235
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,989
First one was probably
around six or seven.

236
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,241
Maybe younger.

237
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,203
So, this took place at home?

238
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,496
Just tell me what I got

239
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,457
and what I need to take
to get better.

240
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,837
There is no treatment.

241
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:56,923
No drugs.

242
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,551
And it's a fairly advanced case.

243
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,350
Do you...

244
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,019
have anyone?

245
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,480
Wife?

246
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,065
Kids?

247
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,359
No, I don't know.

248
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,154
I've got a couple of kids. Why?

249
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,823
In the next couple of years,

250
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,576
you can expect
a fairly sharp decline.

251
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,581
Eventually, you won't be able
to care for yourself.

252
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,835
Bullshit.

253
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,713
I know it's hard...

254
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,507
Listen, you don't know me.

255
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,176
Just tell me how long I have.

256
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,389
Until you're incapacitated?
I can't predict that.

257
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,809
Just tell me,
how long do I have?

258
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,940
I don't know.

259
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,863
A couple of years at the most.

260
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,616
Could be sooner.

261
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,354
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hello, Daisy.</i>

262
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,731
<i>Dad?</i>

263
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,318
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

264
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,111
No.

265
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,697
<i>Did someone
die or something?</i>

266
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,616
I just wanted to say hello.

267
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,702
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

268
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,537
No!

269
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,914
<i>What the hell
do you want then?</i>

270
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,624
Can I come by and see you?

271
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,918
<i>Uh, fuck no.</i>

272
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,296
Okay.

273
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,464
I didn't mean to bother you.

274
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,216
<i>No,
I don't want to see you.</i>

275
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,759
<i>We have nothing to talk about.</i>

276
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,928
<i>I've got an okay thing
going on right now.</i>

277
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,014
<i>And I don't need you
or anyone else</i>

278
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,349
<i>fucking it up for me.</i>

279
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,143
Mmm-hmm...

280
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:38,978
Okay.

281
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,606
Have you heard from...

282
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,444
My... my son?

283
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:49,739
<i>Your son? You mean Colin?</i>

284
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,533
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Colin.

285
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,497
You have his number?

286
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,750
I want to go see him.

287
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,128
<i>Colin's dead.</i>

288
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,297
What?

289
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,673
When?

290
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,343
<i>Almost two years ago.</i>

291
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,638
But...

292
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:15,890
What...

293
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,851
Why didn't anybody tell me?

294
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,561
<i>Why would they, Dad?</i>

295
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,689
<i>You didn't even remember
his fucking name.</i>

296
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,651
Where... where is he buried?

297
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,327
Colin, Colin...

298
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:38,913
Colin...

299
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,916
Colin, Colin...

300
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,255
Fucking idiot.

301
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,090
Colin...

302
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,674
You should take better
fucking care of this place!

303
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,646
I thought I told you
not to come.

304
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,023
Just wanted to see you.

305
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,442
Okay. Well, you saw me.

306
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,070
You can fuck off now, Dad.

307
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,571
Excuse me.

308
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,119
This is un-fucking believable.

309
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,790
And to invite you
and your family to dinner.

310
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,917
And why on earth
would I want to do that?

311
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:53,714
Hi, sweetie.

312
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,133
I'm your grandfather.

313
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,553
Get your butt
back inside.

314
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,019
Why are you...
Why are you selling the house?

315
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,397
You really think
I can afford to buy a house?

316
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:11,481
I rent it.

317
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,565
The owner died

318
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,819
and his kids are selling it
out from under us.

319
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,363
Are you working?

320
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,448
I'm dancing.

321
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:20,949
Stripping?

322
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,951
No,
I joined the fucking Bolshoi.

323
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,327
Hey, hey, hey.

324
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,830
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi.

325
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:27,455
Um...

326
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,667
This is your grandfather.

327
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,962
Hey.

328
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,673
So, you're the boxer?

329
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,466
Was.

330
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,679
You... you play for Dorchester?

331
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:43,263
Newton.

332
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,765
Newton?
They have a football team?

333
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,059
He punched out
the Dorchester coach's son,

334
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,686
and they kicked him
off the team.

335
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,647
It's not funny.

336
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,775
I don't even want him
playing football.

337
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,901
You've got to go clean up.

338
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,945
I could smell you
coming from a mile away.

339
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,114
Smell this!
Goodbye.

340
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,914
What, did you find Jesus
or something?

341
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,585
I just want to explain...

342
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,838
You...
you don't understand...

343
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,339
No, that's just it.

344
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,133
I do understand.

345
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,385
You were a fucking asshole
to us.

346
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,554
Just like my babies' daddies
are assholes.

347
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,347
Just like your dad
was an asshole.

348
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,057
And his dad, and on and on.

349
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,187
Back to the asshole caveman
that spawned you all.

350
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,939
It's a fucking family curse.

351
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,860
The curse of the asshole father.

352
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,158
The dinner,
just think about it, yeah?

353
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:47,912
Okay.

354
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,622
I thought about it.

355
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,332
Fuck off.

356
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,397
Dad?

357
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,482
Yeah.

358
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,695
I thought you were dead.

359
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:04,780
Nah.

360
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,491
It don't work that way.

361
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,213
Are you still mad?

362
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,511
Nah.

363
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,222
I ain't mad no more, kid.

364
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:34,977
We gonna fish?

365
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:39,648
Nah.

366
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,657
Where are we going?

367
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,951
You'll see.

368
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,580
I don't see any land.

369
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,751
Enjoy the ride.
There'll be land soon enough.

370
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,045
Promise?

371
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:02,962
I promise.

372
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,135
What is that sound?

373
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,263
It's a guitar.

374
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,724
It's in the engine.

375
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,649
Yo!

376
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:48,694
Yo, you lost?

377
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,697
Come on.

378
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,742
Yeah, you're the boy
our parents warned us about.

379
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,620
Look at you now.
Mmm-hmm.

380
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,330
So what do you do?

381
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,374
What's you, a gangster?

382
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,626
Huh? You a gangster?

383
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,879
Were you born without a filter,

384
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,131
or is that something
you have to work at?

385
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,633
Ugh. Whatever.

386
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:15,261
Nah, it's all just
a bunch of boo-boo.

387
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,429
"Boo-boo"?

388
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,639
Well, you know...

389
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,476
You know,
boo-boo just means like...

390
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,644
Some weak ass bullshit.

391
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,774
Life ain't weak.

392
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,070
Life's a shitstorm.

393
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,742
But it sure as hell
ain't a bunch of boo-boo.

394
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,827
Wow.

395
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,705
So deep!

396
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,291
I feel like I need to run.
Let's race!

397
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,459
- Come on, let's race!
- No.

398
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,879
Oh, oh, oh.
Okay, soccer knee, soccer knee.

399
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,964
How about backwards race?

400
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,758
-That's even worse.
- What?

401
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,384
-It's worse.
- Come on! Come on!

402
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,595
Stop it, there's people looking.
There's people looking.

403
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,931
Oh, they gonna look, all right.
Come on!

404
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,682
You gonna buy me a Guinness?

405
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,685
I'll make 'em stop looking
if you buy me a Guinness.

406
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,855
Come on, you gangster, boo-boo!

407
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,318
Hey,
where's the screaming drunk?

408
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,239
It's too early for him.

409
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,574
He's a closing act.

410
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,250
What are these bumps
in your tattoos?

411
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,793
Scars.

412
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,088
Cigarette burns.

413
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,967
Life gives you lemons,
you make flowers.

414
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,053
Who did this to you?

415
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,639
Some asshole.

416
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,685
I don't want to talk about it.

417
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,923
I see you got your own scars.

418
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,842
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

419
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,178
How'd you get those?

420
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,097
Some asshole.

421
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:32,815
Where you going?

422
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,484
Have to go to New York.

423
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,697
You not gonna
kiss me goodbye?

424
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,782
No.

425
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,120
I don't have time for that.

426
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:46,705
Hmm...

427
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,124
Quite the sweet talker you are.

428
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,566
Hey.

429
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,278
Hey, you deaf?

430
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:20,738
What?

431
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,367
I asked, how much longer
to stay on I-90?

432
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,079
Why aren't you
using your "gorithm"?

433
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,081
Yeah, very funny, smart-ass.

434
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,708
You said you've been to New York
like a million times.

435
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,836
So, what's the best way
to get there?

436
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,842
Did you forget?

437
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:42,719
No.

438
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,721
Go ahead. Use your toy.

439
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,890
Yeah, I think you forgot
how to get there.

440
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,559
Bullshit.

441
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,254
They said
the northeast corner.

442
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,297
Where should I park?

443
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,091
Make a loop.

444
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,638
What are you looking for?

445
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,349
Anything that doesn't fit.

446
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,186
Keep driving.

447
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,649
Slower. Slower...

448
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,426
Is that us?

449
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:16,897
Yeah.

450
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,193
- I'll see you back in Boston.
- Hey, no, no, no.

451
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:25,112
I'm coming with you.

452
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,697
No, it's not happening.

453
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,200
Jeez,
what is wrong with you?

454
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,410
Pop says he wants me
to learn the business

455
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,246
from the bottom up. Remember?

456
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,332
I got news for you.

457
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,919
This business is all done
on the bottom.

458
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,596
I want to know
what's back there.

459
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,848
No, you don't.

460
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,851
On jobs like this,
you got to learn not to look.

461
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,105
Just do your business.
And look the other way.

462
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,159
Cops.

463
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,663
Fuck.

464
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,208
Just be cool.

465
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,670
Aw, shit!

466
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,510
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

467
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,765
Do me a favor
and get on the floor.

468
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,891
What?

469
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,435
- Get on the floor.
- Why?

470
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,520
When this guy passes us,

471
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,231
he's gonna
take a good, long look.

472
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,441
And I don't need him
seeing you shit your pants.

473
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,526
I'm... I'm cool.

474
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,195
- I'm cool.
- You're not.

475
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,363
Do me a favor, get down.

476
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,865
Fuck!
Get on the fucking...

477
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,034
No, I'm not getting
on the fucking floor.

478
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:55,871
Hey, stop.

479
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,622
Get down, now, get down!

480
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,707
Let me up!

481
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,835
Get down and stay there,
stay down.

482
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,461
Stay there.

483
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,990
This is fucking bullshit, man.

484
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,327
I'm telling Pops
what you just did to me.

485
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,913
You mean saving your ass?

486
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,916
I'm getting sick
of the lack of respect

487
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,667
that you've been showing me.

488
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,669
They don't just hand
that shit out, son.

489
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,088
You've got to earn it.

490
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,480
And I know you're talking shit
to my old man about me.

491
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:06,900
Trying to hold me back.

492
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,903
That rocket fuel's
making you paranoid.

493
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,934
If it ain't the dinosaur.

494
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,520
Hey, fuckpig,
where do you want this?

495
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,690
Take it around back,
Jurassic Park.

496
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,109
What are you smirking at?

497
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:03,248
What are you doing?
Don't get out.

498
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:07,043
Those guys don't want us
seeing what's back there.

499
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,926
You afraid of that guy?

500
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,595
Just stay put.

501
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:28,897
Get her! Let's go!

502
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:29,982
Holy shit.

503
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:31,317
I'm going to break your legs!

504
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,610
Stop!

505
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,363
Help. Please, help me.

506
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,781
No! I want to go!

507
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,158
Get down!

508
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,035
Come down!

509
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,120
No!

510
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:43,912
No!

511
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,332
Get the shit back off!

512
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,293
I want to go!

513
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,586
Shut the fuck up!

514
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:51,879
Help!

515
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,049
- Shut the fuck up!
- Help!

516
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,593
Shut up!

517
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,390
No! No!

518
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,648
All right, here we go,
number four!

519
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,026
Here we go. You got this!

520
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:16,905
Come on, Dre!
Knock him on his ass!

521
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,744
Come on, Dre.

522
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,371
Get up off the ground.

523
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,248
Come on, focus!

524
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,250
Come on. You've got this.
All right. All right.

525
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,295
- Here we go! Here we go!
-Hit it, hit it!

526
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,634
Don't like him
playing football, huh?

527
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,056
Do you mind?

528
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,100
Free country.

529
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,268
Jesus, he's playing terrible.

530
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,687
Come on!

531
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,523
Hit somebody!

532
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,530
Please tell me
that's not a beer in there.

533
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,746
Here we go! Here we go!
Yeah, Dre!

534
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,749
That's my boy!

535
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,585
Yes! Yes!

536
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,462
Touchdown!
Touchdown!

537
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,927
All right, let's do it again!

538
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:26,098
Okay, excuse me, where's
my little Patriots player?

539
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,683
Give me a hug. Oh, my God.

540
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:30,185
You are so good.

541
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,687
I am so proud of you.

542
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:33,857
-Thank you, Mom.
- Yeah, all right.

543
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,108
We've got to go pick up Katie.

544
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,610
You looked good out there.

545
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,654
Ah. I did okay.

546
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,657
Here's something for you.

547
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,707
That's my old reel.

548
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,084
It's a Pflueger.

549
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,670
It ain't for the heavy-duty
deep-sea stuff, but...

550
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,506
it'll be good for what you need.

551
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:02,259
- But... I don't fish.
- It doesn't matter.

552
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,552
What do you say?

553
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:04,929
Well, thank you.

554
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,182
All right,
we've got to go get Katie.

555
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:09,475
But you said I could stay

556
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:11,478
and watch the next game
with my friends.

557
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,354
I did? Fine.
Just be home by dinner.

558
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,483
- Okay, bye, Mom.
- Okay. Bye, I love you.

559
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,613
Didn't the court say
you couldn't hang out in parks?

560
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,032
Take it easy.

561
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,454
Yo, Dre!

562
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:31,539
There you are.

563
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,627
- I want to go with my friends.
- You're riding home with me.

564
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,421
- Wait...
- I promised your mom.

565
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,133
Come on.

566
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,941
I have a question for you.

567
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,446
Why did you punch
that coach's son out?

568
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,826
He cheap-shotted me.

569
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,249
Sometimes
you've just got to walk away.

570
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,344
Mom says you were in prison.

571
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:29,097
What for?

572
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,182
Not walking away.

573
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,978
I've done so much
stupid shit in my life,

574
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,397
I can't even tell you.

575
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,363
Are you still doing stupid shit?

576
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,581
Mom said you probably were.

577
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,709
What else did your mom tell you?

578
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,007
That you...

579
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,219
That you ran out on your family.

580
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,433
Is it true?

581
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:26,988
What was boxing like?

582
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:45,255
What are you doing here?
It ain't the end of the month.

583
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,633
This is my grandson.

584
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:49,093
I want him
to take a look around.

585
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,096
You want to be a boxer
like your grandfather?

586
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,515
Mmm... I don't really know.

587
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,600
Hey.

588
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,560
This guy, back in the day,

589
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,272
if he punched you, your fucking
ancestors would feel it.

590
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,608
You think I'm joking?

591
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:05,818
Make yourself at home, kid.

592
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,825
Hey. Watch these two.

593
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,413
Which one's better?

594
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,334
They both look good to me.

595
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,296
Watch their footwork.
Just their footwork.

596
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,843
The guy on the right
has more power.

597
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,054
But watch the girl.

598
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,682
She's coming at him
from five different angles.

599
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:39,018
Moving, sticking,
getting out of there.

600
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,104
See what I mean?

601
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,357
Calm, controlled, moving fast.

602
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,984
Okay, now start punching.
Two lefts. Left!

603
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,070
Right.

604
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:50,780
Don't stay still.

605
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,117
I'm gonna hit you
if you stay still.

606
00:49:55,868 --> 00:50:00,331
Left, right. That's it.

607
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,001
Don't stay still.
Don't stay still, that's it.

608
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:08,005
Back over this way. Keep moving.

609
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,049
Good job.

610
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,511
There you go.

611
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,430
You're a natural, kid.

612
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:37,577
Hey.

613
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:41,247
Don't tell your mom
I took you to the gym.

614
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,708
You afraid of her?

615
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:46,084
Damn right, I am.

616
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,170
Me, too.

617
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,105
The water's really cold.

618
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,274
On top, it is.

619
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,652
But not down deep.

620
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,531
Did you go to the bottom?

621
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,199
Sure I did.

622
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,495
Is that where guys
like us belong?

623
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,456
Yeah.

624
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,673
Help me, help me!

625
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:22,640
Just don't think about it.

626
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:26,769
Hey!

627
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,564
Just don't think about it.

628
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:31,858
Do like I taught you.

629
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,277
Look the other way

630
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,654
and enjoy the music.

631
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:56,233
<i>He used to take me fishing
every Sunday.</i>

632
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,195
<i>Every single Sunday.</i>

633
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,448
<i>Just me and him.</i>

634
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,870
<i>I wasn't allowed to set foot
in that boat</i>

635
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,206
<i>if he wasn't with me.</i>

636
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,343
<i>He gets arrested
this one Saturday night.</i>

637
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,056
<i>And we can't raise the money
to bail him out until Monday.</i>

638
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,058
<i>So, I figured
I would take the boat out,</i>

639
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,145
<i>and he'd never
find out about it.</i>

640
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,027
<i>He found out.</i>

641
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,666
<i>He never took me fishing again.</i>

642
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,217
<i>It was the one thing
we loved doing together.</i>

643
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,975
<i>And he took it away
to punish me.</i>

644
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:21,527
Waiting for the presents.

645
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,324
Things are happening.

646
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:30,411
Jurassic Park!

647
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,163
What are you doing here
on a Sunday?

648
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:36,833
You got some girls here, right?
I thought maybe I'd take a look.

649
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,591
You're a dirty old dinosaur,
homie! Mmm...

650
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:45,593
We got Viagra too,
if you need it.

651
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,804
Come on, OG.

652
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:51,306
Hey.

653
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:53,016
I've got to
give you props, <i>viejo.</i>

654
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,019
You delivered us a good crop
right there.

655
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,187
All right, now!

656
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:58,439
Lovely ladies.

657
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,482
Smile for me.

658
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:07,573
Hey, come here. Smile.

659
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:09,283
Smile.

660
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,413
Trouble, ah. come.

661
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:16,623
She's my favorite.

662
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:19,668
Whole lotta trouble right here,
if you like that kind of stuff.

663
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,090
Smile.

664
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,550
Put on a smile, beautiful.

665
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:32,223
Come now, off you go! Smile.

666
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:08,259
No, no, no.

667
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,069
I don't...

668
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:30,239
I don't know why I'm here.

669
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:44,336
Do... Do you have family
in the US?

670
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:46,630
<i>Familia?</i>

671
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,052
You want me to call?

672
00:57:58,434 --> 00:57:59,476
They already know.

673
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:03,856
They know?

674
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,447
Diego wants money...

675
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:13,949
How much?

676
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:15,826
Twenty-thousand.

677
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:19,037
20,000, and they let you go?

678
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,372
I will be free.

679
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:25,336
Fuck.

680
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,102
I can't help you.

681
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,856
I can't help you.

682
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:48,984
I'm sorry.

683
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,009
Yeah?

684
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:18,304
<i>Okay. The Priest
can meet you after mass.</i>

685
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,597
Got it.

686
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,309
<i>Get the whole nut,
right? No excuses.</i>

687
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:11,483
Hey, Father.
What's the rush?

688
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:16,530
Fucking idiot.

689
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:53,609
I...

690
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,153
I don't know
what I was thinking.

691
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:10,959
It's all there. 20,000.

692
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,756
Don't want to know
where you got this.

693
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,550
This'll buy you another month.

694
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,137
Hey, Father,
do you still take confession?

695
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,015
I don't have that kind of time.
I'll see you next month.

696
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:30,979
Shit!

697
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,319
I shot a fucking priest.

698
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,071
So, where's our guy?

699
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,283
He must
still be in there.

700
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:03,363
Who the fuck are you?
Do I know you?

701
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:07,826
Who hired you?

702
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:10,871
Fuck you.

703
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:13,457
You're gonna kill me either way.

704
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,211
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

705
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,172
You'll be dead in a few minutes.

706
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,799
And I'm gonna find out
where you live.

707
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:26,428
I'm guessing,
I'm gonna find someone there.

708
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:29,848
Maybe your girl.

709
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,821
He's a big motherfucker.

710
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,825
Big spider tat on his neck.

711
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,372
He said you'd be hard to kill.

712
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,717
You don't think
these guys were there

713
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:31,510
to take out the 20 grand,
do you?

714
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,513
That's not what the guy told me.

715
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,516
You owe anybody any money?

716
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,728
Nothing worth
that kind of attention.

717
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:42,814
Revenge?

718
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:44,816
Now that's a long list.

719
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,740
So, who the fuck are these guys?

720
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,867
Eh, just some fucking amateurs.

721
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:59,289
You know, I'm starting to worry
about you a little bit.

722
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,834
You worried now?

723
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,881
Nice work.

724
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,831
Hey!

725
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,040
Hey, what up, bud?

726
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,458
You shouldn't be here.

727
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:45,794
Oh, yeah, why not?

728
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:47,379
Just go home.

729
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,756
So why don't you park
by your house?

730
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,175
I like my privacy.

731
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,969
I come all the way
out here to see you,

732
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,554
and this is the greeting I get?

733
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:58,222
How do you even know
where I live?

734
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,225
I went through
your wallet the other day.

735
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,062
I know, that sounded
a little crazy out loud, right?

736
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:05,897
Come on!

737
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,567
Cute place.

738
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,239
It's a shitty rental.

739
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,330
There's...
there's nothing to do here.

740
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,042
We can watch TV?

741
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:28,211
It doesn't work.

742
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,715
How 'bout some music?

743
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,216
I don't have music.

744
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,010
Everybody's got music.

745
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,095
I don't.

746
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:53,945
Those aren't mine.

747
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,204
Okay, they're mine.

748
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,592
Did you notice
that I had memory problems?

749
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:18,804
Yeah.

750
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,556
But I just thought
you were an alcoholic.

751
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:23,641
I am.

752
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:28,146
I'm a real prize.

753
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,908
It's sure quiet here.

754
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:48,458
You know my son
I told you about?

755
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,543
The one who died?

756
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:51,628
Yeah.

757
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:56,299
He overdosed on heroin.

758
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,596
I'm sorry.

759
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:12,899
He was gay.

760
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:20,948
Did that bother you?

761
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:22,033
I don't know.

762
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,160
I guess so, yeah.

763
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,748
Maybe if I'd been around more
when he was growing up,

764
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:31,501
things would've been different.

765
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,339
So what, you think
you're so fucking macho,

766
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,259
it's just gonna rub off on him?

767
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:41,887
Shit don't work like that.

768
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:58,152
We aren't gonna end well,
you and me.

769
01:09:58,153 --> 01:09:59,821
You know that, right?

770
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:14,293
Yeah, we're like
that scene in the movies

771
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:16,004
where the gasoline...

772
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:20,967
moves slowly...

773
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,263
towards the flame.

774
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:31,686
Sooner or later...

775
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:50,246
But not tonight.

776
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,023
Hey.

777
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,863
It's me.

778
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,657
Yeah, I know.

779
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,161
What are you doing?

780
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:36,292
Listening to that guy
playing the guitar.

781
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:43,925
What guitar?

782
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,930
He... he was just playing.
Didn't you hear him?

783
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:51,599
No.

784
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:55,186
You're hearing things.

785
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:23,213
I'm taking my daughter
and her kids

786
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,175
out to dinner on Friday night.

787
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,011
I want you to come with me.

788
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,348
You sure about that?

789
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,518
Yeah. I'm sure.

790
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,249
You look nice.

791
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,919
I need a drink.

792
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:04,506
"Why, thank you.
You look lovely too."

793
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,468
Hey! Can I get a drink?

794
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:10,553
Sure.

795
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,431
- Uh, double bourbon, rocks.
-What kind?

796
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:15,391
The cheap kind.

797
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,646
And for the lady?

798
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,357
Uh, just a glass of water, please.

799
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:28,863
Calm down, Sally,
they'll be here.

800
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,074
It's all good. Come on.

801
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,208
They aren't coming.

802
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,334
They aren't coming.

803
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:46,005
Maybe... maybe I gave her
the wrong address.

804
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,842
Shit, I must've given them
the wrong address.

805
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,218
Sorry, but I simply

806
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:52,719
cannot hold this table
any longer.

807
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,805
Fuck off!

808
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:55,264
Excuse me?

809
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:57,183
I said, fuck off!

810
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,685
Who says, "simply cannot"?

811
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,396
No one talks like that.

812
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,605
Would you
speak to our manager?

813
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,900
No, no, no, no. That's...
That's not necessary.

814
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,235
- Yeah.
- No!

815
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:10,112
- Okay.
- No, no!

816
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,281
Hey, hey, okay.

817
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,992
What the fuck
are you looking at? Huh?

818
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:16,661
High-end motherfuckers!

819
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:18,829
- Okay.
- We were supposed to...

820
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:19,913
Hey, hey, hey!

821
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,624
-Let's just go...
- Where's the person

822
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,459
we were supposed to meet?

823
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,627
Daisy.

824
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,004
- Daisy?
- Yeah.

825
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:28,630
What about Colin?

826
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,383
Colin couldn't make it.

827
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:32,010
Daisy?

828
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,721
Yeah, your daughter.

829
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,055
My daughter's not coming,
is she?

830
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,183
No, I don't think she's going
to be able...

831
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:40,768
I gave her the wrong address...

832
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:43,770
What... What...
My... my... my...

833
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,814
My daughter's not coming,
is she?

834
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,441
No, she's not coming.

835
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:49,109
What... what's her name?

836
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,613
Your daughter's name is Daisy, baby.

837
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:08,522
What the hell's
happening here?

838
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:10,608
Why didn't you tell me
you were sick?

839
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,653
You told her?

840
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:16,531
Yeah.
I called her last night.

841
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,533
I mean, I thought, you know,
you were really upset.

842
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:20,742
You fucking told her?

843
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,036
-Hey!
- Yeah, she should know.

844
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,455
Get out of my house.

845
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,916
Dad, stop.
She didn't mean anything.

846
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:30,585
Get out, or I'll throw you out.
Crazy fucking bitch!

847
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,754
Cut it out!

848
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:34,966
So, you want to hit me?

849
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:36,634
You want to hit me?

850
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:38,302
Okay.

851
01:16:38,303 --> 01:16:39,678
Okay, fucking hit me.

852
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,055
Hit me, you fucking pussy.
I know you want to.

853
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,641
Dre, get back in the car.

854
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:48,146
Dre! Please!
Go, get in the car right now.

855
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:50,398
Go!

856
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,180
I didn't want you to know.

857
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:23,805
Okay.

858
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,433
Well, she didn't deserve that.

859
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:29,479
Fuck.

860
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,781
Why... why didn't you come
to dinner last night?

861
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:43,201
Says the guy who walked away
and never came back.

862
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:45,328
You suck.

863
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:53,960
I've got to go pack,

864
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,338
'cause now we've got to be out
in two days.

865
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:58,590
Where... where will you go?

866
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,009
I'll figure it out.

867
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:03,053
Is there...
is there anything I can do?

868
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,517
I can take care of myself.

869
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,482
Are you gonna get treatment?

870
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,150
I don't know.

871
01:18:17,819 --> 01:18:19,612
Well, you got a doctor?

872
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:23,323
I did.
That bitch can't help me.

873
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:24,409
Christ.

874
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:29,914
Hey.

875
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:32,792
Do you need my help
to find a new doctor?

876
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,671
Why... Why would you do that?

877
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:44,679
Well, if you need my help,
let me know.

878
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:57,066
Life's a shitstorm, isn't it?

879
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:43,529
What's her name?

880
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:46,616
What's her fucking name?

881
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,118
Fuck.

882
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:54,707
Yeah.

883
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,168
Maybe my son...

884
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,252
He's dead...

885
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:00,754
Yeah, he was a big dude...

886
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:02,048
Dude, dude...

887
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:08,763
Ta-ta, tattoo, tattoo...

888
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:12,934
Big dude, tattoo...

889
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:14,809
on his neck.

890
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,103
I can't remember it.

891
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:20,357
You fuckin' idiot!
Fuckin' idiot.

892
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,317
<i>Fuck you! Big dude.</i>

893
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,194
Fuck you. Tattoo!

894
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:26,863
Tattoo! Fuck you! Fuck you!

895
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:27,989
Fuck you!

896
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:32,036
Fuck you, you, you!

897
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:40,835
Here comes the packing train!
Choo-choo!

898
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,381
Thank you. Keep it coming.

899
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:50,512
Choo-choo!
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga...

900
01:20:50,513 --> 01:20:52,473
Train is leaving the station.

901
01:20:55,643 --> 01:20:58,396
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga,
chugga-chugga...

902
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,150
What?

903
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:06,654
Um... I need to talk to Dre.

904
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:11,617
All right.

905
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:22,878
Hey.

906
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:30,219
Can we talk?

907
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,393
Dre, I...

908
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,691
It's hard.

909
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,111
Life, life... Life is hard.

910
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:52,658
I, uh...

911
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,581
I...

912
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,263
What you saw yesterday...

913
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,307
my anger.

914
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:19,268
What I'm saying is,

915
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:21,395
don't be like that.

916
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:23,814
Don't be like me.

917
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,888
Fucking idiot.

918
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:12,488
$40,000.

919
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:17,743
It's... It's for a downpayment
on a house...

920
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,496
For my daughter, Daisy.

921
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:27,753
Mr. Connor, I know
that's a lot of money, but...

922
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:34,051
I'm willing to pay
whatever interest you decide on.

923
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:38,597
Mr. Connor...

924
01:23:42,143 --> 01:23:43,143
<i>So...</i>

925
01:23:43,144 --> 01:23:44,228
Mr. Connor...

926
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:48,607
I know 40,000 is a lot of money,
but...

927
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,444
I've been working for you
for 30 years.

928
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:54,864
30 long years. And...

929
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:15,259
Mr. Connor?

930
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,554
Have a seat.

931
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,560
- Who's...
-He works for me.

932
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:31,524
So...

933
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:35,321
I saw doctor Gruber yesterday.
He came by for his Oxy money.

934
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:38,574
Okay.

935
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:42,702
He said something about

936
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:46,206
you maybe having some sort
of brain disease or something.

937
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:47,625
He said I might.

938
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:55,548
I mean, I can't even
put into words how sorry I am...

939
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:56,801
Get to the point.

940
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:00,930
I have to let you go.

941
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,016
Let me go?

942
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,727
Boss! It's...

943
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:09,271
it's me! I'm fine.

944
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,190
Please.

945
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,819
What about the other day?
The... the shooters?

946
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:17,154
I got all your money.

947
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:19,907
What's your phone number?

948
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:32,545
617...

949
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:42,888
What's your address?

950
01:25:53,107 --> 01:25:55,692
"Gee, SpongeBob,
I don't know..."

951
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:57,653
Kyle!
No, fuck this guy!

952
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:05,535
Sorry.

953
01:26:05,536 --> 01:26:09,080
I can't have somebody in your
condition working for me.

954
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,374
It's just too risky.

955
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,092
So, that's it?

956
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:24,305
After 30 years?

957
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:26,807
I'm afraid so.

958
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,481
This...

959
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:36,691
this doesn't make sense, boss.

960
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:37,776
Come on, man.

961
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,404
Let's not prolong this.

962
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,324
The door's over there.

963
01:26:45,034 --> 01:26:46,827
Or do you need directions?

964
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:13,811
First day on the job?

965
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:14,897
Yeah.

966
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,243
You...

967
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,997
you hired those guys to kill me.

968
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,333
Did you know about this?

969
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:36,418
Look.

970
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:40,463
You just walk away, all right?
There'll be no repercussions.

971
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:42,091
I like repercussions.

972
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:43,841
Open your safe.

973
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,635
There's no winning here for you.

974
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:48,263
Open your fucking safe!

975
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:50,224
You're fucking crazy.

976
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:51,599
Hey!

977
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,810
-No!
- Hey!

978
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:56,854
Don't kill him! Don't kill him!
Don't kill him, all right?

979
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,439
I'm opening the safe.

980
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:06,240
Back up.

981
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:12,621
Fill the bag up... and the guns.

982
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:30,389
I came in here
to ask you for a favor.

983
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,057
And you get rid of me

984
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:36,145
like I'm dogshit on the bottom
of your fucking shoe.

985
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,523
Come on, man.

986
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:41,942
Come on, man.

987
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,154
Isn't the money enough?
Can't you...

988
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,031
can't you just walk away?

989
01:28:56,874 --> 01:28:57,875
Yeah.

990
01:29:07,176 --> 01:29:08,761
Can you make me a promise?

991
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:12,806
The kid stays alive.

992
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:16,310
Sit down.

993
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:24,193
All right.

994
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:58,810
What's the fucking emergency
I had to rush down here

995
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:00,394
in the middle of the night for?

996
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,147
Like you have anything
better to do.

997
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,607
I was playing poker.

998
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:07,236
I've seen you play cards.
I did you a favor.

999
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,033
Jesus.
You going on a shooting spree?

1000
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:15,119
Maybe.

1001
01:30:18,372 --> 01:30:19,456
This is for you.

1002
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:22,876
You've got my attention.

1003
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:26,504
Can you get a cashier's cheque
for 70 grand?

1004
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:27,589
Sure.

1005
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,761
I want you to put a downpayment
on this house.

1006
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:35,639
Take the check to my daughter,

1007
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:39,309
and help her with the paperwork
and tax stuff.

1008
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:45,149
She's a bitch on wheels.
So, watch yourself.

1009
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:56,368
Are you okay?

1010
01:30:58,453 --> 01:30:59,454
Yeah.

1011
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:01,123
I'm good.

1012
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,752
Should I ask you
where you got the dough?

1013
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:14,595
It was nice knowing you.

1014
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:26,190
Come on, come on, pick up.

1015
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,118
Fuck.

1016
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:54,968
You home?

1017
01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:19,533
Holy shit.

1018
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,161
Hey, buddy.

1019
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:26,540
What did you...

1020
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,875
What...

1021
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:30,462
Why the hell
would you do this to yourself?

1022
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:32,506
Boo boo...

1023
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,175
Come on.

1024
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:36,802
- Shit.
-Come on.

1025
01:32:37,344 --> 01:32:38,387
Shit.

1026
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,265
Let's get you up. After three.

1027
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:43,767
Oh, shit.

1028
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:48,729
Lay down with me.

1029
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:49,815
No.

1030
01:32:55,654 --> 01:32:56,655
Ow.

1031
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:02,160
How do you feel?

1032
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:06,581
I'm sorry I screwed up.

1033
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:16,173
When I said things weren't going
to end well,

1034
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:19,051
I knew it would be me
that would fuck things up.

1035
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:20,178
Mmm.

1036
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:21,990
You need help.

1037
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:26,828
You're helping me.

1038
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:30,832
I'm serious.

1039
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,050
You are helping me.

1040
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:46,283
If it ain't my old friend,
Jurassic Park.

1041
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:48,994
I want to talk some business.

1042
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,796
What's your business?

1043
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:02,299
I want to buy one of your girls.

1044
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:07,137
You fall in love, <i>viejo?</i>

1045
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,476
You going to pimp her out?

1046
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:17,397
You and me,
we're pieces of shit.

1047
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:21,233
You're a funny guy.

1048
01:36:21,234 --> 01:36:24,821
We live off pain and weakness.
We're bullies.

1049
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:28,408
And you think buying a <i>puta</i>
gonna change all that?

1050
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:33,455
Thirty thousand.

1051
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:43,215
Not bad.

1052
01:36:48,053 --> 01:36:49,179
Which one do you want?

1053
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:52,014
The little one
with the curly hair.

1054
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:53,600
And the blonde bangs.

1055
01:36:58,230 --> 01:36:59,481
She ain't for sale.

1056
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,316
Hey.

1057
01:37:02,234 --> 01:37:04,985
I'm offering you
10,000 above asking price.

1058
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:06,529
She ain't for sale.

1059
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,614
Why not?

1060
01:37:15,956 --> 01:37:17,122
One of the <i>puteros</i>

1061
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:18,833
got a little carried away
with her tonight.

1062
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:26,424
What was her name?

1063
01:37:28,468 --> 01:37:29,511
Araceli.

1064
01:37:30,971 --> 01:37:32,514
What are you gonna do with her?

1065
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,016
I don't know, man.

1066
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:43,566
You can't change the world,
<i>viejo.</i>

1067
01:37:43,567 --> 01:37:45,151
World don't want to be changed.

1068
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,744
I really don't want to
hurt anyone else, not even you.

1069
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:57,914
So, just do what I say, okay?

1070
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:01,167
Come on.

1071
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:13,304
Come out! Come on, let's go!

1072
01:38:13,305 --> 01:38:14,472
Girls! Come out...

1073
01:38:16,266 --> 01:38:17,434
Wait downstairs.

1074
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,731
Come on.

1075
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:25,275
Tell your boy
at the front door to go home.

1076
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:28,736
- Do it!
- Armando, you can knock off now.

1077
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:29,820
You sure?

1078
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,822
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it covered.

1079
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,033
All right.

1080
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:40,415
Get the girls out of here.

1081
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:44,835
Girls, get out here!

1082
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,212
Go wait in the bathroom.

1083
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:51,800
Come on, in the bathroom!

1084
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:53,469
Johns stay inside.

1085
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:54,928
Out of the rooms!

1086
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:56,431
Johns stay inside.

1087
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:57,848
No rush.

1088
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:00,435
Hey, you! Inside! Inside!

1089
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:10,820
Which way do you want me to go?

1090
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,656
The kitchen!

1091
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:14,239
Come on, girls.

1092
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,325
The kitchen!

1093
01:39:16,409 --> 01:39:17,410
You, sit down.

1094
01:39:19,788 --> 01:39:20,789
You, go!

1095
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:26,169
<i>Dinero,</i> inside.
Bring... bring in here.

1096
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:29,838
Come on.

1097
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:30,965
Attagirl.

1098
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:32,424
You're free.

1099
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:33,718
Go! Go!

1100
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:36,971
Pay them.

1101
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:40,600
Easy, easy...

1102
01:39:51,611 --> 01:39:52,696
He has a gun!

1103
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:58,034
No!

1104
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:03,665
Yeah, that's Sureño style
right there, bitch.

1105
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:09,337
You're bleeding out good, <i>viejo.</i>

1106
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,673
I can finish it off.

1107
01:40:13,133 --> 01:40:14,843
You want me to make it quick?

1108
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:18,763
After you, fuckpig.

1109
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:32,193
Just go. Go.

1110
01:40:55,884 --> 01:40:57,677
Don't wake up your mom.

1111
01:40:58,887 --> 01:40:59,888
You hear me?

1112
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,405
Don't come any closer.

1113
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:20,699
Are you okay?

1114
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,910
Yeah, I'm fine.

1115
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,204
Listen to me, Dre.

1116
01:41:26,122 --> 01:41:30,043
You're gonna hear some bad stuff
about me in the next few days.

1117
01:41:33,797 --> 01:41:37,300
Maybe the only way for me
to do something right...

1118
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:39,844
is by doing something bad.

1119
01:41:42,472 --> 01:41:44,474
I... I don't get it.

1120
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:49,771
It might not make any sense
to you now, but...

1121
01:41:58,863 --> 01:41:59,864
I tried.

1122
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:03,076
I tried.

1123
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:05,453
Go back inside.

1124
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:08,539
I... I'll be fine. Go on.

1125
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:09,833
Go on. Go on.

1126
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:27,952
Hello?

1127
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:53,311
Hello?

1128
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,356
Anybody here?
