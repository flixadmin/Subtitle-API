1
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,510
Nothing.

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,221
There's gotta be some spell,
some potion,

3
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,556
something to give us the power

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,808
so we can touch the Loom
without turning extra-crispy.

5
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,894
There's also the question
of who's gonna use it with me.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,897
The Loom requires three weavers
who are as powerful as gods.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,317
Well, I'm not leaving my mom's life
in the hands of you idiots.

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,776
Wow.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,070
Okay, well, that's one person.
What do you think, Sara?

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,615
I'm already a blind
time-traveling Paragon

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,824
who can see the future.

12
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,494
So, might as well just add
"wannabe god" to the list.

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,746
Speaking of which,

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,333
can you use your Sara-Vision to tell me
if what I need is in this book?

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,002
Nothing there.

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,378
You know, you could just read the book.

17
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,882
[sighs] You know I would do anything
to save Behrad, but this is faster.

18
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,091
[Gary grunts]

19
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,094
These are all the spell books
in the manor you asked for.

20
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,679
Yes, you're a good man, Gary.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,014
[grunts]

22
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,558
[Gary] And these...

23
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,977
-are for you.
- Mmm.

24
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,021
Can you just give them to me?

25
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,398
Thank you.

26
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,276
- Shouldn't you be resting?
- Shouldn't you get out of my face?

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,653
-[Gary] Yeah.
- No, he's right, love.

28
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,529
Getting some rest
wouldn't be a bad thing.

29
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,781
Not gonna happen.

30
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,617
Look, the sooner we find
this magical cure-all,

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,953
then the sooner we can use the Loom
and get my sight back.

32
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,162
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,791
This book says that Merlin used
the Philosopher's Stone.

34
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,127
-[scoffs] That thing's as real as Santa.
- Shh! Gary's in the room.

35
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,879
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,632
The Chalice of Dionysus.

37
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,885
It says here that the Chalice was gifted
to an Olympian, Dionysus,

38
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,011
by his father, Zeus.

39
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,430
Whoever drinks from it becomes a god.

40
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,723
But only for a day.

41
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,559
Look, don't get your hopes up,
all right?

42
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,811
The Olympians fed off devotion,

43
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,230
so once they lost their followers,
they just died off,

44
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,524
and their enchanted objects...
Lost to time.

45
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:49,693
I've seen that.

46
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,070
I've seen that.
I've seen that in college.

47
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,990
Okay, your degree is finally paying off.

48
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,533
What class did you see it in?

49
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,659
[chuckles]

50
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,035
That was not in a class.

51
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,745
<i>[students chanting] Chug! Chug! Chug!</i>

52
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,247
Chug! Chug! Chug!

53
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,665
<i>[Nate] It's called the Chug Cup.</i>

54
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,958
Chug! Chug! Chug!

55
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,794
<i>Right, campus legend said

56
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,171

57
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>Now, I went to a rival school,</i>

58
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,848
<i>so the only way I could get a taste
of it is if we, you know...</i>

59
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,141
Hey!

60
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,976
[student] Who's that?

61
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,771
-[ladder rattles]
-[Nate gasps]

62
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,940
Hudson sucks, Brixton rules!

63
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:29,899
[screams]

64
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,651
[cheering]

65
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,737
...stole it. [chuckles]

66
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,614
We really think that Dionysus' Chalice

67
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,825
-is with bunch of frat boys?
- Yes.

68
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>[Gideon] A scan of social media
confirms that a Chalice</i>

69
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,413
<i>matching that of Dionysus
is currently in possession</i>

70
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,291
<i>of the Sigma Psi Phi fraternity
at Hudson University.</i>

71
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,459
[Astra] So, we get that,

72
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,502
I become immortal, use the Loom,

73
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,504
and I can forget I ever knew you people.

74
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,466
Well, then, Legends,

75
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,429
you better get your togas dry-cleaned
because we are going Greek.

76
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,819
[Agent Sharpe] So, babe, all right.

77
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,197
Every year, the Chug Cup
is presented at the student fair.

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,907
And then, apparently,
fraternities and sororities

79
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,077
compete for the right to drink in it
in something called the Chug Challenge.

80
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,245
Definitely our best place
to try to steal the Chalice.

81
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,246
Truth.

82
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,831
Okay, I can get around the ship,

83
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,666
but I'm not so sure
about navigating my way

84
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,419
through a bunch
of drunk college kids, so...

85
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,837
You got this.

86
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,464
- Yeah.
- Team loves you. Don't worry.

87
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,883
Okay, I'm not... I'm not really worried
about them accepting me.

88
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,593
The college kids, on the other hand--

89
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,345
Hi, Aunt Ava, Sara.

90
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,638
[gasps]

91
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,557
Lita, honey, I am so, so glad
that you're still here.

92
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,850
I need you to help me with something.

93
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,436
Um, what are the, like,
kids into these days?

94
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,772
Like, I need them to think I'm cool.

95
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,565
Mission's at Hudson U.

96
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,650
Oh, my guidance counselor

97
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,318
-told me to apply there.
-[Sara] Mmm.

98
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,904
- Sweetie, that's amazing.
- I can't afford it.

99
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,656
You should do it.

100
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,700
If you want to do it,
I can make it happen.

101
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,246
Yeah, I mean, it could be cool
to take a tour. We're here, right?

102
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,250
Yeah, yeah. The, um, mission's all good.
Rory, you should definitely do that.

103
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,626
Okay. Thanks.

104
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,003
If you want kids to think you're cool,
I wouldn't wear that.

105
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,422
They're gonna think
you look like a narc.

106
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,840
I'm... What...

107
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,432
[marching band music playing]

108
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,272
Welcome to Hudson University.

109
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,440
[inhales deeply]

110
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,400
[sighs] You smell that?

111
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,652
Mmm. That smells like the good ol' days.

112
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,029
[grunting] I've had it.
I can't breathe in here.

113
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,657
Ooh. Maybe it was for the better.
What is that smell?

114
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,869
Okay, so the Sigmas hosted the games.
We find them, we find the cup.

115
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,872
Great. Let's fan out. Zari, thank you.
Nate, take up the north end.

116
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,123
-[Nate] Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you.

117
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,041
- Astra, Charlie, you guys--
- Let's just find this Chalice

118
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,418
so we can get this over with.

119
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,837
I wasn't finished, but...

120
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,505
- I'll go after her.
- Thank you.

121
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,760
Pledge Theta! Find your girl gang.

122
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,180
Maybe you can tell me where
I can find the Chalice of Dionysus.

123
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,432
Sorry, we're just really excited
about the Chug Challenge.

124
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,143
Why are we even doing this?
We should just take it by force.

125
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,646
Listen to me. In order to use the Loom,
the weavers have to be in sync.

126
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,856
Now, I'm not gonna let you use it

127
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,649
unless you can prove
that you can work as a team.

128
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,775
Let me?

129
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,488
I left Hell 'cause I was done
working for a Fate.

130
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,616
[sighs]

131
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,579
[tour guide] And that was Quincy Hall,
our economics building.

132
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,873
Hudson has the top program
in the country.

133
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,291
- Did you hear that, Henry?
- Yeah.

134
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,836
[Gene] He's majoring in finance.
I told him, "You have to go to Hudson."

135
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,297
You know
that's not the only reason, Gene.

136
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,257
Guilty. [chuckles]

137
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
I want him to follow in Dad's footsteps.

138
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,387
I'm an alumnus,
you probably noticed the scarf.

139
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,555
Yeah.

140
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,390
[mutters] I'd like to wring your neck
with it.

141
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,558
What was that?

142
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,684
- I said...
-[Lita coughs]

143
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,478
I said it's a great building.

144
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,898
Good brick structure, fire-resistant.

145
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,441
Oh, you really know your architecture.

146
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,901
- Where did you study?
- Iron Heights.

147
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,029
- Haven't heard of it.
- It's a super prestigious art school.

148
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,030
Oh.

149
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,866
[chuckles] Just go with it.

150
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,913
I can't believe I'm back here.

151
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,665
They used to call me Shotgun Nate.

152
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,375
[sighs] I think I know Why, but why?

153
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,669
Is that true, Pops?
Show us what you got.

154
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,796
N

155

PODS. Pops. [scoffs]

156
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,967
Pops.

157
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,642
And I also turn to steel.

158
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,810
Whoa!

159
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,062
Okay, come on, Grandpa.
We gotta keep looking.

160
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,146
[air horn blares]

161
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,356
[chanting] Sigma Psi Phi!

162
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,816
- What?
- Sigma Psi Phi!

163
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,359
- What?
- Sigma Psi Phi!

164
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,111
Ava, I think we found the Sigmas.

165
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,238
<i>Ava? Hello?</i>

166
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,240
[grunting]

167
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,285
I'm on my way.

168
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:55,748
[chanting] Sigma Psi Phi!
Sigma Psi Phi! Sigma Psi Phi!

169
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,551
Oh, wow. That was just like
my entrance to the 2044 VMAs.

170
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,186
What's up, Hudson hedonists?

171
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,855
[cheering]

172
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,984
Welcome to the Chug Challenge's
pre-game!

173
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,777
- That's the Chalice.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

174
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,488
- That's Dion.
-[Astra] Hmm?

175
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,741
He was the head of the Sigmas
when I was in school.

176
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,034
The guy hasn't aged a day.

177
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,202
We have so much in common.

178
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,663
Dude, that's because
your Dion is Dionysus.

179
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,540
This is the Greek god
of wine and revelry!

180
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,459
God, the guy's a riot, honestly.

181
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,211
Now, as chug keeper,

182
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,466
I get the honor of announcing
our 2020 Challenges.

183
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,177
[cheering]

184
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,307
I will reveal the first round tonight
at the Sigma rager.

185
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,393
Now let the Challenge begin!

186
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,145
[cheering, grunting]

187
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,899
Look, just leave this to me, all right?

188
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,776
Oi, Dion.

189
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,904
Or should I say, Dionysus.

190
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,281
- It's me, Clotho.
- Clotho?

191
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,242
- Yes.
- Damn, it's really you.

192
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,744
My God.

193
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,791
The Loombreaker is in the house!

194
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,919
Dude, back before people had free will,

195
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,880
the gods were always
reining in the party.

196
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,757
But look at me now.

197
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,467
You're in college.

198
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,928
Yeah, I know. I'm a lifer.

199
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,264
I found a place where the party
doesn't stop, and I haven't left since.

200
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,308
Honestly, they worship me here,

201
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,686
and they don't even know
that I'm the party god.

202
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,729
- Hey, listen, man, um...
- Yeah.

203
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,272
I kind of wanted
to ask a little favor of you.

204
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,566
Yeah, anything
for the Loombreaker, and, um...

205
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,820
- Sick, is this your squad?
- Yeah.

206
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,780
Yeah, they call me Shotgun Nate.

207
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,407
- I went to Brixton, but--
- All right, enough of this.

208
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,366
Whoa, whoa...

209
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,243
[Dionysus] Hey. Whoa.

210
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,913
So, that's why you're really here.

211
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,666
Wanted to give your gang
a little taste of immortality, hmm?

212
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,750
Is that what it is?

213
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,003
Well, here's the thing.
To pick this up, you gotta be Greek,

214
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,672
and I gotta deem you worthy.

215
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,298
Okay, how are we supposed to do that?

216
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,466
Ah, good question.

217
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,761
You gotta either join a sorority,
a fraternity or a frorority,

218
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,179
and you gotta win the Chug Challenge.

219
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,806
- This is ridiculous.
- Ah!

220
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,474
And that's what makes it fun.

221
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,145
- See you, Clotho.
-[Nate sighs]

222
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,730
He's still so... Ow!

223
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,065
Just stop. I need to focus.
I need to think of something.

224
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,400
- I have an idea.
- No.

225
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,485
Something that does not involve maiming.

226
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,907
[students chatting and laughing]

227
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,663
Since the Chalice belongs to Dion,
we've gotta follow his rules.

228
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,250
You guys, we're gonna win that cup.

229
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,176
So, what you're saying is
in order to use the Loom of Fate,

230
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,386
we have to join a sorority?

231
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,014
Ah, finally. A mission I can get behind.

232
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,684
Luckily for us, the Thetas are hosting
a pledge social today.

233
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,436
This cannot be your plan.

234
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,938
Look, as long as Dion's got the cup,
we've gotta play by his rules.

235
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,900
Counterpoint. You don't get anywhere
playing by the rules.

236
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,860
Oh, really? Because I think I was
about to win him over

237
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,695
before you tried to nab the cup.

238
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,325
Hey, okay. So, who wants to rush
Theta Lambda Rho?

239
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,410
No, no, no. Just stop.

240
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,287
Charlie, Astra, you'll pledge Theta.

241
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,997
Just try to remember
you're on the same side, yeah?

242
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,915
Yeah.

243
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,833
Yeah. Sure we are.

244
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,296
[whispers] She's exhausting.

245
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,384
So, I'm doing track and debate,
plus my dad got me this internship.

246
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,178
What are your extracurriculars?

247
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,472
I was in band for a while, but I quit

248
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,849
because no one else wanted
to play The Replacements.

249
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,936
And I have a part-time job.
I heard that helps.

250
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,647
Actually, to get into a place like this,

251
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,274
you'll really want to build out
your application.

252
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,696
And here we are at Neuman Hall.

253
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,699
The name might sound familiar
to some families on this tour.

254
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,326
Oh, Henry Neuman.

255
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,786
This is actually
my grandfather's building,

256
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,705
which should help my chances
of getting in here.

257
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,541
Hey, hope I didn't miss
too much of the tour.

258
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,210
Uh, just to be super clear,
I'm not a prospective student.

259
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:13,130
Okay, my name is Dr. Nate Heywood.
I got my PhD from Brixton.

260
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,340
Go, Big Red.

261
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,133
Oh, a doctor.

262
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,094
And Lita's dad.

263
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,679
- What?
- What?

264
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,139
Just go with it.

265
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,645
Thank you for your enquiry.
I think it's really important...

266
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,188
- Hi, how's it going?
- Be yourself.

267
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691
Hi.

268
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,779
I can't believe we are this close
to becoming Thetas.

269
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,366
I don't even know you,
but we could be sisters.

270
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,076
I'm only here as a performance.

271
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,786
Notice my empty teacup,

272
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,872
a commentary on the emptiness
of this charade.

273
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,457
Oh, my God.
We should start a group text.

274
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,167
What are your numbers?

275
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,919
[applause]

276
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,505
Welcome to the Theta luncheon.

277
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,299
Everybody, look around you.

278
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,885
This could be your new family,

279
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,890
the ones you turn to for support,
sisterhood, guidance.

280
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,017
That is, as long as you make the cut.

281
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,519
[chuckles] So, bid Theta.

282
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,437
[maps]

283
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,774
[Charlie] What are you doing?

284
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,068
Come on, we gotta try and convince
these people, no matter what.

285
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,155
Now, just try and fit in, please.

286
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,574
Fine. You want me to fit in?

287
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,828
Waiter, replace this drink.

288
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,789
If I wanted weak tea, I'd rush Omega.

289
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,499
[Mel] on!

290
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,045
This girl's fire. I like that.

291
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,963
We're gonna start with your table.

292
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,302
This here is the house paddle,

293
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,512
our most sacred object.

294
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,222
I'm going to ask a question,

295
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,975
and when you're holding the paddle,
it's your turn to answer.

296
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,143
Okay?

297
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,230
[chuckles] What did you do
before college?

298
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,734
So, I grew up in Hell,

299
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,528
had minions do my bidding
and rose to power

300
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,197
until I practically ran the place.

301
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,616
Oh, and she's ambitious.

302
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,785
Now you go.

303
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,578
Oh. Okay, um...

304
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,040
Well, I traveled around the world
with a bunch of friends.

305
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,376
- Oh.
- More like rejects.

306
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,503
[students giggle]

307
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,798
But before that, I was actually
in this really cool punk band.

308
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,801
Yeah, Thetas don't really do punk.

309
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,594
Yeah, I know her type.

310
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,263
You pretend like you're
all about bucking the system,

311
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,725
and then you get pissed when people
don't fall in line behind you.

312
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,480
You think you're better
than the sisters you ran away from,

313
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,107
but the truth is...

314
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,359
you're all the same.

315
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,321
That's a little bit rich, isn't it?

316
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,700
- Coming from my sister's lapdog.

-[gasps]

319
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,923
Theta, no.

320
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,263
You know what?
This whole table is exiled.

321
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,849
None of you are Theta material.

322
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,571
How'd the mission go?
You immortal sorority girls yet?

323
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,239
[Charlie sighs] I need a drink.

324
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,198
Mmm.

325
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,492
The refreshing sound of failure.

326
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,120
We would be well on our way
to using the Loom right now

327
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,705
if someone hadn't blown it.

328
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,916
Our cover was blown 'cause you decided
to go Hell mode on us.

329
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,710
Oh, you think that was Hell mode?
Honey...

330
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,420
Call me "honey" again.
Go on, I dare you.

331
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,921
Try me
and you'll wish you were immortal.

332
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,506
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

333
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,716
No one's killing anyone.

334
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,925
[exclaims]

335
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,553
Astra was definitely gonna go for it.
Zari, hide that fork.

336
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,722
[Agent Sharpe] Charlie, just chill.
Please sit down.

337
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,349
Just take a breath, yeah?
All right. You good?

338
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,934
Okay.

339
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,770
All right, we need to find another way
to get the Chalice.

340
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,731
You can't defy a god.
We have to win as a sorority.

341
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,274
And with no sorority...

342
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,319
- We're screwed.
- Yeah.

343
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,698
Ladies, we're gonna start our own.

344
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,992
I can't tell, is she serious?

345
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,661
I think so.

346
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,663
Becoming an official sorority
by tonight?

347
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,040
I mean, the paperwork alone would...

348
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,085
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

349
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,461
Why not?

350
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,172
I really should've killed you all
when I had the chance.

351
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,382
Go, sisters.

352
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,717
Whoo!

353
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,970
We'll get there.

354
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,472
[students chuckle]

355
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,015
- Do you think my dad's okay?
- Oh, yeah.

356
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,060
He comes and goes as he pleases.
It's really part of his charm.

357
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,271
Bright side is I get to show you
what college is all about.

358
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,023
This is Greek Row.

359
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,651
This is where the fraternities
and the sororities live.

360
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,195
They're the most influential people
on campus.

361
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,322
[whoops]

362
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,241
These are the guys
that have the Chalice?

363
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,743
- Mmm-hmm.
- Wish I could be more impressed.

364
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:59,416
Call the Bro Patrol.
Looks like somebody wants to party!

365
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,709
Is he talking to us?

366
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,294
- Act cool. Be cool. Shut up.
- I don't--

367
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:09,051
Uh, this is Agent Heywood to Bro Patrol.
Desire to party confirmed.

368
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,052
Whoo!

369
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,971
[chuckles] How cool was that?

370
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,055
Do you have a man-crush?

371
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,640
No. It's unrequited.

372
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,350
- You should tell him.
- Shut up.

373
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,811
Super-stoked that you're here.

374
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,273
Anyone who's a friend of the Loombreaker
is chill with me.

375
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,775
So snag some bags and some brews.

376
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,237
Oh, and fear not, we have energy drinks
for the little ones.

377
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,739
It's all peers, no pressure
at Casa de Sigma.

378
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,617
Uh, I want to say that's tight,

379
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,745
but, uh, I got responsibilities.

380
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,167
Well, hey, come by anytime,
and we'll party like it's 1999.

381
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,044
Wait, hold on.

382
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,088
You said these are the guys
that have the Chalice, right?

383
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,006
Uh-huh.

384
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,507
So, why don't you go inside
and get requited,

385
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,509
and I can do some scouting
and find out where they keep it.

386
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,346
Only if your dad doesn't try to set me
on fire while I'm asleep. Deal?

387
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,890
Yeah, deal.

388
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,602
All right, so what are we doing?
League rules?

389
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,729
All right, two points
for those overhangs!

390
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,688
[cheering]

391
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,027
Okay, I call to order
the charter meeting of Delta Chi Sigma,

392
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,486
Sisterhood of Legends.

393
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,071
Let's make a sorority.

394
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,907
First up, we need a house.

395
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,159
I say we steal the Thetas' place.

396
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,660
You disable
the carbon monoxide detector,

397
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,745
I'll go in, cut the power--

398
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,788
Or I have a more non-fatal idea.

399
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,708
There's a place that's been empty
since Pi Epsilon's last rager.

400
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,793
Something about a de-Jell-O-ing?

401
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,755
- Oh, that is really foul.
- Yeah.

402
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,131
But with a little trickery,

403
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,717
I'll just open up a portal,
instant remodel.

404
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,510
They'll never know the difference.

405
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,930
You know, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

406
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,807
It's not my fault you can't resist
my effortless charms.

407
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,478
Obviously,
we're gonna have to redecorate.

408
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,272
Well, you lot have fun. I can't bear
to watch you desecrate this place.

409
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,525
Oh, and watch out for these bad boys.

410
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,527
They bite.

411
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,988
Mmm, so do I.

412
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,619
Okay, so, in order
to be an official sorority,

413
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,454
we need three more sisters.

414
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,623
And if we wanna win that Chalice,
they gotta be good.

415
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,208
So, Gideon, what do you got?

416
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,878
[Gideon] Inez Martin was voted out
of pep squad for being too enthusiastic.

417
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,838
Hey.

418
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,173
How's it going? What's up?

419
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,883
Hi. Hey, there.

420
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,719
- Oh, uh, Inez, right?
- Yes.

421
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,013
This is weird, but I was just wondering
if you wanted to join--

422
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,473
Definitely.

423
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,557
You don't even know what I--

424
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,101
It doesn't matter. Where can I meet you?

425
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,603
[Gideon] Lisa Lindhome.
Aspiring influencer,

426
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,855
shunned after becoming the subject
of a viral video

427
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,441
entitled "Girl Snarts at Party."

428
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,278
Wait. What is a snart?

429
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,904
It's when you sneeze and--

430
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,324
And let's not. Let's just ease Astra
back onto Earth, all right?

431
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,409
Fair.

432
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,308
[Gideon] Silvia Hines created
her own major in performance art.

433
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,977
You're the ones who tried
to kill each other at the tea party.

434
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,186
Yeah, about that.

435
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,646
We've actually started
our own sorority and--

436
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,442
What is the point of partying
with a bunch of brain-dead wasteoids?

437
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,445
I get it.

438
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,905
Seems impossible
to feel any kind of power

439
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,824
in a cruel, dying world, right?

440
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,996
But have you considered that winning
the masses over with the illusion of fun

441
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,623
might be the perfect way to ply them
to do your bidding?

442
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,668
I'm in.

443
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,839
[Gideon] Unfortunately, Captain,
the pool of Theta rejects is slim.

444
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,424
Beggars can't be choosers.

445
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,967
I like 'em.

446
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,639
We chose you
because we know what it's like

447
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,309
looking for a place to belong.

448
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,354
Because we, too, were there at your age.

449
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,316
That's why we've created that place.

450
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:57,613
And as of today, you are Deltas.

451
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,533
Welcome to the sisterhood.

452
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,122
Wait, are you blind?

453
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,749
Yes.

454
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,460
I love it. Deltas are so inclusive.

455
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,212
But don't we need a motto?

456
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,923
We can't do anything without a motto.

457
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,510
Yeah. The sisters...

458
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,472
...are the glue...

459
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,017
Glue that greases the wheels of...

460
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,144
time.

461
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,522
[chuckles] That doesn't make any sense.

462
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,023
It's called avant-garde.

463
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,400
What about, um,

464
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:39,863
"We might not have it all together,
but together we have it all"?

465
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,076
Okay, I need that on a T-shirt,
like, now.

466
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,163
- Okay, go, sisters.
-[all cheering]

467
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,623
Sisters!

468
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,001
I'm telling you, I can take it.

469
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,795
Dude, it's 2020.
We don't do that anymore.

470
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,547
[exclaims] Just do it.

471
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,425

Hey.

480
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,044
So glad that you found us.

481
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,006
I knew that you had bro-tential
the second I saw you.

00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:39,965
[Nate] That's nice of you.

483
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,842

I brew it out back.
I hope you like IPAs.

487
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,892
- Bro, I am all about the IPAs.
- Yeah?

488
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,811
- You mind?
-[students clamoring]

489
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,817
- My man.
- Mmm! So good.

00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,486
Yeah, that brew right there,

491
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,155
honestly, will just take you back
to the glory days.

492
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,242
Make you forget all about that stupid
and stressful world out there.

493
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,952
- Honestly, it's magic, bro.
- Yeah.

494
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,206
I, um... [clears throat]
I just need to check up...

495
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,420
I feel awesome.

496
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,963
- I knew you would.
- Thank you.

497
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,049
- Hey, I wanted to ask you something.
- What?

498
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,260
Why did you and your friends
really end up here, of all places?

499
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,762
Oh, man, they're cool.

500
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,973
Uh, we just wanted to take your Chalice,
so we can use the Loom of Fate.

501
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,896
Are you saying that the Loombreaker
is a Loomfaker?

502
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:42,945
Bro, you're a looker and a cooker.

503
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,367
Right, but she puts
that Loom together...

There goes the party.

[Agent Sharpe] Yeah.

This should scare the competition.

Yeah, and put us well on track
to using the Loom.

Okay, I think this calls
for a snack party.

I've just always been so focused
on changing the world at all costs

00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,210
that I just push people away.

So.., thanks.

Oh, I mean...

They're really the ones who...

532
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,887
Thank you.

00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,354
Loom or no Loom,
at least some things are changing.

Yeah, we're gonna go train
for your dumb challenge,

On, right. Uh...

00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,160
I'm not here
just to meet the new neighbors.

556
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,829
I also wanted to tell you...

557
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,541
that you're disqualified
from the Chug Challenges.

558

There's no way you're getting
that Chalice.

The hell are you on about?

Shotgun told me why you're really here.

00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,177
And the thing is,
I just can't have you using that Loom.

562
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,179
Thing's a total buzzkill.

We did everything you said,
played by every stupid rule.

You can't just change them on us now.

Well, yeah, I can.

keep it whimsical, bro.

What's wrong?

573
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,166
We're not getting the Chalice,
that's what.

574
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,501
Dion's refusing to let us participate
in the challenges.

575
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,628
He somehow got to Nate,
figured out what we're doing.

576
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,005
Of course he did.

577
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,883
[sighs] It's okay,
we will figure this out.

578
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,178
I am done trying to figure this out
with you people.

579
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,054
I should've done this my way
from the start,

580
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,806
so I'm taking that Chalice by force.

581
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,434
Look, even if you tried,
that won't work. You can't defy a god.

582
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,978
And there is no way you're using
the Loom on your own.

583
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,314
Being a grown-up sounds weird.

584

[Astra] If I can't get Dion's cup,
I can at least make him suffer.

Him and all his bros,

586
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,196
including your
hyp-bro-tized friend, Nate.

587
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,405
Hold on a minute.

588
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,574
You can't do that.
We're a sisterhood, remember?

589
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,951
You can stop feeding me
that line right now.

590
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,871
You pretend we're sisters,
but all you do is expect me to change.

591
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,749
I'm only your sister
if I become more like you.

592
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,502
- Astra, calm down, that's not--
-[Astra] You never listen to my ideas,

593
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,629
and I see how you all look at me.

594
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,256
I might be new to this,
but that is not sisterhood,

595
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,675
and I am done trying to fit in.

596
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,391
Hey, got your text.

597
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
[Mick] Hey.

598
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,978
Where were you?

599
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,231
Trying to get you into this place.
What do you think?

600
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,526
What? Dad, how'd you do this?

601
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,236
Went back in time. Donated.

602
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,154
You're as good as in.

603
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,032
Thank you,
but I didn't really need a building.

604
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,826
I just needed you here.

605
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,372
Well, I thought you were embarrassed
to be with me.

606
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,541
I don't belong with these people.

607
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,042
I didn't want to ruin your chances.

608
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,171
I'm sorry, it wasn't about you.
I was just ashamed of me.

609
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,173
What are you talking about?

610
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,884
Don't be stupid. You're great.

611
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,010
Yeah, but I don't belong
with them either.

612
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,012
I mean, the only reason
that I survived high school

613
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,641
was because I was imagining that one day
I would get out and find my people.

614
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,768
They're never gonna take me
as one of them.

615
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,270
I don't really want to be.

616
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,522
You don't have to impress these idiots,
these leeches.

617
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,775
- You're twice the person they'd ever be.
- Yeah, but so are you.

618
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,319
I mean, you fought a demon dog.

619
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,113
And these people think
that they're better than us

620
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,406
because they have whales
on their shorts?

621

[Lita scoffs]

622
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,326
What do you say we find a way
to piss off some rich kids?

623
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,787
I like the sound of that.

624
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,381
Give me that.

625
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,389
Wait, Astra, no, no, no!
You don't have to do this.

626
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,724
I am done listening to you.

627
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,893
Fine, then don't listen to me.
Listen to yourself.

628
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,562
Come on, you know this isn't right.

629
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,188
Yeah, that's the thing,
I don't know that.

630
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,816
Where I'm from,
I had to fight to survive.

631
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,860
This is all I know.
This is what life has made me.

632
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,320
I am not gonna change.

633
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,697
Blimey, no, we don't want you
to give up who you are.

634
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,783
Look, when I joined the Legends,
I was a punk.

635
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,161
All right? And there wasn't a rule
that I couldn't break.

636
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,455
And guess what? I still am.

637
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,457
I just don't need to hurt people
to survive anymore,

638
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,500
because I have them.

639
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,215
Fine, so I don't burn down a house.

640
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,509
But what if I never wanna dress
as a moose,

641
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,679
or sit through one
of your interminable team meetings?

642
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,348
Then we've still got a place for you.

643
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,643
Did you come to party down?

644
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,062
No, we've come
to get the Chalice and you.

645
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,022
Come on, Nate, you can't stay here.

646
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,733
Sure, I can.
Dion says as long as he has followers,

647
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,777
he has the power to run this place
and grant people that cup.

648
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,614
Thought that'd be useful information
for you.

649
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,949
Can't really remember why.

650
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,618
Either way, I'm very important here,
so excuse me.

651
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:50,914
-[chanting] Shotgun Nate! Shotgun Nate!
-[students] Shotgun Nate! Shotgun Nate!

652
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,124
- Shotgun Nate! Shotgun Nate!
- Wait.

653
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,837
The Olympians feed off devotion, right?

654
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,632
So that means that Dion
only has his followers

655
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,134
for as long as they worship him
as the party god.

656
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,138
So, if we take away
all these followers from him,

657
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,307
that's it, the Chalice is released
from his grasp.

658
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,143
Okay, but the party isn't slowing down.

659
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,106
No, but there is one way
to get college kids to leave a party.

660
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,858
Oh, wait, no, no, please don't say--

661
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,779
And that is to throw
an even bigger party. Which means...

662
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,572
[groans] What is wrong with you people?

663
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,782
Come on.

664
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,786
[exhales] The Deltas
have got to out-party Dionysus.

665
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,788
I am still in Hell, aren't I?

666
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,581
Come on.

667
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,137
I can't believe it.
Delta's very first house party.

668
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,139
You know, I'm actually excited.

669
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,683
I get it now.
Parties aren't just about getting drunk.

670
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,309
They're about building community.

671
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,770
This is so much better
than just some frat party.

672
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,940
Yeah, it would be
if anyone were here to see it.

673
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,942
So, where is everybody?

674
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,819
You know what? I think I know.

675

[sighs]

677
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,164
I don't know why we thought
we could out-party Dion.

678
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,041
You know what? Let's not give up yet.

679
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:20,295
Why not? We have drinks, games, music.

680
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,757
We did everything we were supposed to,
and no one came.

681
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,302
That's right. We did everything
that we were supposed to.

682
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,264
But maybe we should ask ourselves,
"What would Astra do?"

683
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,102
If you really want to win,

684
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,229
it is not enough to be good
at your own game.

685
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,066
You also
have to take out the competition.

686
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,776
So, I am talking...

687
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,653
-sabotage.
- Yeah.

688
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,406
All right, what's the plan?

689
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,867
First, we take Dion out of play.

690
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,203
Now, I scoped out his place
when I was gonna burn it down,

691
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,413
and I have an idea.

692
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,666
[hip-hop music playing]

693
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,545
Ooh. 'Sup, Charlie?

00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,219
[whooshing]

695
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,098
- Big D!
-[Dionysus] Yeah.

696
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,933
Now that I got my team out of your hair,

697
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,393
how about we get
a fresh keg and celebrate?

698
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,729
I like how you think, Shotgun.

699
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,689
<i>[Astra] Once he's out,
we mess with his party.</i>

700
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,566
<i>Anything we can do to kill the vibe.</i>

701
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,402
Hacking into Dion's accounts and...

702
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,282
<i>- Buh-bye, party playlist.</i>
-[music stops]

703
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,118
Hey. Who cut the music?

[yodel music playing]

705
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,246
What the hell is this?

<i>[Astra] Then we take out his booze.</i>

707
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,836
And this is where all the magic happens.

708
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,712
[Charlie as Nate] Wow.

709
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,092
So, uh, are these all lagers?

710
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,552
Whoa.

711
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,846
I'm sorry, bro. No hard feelings, yeah?

712
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,472
Dad, now!

And now the keg is tapped.

716
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,448
So, final phase, hijack the party.

717
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,995
Hey, guys, I heard there's a rager
at Delta Chi Sigma.

718
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,539
[students cheering]

719
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,877
So, what are we waiting for?

720
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,587
Let's go party.

721
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,298
[upbeat dance song playing]

722
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,178
I gotta say it,
you Legends do know how to party.

723
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,180
Rory, are you able
to lift the Chalice yet?

724
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,224
[grunts] It's still not giving.

725
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,187
That doesn't make sense.
All of his followers are here.

726
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,443
Cool little trick you pulled back there.
Gotta appreciate a good stunt.

727
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,197
Still, I heard there was a party
that I wasn't invited to,

728
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,656
and that hurts.

729
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,617
We're getting that Chalice, Dion.

730
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,038
As long as I have my followers,
my Chug Cup isn't going anywhere.

Your reign on this campus is over.

00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,761
I challenge you...

736
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,263
to beer pong.

737
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,848
[students] Ooh.

738
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:26,397
You do know I'm undefeated
in all my years on campus, right?

739
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:32,779
Yeah, but it might be pretty hard
to hold on to all your followers

740
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,199
once they watch me demolish you.

741
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,536
So come on, D-Bag.

742
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,413

What do you say?

744
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,293
Winner takes all. Dartmouth rules.

746
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,258
You know I can't say no to a challenge.

00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,010
Hmm.

Stupid whimsy. You're on.

00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,266
But if I win,

'Cause, you know, you can't see.

Oh, I've played some beer pong
in my life.

And plus, superpowers, remember?

756
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,248

[students cheering]

758
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,585
Now, sink a ball into a cup
and the other player drinks it.

759
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:33,256
And to make it even more fun,
body saves are fair game.

So remember, everybody, the first player
to clear the other's cups takes it all.

762
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,806
Now, opponents, please shake hands.

763
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,810

We gotta give it to her.

787
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,759
Wait, wait, wait.
What happened to "Bros for life"?

788
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:42,677
[exclaims]

789
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,888
Come on. I know you wanna say it.

790
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,099
I will not.

791
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,767
Then I will.

792
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,353
Go, sisters!

793
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,855
[all cheering]

794
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,814
[portal opens]

795
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:56,899
Huh?

796
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,152
Got your cup.

797
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,529
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

798
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,242
Best father-daughter weekend ever.

799
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,255
I can't believe that actually worked.

800
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,548
Yeah, you'll get used to it.

801
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,842
We couldn't have done it
without the three of you.

802
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,428
Yeah, thanks for sticking with us
even when we were right gits.

803
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,387
[all chuckling]

804
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,680
It's been real, ladies.

805
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:31,184
I'm sorry this chapter of Delta Chi
Sigma has to come to an end.

806
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,435
Oh, it's not over.

807
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,936
We're gonna keep Delta House going.

808
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,146
- What?
-[Lisa] After the party,

809
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,356
I applied for a house on Greek Row.

810
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,358
Fitting in is hard enough.

811
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,320
So many people telling you what to do
and what to wear.

812
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,448
Now there's a space for people
to figure it out for themselves.

813
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,532
Thanks to you guys.

814
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,243
I get it. You're welcome.

815
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,661
[Zari] All right, ladies.

816
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,787
-[Charlie] Oi.
- What?

817
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,747
One for the road?

818
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,956
Go...

819
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,041
[all] Deltas.

820
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,586
[Zari] Aw.

821
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,629
We'll miss you.

822
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,422
- Say no to drugs, kids.
-[Zari sighs]

823
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,382
Don't do it. It's not worth it.

824
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,052
- I need a nap.
-[chuckles]

825
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,225
[Dionysus] You guys earned
the good stuff.

826
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:16,270
You won the Chalice and, with it,
immortality for a day.

827
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,398
All right, guess it's time to chug.

828
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,194
[sighs]

829
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,531
To Behrad and to your mum.

830
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,035
[sighs] Well...

831
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,829
[chuckles] It's actually quite a lot
of responsibility, really.

832
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,915
And that is a lot of wine.

833
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,584
Why don't we all just drink from it?

834
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,503
I mean, who says there only has
to be three Fates, right?

835
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,837
Yeah, we could
all use the Loom together.

836
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,381
Yeah, you're not alone in this, love.

837
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,508
Immortality sounds pretty epic.

838
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,634
-[Charlie chuckles]
- Let's drink.

839
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,095
Let's all do it, then.

840
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,388
-[Agent Sharpe] Yeah.
-[Nate] All right.

841
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,348
[Charlie sighs]

842
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,310
[chuckles]

843
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,566
[groans] Wow.

844
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:05,152
[clears throat] Yeah,
I'm not gonna drink, super haram,

845
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,197
but I trust all of you to bring
my baby brother back.

846
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,453
Here goes nothing.

847
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,041
[Sara exclaims]

848
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,383
[Nate grunts softly]

849
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,553
That's it.

850
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,140
Well, not exactly, bro.

851
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,399
Oh, wow. You are all glowing.

852
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,362
Oh, must be the moisturizer
you recommended. My skin feels tighter.

853
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,364
Literally... You're literally glowing.

854
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,992
Guys, we did it.

855
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,619
-[Nate whoops]
-[chuckles]

856
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,746
Come on, let's go and use that Loom.

857
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,916
And remember, no looming anything
that'll ruin my party.

858
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,587
Not that you would, Clotho.
I can tell you're still chill.

859
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,755
That's right.

860
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,173
Later days, Shotgun.

861
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,716
[voice breaking] Later days, Dion.

862
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,010
You guys got some trippy art here.

863
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,263
- This cane was yelling at me.
-[Constantine] Yeah.

864
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,973
I'll take that. Nice one, love.

865
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,559
Sounds like someone's had
too much to drink.

866
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,353
Let's get you out of here.

867
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,437
-[Agent Sharpe] Bye
-[Zari] Bye.

868
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,231
[mouthes] Wow.

869
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:30,988
[Lachesis] Hello, traitor.

870
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,037
Just the woman I wanted to see.

871
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,790
Don't bother trying to win me back.
I don't need you anymore.

872
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,918
When you asked for my help
killing John Constantine,

873
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,170
I warned you, you would be in my debt.

874
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,048
Well, honey, I'm calling in the favor.

875
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,850
