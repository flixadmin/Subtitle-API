1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,251
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,453
I found this when
I was in the city.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,627
<i>Penguin's licenses.</i>

4
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,171
<i>Apparently, crime is legal now.</i>

5
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,247
I got a license.

6
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,508
I'm not giving this city
over to Penguin.

7
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,006
I don't care what the commissioner says.

8
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,339
Oswald Cobblepot
keeps your friends safe.

9
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,299
Not the GCPD.

10
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,554
- Is Barbara around?
- No.

11
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,761
<i>She's not coming back.</i>

12
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,016
I want more.

13
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,523
Jonathan Crane's father

14
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,027
<i>created a toxin that makes people
see their greatest fear.</i>

15
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,234
Jonathan, you're going with these men.

16
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,069
Now you're gonna
take your daddy's notebooks

17
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,280
<i>and make as much of that
fear juice as I say.</i>

18
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,159
No.

19
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,421
Gotham Police, you're under arrest.

20
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,212
- Crane?
- Jonathan Crane isn't here anymore.

21
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,713
It's just the Scarecrow.

22
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,186
This is where Merton said they would be.

23
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,309
Let's go, everybody, stay sharp.

24
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,238
There's no one here.

25
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,499
They're long gone by now.

26
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,706
This place smells like death.

27
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,293
Reminds me there's a Thai joint
not far away

28
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,249
if you wanna grab
something to eat after.

29
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,959
Very funny. It's the toxin.

30
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,302
They made more of it.

31
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,464
Lookie here.

32
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,342
An asylum uniform.

33
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,759
1109.

34
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,474
That's Crane's number, right?

35
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,041
He's coming!

36
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,668
Who?

37
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,504
Scarecrow!

38
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,355
Right, thank you very much,
Officer.

39
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,942
Alfred, you need to explain
this was just a misunderstanding.

40
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,322
Worry not, Master Bruce.

41
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:47,328
We have Wayne Enterprises' most talented
and expensive lawyer on the case.

42
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,000
- This is an outrage.
- He'll have you out in a jiffy.

43
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,453
How did they nick you anyway?

44
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,204
I fell through the skylight.

45
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,381
These thieves must have
triggered an alarm.

46
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,880
The police were so quick to respond.
I wasn't expecting that, Alfred.

47
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,426
You could've broke your bloody neck.

48
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,721
I had them red-handed.
If I could've only...

49
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:02,797
Only what?

50
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,887
Only taken on
an entire crew twice your size?

51
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,342
Perhaps, yes.

52
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,104
Well, here's something
you don't see every day.

53
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,395
Bruce Wayne behind bars.

54
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,359
There's been a terrible mistake,
Detective Gordon.

55
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,812
You see, I fell in from the roof
into a robbery in progress.

56
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,896
I wasn't breaking in.

57
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,401
Is that so? Why were you up on the roof?

58
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,620
I was looking for Selina Kyle.

59
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,866
I see.

60
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,868
Yes.

61
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,330
We will, of course, have our lawyer
post bail, Detective Gordon.

62
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,960
I hardly think that's necessary.

63
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,254
We'll talk more about this, Bruce.

64
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,506
But not tonight.

65
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,758
Thank you, Detective.

66
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,180
Thank you.

67
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,446
<i>Everybody in bed.</i>

68
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,740
<i>Everybody in bed.</i>

69
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,678
Covering your dirty footprints, Warden?

70
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,095
It's too late, I'm afraid.

71
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,229
Your dirty deeds have stained you.

72
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,773
How did you get in here?

73
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,184
Come on.

74
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,523
You don't spend three years
in this hellish place

75
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,482
without picking up a thing or two.

76
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,401
Jonathan?

77
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,237
That's right.

78
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,201
I'm not the same
frightened boy you threw in a cell.

79
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,042
No treatments, no therapy.

80
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,589
Just some ice baths

81
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,715
and some...
Electric shocks once in a while.

82
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,839
You know, you could just leave.

83
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,515
I wouldn't tell anyone.

84
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,351
I don't want to leave, Warden.

85
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,104
- Now, are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,154
I cured myself.

87
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,650
You see, I feared the scarecrow.

88
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,994
And now we are one.

89
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,415
Jonathan, please. If you just...

90
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,994
You're not listening to me, Warden!

91
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,293
Jonathan Crane is no more.

92
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,420
Call me by my true name.

93
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,260
The Scarecrow.

94
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,641
Rough night, Bruce?

95
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,321
- Get into a fight?
- No, he fell through a skylight.

96
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,615
He was on the rooftop
talking to Selina Kyle.

97
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,072
Bloody teenagers, eh? Whew.

98
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,402
But your clothes,

99
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,451
looks more like concrete
and stone residue, though.

100
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,998
What were you doing before that?

101
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,324
Rock climbing.

102
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,628
- Rock climbing.
- Yes, we were rock climbing.

103
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,000
Alfred's been teaching me.

104
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,709
At the rock faces in the south gardens.

105
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,845
Taken to it like a duck to water, he
has, but we've got to plod on, Mr. Fox.

106
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,598
Of course. Sorry to have kept you.

107
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,767
Be careful on those rocks, Bruce.

108
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,140
It's a dangerous sport.

109
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,227
We will, Mr. Fox. We will.

110
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,575
Did you know my father was a genius?

111
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,453
He wanted to end fear.

112
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,655
For my sake.

113
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,666
Because he loved me.

114
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,743
So tell me.

115
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,704
What do you fear, Warden?

116
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,717
Something from your childhood, maybe?

117
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,598
Face your fears.

118
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:28,564
Face your fears and defeat them.

119
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,877
What?

120
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,212
No.

121
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,089
Stop.

122
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,609
Brothers and sisters, look at you.

123
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,866
Prisoners, all of you.

124
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,372
My father would have freed you.

125
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,117
But he was killed.

126
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,212
Murdered by the GCPD.

127
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,338
Men who couldn't understand.

128
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,625
But they will.

129
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,757
For you will be my army.

130
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,474
And those men who killed my father

131
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,975
shall truly know fear.

132
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,239
James Gordon.

133
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,281
James Gordon?

134
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,115
There you are.

135
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,953
Play nice.

136
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,663
No.

137
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,632
I see you've caught one of them.
What about the other fellow?

138
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,388
I have no idea who you're talking about.

139
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,632
Jonathan Crane?

140
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,224
People share with me because they
trust me to get things done.

141
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,888
Unlike you.

142
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:31,103
So this boy who created this
lethal toxin which almost killed me,

143
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,357
where is he?

144
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,693
Whereabouts unknown for now.

145
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,528
Why am I not surprised?

146
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,197
I mean, really,

147
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,155
the only thing the GCPD
knows how to do well is fail.

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,743
What is a penguin? A bird or a mammal?

149
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,920
Bird. It is a bird.

150
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,538
Like a chicken?

151
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,806
Time and time again, the GCPD expose
themselves for what they truly are.

152
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,810
An outdated, ineffectual,
and corrupt institution.

153
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,516
How much longer must our citizens
suffer their incompetence?

154
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,022
This coming from a man
who takes money from criminals

155
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,401
in exchange for a license allowing them
to victimize innocent people.

156
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,697
And it is working.

157
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:23,989
Jim, why can't you see that I am not
here to destroy your beloved GCPD,

158
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,535
but to save it?

159
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,371
And through that, Gotham.

160
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,373
Your licenses are illegal,

161
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,001
and I will arrest anyone I find
who is issued one.

162
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,092
So sure your Boy Scout morality
can protect this city, Jim?

163
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,641
How well has that worked in the past?

164
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,846
Should I list the victims of
your antiquated righteousness?

165
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,852
Instead, let me make you a deal.

166
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,815
Find this Jonathan Crane
and lock him up within 24 hours

167
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,821
or admit to me, your subordinates,

168
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,399
and the people of Gotham

169
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,199
that you failed.

170
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,366
And allow me to clean this city up!

171
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,088
Good for you, Jim.

172
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,665
Game on.

173
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,802
What are you doing here?

174
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,515
Have I taught you nothing?

175
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,768
I could've slit your throat
before you even saw me.

176
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,232
I found this on the door this morning.

177
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,655
Someone left this inside last night.

178
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,513
Thank you for coming, ladies.

179
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,897
No way.

180
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,977
I saw you die.

181
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,313
That so?

182
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,106
It is Gotham.

183
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,868
- Check for a pulse next time.
- I will.

184
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,320
Right after I slit your throat.

185
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,911
So what happened to you?

186
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,992
Long story.

187
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,213
Right now, all you need to know
is that I'm back.

188
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,333
And like the card says,

189
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,053
an opportunity awaits you.

190
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,638
A new beginning.

191
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,598
You sure you wanna get this close?

192
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,175
Please hear me out.

193
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,812
Not a day goes by
where I don't think about what I did.

194
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,941
If I could take it back,
trust me, I would.

195
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,653
I wouldn't mind a do-over myself.

196
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,572
Perhaps I'll finish the job this time.

197
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,734
I was jealous.

198
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,154
I was stupid.

199
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,156
I am sorry.

200
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,961
Kill me if you don't believe me.

201
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,755
So is this your place now?

202
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,761
This is our place.

203
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,384
Another club?

204
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,802
In Gotham?

205
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,637
How original.

206
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,102
It's not a club.

207
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,132
Penguin's taking over.

208
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,887
Like it or not,
every criminal in this city

209
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,933
is gonna go to him for a license
to mug, steal, or blow stuff up.

210
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,139
Those criminals are gonna need supplies,
and that is where we come in.

211
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,442
Not only will we be able to facilitate
these lowlifes,

212
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,316
but we'll also find out
what they're planning

213
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,692
and how it's going down.

214
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:32,240
But I will not go forward
without you both.

215
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,497
This is our way back on top.

216
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,242
No.

217
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,704
What you took from me,

218
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,749
I will never be able to get back.

219
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,836
Just feel lucky I don't burn this place
to the ground.

220
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,760
This will be good for all of us.

221
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,929
Please talk to her.

222
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,156
I don't wanna hear it, Alfred.

223
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,457
I'm going back out there.

224
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,330
I'm not gonna let this trail go cold.

225
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,212
Far be it from me
to stop you, Master Bruce.

226
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,836
You're not coming?

227
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,421
No, sir.

228
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,548
And why not?

229
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:41,397
Because, as last night proved,
you are simply not ready.

230
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,686
Yeah, you can chuck a punch.
You can block one.

231
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,642
You're quick on your toes.
I'll give you that.

232
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,862
What if they've got guns, Master Bruce?

233
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,400
Out there,

234
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,570
Alfred, I feel more alive
than I've ever felt before.

235
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,700
Do you understand that?

236
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,582
And that is precisely why
I am not stopping you, sir.

237
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:09,921
But you'll excuse me

238
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,298
if I don't wanna stand by
and watch you get shot.

239
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,181
Hey.

240
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,518
Mental asylum's under siege.
The lunatics are running riot.

241
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,945
The guards called it in
before they bolted for the hills.

242
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,943
- Crane?
- He made more toxins, right?

243
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,400
What happens when you dose 100 nutjobs?

244
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,484
All right, listen up!

245
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,486
There's a riot at the asylum.

246
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,446
I need as many of you as can come.

247
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,122
Who's with me?

248
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,326
Good luck with that.

249
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,631
You really think
Penguin is gonna make this go away?

250
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,334
He's just getting rich
off the same lowlifes

251
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,841
you guys used to hate as much as me!

252
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,216
Ah, forget it.

253
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,927
Not one of you is fit to wear the badge.

254
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,765
This badge gets us
spat on and shot at every day.

255
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,641
For what?

256
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,268
What difference have we made out there?

257
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,561
- Yeah!
- He's right!

258
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,730
Let's go, Harvey.

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,990
Come on. Don't do this.

260
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,496
I told you one day

261
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,078
that you would say
now or never, and I would say never.

262
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,664
Well, today is that day.

263
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,007
If I go with you, I lose them,

264
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,051
and then who's gonna be the new captain?

265
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,301
Because it's damn well gonna be
someone Penguin chooses.

266
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,724
So I am sorry, partner,

267
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,097
but you are on your own on this one.

268
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,637
Yeah.

269
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,637
GCPD.

270
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,566
GCPD.

271
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,164
I'm not scared of you anymore, you see?

272
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,749
I am you!

273
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,847
Ah. It's you.

274
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,269
You came.

275
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,532
<i>Brothers and sisters,</i>

276
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,281
<i>the enemy is here.</i>

277
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,075
Crap.

278
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,964
<i>Tonight, Detective, you will pay
for what you've done.</i>

279
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,052
<i>Tonight,</i>

280
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,553
<i>you will know fear!</i>

281
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:00,647
Get him!

282
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,668
All right, Mr. Cop.

283
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,872
Let's have some real fun.

284
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,220
My, my!

285
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,886
Well, come on in, I guess.

286
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,764
Word was you were dead.

287
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,933
Imagine my surprise when I hear

288
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,689
you've popped back up alive

289
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,736
and gone and opened
a brand-new business.

290
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,320
We're not open yet.

291
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,408
Looks pretty open to me.

292
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,789
Yeah, I'd say it's open.

293
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,871
Hot damn. It's like Christmas.

294
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,044
Which is upsetting because this was

295
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,918
definitely something
you'd want to run by me first.

296
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,419
Is it now?

297
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,045
Oh, yes, absolutely.

298
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,215
All enterprises pertaining
to the criminal underworld shall,

299
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,644
from this time forth, be approved,
monitored, and taxed by me.

300
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,437
My apologies.

301
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,183
I'm still waiting for my partners
to come aboard.

302
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,193
Who? Tabitha?

303
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,188
Selina?

304
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,693
Perhaps.

305
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,025
Well, good luck with that.

306
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,702
Slippery characters, the both of them.

307
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,875
Also, people can often carry grudges
after you shoot their boyfriends.

308
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,502
I can talk to them if you want...

309
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:41,081
I distinctly remember saying you could
come if you kept your mouth shut!

310
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,797
You will need
an operating license, obviously.

311
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,382
Then pay a weapon tax...

312
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,092
- "Weapon tax"?
- And then,

313
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,678
perhaps, your little store can open.

314
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,480
Well, you don't ask for much
now, do you?

315
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,683
I am not asking for enough.

316
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,275
Let me be absolutely clear, Ms. Kean.

317
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,610
I will be keeping
a very close eye on you.

318
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,663
The first rumor I hear
about you and your little partners

319
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,537
making moves to contest me,
and Victor...

320
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,710
...will end you
with your own merchandise.

321
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,291
Understood.

322
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,514
Couldn't have been cheap.

323
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,883
I'm sorry?

324
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,638
You lost your money on the Sirens club,

325
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,440
then went missing.
Rumor was you were dead.

326
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,648
And now you're back
with a brand-new fancy place.

327
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,480
Who paid for it?

328
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,203
You really think
I won't find out who it is?

329
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,701
I'm gonna take this.

330
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,185
Crane?

331
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,248
Do you believe in fate?

332
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,707
I didn't before today,

333
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:52,004
but you, sir, have made me a believer.

334
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,803
Of all the police in Gotham, it was you.

335
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,306
You came.

336
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,270
Jonathan.

337
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,902
What happened to you?

338
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,609
Well, first,

339
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,744
you killed my father.

340
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,197
Your father was insane.
He was trying to kill you.

341
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,032
He tried to help me.

342
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,660
Help all mankind.

343
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,962
- He was a murderer.
- He was a pioneer!

344
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,129
A genius!

345
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:31,218
He taught me
we can live our entire lives

346
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,594
imprisoned by our fears,

347
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,011
or we can embrace them.

348
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,774
You should know that better than anyone.

349
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,648
What will you see, I wonder.

350
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,445
What scares you the most?

351
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,709
What will you see, I wonder.

352
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,167
One of your victims, perhaps?

353
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,261
One of your victims?

354
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,006
What haunts you the most?

355
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,611
Lee.

356
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,407
I just...

357
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,042
I just want some...

358
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,118
God, no.

359
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,458
- What have you done?
- Don't touch me.

360
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,584
Let me go.

361
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,960
Please let me help you.

362
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,504
You've caused me so much pain.

363
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,341
I've suffered you long enough.

364
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,895
We could've been a family, had a child,

365
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,148
but you destroy everything you touch.

366
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,646
I just want

367
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,690
- peace.
- No.

368
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,280
Lee. No.

369
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,332
You can join her

370
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,708
to show her how much you truly love her.

371
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,294
Don't let her die hating you.

372
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,471
It's what she would want.

373
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:47,263
It's the only way to show her, love her.

374
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,938
Cut deep.

375
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,890
Cut deep. It's what she would want.

376
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,395
Cut deep and find peace.

377
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,693
Don't let her die.

378
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,147
- Follow her to death.
- No.

379
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,523
<i>She wouldn't say that.</i>

380
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,738
<i>She wouldn't want that. She loves me.</i>

381
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:04,321
- Cut deep and find peace.
- No.

382
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,499
<i>She loves me. She loves me.
She wouldn't want that. She loves me.</i>

383
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,574
No.

384
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,007
Crane? Where are you?

385
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,084
Crane?

386
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:24,799
How did you do it?

387
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,269
How did you defeat the toxin?
It's impossible!

388
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,347
I overcame my fear.

389
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,727
Liar.

390
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,445
You liar!

391
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,413
You can't just stop being afraid.

392
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,666
You can only become your demon
like I did.

393
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,745
No.

394
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,797
You have a choice, Jonathan.

395
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,501
And whatever your father was,
he didn't want this for you.

396
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,881
You need help.

397
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,099
My father thought that I was weak.

398
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,560
My whole life.

399
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,352
Scared little Jonathan.

400
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,725
Okay.

401
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,310
I can help you.

402
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,687
Let me help you.

403
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,948
But I'm not weak anymore.

404
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,621
And I will never go back
to being that boy.

405
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,763
- Come on, man.
- Right this way.

406
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,137
Just around the corner.

407
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,104
I'm telling you, man.
He leaves the back gate open.

408
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,602
Ha-ha! It's gonna be too easy.

409
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,659
Well, well.

410
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,579
Seems we've caught our stalker.

411
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,340
And he made it way too easy.

412
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,669
Didn't know when he was being played.

413
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,129
Who are you, huh?

414
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,221
Some... Some Boy Scout?

415
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,301
He's just a kid.

416
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,979
Some kind of do-gooder?

417
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,601
Did I date your mom
and not call her back?

418
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,522
Why you hassling us, kid?

419
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,117
I don't know, guys.
His face, it seems familiar.

420
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,739
You famous or something?

421
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,446
You know we got licenses for this, kid?

422
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,164
We're all above board.

423
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,917
- Penguin gets his share.
- That's right.

424
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,168
It's within our rights
to do anything we want to you.

425
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,082
Anything.

426
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,760
Look what you went and did.

427
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,596
You've seen my stash.

428
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,886
You've ticked off my boys.

429
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,730
Now, you're gonna die.

430
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,859
Wait.
I'm telling you, I know this kid's face.

431
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,277
Would you shut the hell up?

432
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,521
Hey, I'm telling you,
I've seen this dude.

433
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,814
Don't matter.

434
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,441
No matter who he is,

435
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,072
he's gotta go.

436
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,374
Get up!

437
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,517
Think you're so slick, huh?

438
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,860
Now, I hate to tell you,
"I told you so," Master Bruce.

439
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:06,771
Up you get.

440
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,398
We gotta leave.

441
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,376
She said she's sorry.

442
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,579
She chose Nygma over me and Butch.

443
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,421
So? Nygma's a popsicle now.

444
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,132
Let's give her a chance.

445
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,550
Why do you want this so bad?

446
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:32,047
Because I'm sick and tired
of not being taken seriously.

447
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,637
All those selfish guys out there
who treat me like I'm stupid?

448
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,677
Alone, I can't do much about it.

449
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,222
With Barbara, maybe.

450
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,983
But with you and Barbara?

451
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,654
The three of us could give
all those creeps a run for their money.

452
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,147
I want in.

453
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,284
- Get out.
- No. Please, just hear me out.

454
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,658
No.

455
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,117
You're a Penguin stooge.

456
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,711
What? I hate that freak.

457
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,256
Oh, please, you guzzled down
his Kool-Aid. Beat it.

458
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,713
No one takes me seriously, either.

459
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,635
There's nothing
I wouldn't do to get back

460
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,462
at the men who treated me like garbage.

461
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,297
Nothing.

462
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,926
Not buying it.
You're working for Penguin.

463
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,352
Cool down, okay? I believe her.

464
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,887
Thank you.

465
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,389
Know what?

466
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,391
You're rude.

467
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,155
And you're about to get your skinny ass
kicked down the block.

468
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,440
I won't ask again.

469
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,317
Get out.

470
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,795
Get word to Barbara. I'll talk business.

471
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,667
But I'll need something in return.

472
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,295
Crane?

473
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,551
- The demon is here.
- Crane?

474
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,976
The demon who haunts
and tortures you is here.

475
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,097
The one who poisoned your minds.

476
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,768
Destroy him and free yourself
from his tyranny.

477
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,867
Kill him!

478
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,882
Water. Right.

479
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,776
I'm so happy.

480
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,528
Jonathan.

481
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,718
- You could've been killed.
- But I wasn't.

482
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,099
That's 'cause I followed you.

483
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,063
I had it under control.

484
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,936
How am I supposed to support you
if you refuse

485
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,358
to accept the realities
of the situation?

486
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,901
Alfred, the realities of the situation...

487
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,279
Mr. Fox.

488
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:48,659
Bad time?

489
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,124
No. Not at all.

490
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:53,706
Please come in.

491
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,667
Forgive me.

492
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,460
I should have called, but...

493
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:03,137
Well, I just couldn't stop thinking
about our last chat.

494
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,311
Wayne Enterprises were developing
a durable material

495
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,810
for military uniforms
when I worked there.

496
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,151
It is a thin Kevlar weave
with reinforced forearm protection.

497
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,990
The gloves have a faceted grip design

498
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,113
to help you cling to any surface.

499
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,321
The whole uniform
is extremely lightweight

500
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:30,452
and actually bulletproof to impacts
from 10 feet or more.

501
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,954
You know, for rock climbing.

502
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,125
Oh, and long-distance
radio communicators.

503
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,628
In case you two wish
to talk to each other

504
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,962
whilst climbing rock.

505
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,850
Well, I will not keep you.

506
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,855
I just didn't want to see you
get hurt again, Mr. Wayne.

507
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,433
Thank you, Mr. Fox.

508
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,230
I feel safer already.

509
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:06,533
Ladies. Thank you for returning.
I'm glad...

510
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,613
Not so fast.

511
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,579
I'll be needing proof of your sincerity.

512
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,127
Yes. Selena said you would
need something from me.

513
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,335
- You can have anything you like.
- Fine.

514
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:19,917
I'll take your hand.

515
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,795
My what?

516
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,265
Both Butch and I lost a hand due
to Penguin's Machiavellian war games.

517
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,145
I believe it's your turn.

518
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,606
- You didn't say anything about this.
- Quiet.

519
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,766
- Tabitha, I assure you...
- No more words.

520
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,191
Penguin cut off Butch's hand,
Nygma mine.

521
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,527
Now I take yours.

522
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:45,984
Fine.

523
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,956
If this is the only way
I can get you to trust me,

524
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,744
so be it.

525
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,187
Fine.

526
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,189
I'll trust you.

527
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,775
For now.

528
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,863
I'll start Monday.

529
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,549
Where is he?

530
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,474
We had a deal, Detective Gordon.

531
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,937
That you would apprehend Jonathan Crane.

532
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,857
You made a demand
in front of your cronies

533
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,855
in an attempt to undermine
me and this department.

534
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,698
There was no deal.

535
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,651
I spoke for all of
the citizens of Gotham

536
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:12,409
when I said that the GCPD
can no longer keep us safe.

537
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,790
How many of you are sick
of risking your lives every day

538
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,711
just to see criminals escape?

539
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,632
How many times has this very building
become a war zone?

540
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,336
I say it is time to start anew.

541
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,257
To police ourselves.

542
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,183
I will triple the wage
of any cop here who wants to work for me

543
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,140
in ensuring the safety
of this city's people.

544
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,976
The future is now.

545
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,611
Follow me into it.

546
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,735
Police yourselves.

547
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,988
He just wants to pay you
to look the other way.

548
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,569
Would you blame them if they did?

549
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,494
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

550
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,542
This is a war, not one battle.

551
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,913
If I would've went with you,
I would've lost them.

552
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,711
And we need them to win this war.

553
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,339
Now, you don't have to say nothing,

554
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,795
but I am buying you a drink.

555
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,821
Oh, no, not you. Leave!

556
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,069
You never paid
for the last stuff I gave you.

557
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:34,658
You make me smell perfume,
make me giddy. Cheap trick!

558
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,031
Out! Out!

559
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,082
I'm done with perfumes.

560
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,001
I'm here for the good stuff.

561
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,206
Don't know what you're talking about.
Leave! I'm closing up.

562
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,212
Word is you have potions here.

563
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,846
Ancient, mystical potions
made by shamans all over the world.

564
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:53,923
Who told you that?

565
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,303
I'm done playing nice.

566
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,392
I need a change. A big one.

567
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,390
I need strength, power.

568
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:00,971
No...

569
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,431
Where are they?

570
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:04,933
My safe.

571
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,643
Under the register.

572
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,612
- Combination?
- It's open.

573
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,861
Which ones make me stronger?

574
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,993
That's dangerous stuff.
It's too powerful for you.

575
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,915
It can get in your blood, your DNA.

576
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,286
Good.

577
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,581
No!

578
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,957
Stop! No!

579
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,960
No, you must stop!

580
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,402
You let me walk into
that nightmare alone.

581
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,949
Yeah, well, I figured it would take

582
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,402
more than a couple of loonies
to take you out.

583
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,405
Besides, I figured you and me
taking on Penguin

584
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,038
and the entire criminal underground
by ourselves wasn't the best idea.

585
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,128
So, what, you wanna sit here,
do nothing, get drunk?

586
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,331
- Is that your plan?
- Unless you got a better one.

587
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,714
What makes you think those cops
back there were wrong?

588
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,337
Are we really making a difference?

589
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,056
One worth risking our lives over?

590
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,979
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

591
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,731
Makes me miss Falcone.

592
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,270
I mean, I know he's a vicious bastard,
but he was... He was fair.

593
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,315
He ran the criminals in this city
with an iron fist. There was...

594
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,241
There was honor.

595
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,488
- No.
- What?

596
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,164
Do not mess with Falcone.

597
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,044
You killed his son, remember?
Italians do not forget that crap.

598
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,543
He must hate what Penguin's doing
as much as we do.

599
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,875
You show your face to Falcone,
he will kill you.

600
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:55,761
Yeah, well...

601
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,349
Like you said, we need an army.

602
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,342
He's got one.

603
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,495
<i>That's a lovely leap,
Master Bruce. Positively gazelle-like.</i>

604
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,998
It's so lightweight,
it's like I'm wearing nothing at all.

605
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,177
Yeah, well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

606
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,131
Remember to keep your face covered
at all times.

607
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,474
<i>Try wearing that mask I made you.</i>
