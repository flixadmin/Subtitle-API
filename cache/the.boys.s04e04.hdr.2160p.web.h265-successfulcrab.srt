1
00:00:06,648 --> 00:00:08,442
Who wants their balls crushed?

2
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:09,776
Me.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,116
This isn't what it looks like.

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,785
You're done. Grab your shit
and get the fuck out.

5
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:19,953
The Boys is mine.

6
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:23,081
<i>Says a dying man
with one last bluff.</i>

7
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:24,517
The Seven is getting even stronger.

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,793
Put your hands together for Firecracker.

9
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:31,048
What have I done to make you
hate me so much?

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,884
You really don't remember me, do you?

11
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,885
And Sister Sage!

12
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,680
Fascist!

13
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:40,849
<i>She's the world's
smartest person.</i>

14
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:42,934
Uh-huh.

15
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:44,978
You remember Colin Hauser?

16
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:48,982
<i>So, what happens when he finds out
you murdered his family?</i>

17
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,443
My dad, he had a stroke.

18
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:54,988
- I'm really sorry. Really.
- Mom?

19
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:57,949
I want to flip A-Train.
He's right there, he's ready.

20
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,576
Enough!

21
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,970
<i>You're never gonna be
your true self</i>

22
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,663
<i>until you transcend your humanity.</i>

23
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:06,166
You need to go back to the start.

24
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:08,168
<i>You need to go home.</i>

25
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,811
Hey, Marty.

26
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:27,205
The security cameras upstairs
just went black.

27
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:29,272
Hey, Phil, you copy?

28
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,859
Phil? Anyone up there?

29
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,614
Call Vought, tell them we have a breach.

30
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,492
The line's dead.

a resync

63
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,448
Hello, everyone.

64
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,824
Hi.

65
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,284
- John.
- Homelander.

66
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:26,705
Just Homelander.

67
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:28,790
Hey, Marty. Good to see you.

68
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:32,252
You, too, uh, Homelander.

69
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:37,924
Oh, my God, this is just so surreal.

70
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,885
I never thought I'd be back here.

71
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,888
So many memories.

72
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:46,975
Oh, I, uh, I brought a Fudgie the Whale.

73
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:49,269
Do me a favor, could you get
a plate and some forks?

74
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:50,979
Thank you so much.

75
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:56,902
I see some new faces.

76
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,280
But a lot that I recognize. Frank.

77
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,991
And-and Assistant Director now, Marty.

78
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:06,828
I still remember when they had you
wiping out the stool sample containers.

79
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:09,998
You remember?

80
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,459
Yeah.

81
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,377
Oh...

82
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,837
Where's Barbara?

83
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,401
Last I checked, she's still Director?

84
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,882
She's off-site today.

85
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,468
Oh, bring her in, would you?
I'd love to catch up.

86
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,596
Tell her... Tell her it's a little reunion.

87
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:27,432
Terrific. All right, everyone, dig in.

88
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,770
Come on, don't be shy. Before it melts.

89
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,149
Please. Come on in. There you go.

90
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,560
What are you doing?

91
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,815
Come on, get up.
Butcher, the world doesn't end

92
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:18,817
just because your shitty life does.

93
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,279
Get up.

94
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,865
Get up.

95
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,725
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?!</i>

96
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:38,086
I'm sorry, your father's condition
meets the criteria for brain death.

97
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,547
It might not seem like it,
but it is the most humane thing.

98
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,925
Humane? You're pulling his feeding tubes
so he starves to death, right?

99
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,927
Hughie, it's what he wanted.

100
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,602
How long before, um...

101
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:55,145
A couple of days at most.

102
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,609
Mom. Don't.

103
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,155
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:29,512
Hughie...

105
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,181
{\an8}<i>V52 Expo.</i>

106
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,099
{\an8} <i>Come meet The Seven in person,</i>

107
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:35,310

110
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:43,735
{\an8}<i>and the other Godolkin Four

<i>A deranged fascist hellbent

116
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:57,290
You should hear
what they say about me.

117
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,587
Give us the room.

118
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,680
Miss January, the only thing
I really want to hear is

119
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:14,140
"We found a way to kill
the head-popping bitch."

120
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:15,517
Mm-mm.

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,976
Then this will be a quick meeting.

122
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,645
You need my help, sir.

123
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,647
I read the draft of your
Supe-control bill.

124
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,110
Let me guess, it's perfect,
but you know just how to fix it.

125
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:27,821
If you get it passed, that's a stake
through Vought's heart.

126
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,156
Gets 'em out of the military, policing,

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,827
tanks their stock, buries 'em in lawsuits.

128
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,746
See, it sure sounds like
I don't need your help.

129
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,498
But that's if you get it passed.

130
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:41,042
You need... what?
50 million constituents

131
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,503
demanding Congress get off its ass?

132
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:46,798
No offense, but your PR department
is kind of shitting the bed.

133
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:49,551
I just okayed a huge marketing spend.

134
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:54,055
Yeah, your ad-buys during <i>CSI: Las Vegas</i>
are definitely winning over

135
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,100
the "left the TV on
'cause they're dead" demo.

136
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,441
So, what is your suggestion?

137
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,861
I can get people into the streets
all over the country,

138
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,422
and they'll demand that
the bill gets passed.

139
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,948
- You'll do it as Starlight?
- Yes.

140
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:16,703
I'll even make another fucking...
Supersuit if I have to.

141
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,706
And what do you get for this?

142
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,207
Just a promise.

143
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,585
Promise me you'll finish what you started.

144
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:27,881
Once and for all...
we put Vought into the ground.

145
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:46,941
Colin, what is this?

146
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,985
Oh, who's uncultured now?

147
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:55,533
Ray Charles, his country western phase.

148
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,370
My dad used to play this
all the time in the car,

149
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:01,873
and I'd fall asleep to it in the backseat.

150
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:05,835
You never told me about them.

151
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,713
Your family.

152
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:11,633
It's, uh...

153
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:13,343
not exactly my favorite story to tell.

154
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,929
No. <i>Désolé.</i>

155
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,931
No, it's fine.

156
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:21,351
When my mom wasn't on my ass
for my grades,

157
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,102
she was a federal judge.

158
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,396
She dealt with really violent cases,

159
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,731
like, the worst of the worst.

160
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:30,527
And there was this Russian mafia thing
in Brighton Beach.

161
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,779
Their boss was this woman.

162
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:35,657
My mom was gonna make
an example out of her.

163
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,951
So they made an example out of my mom.

164
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:44,582
Some guy broke in,
and they found my parents first.

165
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,459
Then my little sister.

166
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:49,587
You were there?

167
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,506
The gunshots woke me up.

168
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,026
<i>I heard 'em coming down the hallway,</i>

169
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,170
<i>so I just hid under my bed.</i>

170
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,847
<i>All I saw was his ankle.</i>

171
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,267
<i>He had these scars, or these burns maybe.</i>

172
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:08,273
Ugh, a lot of nightmares about those.

173
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:10,358
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:36,676
Hey, how are you? Hey, Janet.

175
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,514
Hey, guys, let's call in Stacey and Mark.

176
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:44,058
We need to get an announcement ready.

177
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:49,480
What?

178
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,278
What are they doing?

179
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,749
That bitch.

180
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:11,794
VNN is handling the launch
of Firecracker's show,

181
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,213
simulcast across all Vought networks.

182
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:17,759
The troll farms are already digging up
fringe anti-Starlight content

183
00:10:17,842 --> 00:10:19,719
and injecting it into the mainstream.

184
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:22,013
So far, "Starlight's Progressive Jihad"

185
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:25,141
and "#ArrogantWhiteFeminism"
are showing promise.

186
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,384
We need the algorithm to find
the most receptive users,

187
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:30,521
then blast the articles to the top
of their social feeds

188
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:33,483
until 100 million people
are outraged by Starlight

189
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,026
for reasons they can't even explain.

190
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,653
Dope.

191
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,788
Heroes, you have your talking points,

192
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:49,332
so, everyone, get to it.

193
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,502
- Hey, can we talk?
- No.

194
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,631
Hey. So, I was thinking over lunch
we could order some of those

195
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:58,299
fried pickles from Flavortown,

196
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,510
or just skip straight to
the flounder pounder special.

197
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,722
I find you repulsive in a way
that's difficult to quantify.

198
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:08,184
And I'm fucking amazing
at quantifying, so...

199
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:15,942
So, big day. You ready?

200
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,819
You have no idea.

201
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:20,488
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

202
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:21,731
One last piece of the puzzle.

203
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:25,451
Figured this could be your big finish.

204
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,167
You know, when I first met you,

205
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:34,436
I thought you were kind of uppity,

206
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,171
but you're one of the good ones.

207
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:41,342
Well, we are the new kids in The Seven.

208
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:42,802
Mm-hmm.

209
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,085
Gotta look out for each other.

210
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,442
Hello, Patriots!

211
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,906
Now, I know a lot of you probably know me
from my podcast,

212
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,076
<i>but VNN gave me the next six hours</i>

213
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,455
<i>to bring you the truth about Starlight</i>

214
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:12,540
<i>and her house of horrors.</i>

215
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:15,269
<i>- Where dozens of trafficked children...</i>
- Here, grab your bags and come with me.

216
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:16,729
- Sweetheart, don't forget this. Here you go.
- Okay.

217
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:19,088
- We'll sneak the kids out through the back.
- Okay.

218
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,566
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

219
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,135
Just please tell Sasha to have them
go easy on the room service, okay?

220
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:25,636
That card is almost maxed out.

221
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,305
- You got it.
- Thank you.

222
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,932
Now...

223
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,102
Firecracker's celebrity friends
are arriving.

224
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,854
I saw Jon Voight.

225
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:40,401
What the fuck is he doing here?

226
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:44,238
Bringing him back in.

227
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:45,507
No. No, no, no, no, no. I don't trust him.

228
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,077
I don't. And you're insane
if you do, okay?

229
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,412
And you can drink yourself to death

230
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,331
in whatever dark hole you crawled out of.

231
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:55,708
That's a good idea. I might just do that.

232
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,168
- Good.
- Okay, wait a minute.

233
00:12:57,251 --> 00:13:00,546
Hold on a second, Butcher.

234
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,799
Look, Lord knows I got problems
with the guy, too

235
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,051
We both do, but this is bigger than us.

236
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,820
That shit Homelander and Sage
are talking about,

237
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:08,429
that's some end-of-time shit.

238
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:11,724
Team is shy one total asshole.
Now, we need this motherfucker.

239
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:15,645
- I mean, I'm...
- Annie, this is my call. It's done.

240
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:27,573
Well, all right then.

241
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:29,575
Happy we got that sorted, eh?

242
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:32,036
Now, can someone please explain to me

243
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,499
what makes you Firecracker's Moby Cunt?

244
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,876
- I have no idea.
- Bollocks.

245
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:41,170
I don't.

246
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,298
Now, what's our next move?

247
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:47,552
You get me 50K from the Company,
and in three hours

248
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:50,638
I'll have all the dirt we need
on Little Miss Guns and Ammo.

249
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:53,724
Butcher, there's no way
I'm letting you out of my sight

250
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:56,519
- with 50 grand.
- All right.

251
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,189
But I'm warning you,
you ain't gonna like it.

252
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,823
<i>And Kanye West!</i>

253
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:13,077
<i>But first, a sermon by Ezekiel,</i>

254
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:16,581
<i>Starlight's childhood pastor
before she fell from God's grace.</i>

255
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:20,251
<i>We'll be right back with that, y'all.
You stick around.</i>

256
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,336
<i>U.S.A.!</i>

257
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,385
Hey, Frank, come on over.

258
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,390
How about a game of wastepaper basketball?

259
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm sorry?

260
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:40,438
Uh, first of three, and tell you what,

261
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:41,898
make it interesting,

262
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,401
you win, I'll let you knock off early,
go see the fam.

263
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,988
- Um, okay.
- Excellent.

264
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,948
I'll start.

265
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,755
You know, I learned this game
from you, Frank.

266
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,591
I don't understand.

267
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,595
I once saw you take a shot
at a waste basket, and you nailed it,

268
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,182
and... and you don't remember.

269
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,600
No.

270
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,603
Yeah, well, I sure do.

271
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,772
Yeah, you were sitting there,

272
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,901
and, well, I was in this oven here.

273
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,028
And you made the shot.

274
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,239
You did a little fist pump to celebrate,

275
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:32,841
and then you turned up the temperature

276
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,617
to see if you could burn my skin.

277
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,453
You remember that, right?

278
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,121
Your turn.

279
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:47,630
Fun fact. Um, even though
my skin didn't char,

280
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,840
it still really hurt.

281
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,135
I mean a lot.

282
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,015
Yeah, I was in there, screaming in agony,

283
00:15:58,099 --> 00:16:02,061
and my tears just sizzled away.

284
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:03,645
Yeah.

285
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:09,819
I remember there was, uh,
people standing here

286
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,113
taking notes, but behind them

287
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,824
I saw you make that shot.

288
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,536
It really was a great shot, Frank.

289
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:20,121
I was just doing my job.

290
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,505
Hmm.

291
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,757
You know, I had nightmares about
that exact moment,

292
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:34,844
and you can't even remember it.

293
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:40,141
It's funny, isn't it, how people can have
such a different memory

294
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:43,185
of the exact same thing.

295
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:48,107
It's all a matter of perspective, I guess.

296
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:54,697
Hey, Frank?

297
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,532
This is my last shot.

298
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,093
Why don't you go watch from in there?

299
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,078
- John, why don't we...
- "Homelander."

300
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:07,126
- Get in the oven, Frank.
- Please.

301
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:15,259
Get in the oven
or your family goes in with you.

302
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:16,385
Please, Homelander,

303
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,909
- you don't have to do this.
- Marty.

304
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,564
Thank you.

305
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,276
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,863
I'm so, so sorry.

307
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:38,074
You're sorry?

308
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,408
Now?

309
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,828
But why?

310
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,832
You were just doing your job, right?

311
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,422
Homelander...

312
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,050
Don't do this! No.

313
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:16,570
And I bet you would've won.

314
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:18,406
Oh, my God.

315
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,533
- Oh, my God.
- I forgive you.

316
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,352
Uh, I don't know,
he should be here any minute.

317
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:51,188
Thanks, by the way, for being my muscle.

318
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,990
{\an8}Yeah.

319
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:05,453
What the shit is this?

320
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:06,930
Where's the talking goatee
with the gold chains?

321
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,247
It's okay.

322
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,332
I'm the one that called you.

323
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,917
Are you crazy?

324
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,378
Sage is on my ass,
stares at me like I'm fucking dinner.

325
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:16,982
But you thought this was
a good time to be seen together?

326
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:19,592
I need a dose of Compound V,
and I need it today.

327
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:20,801
Oh!

328
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:22,720
Is that all? For what?

329
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:25,097
- What do you care?
- Homelander has every vial of V

330
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:26,682
locked up in his apartment.

331
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,660
- Hundreds of them. Nobody gets it.
- Okay.

332
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:30,120
Well, he's not gonna miss one vial, then.

333
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:31,304
- You got to find a way.
- No.

334
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,063
It's too dangerous.

335
00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:34,482
No, hey. Fuck that!

336
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:35,733
You owe me.

337
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:37,526
I owe you?

338
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,070
- I just saved your fucking life.
- Every single fucked up,

339
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:42,781
horrible thing that's ever happened to me,
to all of us,

340
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,993
it all started with you,
'cause you took away someone I loved.

341
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:48,555
And now you're gonna
give someone I love back.

342
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,080
What?

343
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,212
My dad's about to die.

344
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,466
V is the only thing that can save him.

345
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,970
This is your chance...

346
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:09,016
...to finally make things right.

347
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:11,227
What makes you think I give a shit?

348
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:14,021
You tell me.

349
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,693
If I do this...

350
00:20:19,777 --> 00:20:21,737
we're good?

351
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,155
Forever?

352
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,365
Yes.

353
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,165
Ow! What?

354
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:38,980
{\an8}Kimiko, I'm sorry, but it's my dad.

355
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,215
What else was I supposed to do?

356
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,769
Fuck!

357
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:01,694
Who the fuck are those guys?

358
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,827
No, I can't. I can't. My ankle.

359
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,579
My...

360
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:13,956
No, no, no. Oh, Jesus.

361
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,132
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

362
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:26,129
Who the fuck are those guys?

363
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,805
Light. Shining Light? Like...

364
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,048
Shining Light. Shining Light?

365
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:32,808
Why are they after us?

366
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,106
Fuck.

367
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:41,525
Okay, what do we do?

368
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:46,488
No, I-I can't run anywhere. I can't.

369
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,631
No, no, no.

370
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:05,174
Whoa.

371
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,675
Easy. All right.

372
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:08,218
Okay.

373
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:09,762
Okay.

374
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:12,013
I got it.

375
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:52,513
Not a word about that 50 grand and what
happened to it to Mallory, motherfucker.

376
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:54,598
Straight up Webweaver's stinky spider?

377
00:22:54,682 --> 00:22:57,476
Heroin enemas don't come cheap, my son.

378
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,436
I'll never unsee that nasty shit.

379
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,314
Well, I fucking warned you, didn't I?

380
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:04,024
Anyway, don't matter.

381
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:07,069
- Got what we needed. Job done.
- Uh-huh.

382
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,407
You ever gonna tell me what happened
with that gash on your face?

383
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,256
M, I got a favor to ask.

384
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,258
Think you're in a position
to ask for a favor?

385
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:33,387
If I can't get the job done
before I, uh...

386
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,980
I need you to get Ryan away
from Homelander.

387
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:44,606
Oh, Butcher.

388
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,278
I got to be realistic.

389
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:54,199
Some days I can barely even fucking stand.

390
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,952
- Get him out of there. Raise him.
- Raise him?

391
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,496
You're the best dad I know, M.

392
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,914
The best fucking anyone.

393
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:03,718
That might be one of the nicest things
you've ever said to me, but...

394
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:06,003
what if Ryan doesn't want to go?

395
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,090
Then you've got to make him.

396
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,974
White trash walking.

397
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,811
Top-notch show, love.

398
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:25,063
Just weren't sure
whether you wanted us to kneel

399
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:26,732
before your cross or burn it.

400
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:30,861
Oh, you're those motherfuckers
that killed my friend.

401
00:24:30,944 --> 00:24:33,322
Yeah, crying shame, that.

402
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,409
But if it's any consolation,
he's up there with God,

403
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:39,253
noshing on his holiest of holies
as we speak.

404
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:41,389
- I'm gonna shut your fucking face...
- All right, all right.

405
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,748
Keep your hair on, love.

406
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:44,750
We just want a little chin wag's all.

407
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,127
- Talk American.
- Right.

408
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:50,339
You remember that magical summer
when you was 28,

409
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:54,468
working as a counselor at the Capes
for Christ Bible Camp in Davie, Florida,

410
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:56,678
and you met that lovely 15-year-old boy

411
00:24:56,762 --> 00:25:00,224
who tickled your fancy, and, well, then,
tickled more than that, didn't he?

412
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:03,018
Hmm? Ring any bells?

413
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,355
Here's a little keepsake snapped by
the Broward County Sheriff's Department

414
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,023
that you can stash in your wank bank.

415
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:12,152
You and your little Bieber
edging in the back of your RAV4

416
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:14,446
in the car park of Buca di Beppo.

417
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,049
Whatever voodoo
Vought's lawyers pulled

418
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:17,658
to get your statutory charges dropped,

419
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:18,885
I don't think they're gonna matter
too much

420
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:20,577
to your evangelical audience back there.

421
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:22,871
You're gonna tell us
everything you know

422
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,166
about Sage and her grand plan,

423
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,211
or I hit this little tweet button here.

424
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:39,179
How about I just send it myself?

425
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,393
Fuck around and find out.

426
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:47,187
<i>"Starlight."</i>

427
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:50,190
<i>That's nine letters,</i>

428
00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:53,026
<i>or is that six... upside down?</i>

429
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:58,282
<i>"Annie January," 12 letters,
that's two more sixes.</i>

430
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:00,993
<i>6-6-6. What more proof</i>

431
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:03,245
<i>could you possibly need?</i>

432
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,830
<i>I'm sorry, I got to interrupt.</i>

433
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:05,831
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

434
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:07,666
<i>I need, I need to make a confession.</i>

435
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:09,001
<i>A confession?</i>

436
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,003
<i>I need to confess my sins.</i>

437
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:17,301
<i>Ain't no way
to sugarcoat this.</i>

438
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:18,594
<i>I had...</i>

439
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:23,724
<i>...inappropriate relations</i>

440
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:27,185
<i>with a sweet young man.</i>

441
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:29,521
<i>Damn, that smile.</i>

442
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:33,650
<i>But that young man, he was 15 years old.</i>

443
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:37,446
- Oh...
<i>- But the moment of my greatest weakness</i>

444
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,906
<i>was also the moment</i>

445
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:42,659
<i>that pushed me to my eternal salvation.</i>

446
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:44,244
<i>I was born again,</i>

447
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:47,748
<i>and my sins were washed away</i>

448
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:49,416
by the tears of His love.

449
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:51,043
Praise the Lord!

450
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:52,711
Praise the Lord!

451
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:56,089
<i>Now, I-I believe</i>

452
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:58,884
that our Lord Jesus Christ
put that young man

453
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,429
<i>in my life to lead me
to the path of righteousness.</i>

454
00:27:02,512 --> 00:27:04,222
Oh, my God.

455
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:08,518
<i>You got to choose to turn
in to the light of His love.</i>

456
00:27:08,602 --> 00:27:10,979
<i>And that's what Starlight,
she just didn't do.</i>

457
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:14,066
<i>Y'all ever hear that story
about her very first save?</i>

458
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:17,653
<i>She was only 13 years old,</i>

459
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,865
<i>and, well, a gunman came into Walmart
and took hostages.</i>

460
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:24,952
<i>Well, Starlight, she came in a'blasting.</i>

461
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:27,120
<i>But what they don't tell you</i>

462
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:31,625
<i>is that she blinded
one of those hostages that day.</i>

463
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:37,047
<i>A mother of three, just trying to buy
Crunch Berries for her kids.</i>

464
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,717
<i>But Starlight, she just went on,</i>

465
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:45,681
<i>smiling for those cameras
like none of it ever happened.</i>

466
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,182
<i>Starlight's no hero.</i>

467
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,727
<i>She never was.</i>

468
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,908
I was still learning
how to control my powers, I...

469
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:10,831
Mademoiselle Annie.

470
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:20,882
Well, whatever you attempted,
it seems you have failed.

471
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,718
Not so fast, Frenchie.

472
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:25,887
Keys to her trailer.

473
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,973
Go give it a toss, will you?

474
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,411
A-Train.

475
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:34,581
What the fuck are you doing here?

476
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,750
Taking V, huh?

477
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,297
What the hell are you doing in here?

478
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,799
Nothing.

479
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,430
You left a floater
in his toilet?

480
00:29:50,514 --> 00:29:51,616
That was there when I got here.

481
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,104
That is the most pathetic clapback
that I have ever seen.

482
00:29:57,187 --> 00:29:58,980
And you know, if Homelander knew,

483
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,144
- that'll be the last shit you ever take.
- Oh, yeah?

484
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:04,236
If Homelander knew you took that V,
he would flay you alive.

485
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,030
Looks like we both have a problem.

486
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,700
Looks like we do.

487
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:17,457
So, what do we do about it?

488
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,016
Marty.

489
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,977
- Yeah?
- Come here for a sec.

490
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:43,525
I'd like to apologize.

491
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,818
For Frank.

492
00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:48,780
Look,
I guess I-I got a little grumpy,

493
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:51,992
and I-I'm sorry.

494
00:30:52,075 --> 00:30:53,827
Can you forgive me?

495
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,079
Of course.

496
00:30:56,163 --> 00:30:59,457
These things, these things happen.

497
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:03,170
Thank you.

498
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:05,380
You were always one of the kinder ones.

499
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,590
That's right, John.

500
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:09,718
- "Homelander."
- Homelander. We were friends.

501
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,636
I was always nice to you.

502
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,305
Yeah, that's right.

503
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:15,557
You were. Mostly.

504
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,103
Well, you remember the nickname
you had for me, right?

505
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:22,522
- Mm-mm.
- Really?

506
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:24,649
"Squirt."

507
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:28,403
Yeah,
you called me Squirt, silly.

508
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,488
You remember why?

509
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:32,157
No.

510
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,910
Oh, f... Marty, okay.

511
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,120
But you do remember, though,

512
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:40,040
that I used to be left in there

513
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:43,501
for hours, days on end.

514
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,545
Completely alone. Right?

515
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:48,298
Only... I was never really alone, was I?

516
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:50,008
Mm?

517
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,302
Big Brother was always watching.

518
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:56,598
You were always watching,
weren't you, Marty?

519
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,266
Huh?

520
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,062
But... growing boys have...

521
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:06,608
certain needs, shall we say?

522
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,362
So I figured out that when
you did your rounds at night,

523
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:15,492
I had about a couple of minutes
to myself to, uh...

524
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:18,328
well, to, uh, to do what boys do.

525
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,290
And-and that would be the only time of day

526
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,501
that I would feel anything good.

527
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:29,339
So this one night, uh,
I couldn't get finished in time.

528
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:32,550
And you caught me with my pants down.

529
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:37,889
You had a really, really good laugh at me.

530
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:39,724
Remember?

531
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:42,811
That's when you nicknamed me Squirt.

532
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,355
I got to be honest with you, Marty...

533
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:49,651
...you really hurt my feelings.

534
00:32:53,697 --> 00:32:58,368
I am very sorry.

535
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:03,290
What's done is done.

536
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,251
Water under the bridge.

537
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:07,419
Ha.

538
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,504
But stay there a sec.

539
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:16,803
I do want you to jerk off
in front of us right now.

540
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:18,972
Hey, uh, guys, come on over here.

541
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:21,224
Come on. Yeah.

542
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,729
We're all gonna laugh at you. Okay?

543
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,772
Yeah.

544
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:31,192
That way, you will know how it feels,

545
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,070
and I think I'm gonna feel better.

546
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,547
Homelander...

547
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:57,510
...I am really very sorry.

548
00:33:57,594 --> 00:33:58,762
I know, I know.

549
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:00,764
Thank you.

550
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,265
Now, don't be shy.

551
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,601
Take your pants down.

552
00:34:04,684 --> 00:34:06,186
Now.

553
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:12,650
Mm-hmm.

554
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:15,028
That's the spirit.

555
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:32,754
Marty, it looks like you're shucking
a little mushroom.

556
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,590
Oh, that poor little thing.

557
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:40,804
Cheer for him. Come on.

558
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:42,889
Squirt. Squirt. Squirt.

559
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,142
Aw.

560
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:47,977
Not off to a great start, huh?

561
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:50,814
Tell you what,
I'll give you a little motivation.

562
00:34:50,897 --> 00:34:52,357
You get hard right now,

563
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,151
or I'm gonna laser your dick off.

564
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,195
Okay?

565
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,659
Something to play for now. Mm?

566
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:04,744
Use it or lose it, Marty.

567
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:07,914
Your life is literally in your hands.

568
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:11,501
Come on, Squirt.

569
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:17,924
Yes!

570
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:21,428
More spit, Marty, more spit.
That'll work.

571
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:22,512
Come on!

572
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:24,931
Put your fucking back into it. Attaboy.

573
00:35:26,516 --> 00:35:27,642
I can't.

574
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,978
- Come on, Marty!
- I'm sorry.

575
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,646
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

576
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:35,316
It's okay. Honestly,
it-it happens to a-a lot of guys.

577
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,820
Truly. Not me, of course.

578
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,281
Ah...

579
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:51,666
That's a fucking squirt, Marty.

580
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,628
Whoa, whoa! You're getting
dick blood on my boots, Marty.

581
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,674
Stop it, John.

582
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,968
Barbara.

583
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:08,057
Um, the cake's melted, I'm afraid.

584
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:11,102
Please put him out of his misery.

585
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,821
I forgive you, Marty.

586
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,915
Can we talk in private?

587
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,878
That's a great idea.

588
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,297
I know just the place.

589
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:44,886
Um, it's more comfortable in my office.

590
00:36:47,347 --> 00:36:50,058
No,
I think in here is better.

591
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,367
Kimiko!

592
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,162
Holy shit!

593
00:37:32,308 --> 00:37:33,393
Ah!

594
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:35,478
Oh, shit.

595
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:46,364
Ah!

596
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:48,134
Do you remember?

597
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:53,389
After you offered me ice cream,

598
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,810
then threw me into that trunk?

599
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:00,563
You took me to the camp,

600
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:02,357
dragged me into the fighting pit.

601
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,151
I could either fight

602
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:07,070
or die.

603
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:11,074
Then you left me with these.

604
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:18,998
I hate you.

605
00:39:47,276 --> 00:39:48,486
Kimiko...

606
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,549
Bonjour.

607
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:35,158
<i>Now,
y'all heard a lot tonight</i>

608
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:37,994
<i>about who Starlight really is.</i>

609
00:40:38,077 --> 00:40:41,289
<i>But you still haven't seen
the true monster behind the mask.</i>

610
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,999
And the truth...

611
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,295
<i>...oh, it is so much worse
than you could ever imagine.</i>

612
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,713
Oh, no.

613
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,757
<i>Six months ago,</i>

614
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,675
<i>Starlight visited a clinic.</i>

615
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:54,594
<i>She wasn't going for a checkup.</i>

616
00:40:54,677 --> 00:40:56,220
What the fuck?

617
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:58,097
<i>She found out</i>

618
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:00,558
<i>that she was pregnant,</i>

619
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:02,685
<i>and she had an abortion.</i>

620
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:06,439
Are those my fucking medical records?

621
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:10,443
<i>She was raised a Christian.</i>

622
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:11,944
<i>She knew the difference</i>

623
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:14,238
<i>between right and wrong.</i>

624
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:17,492
<i>She knew exactly what she was doing.</i>

625
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,511
<i>So you won't tell me
that those teens over there,</i>

626
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:21,496
<i>that they're safe with her.</i>

627
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,748
<i>With that baby killer?</i>

628
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,502
Annie, wait.

629
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:31,422
What do you think you're doing?

630
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:33,817
<i>I'm sorry.
I must've gotten lost.</i>

631
00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:35,843
- Fucking hell. Frenchie.
<i>- Who are you?</i>

632
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,428
It is so embarrassing.

633
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:39,305
I am Firecracker's biggest fan.

634
00:41:39,388 --> 00:41:41,057
I was just looking for a souvenir...

635
00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:45,162
<i>She could have
given it up for adoption.</i>

636
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:48,606
But no. She murdered it.

637
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:53,694
So you finally came to deb...

638
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:08,209
Oi.

639
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,819
How's that for "uppity," cracker?

640
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:38,155
Stop.

641
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,365
Look.

642
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:51,752
<i>Look.</i>

643
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,504
First pebble down the mountain.

644
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:55,428
Let's get out of here.

645
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:58,676
Come on.

646
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:08,811
Get up.

647
00:43:08,895 --> 00:43:09,937
Billy, come on, get up.

648
00:43:13,482 --> 00:43:14,859
Come on. Billy.

649
00:43:15,985 --> 00:43:17,236
You don't get to quit.

650
00:43:18,487 --> 00:43:19,906
Get up!

651
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:10,414
Fucking hell.

652
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:14,353
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

653
00:44:14,377 --> 00:44:17,088
Frenchie!

654
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:18,631
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God. Frenchie.

655
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:26,639
What the fuck happened?

656
00:44:26,722 --> 00:44:28,808
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

657
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,397
What the fuck?

658
00:44:42,863 --> 00:44:44,031
It's funny.

659
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:47,994
I-I remember it being so much bigger.

660
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:50,663
You know why
I used to call this The Bad Room?

661
00:44:50,746 --> 00:44:53,249
It was just a room, John.
It's neither good nor bad.

662
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:56,544
That's easy to say
from the other side of the door.

663
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,422
- Now...
- Did you come back here just to torment those people?

664
00:44:59,505 --> 00:45:03,884
Doesn't that feel a little...
a little small?

665
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:08,055
They were just following orders.
Dr. Vogelbaum's, Stan Edgar's and mine.

666
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,266
Yeah. But they followed them.

667
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:15,563
Not one of them had the backbone
to stand up and say, "This is wrong."

668
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,023
'Cause they were scared.

669
00:45:17,106 --> 00:45:19,150
- I was a child.
- They were scared.

670
00:45:21,694 --> 00:45:22,987
You know...

671
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,449
I was there the day that you were born.

672
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:30,953
They paid some poor runaway
two grand to carry the embryo to term.

673
00:45:31,037 --> 00:45:33,998
But you lasered her guts open
from the inside.

674
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:36,751
You rose in the air
with your umbilical cord still attached,

675
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,587
like some creature out of myth...

676
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,505
or nightmare.

677
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:44,508
You killed three doctors
and a nurse while you were at it.

678
00:45:44,592 --> 00:45:46,632
And then, just trust me,
it was downhill from there.

679
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:50,639
So, yeah, yeah, everybody was
terrified of you, from your first breath.

680
00:45:50,723 --> 00:45:51,724
But you weren't?

681
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:54,894
Hmm.

682
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:57,396
We have no physical power over you.
We never did.

683
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,857
You could've broken out of here
anytime you wanted.

684
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,693
We couldn't have stopped you.
But you didn't.

685
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:09,742
Because you couldn't stand the idea
that we would be disappointed in you.

686
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,537
Your need for approval and for love.

687
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,750
Vought brought in the best psychologists
in the world.

688
00:46:20,086 --> 00:46:24,298
Developed the protocol
to carefully engineer that need

689
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,592
so that you would be obedient.

690
00:46:27,802 --> 00:46:31,764
In many ways,
that was our greatest success.

691
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:36,018
I don't need any of it anymore.

692
00:46:36,102 --> 00:46:39,438
Doesn't matter what you do to me
or the rest of the staff here.

693
00:46:39,522 --> 00:46:42,399
Your need for love is so deep,
it's so human,

694
00:46:42,483 --> 00:46:45,277
you'll never be able to overcome that.

695
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:47,530
That's where you're wrong.

696
00:46:47,613 --> 00:46:51,283
I'm not human. And neither is my son.

697
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:54,495
And I'm going to raise him
so that he knows it.

698
00:46:58,207 --> 00:47:03,003
You know, I really do want to share
with you why I called this The Bad Room.

699
00:47:17,143 --> 00:47:18,727
Oh...

700
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:21,147
Hey. Hey.

701
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,190
Welcome back. You okay?

702
00:47:24,984 --> 00:47:26,694
Wow.

703
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:29,446
I feel like I've been fixing you up
so much lately

704
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,865
I should bill your HMO.

705
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,325
- Colin, please.
- All right, I got to get you up.

706
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:38,205
Colin, don't, please. Stop!
Stop being so fucking nice to me!

707
00:47:43,836 --> 00:47:45,045
It was me.

708
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:47,423
W-What was you?

709
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:05,149
It was you?

710
00:48:08,611 --> 00:48:10,237
I'm sorry.

711
00:48:19,622 --> 00:48:21,332
You're a fucking psychopath.

712
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,969
Come on.

713
00:48:34,053 --> 00:48:35,429
Do it.

714
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:49,360
If you come near me again...

715
00:48:51,445 --> 00:48:53,405
I'll fucking kill you.

716
00:49:19,098 --> 00:49:22,643
Yeah, so, you wanted to see me?

717
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:26,605
Got you some of those fried pickles
and ranch from Flavortown.

718
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:29,275
- This your way of apologizing?
- I need a favor.

719
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:32,820
I don't get you, dude. Like, at all.

720
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,030
You start off, you're a total bitch,

721
00:49:35,114 --> 00:49:37,241
and then you tell me I'm,
like, a superior being...

722
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:38,760
which of course I like
and that you're down to pound,

723
00:49:38,784 --> 00:49:39,868
which obviously I will...

724
00:49:39,952 --> 00:49:41,203
I know.

725
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:51,380
Most people, their brains grow till
they're about 25, then stop forever.

726
00:49:51,463 --> 00:49:54,383
Mine doesn't.
It regenerates, constantly.

727
00:49:54,466 --> 00:49:56,302
Stab me in the heart, I die.

728
00:49:56,385 --> 00:49:59,513
But stab me in the brain
and the little fucking bitch grows back.

729
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:05,936
I want you to put this inside me.

730
00:50:08,731 --> 00:50:10,357
That's the worst dildo

731
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,109
- I've ever seen, but...
- No.

732
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:14,278
In my eye. Here.

733
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:21,076
I am down for, like, a lot, but...

734
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,244
It's temporary.

735
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:24,330
Hmm?

736
00:50:24,413 --> 00:50:27,374
You give me a frontal lobotomy

737
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,169
and I don't have to fucking be me
for a couple hours.

738
00:50:31,587 --> 00:50:35,549
Uh, that's just... fucking gross.

739
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,152
I'll let you ass-fuck me while we
watch the Kim and Ray J video.

740
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:40,898
Okay, so where do you want me to put it?
Just right there? Sit down.

741
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:49,563
Now, avoid the eye itself.
I don't want to go blind.

742
00:50:56,445 --> 00:50:58,238
Ooh.

743
00:50:58,322 --> 00:50:59,740
Now, use the hammer.

744
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,075
- The hammer? Fuck.
- Mm-hmm.

745
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,576
Tap, tap.

746
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,121
Again.

747
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:08,957
- Okay.
- Oh, sorry.

748
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:10,918
Hammer down.

749
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,795
Now...

750
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,005
- Scrape.
- Scrape it?

751
00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:17,841
Scrape my fucking brains out.

752
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:20,302
- Oh...
- That's weird.

753
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,641
Okay, okay, okay.

754
00:51:25,724 --> 00:51:28,560
You can take it out.

755
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,232
Oh, God...

756
00:51:33,315 --> 00:51:34,608
Hey, are you okay?

757
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,652
Uh-huh.

758
00:51:36,735 --> 00:51:38,278
So... Hey.

759
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:41,573
I have another Flavortown for you.

760
00:51:43,992 --> 00:51:46,495
- My pussy.
- Yes.

761
00:51:55,087 --> 00:51:57,131
{\an8}<i>Today's events have
sadly confirmed my suspicions.</i>

762
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,843
<i>While I respect President Elect Singer,</i>

763
00:52:00,926 --> 00:52:03,154
<i>it's disheartening to see him
align himself with Starlight,</i>

764
00:52:03,178 --> 00:52:05,639
<i>someone so clearly out of control.</i>

765
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:10,561
<i>What's even more troubling is that
I considered Starlight a friend.</i>

766
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:15,232
<i>But her violent, out-of-control attack
on Firecracker was</i>

767
00:52:15,315 --> 00:52:19,278
<i>someone I simply don't recognize.
I won't speculate on...</i>

768
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:35,043
<i>And President Elect Singer
needs to wholeheartedly...</i>

769
00:52:38,881 --> 00:52:40,841
- Hey.
- Oh, Jesus.

770
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,469
- What happened to your leg?
- It's okay. I'm fine.

771
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:46,138
But, look, I saw the Firecracker thing.
That fucking asshole.

772
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:49,099
- No, no, I shouldn't have lost it.
- How could you not lose it?

773
00:52:49,183 --> 00:52:51,369
That was, like, the most private thing
between you and me.

774
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:54,062
And to fucking broadcast it like that,

775
00:52:54,146 --> 00:52:55,457
- that's a fucking violation.
- Hughie.

776
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:56,815
It's not helping, okay?

777
00:52:56,899 --> 00:52:59,276
Right, sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

778
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:04,031
I agonized over that decision.

779
00:53:05,365 --> 00:53:07,910
Agonized.
And you know I did.

780
00:53:07,993 --> 00:53:09,411
I just wasn't ready.

781
00:53:09,495 --> 00:53:10,996
I know. I mean, neither was I.

782
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:14,374
And now when people look at me,
whether they're...

783
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:18,837
supportive or judging or-or angry,

784
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:22,716
I have to relive it.
Over and over and over again.

785
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:23,967
And my mom...

786
00:53:27,012 --> 00:53:28,597
Have you talked to her?

787
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,058
She won't return my calls.

788
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,477
Okay. Come here.

789
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,647
It's none of her business. Okay?

790
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,483
It is nobody's business but yours.

791
00:53:39,566 --> 00:53:40,567
Oh, shit.

792
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,587
- I'm sorry, I have to take this.
- It's okay. Um...

793
00:53:42,611 --> 00:53:46,698
I, um, I have to pick up something
for my dad.

794
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:50,285
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Okay.

795
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:51,529
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

796
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,251
Hello?

797
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,338
<i>You know, friends tell friends
the truth, and...</i>

798
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:05,467
The Supe Control bill
would've passed with flying colors.

799
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:07,344
But after what you pulled today...

800
00:54:07,427 --> 00:54:12,057
<i>might as well call it
the Psycho Starlight Baby-Killer bill.</i>

801
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:14,768
Are you still there?

802
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,353
I'm sorry.

803
00:54:16,436 --> 00:54:20,065
<i>Sorry doesn't bring back
all the Republican votes you just torched.</i>

804
00:54:20,148 --> 00:54:22,651
I can't be affiliated with you anymore.

805
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,604
It's bullshit, right?
You're not gonna forgive me.

806
00:55:02,274 --> 00:55:04,026
Yeah. Thought so.

807
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,487
Wait.

808
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,283
You're right, I...

809
00:55:11,366 --> 00:55:13,785
I was gonna tell you to go fuck yourself.

810
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:15,495
But I changed my mind.

811
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:18,373
We're good.

812
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,518
You fucking dog-wanker.

813
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:44,000
Jesus. How long have you
been standing there?

814
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:45,275
Long enough.

815
00:55:46,735 --> 00:55:47,903
How could you?

816
00:55:47,986 --> 00:55:50,405
I-I didn't, I didn't do it for him.

817
00:55:52,032 --> 00:55:54,272
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life hating anybody.

818
00:55:57,329 --> 00:55:59,498
What you gonna do with that, then?

819
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,001
I mean, you're probably the only guy
that would understand,

820
00:56:03,085 --> 00:56:04,670
but I was going to give it to my dad.

821
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:05,962
- Oh, Hughie.
- Look, I know.

822
00:56:06,046 --> 00:56:10,717
I know it's insane and terrible,
but what other choice do I have?

823
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,053
Any other fucking choice, you twat.

824
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,616
You're really telling me
that you wouldn't take some

825
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,808
if you were in his shoes?

826
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:20,018
'Cause you kind of are.

827
00:56:20,102 --> 00:56:22,270
There's enough here.

828
00:56:22,354 --> 00:56:24,606
It'd save you, too.

829
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,109
It's got to beat
dying of brain cancer, right?

830
00:56:27,192 --> 00:56:28,568
I already took some.

831
00:56:29,778 --> 00:56:32,989
<i>Nicked it out of Frenchie's desk
four months ago.</i>

832
00:56:34,282 --> 00:56:36,952
- Thought it might cure me.
- Jesus.

833
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:39,037
Do you have powers?

834
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:40,706
No.

835
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:44,167
<i>All it did was bring up the big day.</i>

836
00:56:44,251 --> 00:56:48,296
I'm telling you, quit while you're behind.

837
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:51,425
You'll only make matters worse.

838
00:57:13,155 --> 00:57:16,199
What happened to me back there?

839
00:57:30,964 --> 00:57:33,109
<i>Radiology,
please call extension 1401.</i>

840
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:37,304
<i>Radiology, please call extension 1401.</i>

841
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:52,444
<i>Tech Services,
call extension 6334.</i>

842
00:57:52,527 --> 00:57:56,448
<i>Tech Services, extension 6334.</i>

843
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:59,826
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

844
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:05,123
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just tripped.

845
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:06,833
How is he?

846
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,795
Well...

847
00:58:09,878 --> 00:58:12,255
The doctor said any time now.

848
00:58:37,405 --> 00:58:39,866
No, no.

849
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,785
Um...

850
00:58:42,994 --> 00:58:44,621
I just need some air.

851
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:43,889
What the fuck?
