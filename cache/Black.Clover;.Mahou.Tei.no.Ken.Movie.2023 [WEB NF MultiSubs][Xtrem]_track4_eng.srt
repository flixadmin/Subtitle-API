1
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,920
Why?

2
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,090
Why do you get in my way, Julius?!

3
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,590
Because what you're trying to do
is wrong, Conrad.

4
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,010
You must give up.

5
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,680
You don't have enough magic
left in you to resist--

6
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,310
The one who's wrong…

7
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,770
is you!

8
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,520
That sword!

9
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,480
The Imperial Sword, Elsdocia!

10
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,030
He shortened his own life?

11
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,420
I must create it.

12
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,010
A world where everyone respects each other

13
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,470
and laughs with one another!

14
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,390
How could I be wrong
to want such a world?!

15
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,570
Is this for real?

16
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,800
Because there is no future
where you're headed.

17
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,980
Even you deny me?!

18
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,820
If you seal me right now,

19
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,320
you'll lose access to the Imperial Sword!

20
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,790
It does pain us
to lose our national treasure.

21
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,120
But we no longer have
enough power to get it back.

22
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,130
I take full responsibility for this

23
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,460
as the next Wizard King.

24
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,510
I won't give up. I will not, Julius!

25
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,100
Never giving up is my…

26
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,740
SWORD OF THE WIZARD KING

27
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,500
CLOVER KINGDOM

28
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,830
Welcome, everyone,

29
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,050
to the festival of magic battles
that takes place once a decade,

30
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,170
the Triumph!

31
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,050
The Triumph is a tournament of duels

32
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,680
to decide the strongest Magic Knight!

33
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,060
It's long been said

34
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,190
that the mage who wins this tournament

35
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,600
would eventually be chosen
as the Wizard King!

36
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,320
As you know,

37
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,570
there are nine Magic Knights Squads
consisting of mages

38
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,570
who specialize in battle.

39
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,780
And under the direction
of the Wizard King,

40
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,540
the strongest mages
from the top Magic Knights Squad

41
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,660
protect the peace
of the Clover Kingdom every day.

42
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,040
We will determine
the strongest member of the Magic Knights.

43
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,340
Today is sure to be a memorable day!

44
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,170
Thank you for waiting.

45
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,760
The Triumph commences…

46
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,220
Now! Shall we?

47
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,200
By the way, Klaus,

48
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,070
why were we chosen
as the masters of the ceremony?

49
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,330
Because we're members
of the strongest Magic Knights Squad,

50
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,000
the Golden Dawn Squad, of course!

51
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,750
Turn off the Amplification Magic first
before you talk!

52
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,580
Oh my, it totally slipped my mind!

53
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,210
Well… pardon the belated introduction.

54
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,090
My name is Mimosa Vermillion,
and I'll be your commentator.

55
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,760
This here is Klaus.

56
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,050
Now is not the time
for introducing ourselves!

57
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,310
Who in the world
chose Mimosa as a commentator?

58
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,810
But, man, look at all these people.

59
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,770
It's almost a full house.

60
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,850
Of course it is. Because, you see…

61
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,070
Yuno, my love!

62
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,830
In the first round is Yuno,
the vice captain of the Golden Dawn Squad.

63
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,000
Hooray, hooray, Yuno! Go, go, Yuno!

64
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,720
So Pretty Boy is in the first round.

65
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,930
Of course, everyone wants to see him.

66
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,930
Right?

67
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,600
I only want to see
my dearest little sister, Marie.

68
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,350
As expected from Gauche…

69
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,020
Man, I'm so ready to fight too!

70
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,110
I wish Asta could have joined us.

71
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,610
He's in exile because of the demon trial.

72
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,150
What a drag.

73
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,360
Why am I even on the roster?

74
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,910
Go for it!

75
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,870
Oh, here he comes!

76
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
What's that?

77
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,460
Hey, who the hell is that?

78
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,170
Up against Yuno is, um…

79
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,670
"the Masked One"?

80
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,010
There's no way you could enter
with such a ridiculous name…

81
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,140
Oh, you're right.

82
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,390
What's with their getup?

83
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,140
Mocking Yuno, are they?

84
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,190
Festival of magic battles, the Triumph.

85
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,570
The first round is
Yuno vs. the Masked One.

86
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,650
The match begins!

87
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
Attaboy, Asta!

88
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,680
The first attack is by Yuno!

89
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,970
He used strong Wind Magic,

90
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,350
but the Masked One cut it in half,

91
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,390
completely neutralizing it!

92
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,690
I guess it's begun.

93
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,580
Well then, Julius, shall we begin as well?

94
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,120
Uh-huh!

95
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,130
Barrier Magic, "Voodoo Shangrila"!

96
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,510
What is this enormous magical power?!

97
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,770
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting for this day.

98
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,400
Today, I will change this country!

99
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,930
How fragile you look, Julius.

100
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,390
I absorbed only a little bit of magic,
and this is the toll it takes on you?

101
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,600
I never expected to meet you again.

102
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,100
I see. So, back then, you…

103
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,900
Yes, I hope
you didn't mind me breaking the seal.

104
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,900
You were distracted for a second.

105
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,490
And are you still…?

106
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,160
My ambition
has not changed a bit since then.

107
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,370
I must create a world

108
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,830
where everyone can respect each other

109
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,040
and laugh with one another.

110
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,210
And for that…

111
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,050
My soldiers, it's time for domination.

112
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,430
We shall overthrow the Clover Kingdom!

113
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,760
Legion Magic: Gehenna Game.

114
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,370
Stop it, Conrad!

115
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,270
All right, old man?

116
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,020
Oh, thank you!

117
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,820
Everyone, this way!

118
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,030
Steel Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

119
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,700
Klaus, leave this to me!

120
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,180
Why am I being targeted?!

121
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,680
Yuno!

122
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,650
Jeez, what's up with these guys?!
They totally ruined my perfect disguise!

123
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,360
Here I thought you were some lost kid
from the festival who wandered in.

124
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,940
Who are you calling a kid?!

125
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,450
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

126
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Whoa!

127
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,030
Stupid Asta!

128
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,370
You could have told me
you were participating!

129
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,450
Noelle!

130
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,460
I know you probably can't feel it,

131
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,130
but it seems like everyone here
is getting their magical power absorbed.

132
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,800
Those with little magical power
are unable to move!

133
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,670
Oh no, really?! Are you okay?

134
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,220
I'm a royal!

135
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,300
A little loss of magic is nothing to me!

136
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,800
Well then, that just means

137
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,680
I'll have to work harder than anyone here!

138
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,350
Don't get too carried away.

139
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,140
I got your back!

140
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,860
You just need to look ahead!

141
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,860
Yeah! Thanks!

142
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,970
Those three?

143
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,350
But that's impossible!

144
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,440
You must know them
if you're a Wizard King.

145
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,980
Those three who had their status
as Wizard King revoked

146
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,610
because of their austerity and cruelty…

147
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,780
Who the heck are you?! Is this your doing?

148
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,740
What's with this child?
How come he can move?

149
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,990
Uh-huh?

150
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,160
He doesn't have
any magical power to begin with.

151
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,160
No juice to speak of, huh? What a weirdo.

152
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,380
There is no way my soldiers would be
defeated by someone with no magic.

153
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,170
How interesting.

154
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:31,630
I managed to revive them with my magic
and the power of the Imperial Sword.

155
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,680
Unlike you, those three have become
great supporters of my cause.

156
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,310
The four of us will create a new world!

157
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,020
That's right.

158
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,940
And you're in our way.

159
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,110
Say what?!
I don't know what exactly you're up to,

160
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,610
but I know that you're the bad guys!

161
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,280
I will defeat you!

162
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,240
Aren't you a lively one?

163
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,830
Barrier Magic: Voodoo Regalia!

164
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,130
He neutralized magic?

165
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,260
Conrad, I found a new toy you might like.

166
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,600
You wanna play?

167
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,850
Wizard King, are you all right?!

168
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,190
No, Marx! Stay back!

169
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,360
Well, well, that's interesting magic.

170
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,660
Huh, so he's not gonna answer me.

171
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,780
I take it I should do whatever I want?

172
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,290
Do not hurt him unnecessarily.

173
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,750
Have the decency
to finish him in one blow.

174
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,870
Hey, my toy!

175
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,760
-Asta!
-La!

176
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,680
Thanks, you all!

177
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,060
Oh? Nice magic you got there.

178
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,320
It's useless against a Wizard King.

179
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,530
What can a normal Magic Knight do?

180
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,950
A peasant kid with no magic like him
is a Magic Knight?

181
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,620
It seems things have fallen far, Julius.

182
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,040
I wouldn't be so sure.

183
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,870
Come again?

184
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,080
I don't think we've fallen that much.

185
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,630
Not me, nor the Magic Knights Squads.

186
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,840
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Blade Storm!

187
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,860
Thanks for waiting!

188
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,780
A strong helper is here to assist you!

189
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,790
Wait, what is this sinister magical power?

190
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,580
It looks like I can paint
another masterpiece based on this!

191
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,790
You're fighting me!

192
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,840
I'll burn you to ashes
with the flame of justice!

193
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,380
That silhouette… You must be…

194
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,970
Kaiser.

195
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,350
It's been a while.

196
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,260
Captain Yami!

197
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,180
My bad.

198
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,440
I was taking a dump,
and it took me a while so I'm late.

199
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,400
And who are these guys?

200
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,270
Not exactly sure,

201
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,110
but I know they're really bad!

202
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,280
And things are really bad too!

203
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,740
For real? Your vocabulary is really bad.

204
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,860
He isn't wrong, you know.

205
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,830
It'd be difficult
to defeat them as we stand.

206
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,330
One possibility would be…

207
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,000
Yami.

208
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,710
Please head to the Magic Tool
Research Lab's Branch Zero right away.

209
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,880
I need you to bring the magic tool
we're co-developing with Nero.

210
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,010
-No, thanks.
-Huh?!

211
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,720
If I went, then who'll have your back?
You're totally vulnerable.

212
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,720
I have no interest in going through
what I did back then again.

213
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,140
Yami…

214
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,270
I mean, if that's all you need,
we can send this guy.

215
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,150
-Hey, kid, you're up.
-Huh?

216
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,980
Yo, Finral. You heard him.

217
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,940
Go to Branch Zero with him.

218
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,110
Yes, sir!

219
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,490
But if I went, this place would be…

220
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,540
So this is where you were hiding.

221
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,540
Stop running around.

222
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,500
I can't kill you swiftly.

223
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,470
Oh?

224
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,390
Stop blubbering and go already!

225
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,060
If you don't come back soon,
I'll kick their butts all by myself!

226
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,980
Yes, sir!

227
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,650
Captain Yami!

228
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,070
Quickly, Asta!

229
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,240
Because of that black barrier,
it's difficult to maintain spatial magic!

230
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,580
You're a member of the Black Bulls Squad!

231
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,120
Listen to your captain!

232
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,620
Nice, Noelle!

233
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,250
Whoa, whoa.

234
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,210
A magic like that exists in this era?

235
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,090
Well, I guess I can analyze it later.

236
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,760
Whoa.

237
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,380
Voiuvre's Roar!

238
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,310
Running away is pointless, I guess.

239
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,480
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade!

240
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,480
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

241
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,120
Their defense is getting
harder and harder.

242
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,710
The kids have come far.

243
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,630
No, they've got a long way to go.

244
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,710
A long way to go
before they can fight alongside me.

245
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,430
I'm sorry, I wasn't able to contain them.

246
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,470
No, you've done well.

247
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,980
Thanks to you, I got to send
my guys out on an errand.

248
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,940
Whatever you do, it is pointless.

249
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,400
If the Imperial Sword's magic
is activated,

250
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,820
the Clover Kingdom will be destroyed.

251
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,150
Repeating the same thing
from ten years ago.

252
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,160
Wait, wasn't the Imperial Sword
something that could absorb

253
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,080
and store magical power and stuff?

254
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,710
Is it really possible
to destroy a country with it?

255
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,460
It can unleash
the stored magical power all at once.

256
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,090
Right now, the magical power
absorbed from everyone at the stadium

257
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,130
is stored inside the Imperial Sword.

258
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,590
With his magic,

259
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,510
he could abuse that magical power
and the Imperial Sword as he wishes.

260
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,730
"Abuse"? I'm using it to save the world.

261
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,850
I'd say it's the proper way to use it.

262
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,200
Are you all right, Wizard King?

263
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,280
We have completed
the evacuation of the audience.

264
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,870
All that's left is to defeat the rebels.

265
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,210
Fuegoleon and Nozel.

266
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,370
Have you gotten any stronger?

267
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,460
I never expected to fight
this monster again.

268
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,800
Oh yeah, back then,

269
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,430
Nozel got spooked, fell down,
cried, and soiled his pants, didn't he?

270
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,600
Want me to dunk you in mercury, foreigner?

271
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,180
Hey, those guys weren't there back then.

272
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,140
Who are they?

273
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,390
That woman's magic,
which produces magic soldiers…

274
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,650
I remember seeing it
in my great-grandfather's journal.

275
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,480
My sister was captivated by it,
so I remember it well.

276
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,400
No way!

277
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,160
Historical figures who died long ago…

278
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,160
Wait, does that mean
former Wizard Kings have returned?

279
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,950
Seriously?

280
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,370
I gotta get their autographs
and scalp them.

281
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,710
The former Wizard Kings have been revived?

282
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,000
It's so strange. I'm awake for a change,

283
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,630
but this is like a dream.

284
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,380
It gives me lots of inspiration!

285
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,220
But maybe now's not the time for that.

286
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,770
You seem to have gathered enough people,

287
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,190
but this is where it ends.

288
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:36,950
There are countless singular points
where veins of mana interact.

289
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,080
This stadium is one of them.

290
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,500
Ten years ago,

291
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,630
I altered this stadium

292
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,290
and turned it into a weapon.

293
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,550
You all interrupted me
before I could activate it.

294
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,000
The festival stadium.

295
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,590
Also known as
the "Triumph" flying fortress.

296
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,010
Now, there's no way to escape.

297
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,760
Julius, it's time to turn the hands
of the clock you took away from me.

298
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,940
Here we are. This is Branch Zero.

299
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,780
Hey!

300
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,530
I'm Asta from
the Black Bulls Magic Knights Squad!

301
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,780
Open the door!

302
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,120
That won't do, Asta.

303
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,250
Only a limited number of nobles
know about this lab.

304
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,000
To enter, you have to spell out
a secret password with your magic…

305
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,340
You are…

306
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,220
You must be the Black Bulls.

307
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm Millie Maxwell,
the coordinator at this branch.

308
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,730
Come on, hurry up.

309
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,100
Alright!

310
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,850
We've been debriefed about the situation.

311
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,860
From here on, she will show you around.

312
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,070
I'll leave you to it.

313
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,490
Nero!

314
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,570
The magic tool Julius needs

315
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,080
is stored in a place quite far away.

316
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,700
Right now, Sally is making an adjustment.

317
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,170
Experiment, experiment!

318
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,250
So Sally is here too, huh?

319
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,920
Nero, you've watched the Clover Kingdom

320
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,130
over the last 500 years, right?

321
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,300
Do you know the people
who attacked the stadium?

322
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,720
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,140
I don't know everything, but…

324
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,980
the mastermind is Conrad Leto.

325
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,940
What?

326
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,400
I believe you've at least heard the name?

327
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
Conrad?

328
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,730
You don't mean…

329
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,780
Yes.

330
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,030
He used to be
a Magic Knight of the Clover Kingdom.

331
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,700
He's the predecessor of Julius Novachrono.

332
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,210
A former Wizard King.

333
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,710
But I thought the former Wizard King
died from a disease ten years ago.

334
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,920
I'll explain.

335
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,920
Get on.

336
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,060
Conrad Leto, the 27th Wizard King.

337
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,680
Before he was chosen as the Wizard King,

338
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,480
he was known as a powerful man
in the Clover Kingdom.

339
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,270
He became a Magic Knight captain,

340
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,030
establishing an impressive track record
with his squad.

341
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,110
The citizens trusted him,

342
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,410
and his abilities were recognized.

343
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,830
He was finally chosen
to be the Wizard King.

344
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,000
But he changed.

345
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,330
He rebelled against the Kingdom,

346
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,340
and as a result,
his status as the Wizard King was revoked.

347
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,500
"Rebelled against"?

348
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,180
He tried to destroy the country.

349
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,970
What?! The Wizard King's job
is to protect the peace for everyone.

350
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,470
Why did he try to do something so crazy?

351
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,980
I don't know.

352
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,440
But he used Lemiel's…

353
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,610
He used
the first Wizard King's magic item,

354
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,940
the Imperial Sword Elsdocia,
to make it happen.

355
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,200
Julius and the others learned of his plan

356
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,820
and sealed Conrad to stop him.

357
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,950
"Sealed"?

358
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,080
They announced that he died of an illness
so as not to panic the citizens.

359
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,920
The current Wizard King, Julius,

360
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,540
couldn't defeat him, even with all
the Magic Knights Squad elites.

361
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,670
Julius had no choice

362
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,340
but to use his Time Magic
to continue sealing him.

363
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,390
He's incredibly strong.

364
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,760
What kind of magic does he use?

365
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,720
Key Magic.

366
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,060
He can open or close
anything and everything

367
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,060
with a key he creates with his magic.

368
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,060
The magic space he opens with his key

369
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,190
can absorb anything.

370
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,860
Magic tools, grimoires.

371
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,610
Even magic itself…

372
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,610
Magic itself?!

373
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,740
What? No way!

374
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,660
Yes.

375
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,990
He can steal the magic of others.

376
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,750
And he can use it as he pleases.

377
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,800
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.

378
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,810
How far are we going?

379
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,860
The security is extremely tight.

380
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,060
Indeed.

381
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,770
Because beyond this point…

382
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,080
This is the innermost part of Branch Zero.

383
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,800
This is where we store and research
the most important magic tools in the lab.

384
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,130
Is what we've been asked to retrieve
also rare?

385
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,050
Yes.

386
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,640
It controls the power
of the Imperial Sword

387
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,680
that Prince Lemiel was developing.

388
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,890
Something that serves as a sheath
for the Imperial Sword.

389
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,230
It's still a prototype,

390
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,770
but we'll have to use it to seal Conrad.

391
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,070
How?!

392
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:52,540
I had high hopes hearing that
it was a magic tool Lemiel was working on.

393
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,290
But it turns out it was just a toy.

394
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,580
-Don't!
-Sally!

395
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,750
Demon Slayer!

396
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,380
Oh?

397
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,020
Finral!

398
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,440
I know you.

399
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,530
How did you find this place?!

400
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,320
You're Secré Swallowtail,

401
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,910
a member of the Black Bulls Squad.

402
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,080
And you too, Asta.

403
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,830
Noelle Silva.

404
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,210
Finral Roulacase.

405
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,790
Memory Exchange Magic, which allows
you to peek at someone else's memory.

406
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,380
It's a magic of poor taste,

407
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,970
but thanks to that,
I was able to easily locate this place.

408
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,720
You used Marx's…

409
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,720
I'll tell you one more thing.

410
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,930
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom!

411
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,980
Surrender immediately
and offer your magical power as a tribute.

412
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,690
Resistance is futile.

413
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,480
My Legion Magic soldiers

414
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,950
will stop at nothing
until their last bit of power is spent!

415
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,740
One of the former Wizard Kings, Princia.

416
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,910
The Imperial Sword is supplying her
with the magical power it stored,

417
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,660
and her magic will have no limit.

418
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,210
The Magic Knights Squads
have been wiped out.

419
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,210
The citizens and the major facilities
of the kingdom have all been seized.

420
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,970
No way…

421
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,880
Impressive, no?

422
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,010
Tens of thousands…

423
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,220
She can create even more magic soldiers.

424
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:41,350
You're being invaded by a military power
equal to an entire country.

425
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,400
Those captains who helped you escape…

426
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,730
Captain Yami!

427
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,660
As you can see, they just went to sleep.

428
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,240
The people at the stadium…

429
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,660
Brother Nozel!

430
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,290
You're the youngest daughter
of the Silvas?

431
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,170
A leftover child
of the Steel War Princess,

432
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,670
Acier Silva.

433
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,300
How pathetic of Nozel
to fall before his little sister.

434
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,930
To think that a coward like him

435
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,470
is the Magic Knights Captain!

436
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,270
Sea Dragon's Roar!

437
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,200
Noelle! Dammit!

438
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,070
Oh?

439
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,700
Still rough around the edges,
but this water magic is of high purity.

440
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,660
I will take it.

441
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,380
When there is such a clear difference
in abilities, it's so easy to take magic.

442
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,180
My magic…

443
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,810
Bastard… What did you do to Noelle?!

444
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,440
Learn this the hard way.

445
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:11,280
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar.

446
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,540
That's Noelle's magic…

447
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,540
Give it back to her!

448
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,890
I'll defeat you here and now!

449
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,390
So this is Anti-Magic,
the power to neutralize magic.

450
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,100
Demon-Destroyer!

451
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,320
What a wonderful power you possess.

452
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
It can neutralize not only magic,

453
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,910
but also phenomena derived from magic.

454
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,780
I'd like to take your magic as well,

455
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,160
but perhaps I should refrain.

456
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,410
I wouldn't want it
to affect my other magic.

457
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,540
Let's talk.

458
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,170
The paths we walk are one and the same.

459
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,210
What the heck are you talking about now?!

460
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,380
Of course they're not!

461
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,340
The magic tool developed by Lemiel,
the first Wizard King,

462
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,100
the Imperial Sword Elsdocia.

463
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,310
It is quite compatible with my Key Magic.

464
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,730
The Imperial Sword was created
to leave behind the exceptional magic

465
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,820
of great mages and heroes
as a legacy for future generations.

466
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,400
It stores every Wizard King's magic
and wisdom,

467
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,490
not to mention a part of their souls.

468
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,740
And one more thing.

469
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,580
Using the function to absorb, store,

470
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,000
and unleash the magical power all at once,

471
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,750
I will compound
the generations of Wizard Kings' magic…

472
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,880
FLAME EARTH WATER WIND

473
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,340
…with the plethora of magic I've stolen

474
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,380
and create Gargantuan Compound Magic!

475
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,680
Our goal is to drive that
into the vein of the earth here.

476
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,640
It will cause unprecedented disaster.

477
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,020
The foundation of the continent
will be destroyed,

478
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,520
and every single citizen will die.

479
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,190
But have no fear.

480
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,610
The Imperial Sword
can store the departed souls.

481
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,110
So we will select

482
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,410
and bring back only those people
who are valuable enough

483
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,160
to live in the new world!

484
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,870
I've seen it in people's memories.

485
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,000
I was once loathed
and disliked because of my magic.

486
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,170
So I know exactly how you feel.

487
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,920
Those with magical power own everything,

488
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,800
and those without die helplessly.

489
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,380
It's impossible, Asta.

490
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,550
We must destroy everything first.

491
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,390
Join me and together we'll create

492
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,690
an ideal world where everyone respects
each other and laughs with one another!

493
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,690
Everyone who lives there respects
each other and laughs with one another.

494
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,780
That's the country I want to create
when I become the Wizard King!

495
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,150
No!

496
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,910
That's bullshit!

497
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:50,410
The Wizard King is there
to protect the nation and its people!

498
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,910
I will not let you destroy it!

499
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,420
That's not what the Wizard King does!

500
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,130
An ideal world will be built
upon the meaningless lives

501
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,420
of those who are oppressed.

502
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,260
I can give meaning to their lives!

503
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,140
Why can't you see that?!

504
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,100
Of course I can't!
What you're saying is absolutely crazy!

505
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,980
You don't see
the true nature of the world yet.

506
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,480
I'm disappointed.

507
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,940
Shut up!

508
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,910
You're just thinking of yourself!

509
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,420
Why can't you understand?!

510
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,090
I know you've experienced it!

511
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,510
The unfairness! The betrayal!
And the inequality of this country!

512
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,100
Choose, Asta.

513
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,270
Walk this path with me

514
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,730
or die.

515
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,710
Give up already, Asta.

516
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,420
You are me.

517
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,840
You can be me.

518
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,720
By dawn tomorrow,
the fusion of magic will be complete.

519
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,100
At that point, you will be…

520
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,980
Give… Noelle back… her magic…

521
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,940
I see.

522
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,110
It's truly regrettable.

523
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,240
I will

524
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,660
not give up.

525
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,210
Never giving up

526
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,630
is my magic!

527
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,550
I have no magical power left.

528
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,430
What do I do?

529
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,390
But we still have to give it a try!

530
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,860
You… you're Yuno!

531
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,870
Millie!

532
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,950
He insisted he came to help you all.

533
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,580
Drink up, Sally!

534
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,620
Okay.

535
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,670
Sorry, but we'll have to play this by ear.

536
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,590
Play it by ear?

537
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,130
Sounds fun!

538
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,670
Not at all.

539
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,590
It's the phrase
I hate the most in the world.

540
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,200
Yuno…

541
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,340
I never thought I'd use it like this,

542
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,210
but let's try and activate it
with all the magic we have!

543
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,590
Nonsense.

544
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,470
It may be. But…

545
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,800
I can hit you thanks to everyone's help!

546
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,810
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

547
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,520
He's a monster!

548
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,150
We'll retreat for now!

549
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,300
It's me. How is the fusion of magic going?

550
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,760
Uh-huh? We're at about 20%.

551
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,970
Generally speaking, it's going well.

552
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,350
It should be completed by dawn,
as scheduled.

553
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,810
Understood.

554
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,900
Thank you.

555
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,980
For walking this path with me.

556
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,110
Finally, we'll create it.

557
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,690
The strongest country

558
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,490
with no tears and where no one
is robbed of what they have!

559
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,870
Once again, save the poor lost souls…

560
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:47,080
What I seek is a world
where no one oppresses or is oppressed.

561
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,920
I trust that you can achieve that, Conrad.

562
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,590
Yes.

563
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,930
How about the veins?

564
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,890
Uh-huh? I found the perfect one.

565
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,060
It's at a village called Hage,

566
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,810
in the Forsaken Realm
where the demon's skeleton lies.

567
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:18,780
My Key Magic is useless
unless I borrow someone's power.

568
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,660
That's why it is meaningful
that I'm the one who finishes this.

569
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,580
One day, I will even change this country.

570
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,260
Never giving up is my magic!

571
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,470
Never giving up…

572
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,910
Where am I?

573
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,710
Oh, Noelle!

574
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,460
You're awake.

575
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,130
I'm sorry that all I could provide
was first aid.

576
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,460
Mimosa.

577
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,670
You're safe.

578
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,010
This is a Golden Dawn emergency shelter.

579
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,520
It's still under construction,

580
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,310
so only a few members know about it.

581
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:34,020
We were almost captured
and our magic stolen,

582
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,190
but the captains let us escape.

583
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,160
Take care of the kid for me.

584
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,790
I don't know what happened afterwards,

585
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,080
but if they're not here yet…

586
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,960
Hey, are you okay?

587
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,210
Asta! Please excuse me.

588
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,430
Asta!

589
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,930
You should not move
until the treatment is over.

590
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,930
Conrad… needs to be stopped.

591
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,060
He's going to destroy this kingdom.

592
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,980
If we don't do something,

593
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,480
it will happen tomorrow at dawn!

594
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,900
At dawn?

595
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,150
But if the enemies are so formidable…

596
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,360
Why would a former Wizard King…

597
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,740
What could we possibly do by ourselves?

598
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:28,950
What could we do?

599
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,080
Now that it's come to this,
we should run away!

600
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,120
There's nothing we can do with so few,

601
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,500
and who knows when they'll find us here!

602
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,500
Let's run!

603
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,000
To some other country!

604
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,510
Maybe the Heart Kingdom will take us in.

605
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,010
This is not a problem we alone can solve…

606
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,510
Yes, we could ask other nations for help.

607
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,310
There are injured people.
Getting them to the border would be tough.

608
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,690
If the enemy is the former Wizard King,
do we have any chance of winning?

609
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,650
With Julius gone…

610
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,770
What could we do by ourselves?

611
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,530
We gotta do something!

612
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,070
If we cave in,

613
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,490
then who will protect this kingdom
and everyone in it?

614
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,160
Aren't we the Magic Knights Squads
of the Clover Kingdom?!

615
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,170
We've been able to live
happily and peacefully

616
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,420
thanks to the Wizard King
and the Magic Knights Squads!

617
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,840
Before we joined, or when we were kids,
or even before we were born,

618
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,430
the Magic Knights Squads
were fighting for us.

619
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,440
And the Wizard King has stood
at the helm to protect this kingdom.

620
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,940
It's thanks to those efforts
made by one person for another

621
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,190
that the Clover Kingdom exists now.

622
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,240
That's why we are here!

623
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,450
Asta…

624
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,990
I can't just sit and watch!

625
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,780
It's my turn to protect

626
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:55,250
what the Wizard King
and the captains have protected!

627
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,420
But it's not just me. It's our turn!

628
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,920
I can heal an injury like this
with my fighting spirit!

629
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,760
And then I will kick his butt,
for real this time!

630
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,520
With all of us, we can stop Conrad!

631
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,690
We may not be strong enough by ourselves,

632
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,360
but if we come together,
we can become an immense force!

633
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:33,040
That's why we,
the Magic Knights Squads, are strong!

634
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,960
If all the Magic Knights Squads
join their power,

635
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,250
we could face any enemy!

636
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,590
I'm not forcing you to come with me.

637
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,920
Like Sekke said,

638
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,550
you can still escape to the Heart Kingdom
or elsewhere if you go now.

639
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:54,100
But if any of you
is willing to lend me your power…

640
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,650
Jeez, what you suggest is so reckless.

641
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,860
But coming from you, who's trying to do
the most reckless thing,

642
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,070
I guess I can't say no.

643
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,290
I'm not letting you go alone.
Not a chance.

644
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,970
The Wizard King isn't here!

645
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,300
We don't have the captains to rely on!

646
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,510
But that doesn't matter!

647
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,060
Now it's our turn to carry on!

648
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,690
We'll fight on their behalf!

649
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,310
I'll say it again.

650
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,360
We are the Magic Knights Squads
of the Clover Kingdom!

651
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,820
Right here, right now!
We'll surpass our limits,

652
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,610
and protect this country!

653
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,570
Yeah!

654
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,950
And what is the actual plan?

655
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,290
I'm going to figure that out now!

656
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,580
What?!

657
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,790
I can't take this anymore, bwa-ha!

658
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,170
Now that it has come to this,
I have to escape, even if it's just me!

659
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:07,590
Huh?

660
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:08,800
Bwa-ha!

661
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,390
Without any plans…

662
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,890
Stop boasting, you imbecile!

663
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,410
Lady Big-sis-leon! Everyone else, too!

664
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,910
I didn't know you were alive! Ouch!

665
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:40,790
Who are you calling "Big-sis-leon"?

666
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:41,910
And don't assume I'm dead.

667
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,630
I was away for training.

668
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,590
But it seems…

669
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,300
something fun is going on.

670
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,930
I've also been away
on a mission with Jack.

671
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:02,140
Which is why I didn't get caught by
pursuers and was able to arrive here.

672
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,940
Same for me.

673
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,110
We must go rescue everyone.

674
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,440
Hehe.

675
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,110
Some of the people who went on a mission
with us are fine as well.

676
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,990
They're out there,
surveilling that huge flying fortress.

677
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:21,450
It looks like Yami
and the other captains are alive.

678
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,170
They're trapped inside a barrier though.

679
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,630
Captain Yami!

680
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,210
My brother Nozel!

681
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,960
Yami! I'm so glad!

682
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,130
But I don't get it.

683
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,470
Why have the enemy captured
the citizens and the Magic Knights Squads

684
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,220
but are keeping them alive?

685
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,560
Because they need their magical powers.

686
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,350
If they absorb power through the Sword
and supply it to their members,

687
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,480
they will never run out of magical power.

688
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,110
Hehe, so they're the feed.

689
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,860
Oh man! He also mentioned
that he needs lots of magical power

690
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,990
for his crazy ambition to come true!

691
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,660
So that's why he's keeping them alive.

692
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,580
So if their magical power runs out,
Yami and the others will be…

693
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,120
We don't have much time left.

694
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,660
Asta, everyone.

695
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,500
Let's join forces
to take back this kingdom.

696
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,960
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

697
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,800
Before we do, we must eat-la!

698
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,690
Oh! Charmy, you're okay!

699
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,610
Yup. Thanks to Rouge and Captain Yami,
who let me escape.

700
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,360
Oh! You all!

701
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,200
Noelle, I'm glad you're okay.

702
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,660
Our base was trapped
inside the barrier as well.

703
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,000
Henry and Gordon are trapped inside,
but they're okay for now.

704
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,160
Then,

705
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,750
we gotta go get them, right?

706
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,840
The base of the Black Bulls…

707
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,090
The Imperial Sword has collected
the magical power of all the citizens,

708
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,760
which will be driven into
a "singular point" vein of mana.

709
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:07,060
Ha! Then that's the end for this kingdom.

710
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,850
The enemy Wizard Kings

711
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,770
must have been revived with
the Imperial Sword and Conrad's magic.

712
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,280
So if we destroy the Imperial Sword,
do we stop the power of the Wizard Kings?

713
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,280
Judging from Conrad's actions,

714
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,780
that's highly likely.

715
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:24,790
Very well!

716
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:28,410
The final goal is to destroy
the Imperial Sword and neutralize it!

717
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,210
Go and prepare for encountering the enemy!

718
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,420
We don't have much time before dawn,
our time limit!

719
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,270
I still can't use
the spells in my grimoire,

720
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,350
but thanks to Charmy,
my magic has returned.

721
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,020
I'll focus on what I can do now!

722
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,540
Yuno!

723
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,300
Are you ready, Asta?

724
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,840
Yeah!

725
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,850
BLACK BULLS SQUAD BASE

726
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,770
This is strange. When I got back
from training, there was only Henry here.

727
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,690
And former Wizard Kings have been revived,
and they've taken over the capital…

728
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,030
I'm going to retake the base!

729
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,160
First, we will go and rescue
those at the Black Bulls base.

730
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,580
Are you sure?

731
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:58,840
This plan depends on how much
fighting power we can preserve.

732
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,970
For that, we need something that allows us
to move safely but in large numbers.

733
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:04,890
I see.

734
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,010
Don't you get it?

735
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,850
At your base, that's possible.

736
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:16,060
But Conrad is a formidable foe
who uses many types of magic at will.

737
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,940
Normal magic attacks will be canceled out.

738
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,240
And that's where you come in, Asta.

739
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,280
Since you have Anti-Magic,
which neutralizes any kind of magic,

740
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,950
only you have the chance to defeat Conrad.

741
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,450
This is the key point of the plan.

742
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:35,830
Please stop Conrad. Can I count on you?

743
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,790
Yes, sir!

744
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,390
All right!

745
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,100
Welcome back, everyone.

746
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,930
And we have so many guests…

747
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,980
That's the story, Henry.

748
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,310
Can you do it?

749
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,190
Okay!

750
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:06,910
Well then! You recover
the magic you lost by eating-la!

751
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:16,210
I've never felt
this much magical power before!

752
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,520
Cool!

753
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,360
So this is the flying style
of the Black Bulls!

754
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,490
Is this really going to fly?

755
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:51,870
If there's enough magical power,

756
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,660
I think it will--

757
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,210
More than we expected, huh?

758
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,710
Hehe!

759
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,300
Severing Magic…

760
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,050
Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!

761
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,100
Briar Magic…

762
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,390
Crimson Vine Spear.

763
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,570
A drop in a bucket, was it?

764
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,070
Hehe! How annoying.

765
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,490
What?!

766
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,700
Bwa-ha!

767
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,170
Hehe! Looks like this is worth severing!

768
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,880
We will stop them here!

769
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,880
You all go on ahead!

770
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,300
Captain Jack! Captain Charlotte!

771
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,010
This will be pointless if you go!

772
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,310
But those two alone couldn't…

773
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,680
It might be impossible, yes.

774
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,600
Then,

775
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,270
how about three?

776
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,530
World Tree Magic…

777
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,740
Great Mistilteinn Tree!

778
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,960
Now, go while you can!

779
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,290
Captain Vangeance!

780
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,130
Are you ready?

781
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,950
Yuno.

782
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,990
I'm leaving the Wizard King in your care.

783
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,120
Well then,

784
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,660
let's have the barbarous guests leave.

785
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,840
Listen up, everyone!

786
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,170
We are minus three captains,
but we'll head into enemy territory…

787
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,920
No, Asta.

788
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:12,920
You tell them.

789
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,930
Okay, let's go, everyone!

790
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,770
We'll kick their butts

791
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,980
and get the Clover Kingdom back!

792
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,980
Yeah!

793
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,450
A report from my soldiers.

794
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,370
The rebels have started to move.
How shall I deal with them?

795
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,620
So you're here.

796
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,790
That's right. I knew you would come.

797
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,880
It is time for the finale.

798
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,630
I saved you the best seat.

799
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,720
Is that why you kept me alive until now,

800
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,890
even after I've lost most of my power?

801
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,930
Those you love, those you want to protect.

802
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:04,890
Burn into your eyes the image of
your trusted ones dying miserable deaths.

803
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,440
Die as you agonize
over how powerless you are.

804
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,530
This is the beginning
of a new Clover Kingdom.

805
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,650
Let us turn a new page!

806
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,380
What is that?!

807
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,630
Whoa, it's enormous!

808
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,390
It's incomparable to the one that was
at the Magic Knights Squad base!

809
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,850
Everyone, look!

810
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:54,780
Well, well, let me see
the last squeeze of power you have.

811
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,530
And let me teach you

812
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,530
that the Wizard King
is never caught off-guard!

813
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,460
So, what are you going to do?

814
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,380
This is the power of the Wizard King?

815
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,220
It's in another league! What should we do?

816
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,180
Asta!

817
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,310
It's not your turn yet!

818
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:27,270
What do we do?
More like, what don't we do?

819
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,060
We've always surpassed our limits, right?

820
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,190
Ready, you guys?

821
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,410
-Let's show him what we're made of!
-Yeah!

822
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:44,370
Flame Magic: Exploding Fireball!

823
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,370
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

824
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,370
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

825
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,580
Everyone!

826
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,960
Are you ready?

827
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,460
Yeah!

828
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,010
Mirror Magic: Large Reflect Refrain!

829
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,520
Go!

830
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,870
Bwa-ha! Again?!

831
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,080
Now's the chance!

832
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,460
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

833
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,460
Well, well.

834
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:39,920
Whoa, whoa, we're about to arrive
at the enormous barrier!

835
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,880
The space is shut off from here on,

836
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,930
so I can't break through with my magic.

837
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,680
So, I'm counting on you.

838
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,730
I know you can do this.

839
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,400
Asta!

840
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,540
Stop running around!

841
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,300
Thanks for voluntarily walking
into the trap.

842
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,010
Magic like this will not--

843
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,340
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

844
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,300
Finral, now! Do it quickly!

845
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:31,560
Alright! Not said this in a while,
but remember I'm your senior!

846
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,310
Good. Now…

847
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,190
Didn't I tell you?

848
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,110
I'm never caught off-guard!

849
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:01,250
Thank you so much!

850
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,890
Uh-huh? This special barrier has been
fortified with the Imperial Sword,

851
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:15,640
so even if it gets broken,
it'll regenerate and not be a problem.

852
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:21,190
To create the perfect world, we should
get rid of those who get in our way.

853
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,030
This is the end!

854
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,440
For you!

855
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,750
I love it, I love it! Struggle for me.

856
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:37,460
Mana Zone: Fangs of Riot…

857
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:38,500
Double Attacks!

858
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,170
Was that supposed to hurt me?!

859
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,630
Now! Fire at will!

860
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,970
One more time!

861
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,350
Are you ready?

862
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,780
I love it, you guys.

863
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,320
Bring it on!

864
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,380
-Go!
-Go!

865
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:33,350
Ha! Are you serious?

866
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,640
You guys are amazing!

867
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,350
However!

868
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,890
Everyone!

869
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,150
I'm counting on you, Asta!

870
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:44,480
You defeat him!

871
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,940
Alright! I'm off!

872
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,910
Hey, check that out.

873
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,910
Conrad?!

874
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:55,870
Why is he there?

875
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,870
Oh, the singular point…

876
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,670
Is it the skeleton of a demon?

877
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,460
Uh-huh!

878
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:12,930
Don't you dare get in our way!

879
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:23,440
Asta! You go to Conrad!

880
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,440
Give him all you got!

881
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:30,530
Yeah!

882
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,250
Let's go, Bell!

883
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,170
I'm ready!

884
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,710
Going all out!

885
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,470
Spirit Assimilation…

886
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,600
Spirit Dive!

887
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:06,020
All units! Get into your positions!

888
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,320
Just as planned, we succeeded
in splitting the enemy force!

889
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,200
Now each of you will fight to the end

890
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,120
with the pride of a Magic Knights Squad!

891
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,700
If you don't,
then you have me to answer to!

892
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:24,000
And not one of you
is allowed to die either.

893
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,540
If you slack off, or if you die,

894
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,710
then I will burn you to death myself!

895
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:33,300
Listen well, all of you.

896
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,970
If you don't want to die,

897
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,260
then fight on, even if it kills you!

898
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:40,100
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

899
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:46,020
No tricks to speak of
for fighting against me?

900
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:50,270
Just my luck to have
such a boring fool as my enemy.

901
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,070
"Tricks"?

902
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,280
Why would I need tricks to face you?

903
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,320
Princia Funnybunny.

904
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:01,790
A mighty warrior among the Wizard Kings,
whose combat strength

905
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,870
is worth a thousand soldiers!

906
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:07,750
The records say that you've never lost

907
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,630
in any combat where you were involved.

908
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,340
Why would I rely on some silly tricks

909
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,050
when facing such a foe!

910
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,350
Very well, I take back my words.

911
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:23,310
Legion Magic: Endless Domination!

912
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,980
If you want me to play with you,

913
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,020
then show me your strength first.

914
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,700
A test of strength?
I accept the challenge.

915
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:42,490
But I hope you don't hold back on me!

916
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,420
Next…

917
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,300
Where are you aiming?

918
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:08,270
Did you actually think
you managed to lure me in?

919
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:10,770
Just the opposite, silly you!

920
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,110
I'm the one who lured you here.

921
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,820
The truth is,

922
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,700
we can use the magical power

923
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,070
that's fueling this flying fortress
as our own!

924
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,540
So, as long as I'm in here,

925
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:28,370
I can replenish my magic endlessly!

926
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:35,050
And you think you've won just for that?

927
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,460
Against us?

928
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:37,920
"Us"?

929
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:41,720
Hey, hey, Pretty Boy.

930
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,930
Didn't anyone teach you

931
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,970
that a damsel in distress
should be rescued gently?

932
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,730
I'm a Virgo, you know!

933
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:53,980
The earlier attack…

934
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,650
This is what he was aiming for.

935
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,200
I'll remember that.

936
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:01,410
Are you ready to go?

937
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,990
Can't have my subordinates taking risks

938
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,660
without me, the captain,
surpassing my limits first, can I?

939
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,210
Right, you guys?

940
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,750
You don't need to tell me.

941
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,170
We will show you the might
of the Magic Knights Squads, here and now!

942
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,170
Yuno! We will back you up!

943
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,050
You focus on attacking!

944
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:34,900
Uh-huh?

945
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,400
Don't make me yawn,
you nearly dead idiots.

946
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:43,320
These guys here have been kept alive

947
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:47,450
so that we could suck their magical power
to fuel the fortress.

948
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,790
They have little magical power left.

949
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:54,290
And?

950
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,040
Is your grit going to help
regain your magical power?

951
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,300
Huh? Surpassing limits?

952
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,300
You can't get strong that quickly!

953
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:09,350
You called yourself Wizard King
when you didn't even know that?

954
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,310
Unbelievable.

955
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,810
Bring it on, bastards!

956
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,860
Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!

957
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,930
Here it is! Grey!

958
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,850
Okay!

959
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:51,390
Magic Conversion!

960
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,200
Thank you…

961
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,910
I can't use strong magic,

962
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
but I can manage this much
without my grimoire…

963
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,210
Looks like we can handle this.

964
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:19,670
Right.

965
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:23,130
The revived Wizard Kings
and the magic to destroy this kingdom…

966
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,130
If Asta can touch the Imperial Sword
with his Demon-Slayer Sword,

967
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,640
they can all be neutralized.

968
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:31,310
All we have to do is to stop them
until he can do that!

969
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,560
How pitiful…

970
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,770
I'm saying this for your sake.

971
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,060
Surrender now.

972
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:43,940
And, please, leave
and go somewhere out of our sight.

973
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,900
That's mighty nice of you.

974
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:51,490
Isn't it your purpose to kill us off?

975
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:58,170
If you were nobles and royals
who only think of benefitting themselves,

976
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,000
then I'd have no mercy for you.

977
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:05,170
But your hearts aren't impure like theirs.

978
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:06,630
Retreat now!

979
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,680
If you promise not to get in our way,

980
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,430
I will let you go.

981
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,430
That means,

982
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,600
"Just shut up and watch
as this country breaks apart," right?

983
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,190
In that case…

984
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,690
We would not retreat even if it kills us!

985
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,530
Being foolish is… pitiful.

986
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:34,160
Ice Wedge Magic: World End Church.

987
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,340
And here you thought you could beat me
with this level of magical power.

988
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,590
My mana zone allows me

989
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,350
to lower the temperature
of a space to below freezing!

990
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:01,060
Amateurs won't be able
to even breathe in this space!

991
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:07,480
Move…

992
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:09,110
I don't understand.

993
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:12,490
You were also oppressed by this world.

994
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:15,490
Why do you reject our ideas?!

995
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,240
Don't underestimate us…

996
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,500
Everyone's giving their all to survive.

997
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,460
Even if it's hard, they're not giving up!

998
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:30,010
You have no right to take away
the lives of people like that!

999
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:33,430
Indeed.

1000
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:37,140
No one has the right to do so.

1001
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,850
And that's why I must do what I must.

1002
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,440
In order to create a world
where those without magic

1003
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,320
and outsiders can smile as they live!

1004
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,530
But that doesn't justify--

1005
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:52,860
Being weak is also pitiful.

1006
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:59,750
Legion Magic: Blink Castling.

1007
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:09,380
It's useless. You will never reach me.

1008
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,640
Go to sleep.

1009
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:17,640
I refuse.

1010
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,640
I just need to burn everything down.

1011
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,850
Mana Zone…

1012
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:24,940
Full Release!

1013
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,900
Flame Magic…

1014
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:30,190
Calidos Brachium…

1015
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:32,860
Purgatory!

1016
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,410
Now!

1017
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:43,540
Time to play!

1018
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:58,550
Your name was Mereoleona, was it?

1019
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,890
You made me use my fist.

1020
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:05,810
You are very interesting.

1021
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:23,080
It's not often
that I get to use this on someone.

1022
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:26,210
Very good, Mereoleona.

1023
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,330
I will admit it.

1024
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,840
You are strong!

1025
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:34,130
But not as strong as me!

1026
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,140
What are we going to do, Yuno?

1027
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,720
At this rate,
Yami and the others won't last.

1028
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,680
I know!

1029
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:52,400
Captain Nozel!

1030
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,610
Yuno, don't try to do something you can't.

1031
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:00,530
You are strong.

1032
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,790
Try and face
what you are capable of right now.

1033
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,120
Don't worry about us.

1034
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:20,300
Please buy me a little more time!

1035
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:25,560
I'll finish him with the next blow!

1036
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,480
Hey, hey, beardy macho man!

1037
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:37,900
Did you run out of energy at the start?

1038
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,200
Your taste in nicknames is horrible!

1039
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,120
No matter how you look at it,

1040
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,790
I'm obviously more of
a "cute and girly" kind of macho!

1041
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,240
Don't you know any other moves?

1042
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,000
This guy…

1043
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:37,000
He's pouring all his magical power
into this blow!

1044
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,060
You powered your way through after all.

1045
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:51,390
A rather unrefined move, Pretty Boy!

1046
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:05,660
Aren't you interesting?!

1047
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:26,010
So you've been protecting
this land all these years…

1048
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,310
Lemiel.

1049
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,730
The world you envisioned,

1050
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:36,150
I will make it come true.

1051
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,490
Conrad!

1052
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:46,030
So you've arrived, Asta!

1053
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:51,120
You were a little too late, Asta.

1054
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,870
This is…

1055
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:55,870
Stop!

1056
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,380
…the end.

1057
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:10,220
And a new beginning for this world!

1058
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,170
Give up, Asta.

1059
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,920
I drove the magic of the Imperial Sword
into the singular point.

1060
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,760
No one can stop
the destruction of this kingdom!

1061
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,770
Not yet!

1062
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,940
I'll pull that sword out
and kick your butt!

1063
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,310
I'm really persistent.

1064
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,150
If I decide to do something,
I'll do it even if it kills me!

1065
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:05,440
It's you who should give up!

1066
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:09,780
Then you understand me, Asta.

1067
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:17,210
-Never giving up is my magic!
-Never giving up is my magic!

1068
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,720
If someone like you had been around me,

1069
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,970
then my loneliness
may not have been as bad,

1070
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,720
Mereoleona.

1071
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,360
Hey.

1072
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,110
The battle…

1073
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,700
is not over yet!

1074
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:58,330
Impossible!

1075
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,620
Her power increased?!

1076
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,370
You!

1077
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,380
How can you still move?

1078
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:07,300
Ugh, Big-sis-leon.

1079
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:08,970
What's up! Lady Mereoleona!

1080
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,130
Good morning, big sister!

1081
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,430
Good morning, Lady Mereoleona!

1082
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:15,680
Big sister!

1083
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:21,940
It's my grit!

1084
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,900
Also,

1085
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,570
if I kick the bucket in a place like this,

1086
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,320
they'll surely laugh at me!

1087
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,970
And one more thing!

1088
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:55,260
Unless I stay the strongest,

1089
01:20:56,390 --> 01:21:01,060
I won't be able to call
a certain someone "my rival"!

1090
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,020
Drawing strength from your comrades…

1091
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,820
That sure is a trick I'll never learn.

1092
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,400
However…

1093
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,580
Well done, Mereoleona.

1094
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,080
To think that I'd lose in a fist fight.

1095
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,420
You just might be

1096
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:27,880
strong enough to fight me
when I go all out!

1097
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:33,050
Oh man, you're really strong.

1098
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,590
You even made me use my trump card.

1099
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:39,100
Had I met you when I was the Wizard King,

1100
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,850
I might have made you my advisers.

1101
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,100
Maybe!

1102
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:48,940
You are wrong!

1103
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:51,860
Don't give me that crap.

1104
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:57,870
No one knows
what's right and what's wrong!

1105
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,240
We're the same as you!

1106
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:06,120
Conrad and I, we fight for our beliefs!

1107
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,500
I get that!

1108
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,720
In a fight like this,
there's no right or wrong!

1109
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:17,390
But to protect what matters to us…

1110
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,390
we both plant our feet and fight!

1111
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:22,970
Combo Spell…

1112
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,940
Dimension Slash!

1113
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,730
Scorching Light!

1114
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:41,910
I won't lose…

1115
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:45,790
I won't lose to something like this!

1116
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,540
That's too bad!

1117
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:50,130
Asta, I'm borrowing your skill!

1118
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:54,800
I hate losing more than anything too!

1119
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,320
Whatever.

1120
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:17,070
I don't care about preserving
magical powers for the fortress anymore.

1121
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:23,830
I'll use all my power to crush you all!

1122
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,420
Reconsider, Asta.

1123
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,840
This crazy world is not worth protecting.

1124
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,600
Let's build a new world together!

1125
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:50,770
I don't care about your new world!

1126
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,360
My dream is to become the Wizard King!

1127
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,860
Nonsense.

1128
01:23:56,690 --> 01:24:00,070
Becoming a Wizard King in this world
will change nothing.

1129
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,950
That's right.

1130
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:04,240
Nothing…

1131
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:46,080
All routes are shut down.

1132
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,910
Your sword will never reach me.

1133
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,170
No matter how you struggle,

1134
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,500
this is your limit.

1135
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,420
I'll say it one last time.

1136
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,840
Come with us, Asta.

1137
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,390
You can be my successor.

1138
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,470
Become the Wizard King in the new world.

1139
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,440
Not in a million years!

1140
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,690
Someone can't turn you
into the Wizard King.

1141
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:23,320
You become one on your own merits!

1142
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,280
And there is a way!

1143
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,370
If there isn't,

1144
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,660
I'll make one!

1145
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:42,050
I've always been told
to surpass my limits!

1146
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:51,720
That was a good hit.

1147
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,560
So I didn't parry and took it.

1148
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,980
Along with your ambition.

1149
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:02,570
But playtime is over, Asta.

1150
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,740
If we can't walk the same path together,

1151
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:08,320
then there is no point
in holding back anymore.

1152
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:09,780
Asta.

1153
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:15,830
The biggest reason I asked you to join us
is not because of your power.

1154
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,670
Nor is it because
you were in the same boat as me.

1155
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:23,720
I wanted you,
who has the same ambition as me,

1156
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,760
to be rewarded!

1157
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:30,560
But I was not able
to open your eyes to the truth.

1158
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,350
How regrettable…

1159
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,640
I'm neutralizing him with my Anti-Magic,

1160
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,650
but I can't keep up!

1161
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:24,480
Now!

1162
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,530
I've been waiting

1163
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:33,530
for the moment you'd take it easy
and drop your guard!

1164
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,040
Exploding Fireball!

1165
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,750
From there, Flame Bondage Formation!

1166
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:44,920
Full Reflection!

1167
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,100
Ice Wedge Magic…

1168
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,640
World End Martyr!

1169
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,570
This is what…

1170
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,860
"taking it easy" means!

1171
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:15,700
You learn something new every day,
don't you, young one?

1172
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,710
Thanks for nothing, old fart!

1173
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:21,460
Hurry up, Asta!

1174
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,340
Our magic won't last much longer!

1175
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,340
Black Hurricane!

1176
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:33,090
It's admirable how you can
keep your spirits up,

1177
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:35,350
but your movements are getting slow!

1178
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,100
One Horn Bull Thrust!

1179
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,490
No matter how much you struggle,

1180
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:53,490
this gap between us will never be filled!

1181
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,120
This is the power of the Wizard King!

1182
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,250
I will never…

1183
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:10,550
acknowledge a guy like you
as the Wizard King!

1184
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,140
Crap, if I let my guard down,
my Black form will become undone.

1185
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,770
I need to land a hit
with everything I've got left!

1186
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:22,100
Stop seeing your dreams
in the Wizard King!

1187
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,770
No one, not even the first Wizard King,

1188
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:28,780
has been able to bring
revolution to this kingdom.

1189
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,570
In fact, far from changing the nation,

1190
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:35,030
Julius ended up getting beaten
by the Elves in the earlier war,

1191
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:39,040
and the Clover Kingdom
almost faced its doom.

1192
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,160
They can't protect anything.
They can't change anything.

1193
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:45,670
Wizard Kings are utterly useless!

1194
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:48,170
That's not true…

1195
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:56,050
The current Wizard King protected
all the citizens in exchange for his life!

1196
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:58,300
Same with the first Wizard King!

1197
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:01,680
He protected everyone
at the expense of his life,

1198
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:03,940
and even after that,
for hundreds of years,

1199
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,810
he kept on sleeping

1200
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:11,980
so he could help us and this country!

1201
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:22,200
Clover leaves each represent
faith, hope, and love.

1202
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,870
Within the fourth leaf dwells good luck.

1203
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,290
In the fifth leaf resides the devil.

1204
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,010
Is he about to die again?

1205
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:38,640
Man, what a piece of work.

1206
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,850
I guess I'll get the payment
in a lump sum later.

1207
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,060
You became the Wizard King

1208
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:52,110
because a lot of people acknowledged you,
didn't you?

1209
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:56,240
Betraying those people
makes you unfit to be one!

1210
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,950
I won't acknowledge you!

1211
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:05,040
Wizard Kings inspire people!

1212
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:09,000
They can be someone's hopes and dreams!

1213
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,130
They are not useless at all!

1214
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:17,510
You don't understand
the true nature of this country yet.

1215
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:21,600
The discrimination and prejudice
rampant in this country

1216
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:25,270
have crushed people's dreams
and hopes again and again!

1217
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:29,650
Unless we make a fundamental change,
this country will not change!

1218
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:32,690
That's not for you to decide!

1219
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:34,480
Right now,

1220
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:37,570
regardless of their social status,
everyone from peasants to royals

1221
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:41,320
is working hard together
to make this a better country!

1222
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:43,660
So don't get in our way!

1223
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:46,910
A country cannot change
with such simple measures!

1224
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,500
Don't get in my way!

1225
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,550
What the hell?
I'm not sure what's going on,

1226
01:31:57,630 --> 01:32:00,970
but I feel like
I finally got to talk to the real you.

1227
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,300
Shut up.

1228
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:09,230
I'm no longer interested in listening to
pipe dreams from a kid who knows nothing!

1229
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:17,110
Crap! My Black form is coming undone!

1230
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:20,610
True, there was a time
when I trusted the country and its people

1231
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:25,870
and tried to bring changes
to the Clover Kingdom as the Wizard King.

1232
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:28,620
But people betray you.

1233
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:31,120
You must know what that's like.

1234
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:35,250
Just because a small portion
of your community changed,

1235
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,510
do you seriously think
that a whole country will change?

1236
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:41,840
It's not that they change.

1237
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,510
It's that we bring change together!

1238
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,260
The world you're trying to create

1239
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:50,850
is an egotistical world
where you're the only one who's laughing!

1240
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:54,770
I want to laugh with everyone.
I want to become happy with everyone!

1241
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:59,900
I will change this country with everyone!

1242
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:02,240
A country where everyone who lives there

1243
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,490
respects each other
and laughs with one another!

1244
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:09,500
That's what I'm going to create!

1245
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:22,680
My magic is back!

1246
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:27,390
Noelle!

1247
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:35,310
Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Armor!

1248
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,060
Yeah!

1249
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:38,480
What a futile struggle.

1250
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:42,650
You defying us only pushes us
away from an ideal world!

1251
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,860
Why can't you see that?!

1252
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,080
An ideal world

1253
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,660
isn't something that's forced upon you.

1254
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,170
It's something you earn yourself!

1255
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:56,920
Noelle! Look at me!

1256
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:00,340
Mirror Magic…

1257
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:02,670
Mirror Brigade!

1258
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:08,350
I used to resent this world as well.

1259
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:11,520
I couldn't learn to control
my magical powers

1260
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,520
and was abandoned by my family.

1261
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,730
I thought I was alone in the world.

1262
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,650
But I now have friends

1263
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:24,280
who make me feel I belong!

1264
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,700
They accept me with my shortcomings,

1265
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:32,500
and they stay right beside me
as we move forward!

1266
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,120
Combo Spell…

1267
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,630
Mirror Meteo…

1268
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:41,750
Dragon!

1269
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,510
Magic Conversion!

1270
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:49,600
Ice to Water!

1271
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:52,390
Right here, right now…

1272
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,390
Fate Manipulation…

1273
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,770
Absolute Evasion!

1274
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:59,560
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

1275
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:03,150
I will surpass my limits!

1276
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:08,280
Jeez.

1277
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,910
Just go already!

1278
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:12,160
Leave it to me!

1279
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:18,420
The world can be changed.

1280
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,710
Fate can be manipulated!

1281
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:25,880
I will not let you destroy

1282
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:32,680
even the possibility of it!

1283
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,910
How about that?

1284
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:54,660
If that's not enough for you,
then I can do this all day.

1285
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,080
But…

1286
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,540
Start over with us, together.

1287
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,460
I don't mean to boast,

1288
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:09,800
but I can't do anything
without everyone's help!

1289
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:13,010
I nearly died many times,

1290
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,600
but I was able to come this far
with their help!

1291
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,850
Shut up!

1292
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:24,900
I want to create a world where everyone
can laugh together in a way

1293
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:27,490
that everyone can accept.

1294
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:32,320
If you have to kill
a lot of people to create it,

1295
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:35,580
no one will accept that!

1296
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:08,530
You… What is your name?

1297
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:11,030
Noelle. Noelle Silva.

1298
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:13,530
From the royal house of Silva…

1299
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:15,320
I see.

1300
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:18,200
You're a good girl, Noelle.

1301
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,960
You're a royal, and yet
you can empathize with the weak.

1302
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:27,550
If a person like you exists,
then surely this world…

1303
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:32,550
Hey, hey, hey…

1304
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:36,300
Are you serious, Conrad?

1305
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:40,810
I can still fight!

1306
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,350
Me too.

1307
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:48,230
But it looks like
it's my turn to go to sleep.

1308
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:51,690
It was a lot of fun.

1309
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,490
I did it…

1310
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:59,030
I did it!

1311
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:00,450
Everyone!

1312
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,910
Not… yet…

1313
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,710
Not yet…

1314
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:15,970
It's a forbidden spell
that's activated in exchange for my life.

1315
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:19,510
Doom's Gate.

1316
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:31,400
I will not give up.

1317
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,490
I will not give up, Asta.

1318
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,380
I will… not give up either.

1319
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:56,380
I'm going to be the Wizard King.

1320
01:38:57,430 --> 01:39:01,640
In order to be the Wizard King…

1321
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,390
I am!

1322
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:08,230
Right here!

1323
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,900
Asta!

1324
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:18,780
Asta, take this.

1325
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,200
The Wizard King!

1326
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:25,160
You won't need an explanation.

1327
01:39:25,870 --> 01:39:27,670
That sword will show you.

1328
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,000
The future of this nation…

1329
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:30,920
The space…

1330
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,000
…is in your hands.

1331
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:39,090
I feel it.

1332
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:42,640
This is everyone's power!

1333
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,100
Their hopes and dreams!

1334
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:50,730
I feel everyone…

1335
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:53,110
everyone is there!

1336
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,700
Master Nacht, please stop it!

1337
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:03,200
You've been working non-stop
since you got back to the Clover Kingdom!

1338
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:08,160
If you give away your magical power
on top of that, you'll pass out!

1339
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:10,460
I don't mind passing out

1340
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:15,880
if that means someone
who's doing the right thing gets rewarded.

1341
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:19,930
Right here…

1342
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:21,470
Right now…

1343
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:23,800
Let's all…

1344
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:30,060
surpass our limits.

1345
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:35,730
The Imperial Sword?

1346
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,530
What is going on?

1347
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:43,990
Go, Asta!

1348
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:04,090
With this…

1349
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,780
You bastard, how badly
do you want to destroy this country?!

1350
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:20,820
Oh, you have no idea!

1351
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,280
It needs to be destroyed!

1352
01:41:23,070 --> 01:41:25,120
This nation is rotten to its core.

1353
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:29,160
The very foundation of it
needs to be destroyed.

1354
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:34,040
I have to save everyone. I must!

1355
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:39,340
Who exactly do you mean by "everyone"?!

1356
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:43,130
All those who are unreasonably oppressed!

1357
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:45,510
For their sake, I…

1358
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:58,570
I will…

1359
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:01,400
I will…

1360
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:08,080
Even if you're a peasant
or don't have magical power,

1361
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,580
you can be stronger
than anyone else in the world.

1362
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:14,080
You can be everyone's hope!

1363
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,500
And to prove it…

1364
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:22,670
I am going to be

1365
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,840
the Wizard King!

1366
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:54,960
Did I… lose?

1367
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:58,790
Then why…

1368
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,090
why do I feel so at ease?

1369
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:10,010
Now I see it.

1370
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:14,270
Asta. Become the Wizard King.

1371
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:20,900
Share that warm world of yours
with every citizen in this nation.

1372
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,900
Never giving up is your magic.

1373
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:26,570
I know you can…

1374
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:31,330
You all…

1375
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,840
I see.

1376
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:09,240
Cheerful and honest,

1377
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:12,870
he knew how to empathize with the peasant.

1378
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:18,290
Conrad used to be
a strong, kind man like Asta.

1379
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:22,080
But he was framed by the royalists,

1380
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:25,380
and ever since his squad
and his wife were slaughtered,

1381
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,590
he changed.

1382
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:31,050
Asta.

1383
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:32,890
Thank you for stopping him.

1384
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:38,930
Why was I able to use
the Imperial Sword at the end?

1385
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,890
What do you mean?

1386
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:43,400
When I hit the Imperial Sword
with my Demon-Slayer Sword,

1387
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,110
the magic of the Imperial Sword
must've been neutralized.

1388
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:48,190
So I was wondering…

1389
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:52,070
Well, that's because…

1390
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,580
Generations of Wizard Kings…

1391
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:05,590
…generations of Wizard Kings
lent you their miraculous power.

1392
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:08,920
Wow, that sounds so cool!

1393
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:11,340
Silly, he's teasing you.

1394
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:12,720
That's not true!

1395
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,140
Generations of Wizard Kings.

1396
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:19,560
The clovers responsible for the future
of this kingdom are growing up nicely.

1397
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:22,480
-You making fun of Prince Lemiel?
-How about it, Asta?

1398
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:25,150
The Wizard King is incredible, right?

1399
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:26,400
I knew that, sir!

1400
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,480
And one day,
I'll be that incredible myself.

1401
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:31,610
I will become the Wizard King!

1402
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:32,850
Don't you be slacking here.

1403
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:35,230
I worked my butt off, you know?!

1404
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:41,030
The place was a total shambles,

1405
01:49:41,110 --> 01:49:44,110
but it looks like things might be
restored sooner than I thought.

1406
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,240
Yeah.

1407
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,750
Conrad was the Wizard King, too, huh?

1408
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:55,330
Ouch!

1409
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,340
Not a chance.

1410
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:00,460
You're right!

1411
01:50:02,130 --> 01:50:04,260
I'm going to be the Wizard King, anyway.

1412
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:05,680
No, I will!

1413
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,260
I'm going to be the Wizard King!

1414
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:09,930
-Can't hear you.
-Don't ignore me!

1415
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,640
Wanna go?

1416
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:13,730
The Triumph was canceled,

1417
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:16,770
but you and me gotta settle this match!

1418
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:19,270
Not a chance.

1419
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:29,580
I'm going to be the Wizard King!
