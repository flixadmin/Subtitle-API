1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,120
Barbara?

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,600
Sweet crib.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,400
You must be one rich cop.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
It's my girlfriend's place.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,840
Where is she?

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,920
I don't know. Barbara?

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
So... What?

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,920
I get to stay here alone?

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
I'm hungry.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>Dear Jim, I thought I could be strong
and brave for you, but I can't.</i>

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,680
<i>Every place I go,
I see Falcone and Zsasz.</i>

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,320
<i>I'm nervous and needy and screwed up</i>

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,560
<i>and I know that's not
what you need or want,</i>

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
<i>so I'm going away for a while,
to get myself together.</i>

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,960
This is Gordon.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Right. Yeah.

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,840
We're in the penthouse. Come on up.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,800
Sounds like your girlfriend's
not coming back, huh?

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,720
Why's she worried about Falcone?

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,120
None of your business.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,600
So, what happens now?

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,360
You gonna get the charges
against me dropped?

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,800
I will, but you're my only witness
to the Wayne murders.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
You gonna cuff me
to a drainpipe again?

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,640
No, I'm not gonna hold you
against your will.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,640
GCPD, juvie, you'd just break out.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,600
So I do get to stay here.

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,600
No, I have someplace else in mind.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,280
That's the sketch artist.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,320
I need you to describe
the man who shot the Waynes.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,200
- Wait, where am I going to stay?
- Wayne manor.

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,040
Do not speak to the inmate.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,240
Do not touch the inmate unless
in the service of your job.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
Do not accept anything from
the inmate under any circumstances.

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,640
Who is this guy, anyway?

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,240
Name's Ian Hargrove,
some genius bomb maker.

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,520
Took out over a dozen buildings
in and around Gotham.

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,080
He's the one that blew up
the commissary last month?

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,320
Yeah, and he did it
with match shavings

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,480
and apple cider vinegar.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,320
So no mistakes today, got it?

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,320
Put your hands up.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,760
She said this is the man
who killed your parents.

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,520
She said she saw his face.

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,360
Do you recognize him, Bruce?

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
No.

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,120
- What's her name?
- Selina Kyle.

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,720
Do you believe her?

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Yes, I do.

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
So, she saw...

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Everything?

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
And you want her to live here
with us, do you?

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
A common street criminal.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,440
She's hardly older than Bruce.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,200
She's just a kid who's seen too much.

56
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,440
This is for her safety.

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,760
GCPD is full of moles...

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,040
Right, and how long
would you have us put her up, then?

59
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,480
I don't know.

60
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
No. The answer is no.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,480
Her being here will put Master Bruce
in great danger.

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
Alfred.

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,680
She is the witness
to a murder, Master Bruce.

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,000
You do understand that, don't you?

65
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,720
She's also the best chance we have
of finding who killed my parents.

66
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,080
Isn't she?

67
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,240
Yes, she is.

68
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Then she can stay.

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,240
As long as it takes.

70
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,720
I've made my decision.

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,400
Yes, Master Bruce.

72
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,120
Look, I know this is a lot.

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
But I'm doing everything I can.

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
Montoya and Allen and I
are meeting with an ADA

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
they trust this afternoon.

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,280
A trustworthy lawyer.

77
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
In Gotham.

78
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,440
Look, if we find this guy,
we'll need her.

79
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,680
She'll have to testify.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,440
Go before a judge. It won't be easy.

81
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,160
Witnesses back out all the time.

82
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,080
The ones that stick it out do so
because they care about the victims.

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
We'll do our best to be nice to her,
then, won't we?

84
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,520
It's from the Chinese Ming Dynasty.

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Five...

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
Five hundred years old.

87
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,600
You can get one just like it
for five bucks, in Chinatown.

88
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,080
I'm Bruce Wayne.

89
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,640
Selina Kyle.

90
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,800
People call me Cat.

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,000
Nice to meet you, Cat.

92
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
What are you doing?

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,440
Nothing.

94
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,560
What's in your hand?

95
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
I said, what's in...

96
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
What the hell...

97
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,480
Hargrove!

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,520
Ian Hargrove, time to go.

99
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
Kid, you screwed up, big-time.

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,480
{\an5}But you're still young,
you deserve a second chance.

101
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,920
So I have a bet for you.

102
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,400
{\an5}You call heads or tails.

103
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,600
{\an5}You lose, you go to jail.

104
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,880
You win, we let you go.

105
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,600
{\an5}- Bet.
- Hold on.

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,640
{\an5}There's a catch.

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,400
You have to make a promise
to God right now.

108
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,600
{\an5}If you win, you're gonna
take this as a sign from him

109
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,240
{\an5}telling you that you need
to go back to school

110
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,160
{\an5}and get your life straight.

111
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,560
Can you promise that?

112
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
Do you promise that?

113
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,440
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,320
Okay, then.

115
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,840
- Call.
- Heads.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
Walk away, kid.

117
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,920
Somebody up there loves you.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Hey, Harvey.

119
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,560
{\an5}Go. Remember your promise.

120
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,640
{\an5}Jim Gordon, GCPD.

121
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,200
{\an5}I hear good things
about you, counselor.

122
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,520
{\an5}Harvey Dent, likewise
about you, detective.

123
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,520
That was some trick with the coin.

124
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,000
What if the kid guesses wrong?

125
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,280
You gonna send him to jail?

126
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,960
{\an5}Teenagers,
they nearly always call heads.

127
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
{\an5}I don't know why.

128
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,000
Two-headed coin.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,680
Whatever works, right?

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,560
So who is he, Jim?

131
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
Who really killed the Waynes?

132
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,840
{\an5}Well, this is what we have.

133
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,800
{\an5}No ID.

134
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,520
{\an5}But this is from an eyewitness?

135
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,760
{\an5}That you have in safe custody.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,280
{\an5}It's not nearly enough
to go to the law with.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,760
{\an5}Even if we had ID on this guy,

138
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
{\an5}it's the people who hired him
we really want.

139
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,600
{\an5}I agree.

140
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,520
{\an5}Your eyewitness is useless
in a courtroom.

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,080
{\an5}But the idea of your witness
could be immensely valuable.

142
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,240
Ever hear the name, Dick Lovecraft?

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,160
{\an5}Sure. Billionaire.

144
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
{\an5}Property, construction, chemicals.

145
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,960
{\an5}And as corrupt as they come.

146
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,520
{\an5}Falcone, Maroni,
even Wayne enterprises,

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Lovecraft has dealings
with all of them.

148
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,320
Since the Waynes' deaths,
he's doubled his fortune.

149
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,200
Including a huge piece
of the Arkham deal.

150
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,720
{\an5}Lovecraft had a long feud
with Thomas Wayne

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,200
{\an5}over deals and politics.

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,360
They couldn't have had a more
different vision for Gotham.

153
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,080
I'm willing to bet my career

154
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,640
on his involvement
in the Wayne murders.

155
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,800
That's a big bet.

156
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,520
I want to use your witness
To go after Lovecraft.

157
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,440
{\an5}How? My witness can't connect
Lovecraft to the perp.

158
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,680
{\an5}Lovecraft doesn't know that.

159
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,440
I'll let it leak out.

160
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,040
{\an5}That we have a secret eyewitness

161
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,920
{\an5}who's going to blow
the case wide open

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,160
{\an5}and connect Lovecraft
to the Wayne killings.

163
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

164
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,040
And the people around him
will get nervous.

165
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,520
{\an5}And that's when people start talking,
you know how that goes.

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
{\an5}Unless Lovecraft wasn't involved
in the Wayne murders.

167
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,160
If so, which I doubt, we still win.

168
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,040
Whoever was involved
in the Wayne killings

169
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,840
will get their cage rattled
like the dickens, won't they?

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,600
- I bet he makes a move.
- You like to bet a lot.

171
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,880
{\an5}Well, what do we got to lose?

172
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,320
My witness becomes a target.

173
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,160
{\an5}No. That's the beauty of it.

174
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,480
{\an5}We never actually file papers.

175
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,680
{\an5}We never name names.

176
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
{\an5}It's just a powerful story.

177
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,240
Your witness is perfectly safe.

178
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,640
And you're on board with this?

179
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,920
We've been on board, Jim.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,960
Harvey's one of us.

181
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,360
I want what you want, Jim.

182
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,960
{\an5}I want to make this city
a better place.

183
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,560
No names.

184
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,520
Not mine, not my witness,
nothing, just a story.

185
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Just a story.

186
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,800
All right.

187
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,920
Let's try something.

188
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,600
Hey, I thought I was gonna have
to work this case without you.

189
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,400
Where the hell have you been?
You know what?

190
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,080
On second thought, never mind,
I don't want to know.

191
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,400
- What do we got?
- A biggie.

192
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,560
Blackgate prisoner escaped

193
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,920
while in transit to St. Mark's
for psychiatric care.

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,480
His name's Ian Hargrove,
clinically insane,

195
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
with a compulsion
for blowing things up.

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,840
He exploded a bunch
of old buildings around Gotham.

197
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,360
Last one, two janitors were killed.

198
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,480
Says here he was busted out
by four gunmen?

199
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,320
Yeah, which is odd,
Hargrove never used accomplices.

200
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,800
All right, so who did Hargrove
spend time with at Blackgate?

201
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,320
Who did he communicate
with on the outside?

202
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,000
His entire stretch,
he was isolated from gen pop.

203
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,440
Never made or received phone calls.

204
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,880
Only one visitor in those two years,
his brother John.

205
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,880
- Got an address?
- We do.

206
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Unis are bringing him
in right now for questioning.

207
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,360
We're lucky you deigned to show up.

208
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,800
Yeah, sorry.

209
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,720
No problem.

210
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,360
- Girl trouble?
- Yeah.

211
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,360
I told you. Those high society dames,
get you all twisted.

212
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,720
Keep your guard up.
Knock lumps out of you.

213
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,960
Watch your feet.

214
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,400
Right. Jab, jab, right.

215
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
- Lead with the...
- Hey!

216
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,680
Jab, jab, right.

217
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,480
Keep that guard up, jab, jab, right.

218
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,960
Lead, Jab, jab, right.

219
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,400
Jab, jab, right.

220
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,840
Now keep that...

221
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,160
Yes.

222
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,400
Sorry, Alfred.

223
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,560
- Hello.
- Bruce.

224
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,920
- That hurt.
- Yeah, it's supposed to, isn't it?

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,320
Taking a punch is just as important
as throwing one, Master Bruce.

226
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,880
- What you doing?
- Alfred's teaching me to fight.

227
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
Why?

228
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,480
So I'll be prepared
if something bad happens.

229
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,200
Yeah, 'cause you live
in a pretty rough neighborhood.

230
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,560
Not here, in Gotham.

231
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,520
In Gotham, people don't fight
with gloves on.

232
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,600
How's your room? Everything good?

233
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,280
It'll do. I'm hungry, though.

234
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,160
Right. Well, breakfast
was served at 8.00, miss,

235
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,720
which you slept through.

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,080
Lunch shall be served at 12.00.

237
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,920
There's plenty to eat in the kitchen
and Alfred will be happy

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,280
- to fix you something.
- No, he won't be, will he?

239
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,080
Because it's not a bloody hotel.

240
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,200
Relax, old man. I'll figure it out.

241
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,560
Yeah, you can mind
your manners as well,

242
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,280
you cheeky little minx.

243
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,520
Be nice to her, Alfred,
she's our guest.

244
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,920
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
Master Bruce.

245
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,120
Didn't realize you fancied her.

246
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,320
What do you mean? No.

247
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,840
Well, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

248
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,160
It's only natural, isn't it?

249
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,000
But you watch her.

250
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,040
She's a lairy one.

251
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,760
Right. Left, left, right.

252
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,400
keep your guard up, son.

253
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,400
You know about girls, do you, Alfred?

254
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,600
Fair sight more than you.

255
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,200
And she, mate, is trouble watch.

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
Liza, Liza...

257
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,440
What are you up to?

258
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,840
Lilacs.

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,440
I'm telling you, I don't know
anything about his escape.

260
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,360
- I haven't talked to him.
- Your own baby brother

261
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
busts out of prison
and doesn't call you,

262
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,240
The only person
he's talked to in two years?

263
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,240
What happened?
You two have a falling out?

264
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,920
No, Ian and I are close.
Always have been.

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Even after he bombed those janitors?

266
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
That was an accident.

267
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,120
That's what they all say.

268
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
It's the truth.

269
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,880
My brother's not a killer.

270
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,000
He never was.

271
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,640
He blew up 12 buildings in Gotham.

272
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,680
Yes, Munitions factories
and their offices.

273
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,360
Places that made guns
and bullets and missiles.

274
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,120
I know he was wrong,

275
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,800
but Ian thought that
what he was doing was good.

276
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,400
He didn't hurt a soul
until the last bombing.

277
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,200
And he felt terrible about it.

278
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,520
He practically handed himself
into the cops and pleaded guilty.

279
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,640
Ian has had mental problems
ever since he was a kid.

280
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,600
My parents didn't have the money
to get him the help he needed.

281
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,880
And he sure as hell
wasn't getting it at Blackgate.

282
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,240
Look...

283
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,720
My brother's not a bad man.

284
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,760
Then what is he?

285
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,240
He's sick.

286
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,040
There's a difference.

287
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Okay.

288
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,640
So who would want to bust him out?

289
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,080
I don't know.

290
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,520
But my brother needs help.

291
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,640
You have to find him.

292
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,440
It's done.

293
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,920
I have a delivery for you.

294
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,280
I'll take that.

295
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,400
Who sent this, anyway?

296
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,560
Who cares?

297
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,120
Wait a second.

298
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,520
You hear that?

299
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,960
Sounds like ticking.

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Good morning.

301
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,240
- How'd you sleep?
- Your house makes noise.

302
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,480
It's old.

303
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
You didn't come here with much.

304
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
If you want,
Alfred can buy you some clothes.

305
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Pass.

306
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,560
Detective Gordon told me
you live on the streets.

307
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah. So?

308
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,800
What's it like?

309
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,240
Not as nice as here.

310
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Do you live alone?

311
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,960
Are you going to ask me questions
all morning?

312
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
Aren't you supposed to be in school
or something?

313
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,960
I'm developing my own curriculum.

314
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,680
It lets me move at my own speed

315
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,360
And focus on academic areas
that interest me.

316
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,880
Why?

317
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
You're a billionaire,
what's to learn?

318
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
That's a strange attitude.

319
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
So where are your parents?

320
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,120
They alive?

321
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,560
Sure. They're around.

322
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,320
Where?

323
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,280
- What's that to you?
- Nothing, I just thought...

324
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,040
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

325
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm not an orphan.

326
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,240
I got family all over.

327
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,360
This was bad enough
when it was just a prison escape.

328
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,480
Now we've got five dead
security guards,

329
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,360
and the press is calling Hargrove
an urban terrorist.

330
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,160
Did you get anything
from the bombing site?

331
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,760
Forensics is still looking into it
but the entire office was destroyed.

332
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,520
Including all security footage.

333
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,680
Yeah.

334
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,200
We do know that Hargrove
and his guys made off

335
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,200
with a compound called HMX.

336
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,520
It's military-grade.

337
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,360
Ten times more powerful than C-4.

338
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,560
Nasty stuff.

339
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
Using explosives to steal explosives.

340
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,560
What's that about?

341
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,520
Trading up?

342
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,920
He must have another target in mind.
Someplace difficult to crack.

343
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,280
You know what I'm gonna say.

344
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,280
So, go, do it.

345
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,400
- This is Gordon.
- <i>Yes, detective.</i>

346
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,440
<i>It's Alfred.</i>

347
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,040
Alfred, is everything all right?

348
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
<i>Is Selina okay?</i>

349
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,160
Well, she's safe.

350
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,840
- But?
- But I'm afraid,

351
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,040
detective, this isn't gonna work out.

352
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,000
She's a, a tough nut, this one.

353
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,560
Well, look, we need her help

354
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,160
if we have any chance
of catching the Waynes' killer.

355
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,440
Just hold onto her for now
and I'll be out to check on her

356
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,640
<i>as soon as I can.</i>

357
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,320
We shall patiently await
your arrival, Detective.

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
- Everything good?
- Right as rain.

359
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,000
You sure you want to go
through with this?

360
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Butch, don't you go
getting scared on me now.

361
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
Never, boss.

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Oswald, you're back.

363
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,360
I'm starting to think
you enjoy being hurt.

364
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
I was passing by.

365
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Thought I'd say hello.

366
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,320
Well, you said it.

367
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,400
Now why are you here?

368
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,440
Honestly, I'm just trying
to be friendly.

369
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,000
Lilacs.

370
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,840
You smell good.

371
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,080
You don't.

372
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,040
Snappy as ever.

373
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,080
Well, good-bye then.

374
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,880
Sorry, you're still grumpy with me.

375
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,800
But, you know,

376
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,160
reaching out in friendship
is never wrong.

377
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
Man, that dude's creepy.

378
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,400
Forget him.

379
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,600
He's nothing.

380
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,440
Hargrove's contacts and phone records
from before he went to Blackgate.

381
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Yeah.

382
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,920
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

383
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,160
Barbara left.

384
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
- Left, left?
- Yeah.

385
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,920
Where'd she go?

386
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
I don't know.

387
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,440
It's a ploy.

388
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,720
She wants you to set a date.

389
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,040
It's a standard move. She'll be back.

390
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,360
Do you play video games?

391
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,320
Ed, don't ever do that again.

392
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,440
My apologies, detective.

393
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,160
Do either of you play video games?

394
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,920
I do, I... I love video games.

395
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,080
I find that each one presents
a new challenge, a puzzle.

396
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
It's a lot like detective work
in that way.

397
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,400
- Ed.
- Oh, sorry.

398
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,840
I had a chance
to analyze the shrapnel

399
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,240
from the security office.

400
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,560
And I found something.

401
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,880
It's a nameplate.
It was damaged in the bombing.

402
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,000
But you can still
read the information.

403
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,800
It's from an abandoned metal factory
here in Gotham.

404
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,160
That's really good work, Ed. Thanks.

405
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,760
Thank you, detective.

406
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,200
Let's go check this out.

407
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
GCPD!

408
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,120
Freeze!

409
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,480
Don't shoot!

410
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,080
You found the nameplate, thank God.

411
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,640
Is anyone else here?

412
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,080
No, but they'll be back soon.

413
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,800
Please, you got to help me.

414
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,080
They broke me out of prison,
they kidnapped me, they told me.

415
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,240
They'd kill my brother
and his family if I didn't help them.

416
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,040
- Who's "they"?
- Russians.

417
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,040
One of their names is, is Kasyanov.

418
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,640
They're planning something
against Falcone.

419
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,120
- Falcone?
- Yeah.

420
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
It's a, it's a big job, a vault.

421
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,040
That's why they needed me
to build explosives.

422
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,280
What's this?

423
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,640
Behind you! Get down, get down!

424
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,920
Keep them pinned down!

425
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,280
- Get out of here.
- Help me!

426
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,920
Move, move. Come on.

427
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,080
Move.

428
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,680
Move.

429
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,120
If you want to go somewhere,
we can call you a taxi.

430
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,720
You move quiet.

431
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
So do you.

432
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,680
Are you leaving?

433
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,160
Thinking about it.

434
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,760
I'm sorry if talking
about your family upset you.

435
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,640
I wasn't upset.

436
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,160
You seemed kind of upset.

437
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,720
That's your mom, huh?

438
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,280
She looks nice.

439
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,520
She was.

440
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,520
You saw her...

441
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,600
The night she was killed?

442
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,920
And you saw me?

443
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,600
What I did?

444
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,880
What I didn't do?

445
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,800
What are you talking about?
What could you have done?

446
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,280
I don't know, something.

447
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,000
You're dreaming, kid.

448
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,280
A gun's a gun.

449
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,240
My mom's in show business.

450
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Oh?

451
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,400
Yeah.

452
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,360
She sings and dances
and does magic tricks.

453
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,400
Gets paid, like, millions.

454
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,200
But that's just a cover.

455
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,360
Really, she's a secret agent
for the government.

456
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,960
Wow.

457
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,400
Yeah.

458
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
She's on a secret mission.

459
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,520
But when she's done,
she's coming back to get me.

460
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,680
That's good.

461
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,280
Yeah.

462
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,960
Did you ever kiss a girl?

463
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,920
No.

464
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,640
Do you want to?

465
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,560
Why, why do you ask?

466
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,080
Just curious.

467
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,880
Time for your studies, Master Bruce.

468
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,840
Thank you, Alfred.

469
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,680
You're more than welcome to join,
Miss Kyle.

470
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Right.

471
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,320
I'll see you later.

472
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,160
Do you have any idea
how many angry phone calls

473
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,040
we've been getting this week?

474
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,640
Got a terrorist out there.

475
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
- And that's our fault?
- Jim!

476
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,920
No, no, please.

477
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,600
You tell me, detective.

478
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,800
How is this my fault?

479
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,400
Well, for starters,

480
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,360
you have the mentally ill housed
at Blackgate,

481
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,360
a prison with no facilities for them.

482
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,800
So you send them out for treatment,

483
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,280
which was exactly where Hargrove
was headed when he was broken out.

484
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,080
- I want him found.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,320
- Today.
- Yes, sir.

486
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,600
What is wrong with you?

487
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,920
By the way, Hargrove's brother John,

488
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,680
I went ahead and put him
and his family in protective custody.

489
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,080
That'll help.

490
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,840
Yeah, only problem is,
Hargrove doesn't know that.

491
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,840
All right, Dent.

492
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,160
You dragged me down here, now what?

493
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,720
I got the last piece
of the puzzle in place.

494
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,240
I'm bringing charges against you.

495
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,600
Oh, that old song again?

496
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,200
You will never prove fraud.

497
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,680
You know that, and I know that.

498
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,720
Fraud charges are only part of it.

499
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,600
Oh, really? What, then? Jaywalking?

500
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,040
Conspiracy to commit
first-degree murder.

501
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,480
Murder? So tell me, Dent.

502
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,440
Who did I kill?

503
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

504
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,880
Oh, God.

505
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,280
I have an eyewitness
who can tie you to the crime,

506
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,880
you and all the others involved.

507
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,840
That's absurd.

508
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Help yourself out here, Dick.

509
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,560
Think about your options.

510
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,400
This is gonna get ugly.

511
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,560
You're a fool.

512
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,280
And you have no idea
who or what you're even dealing with.

513
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,000
Don't threaten me!

514
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,000
I will rip you open.

515
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
It was good to see you, Dick.

516
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Jim!

517
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
Got it.

518
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,560
Yeah?

519
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,240
Meet Gregor Kasyanov.

520
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,360
Long rap sheet.

521
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,600
Worked for Nikolai before he died.

522
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,720
Who does he work for now?

523
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
- Beats me.
- All right.

524
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,520
Hargrove said it's a big job, right?

525
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,280
A vault.
Somebody's got to be bankrolling it.

526
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,840
Yeah, someone with cash
and pull and beef with Falcone.

527
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,760
Problem is in Gotham,
anyone with cash and pull

528
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,240
has beef with Falcone.

529
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,440
So who is it?

530
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,080
You kept me waiting.

531
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,760
Ran into a little trouble.

532
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,200
Nothing to worry about.

533
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,720
Good,
I've got a lot riding on this job.

534
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,320
You've said.

535
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,720
Your boss Nikolai is dead
because of Falcone.

536
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,960
You want to get back at him,

537
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,000
you hit him where it hurts,
his money.

538
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,760
- Ain't that right, Butch?
- Yep.

539
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,480
The root of all evil.

540
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,160
We'll take his money.

541
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,640
No problem.

542
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,080
As long as it's there like you said.

543
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,040
Oh, it's there.

544
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm positive.

545
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,200
The truck you needed.

546
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,960
And Gregor...

547
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,800
break a leg.

548
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,640
You're the weirdest kid
I've ever met.

549
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,840
Why are you doing that?

550
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,080
Training.

551
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Like the boxing.

552
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,840
So if anyone mugs you
with a diving board,

553
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,000
you'll be ready, huh?

554
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,840
Yes.

555
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,760
I mean, no.

556
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
I'm developing self-discipline
and willpower.

557
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,080
Why?

558
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
So I can be strong.

559
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,800
I get you, but it won't work.

560
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,680
Not on the streets, not in Gotham.

561
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,040
- Why's that?
- Out there on the streets.

562
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,480
It's not enough to be strong.

563
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,680
You gotta be mean.

564
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,000
Gotta be ruthless.

565
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,760
- Do you know what ruthless means?
- Of course, I do.

566
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,440
Yeah? Well, you ain't.

567
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,640
You're a nice kid.

568
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,200
Five minutes on the street,
you'll be mincemeat.

569
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,880
And holding your breath
won't do a damn thing.

570
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,240
<i>The subject of today's category
is numbers.</i>

571
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320
<i>Here we go.</i>

572
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,120
<i>How many bones in the human arm?</i>

573
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,520
Thirty-two.

574
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
<i>Thirty-two.</i>

575
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,200
<i>Correct.</i>

576
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,280
<i>Next, how many elements
in the periodic table?</i>

577
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,280
One hundred eighteen.

578
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,320
<i>One hundred eighteen.</i>

579
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,120
<i>Yes, again.</i>

580
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,320
<i>Now for a tough one.</i>

581
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,560
<i>How many eyes
are there on cards in a deck?</i>

582
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,920
Forty-two.

583
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,320
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

584
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,800
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

585
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,840
<i>The number you
were looking for is 42.</i>

586
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,560
<i>You forgot to double it for two eyes.</i>

587
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,040
<i>Well, that concludes our show
for today.</i>

588
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,680
<i>We'd like to thank
all the contestants</i>

589
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,520
<i>that participated here in studio</i>

590
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,760
<i>and those of you playing
along at home.</i>

591
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,000
<i>We'll be back right after this.</i>

592
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,480
Okay.

593
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,720
What about the explosives?

594
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,040
It, it's a very specific type.

595
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,640
It's highly volatile

596
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,560
and it's very difficult
to manufacture.

597
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,920
It's for one use and one use only.

598
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
To penetrate iron.

599
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,640
Like a vault in a bank.

600
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,920
No, they're all steel.

601
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,360
No one makes anything
out of iron anymore.

602
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,640
Not for, a hundred years, at least.

603
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,240
The Gotham Armory.

604
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,080
Yeah. Yeah, they have those
iron vaults.

605
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,920
They used to keep the gunpowder in.

606
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,480
A few years ago,
a private investment group bought it.

607
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,440
Ten to one, Falcone's behind it.

608
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,080
Do you...

609
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,680
How much longer?

610
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,040
It's ready.

611
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,080
It didn't work.

612
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,160
Hey, hey.

613
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,200
Promise me nobody else
is gonna get hurt.

614
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, no problem.

615
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,160
Cross my heart.

616
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,240
You're surrounded!

617
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,600
There's no way out!

618
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,080
Drop your weapons!

619
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,080
Don't do it! Get back!

620
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,400
Hargrove!

621
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,840
Ian Hargrove!

622
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,520
Your brother and his family are safe.

623
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,880
We have them in protective custody.

624
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,480
If he runs, shoot him!

625
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,800
- Don't shoot!
- You shoot him, they shoot us!

626
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,280
Drop your weapons!

627
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,720
Get away from the truck!

628
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,040
Everybody down!

629
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,960
Why'd you do that?

630
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,120
Bet you can't hit me.

631
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,520
I could.

632
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,640
- But why would I want to?
- Try.

633
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,240
What for?

634
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,560
Hit me and...

635
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,440
I'll let you kiss me.

636
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,960
You didn't get me.

637
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,520
No!

638
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,160
<i>Morning, Alfred.</i>

639
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Detective.

640
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
I've been trying to get out there.

641
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,160
I'm sorry... Is everything okay?

642
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,560
<i>Is she behaving herself?</i>

643
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,520
Well, not really, no.

644
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,240
- That's all right.
- It is?

645
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,520
<i>Yes, well, she's...</i>

646
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,560
A breath of fresh air, I might say.

647
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,120
Glad to hear it.

648
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,320
I'll be out there
as, as soon as I can.

649
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Very good, sir.

650
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,080
Forgive me for the intrusion

651
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,520
but it's urgent
that I speak with you.

652
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,880
You know who I am.

653
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,160
Yeah.

654
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,720
And Falcone would kill you
if he knew you were here.

655
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,000
Perhaps.

656
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,280
What would he do if I told him

657
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,640
That you were spying on him
for Fish Mooney?

658
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,120
You don't have any proof.

659
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,920
No.

660
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,240
But suspicion, it's a funny thing.

661
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,920
Falcone might not choose
to believe me at first,

662
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,840
But every time he looked at you,
he'd ask himself, is she?

663
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,360
Could she?

664
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,960
Would she?

665
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,640
You're wrong.

666
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,520
He cares about me.

667
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,120
Let's call him and find out,
shall we?

668
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,040
Stop!

669
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,200
Your secret is safe with me.

670
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,720
I won't tell...

671
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,880
because you...

672
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,880
are gonna keep working for Fish.

673
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,280
And you are not going to tell anyone.

674
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,120
Or you'll die.

675
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,600
Messages for Gordon.

676
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,160
Thanks.

677
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,080
Jim. You have a minute?

678
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
Yeah.

679
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,680
I met with Lovecraft.

680
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,920
How'd it go?

681
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He was scared.
He's involved, all right.

682
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,320
- Scared isn't proof.
- You didn't see him.

683
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,840
Told the same story
in a few other spots.

684
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,800
All the big players will know by now,
someone will start talking.

685
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,200
If and when they do,

686
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,320
neither of us makes a move
without talking first.

687
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,440
- We move together on this.
- Absolutely.

688
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,360
Hey, nice work on the Hargrove case.

689
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,640
You saved the poor guy's life.

690
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
- You're a regular saint.
- Thanks.

691
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,200
We'll be talking again soon, I hope.

692
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,400
- You bet.
- Thanks, counselor.

693
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,120
Finish up with Hargrove?

694
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah.

695
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,040
He's on his way to Arkham.

696
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,880
- Arkham?
- Mayor's directive.

697
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,320
He's taking all the criminally
insane inmates from Blackgate,

698
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,840
sending them to Arkham.

699
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,520
So they can get appropriate
treatment.

700
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,880
That's nuts. Appropriate...
The building's 200 years old.

701
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,600
Welcome to Gotham.

702
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,440
Oh, and get this...
Hargrove said that the bomb

703
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,120
That blew up the money wasn't his.

704
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,720
- Whose was it?
- He didn't know.

705
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,120
How did it go?

706
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,560
Cops were everywhere.

707
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,040
Our guys had no way out.

708
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,400
I had to make the call.

709
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,680
Is everybody dead?

710
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,080
Gregor? All his men?

711
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,080
Every last one.

712
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,480
Good.

713
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,360
I can't stand loose strings.

714
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,120
You're not mad?

715
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,680
That's a hell of a lot of money
we just lost.

716
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,920
Mad?

717
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,040
I couldn't be happier.

718
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,280
The point wasn't to steal that money,
Butch.

719
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,040
It was to hurt Falcone.

720
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,360
Well, that you did, Fish.

721
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,920
That you did.

722
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,080
Good afternoon, everyone.

723
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,680
Thank you all for coming.

724
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,840
As you well know...

725
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
the people of Gotham

726
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,200
have been shaken
by tragedy in recent days.

727
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,240
Tragedy no citizen
should have to endure.

728
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,120
What has happened these past
few days is a direct result

729
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,800
of Gotham's criminally insane
not getting the appropriate treatment

730
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,360
and help that we owe them.

731
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,480
That is why I am moving forward
with plans

732
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,440
to turn the recently
renovated Arkham Aylum

733
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,280
into a remedial facility...

734
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,560
All right, let's go, here, man,
let's go.

735
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,840
...for the criminally insane.

736
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,040
Barbara, it's me.

737
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,320
I got your letter and I...

738
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:00,800
I know you said you needed some time
away from Gotham from me.

739
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,360
But I want you to come back.

740
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,160
I need you...

741
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,840
to come back.

742
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,840
I don't have anything without you.

743
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,080
And I love you.
