1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,446
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,763
That woman running around
in black leather tonight, that wasn't Sara.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,810
- It was. Who else would it be?
- That's why I'm talking to you.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,121
Who are we running from?

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,967
His name is Ra's al Ghul. And he's
marked me and my family for death.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,129
I heard a rumor you were leaving town.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,288
Happy to say that those rumors are false.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,888
Ra's is going to come for me.
And he will learn the truth about Sara.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,600
- He'll come for Thea.
- That's why I have to kill him.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,361
- You couldn't before.
- This time I will have you to train me.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,328
Dinah Laurel Lance.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,122
Selfish bitch.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,970
You're not a hero.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,802
You're a liar. A fraud.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,490
And an addict.

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,925
Sara.

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,051
Sara, please. Please. I'm your sister.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,171
Then why are you trying
to take my place? Unh!

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,202
What the hell do you think you're doing?

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,371
Your job, apparently.

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,409
- I told you that I didn't want you out here.
- And I told you that it wasn't your call to make.

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,724
Think for a second about what it would do to
your father if something happened to you.

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,247
What you're doing is selfish.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,046
Fighting for your city isn't selfish.

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,611
It's what a hero would do.

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,729
You're not a hero.

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,084
Maybe it's best if we stay
out of each other's way.

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,404
How'd it go out there?

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,928
We ran into Laurel. Again.

30
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,243
Diggle, how could you sign off
on her doing this?

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,609
You might not notice, but she's not
lobbying for anyone's permission.

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,609
- She has yours.
- Well, not at first.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,481
- But she can definitely hold her own out there.
- You have a visitor.

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,445
Or as I like to call him, your new BFF.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,809
- I see things are running smoothly down here.
- What do you want?

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,962
It's been a week since your return.
I thought it past time we spoke.

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,282
Nanda Parbat is remote.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,962
But I wouldn't delude yourself
into thinking that Ra's al Ghul missed...

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,288
...your televised return to Starling City.

40
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,771
Your point, Malcolm?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,800
We can't merely wait
for Ra's to mobilize his forces.

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,167
It's time to bring Thea into the fold.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,164
She's not ready to know my secret.

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,970
I disagree.

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,209
But in any case...

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,722
...if we are to protect Thea...

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,803
...and to defeat the League...

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,122
...the three of us need to join forces.

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,840
I don't see how we can do that
if she is to believe...

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,801
...that her brother is a reformed playboy
and failed businessman.

51
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,321
I told you before, if Thea finds out
you've been lying to her all this time...

52
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,801
...you will lose her. Forever.

53
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,607
How's Tatsu?

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,406
She'll be better when we're far away
from here. Your bow.

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,689
Want anything else, take it quickly.
We're leaving in five minutes.

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,161
- We're not coming back.
- We can't just run.

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,045
Waller knows I tried to steal the virus
to get Tatsu back.

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,526
Even if she didn't...

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,001
...Chien Na Wei knows where we live.
We have to go.

60
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,204
- Look, Maseo...
- If you stay, Waller will torture you to find us.

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,609
Contact your family, contact the press.

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,207
Once the world knows Oliver Queen
is still alive...

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,044
...it will limit A.R.G.U.S.' options.

64
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,681
Make it more difficult for Waller
to assassinate you.

65
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,611
That's reassuring.
What are you gonna do?

66
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,561
I'll take Akio and Tatsu on the ferry
to Shanghai.

67
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,889
From there, we will disappear.

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,048
You saved us.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,202
Now save yourself.

70
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,686
Mr. Zytle. Vertigo. Mr. Zytle.

71
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,411
- How many have your drug killed?
- How many have you killed?

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,130
Reaction to sentencing, Mr. Zytle?

73
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,723
The Roman governor, Porcius Festus,
maintained that the accused...

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,605
...has the right to face their accuser.

75
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,928
Now, where is my accuser?

76
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,166
I speak, of course, of the Arrow.

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,926
Excuse me, Mr. Zytle
has no further comments.

78
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,169
ADA Laurel Lance. Take him to the van.
Thank you.

79
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,084
Stay back. Stay back!

80
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,441
Where's Zytle?

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,607
Hey.

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,685
So you still haven't told me,
what did you think of my set last night?

83
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,161
Fan girls on Vine called
it "epically epic."

84
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,125
More like "epically profitable."

85
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,681
It's kind of hot when
you talk business and numbers.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,805
Chase. God, if you ever really
wanna kiss me again...

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,571
...you're gonna have to work on your game.

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,370
Later, princess.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,531
Ollie.

90
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,960
Hey, Speedy-

91
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,166
I'm so happy you're home.

92
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,689
What?

93
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,808
I have to show you something.

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,608
- Where are we going?
- The basement.

95
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,690
I thought that you said
that it was flooded.

96
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,484
I lied.

97
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,929
Ollie, what's going on?
You're kind of making me nervous.

98
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,761
I know that this isn't gonna mean much...

99
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,206
...and I've given you no reason
to believe me when I say it...

100
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,888
...but I lied all of this
time to protect you.

101
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,610
You're...

102
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,807
You're him.

103
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,210
Yeah.

104
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,565
That night with the Hoods...

105
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,808
...and the woman in black, that...

106
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,691
That was Ra's al Ghul's daughter.

107
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,084
That was you.

108
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,209
All those times I got so mad at you
for being a flake...

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,008
...or telling me something I knew
that had to be a lie...

110
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,521
...you were saving someone's life.

111
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,646
Thank you.

112
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,730
Thank you.

113
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,284
Thank you.

114
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,402
You know how many times I've wished
that I could thank the Arrow...

115
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,927
...for things he's done for this city?

116
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,448
Probably as many times as I've wished
we could have this conversation.

117
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,210
Did Mom know?

118
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,446
The night that she died, she told me...

119
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,961
...that she'd known for a while.

120
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,969
I was worried that you'd be angry.

121
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,410
Only because you broke my window.

122
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,967
Although I did kind of kick your ass.

123
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,321
You didn't.

124
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,849
- But you did have a good teacher.
- You were looking for Malcolm that night.

125
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,610
We know about each other.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,842
Wait, Malcolm knows that you're the Arrow?

127
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,971
I am amazed that he didn't tell you.

128
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,767
And why did you tell me?

129
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,007
Why now?

130
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
Because Ra's al Ghul is coming for us.

131
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,567
All of us.

132
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,687
And the only chance that we have to survive
is to work together.

133
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,120
To trust each other.

134
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,646
He's right.

135
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,125
No.

136
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,362
No. No, he's not.

137
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,370
I turned my back on everyone I know.

138
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,688
Including my own brother.

139
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,201
Because you told me there was nobody
I could trust.

140
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,522
I was only trying to protect you.

141
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,649
By driving a wedge between me and Ollie?

142
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,361
You manipulated me.

143
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,008
- Thea.
- Let her go.

144
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,891
Yeah.

145
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,411
You've reached Moira Queen.
Please leave a message.

146
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,164
Mom, it's me.

147
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,802
I'm alive. I'm... I'm in Hong Kong.
I know it sounds crazy...

148
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,930
...but I'm alive, I'm in Hong Kong,
and I need your help.

149
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,847
I want you to call Ned Foster, you tell him
to issue a press release. Tell everyone.

150
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,326
You tell Thea.

151
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,568
I'm coming home. I love you...

152
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,327
What do we know?

153
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,127
Apparently the federal marshal guarding
Werner Zytle just started shooting...

154
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,209
...while Zytle waltzed off in the panic.

155
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,564
This is my favorite part.

156
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,161
It's pretty convenient. Guy decides
to wig out and Zytle takes advantage.

157
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,011
It's planned.
Those are the effects of his Vertigo.

158
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,964
Zytle was in a full set of restraints.

159
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,563
- How did he manage to dose a federal agent?
- He didn't. One of the reporters did.

160
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,287
What's wrong?

161
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,806
Was my form off?

162
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,203
She's right. About the reporter.

163
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,968
- We need a name...
- And address on our clumsy reporter. I'm on it.

164
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,610
What do you think you're doing?

165
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,370
- I'm coming with you.
- You're not.

166
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,324
I just gave you your only lead.

167
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,205
Talk to you for a second? Alone?

168
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,089
I know what you're gonna say. But I risked
my life for this city while you were gone.

169
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,011
- That should earn me respect.
- This isn't about respect.

170
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,168
And it's not about you risking your life.

171
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,283
I understand that you miss Sara.

172
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,005
And I understand that when you go out there
like this...

173
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,844
...all of that pain goes away.

174
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,525
- It's the only time it ever does.
- That relief isn't real.

175
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,761
It's a drug.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,606
- If you're implying...
- You are an addict.

177
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,168
Just like with booze and pills,
that high you're chasing every night...

178
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,250
...is endangering your life.
Go to hell, Oliver.

179
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,807
You don't get to play that card with me.
Even

180
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,967
And if there is anyone who's using adrenaline to
hide the pain of real feelings and real life...

181
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,889
...it's you.

182
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,922
Oliver. Felicity tracked down
the reporter's work address.

183
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,930
Anthony Walker. Where's Werner Zytle?

184
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,567
- He's not... He's not here.
- You helped him escape today.

185
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,042
Zytle threatened my wife.

186
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,330
Said he could get to her,
that he'd kill her if I didn't do this.

187
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,766
Do what?

188
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,486
Kill you.

189
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,564
- I'm so sorry.
- Anthony.

190
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,000
Give me the detonator.

191
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,884
He'll kill my Wife.

192
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,889
We can protect her.

193
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,003
Promise.

194
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,249
Now, hand me the detonator.

195
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,010
God forgive me.

196
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,931
I will weep for thee.

197
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,803
Ollie?

198
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,245
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

199
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,845
Can't sleep.

200
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,965
Apparently insomnia is a common side effect
of finding out your brother's a vigilante.

201
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,122
Heh. Right.

202
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,524
You smell like smoke.

203
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,530
- Korean barbeque?
- C4.

204
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,160
Yeah.

205
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,567
Nice that we can tell each other
this stuff now.

206
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,683
It is, actually.

207
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,930
You always had the lamest excuses.

208
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,886
Lame excuses are sort of
an occupational hazard.

209
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,084
What was tonight's hazard?

210
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,605
Roy and I were looking for the man that
escaped from the courthouse earlier today.

211
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,723
We found a bomb instead.

212
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,082
Yeah, I don't know how you do it.

213
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,001
Just risk your life out there
for people every night.

214
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,844
It's my job.

215
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,844
It is my job...

216
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,566
...to keep the people of this city safe.

217
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,206
And that includes you too, Speedy.

218
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,923
Listen to me.

219
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,042
I'm always gonna hate Malcolm Merlyn.

220
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,642
But right now, he is a necessary evil.

221
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,090
- We can take care of ourselves...
- Not against Ra's al Ghul.

222
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,684
You have to trust me on this.

223
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,961
I do.

224
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,288
But I don't trust him.

225
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,290
I can't.

226
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,205
And I won't.

227
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,205
Ten minutes.

228
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,323
I'm impressed.

229
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,603
I know Special Forces
who can't last longer than three.

230
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,648
Eventually, though, everybody breaks.

231
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,207
Tell me where the Yamashiros are
and it will stop.

232
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,649
My family's gonna be looking for me.

233
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,729
Everyone is gonna be looking for me.

234
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,049
Because your mother issued
a press release?

235
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,570
We erased your message
before she could hear a word of it.

236
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,689
Be glad.

237
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,171
If she had heard it,
your mother would be dead right now.

238
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,846
You would never risk the exposure.

239
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,371
You're right.

240
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,370
Your mother's too public a figure.

241
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,881
But your sister on the other hand...

242
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,884
What's her name?

243
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,565
Thea?

244
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,888
Did you know she's developed something
of a substance abuse problem...

245
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,969
...since you've been gone?

246
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,405
I guess the strain of losing two family members
must have been too much for her to bear.

247
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,403
One day, someone may just find her
in the back of a car...

248
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,211
...dead with a needle in her arm.

249
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,041
Poor Speedy.

250
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,443
You stay away from my sister.

251
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,484
I will. If you answer one question.

252
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,570
Where are the Yamashiros?

253
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,486
The ferry to Shanghai.

254
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,650
Knock, knock.

255
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,481
H9)'-

256
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,645
You know, half the department is still talking
about the way you clocked that marshal.

257
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,041
Those boxing lessons look like
they're paying off.

258
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,321
Yeah, I guess so.

259
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,761
Are those the cargo manifests
for the whole city?

260
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,691
Yeah. Although, I gotta ask.
What do you need these for?

261
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,247
Just a RICO case that I'm second chairing.

262
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,726
Right.

263
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,404
- Dad.
- Yeah. Sorry, I just...

264
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,963
Have you heard from Sara lately?

265
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,446
No. Why?

266
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,361
I ran into her a few weeks back.

267
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,451
And something just felt a little off.

268
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,328
Then I ran into that friend of hers.

269
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,291
You know the one with the, uh...
The boy hair?

270
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,682
- Sin.
- Yeah, Sin. That's it.

271
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,770
She said something strange.

272
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,169
She said that the woman in black
isn't Sara.

273
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,608
- That doesn't make any sense.
- No.

274
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,089
I mean, look, I just wanna talk to her,
you know? Sara or not.

275
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,005
But look, don't worry. I said I'd
start taking it easy, I meant it.

276
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,204
I'll get out of your hair.

277
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,525
You know, I've been wondering.

278
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,810
How do you decide between the red hoodie
and the one with the mask?

279
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,445
I'm glad you know.

280
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,690
I felt pretty lame not recognizing my own
brotherjust because he's wearing a hood.

281
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,247
I can't believe you knew before I did.

282
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,885
He saved my life, Thea.

283
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,522
He saved a lot of people's lives.

284
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,922
- He thinks we need Merlyn's help.
- Hm.

285
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,570
And what do you think?

286
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,804
I think I wanna get as far away
from Malcolm Merlyn as I possibly can.

287
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,889
Well, there's your answer right there.

288
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,726
Hey.

289
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,849
Sorry. May I borrow him for a second?

290
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,365
Apparently he's been more yours
than mine lately, so...

291
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,327
What happened?

292
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,767
One of our trackers sent a signal
from the docks.

293
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,810
Except we don't have any tracking devices
in the field.

294
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,929
Unless we do.

295
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,810
It's Laurel.

296
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,170
- You tagged Laurel with a tracer?
- If she's gonna be reckless...

297
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,802
...I need to know what she's doing.
She's definitely doing something.

298
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,685
Just not exactly sure how reckless it is.

299
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,284
I ran the manifest on these shipping
containers you see here.

300
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,761
One of these leads back
to Zytle's old supplier.

301
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,727
- Looks like Vertigo's back in business.
- She's gonna get herself killed.

302
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,445
Suit up.

303
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,169
Hey! Unh!

304
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,845
Come on.

305
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,207
Wonderful seeing you again.

306
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,681
Ooh, I fancy the new outfit.

307
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,966
Feeling my Vertigo, dear?

308
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,405
Wonderful to...

309
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,605
Dinah Laurel Lance.

310
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,807
Selfish bitch.

311
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,162
You're not a hero.

312
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,203
You're a liar.

313
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,841
A fraud.

314
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,648
And an addict.

315
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,607
Sara.

316
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,291
Sara, please. Please. I'm your sister.

317
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,086
Then why are you trying to take my place?

318
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,881
Get away from her.

319
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,605
You should be dead.

320
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,280
I salute your persistence.

321
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,644
Help me.

322
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,130
Help... Help me.

323
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,568
Help me. Help me.

324
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,166
We need an IV.

325
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,365
Watch her head.

326
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,286
It's gonna be okay.

327
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,482
- Why did I have to die?
- Sara.

328
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,524
If you wanted to be me, you could have.

329
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,131
I didn't have to die.

330
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,044
I am so sorry.

331
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,523
I'm so sorry, Sara. I'm so...

332
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,811
Ollie.

333
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,127
I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk.

334
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,890
Thea, go back upstairs.

335
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,930
- Now!
- Hey. Don't talk to her like that.

336
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,122
You don't have the right to kick her out.

337
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,446
I'm not.

338
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,286
- I'm protecting her.
- By telling her what to do?

339
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,051
Work with Malcolm Merlyn,
let him get his hooks deeper?

340
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,084
- Enough. She's my sister.
- She makes her own choices, Oliver.

341
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,489
It's okay. We can talk later. I just...

342
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,480
Just... is Laurel okay?
Is she a part of this too?

343
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,890
She's gonna be fine.

344
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,208
I promise. Just...

345
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,883
Please go back upstairs.

346
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,325
What the hell was that?

347
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,807
You're the only person
who can stand up for Thea?

348
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,566
I'm trying to figure out why
you're standing up to me.

349
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,962
All right,
maybe we just need to throttle back.

350
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,687
No. We need this. Oliver, you were gone.
Dead. At least we thought you were.

351
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
And we had to go on with our lives.
And doing that...

352
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,841
...meant not doing things your way.
Fine.

353
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,010
- I'm back now.
- That doesn't mean that we can go back.

354
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,286
And you do not have the right to come back
here and question everyone's choices.

355
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,810
Just let me know if there's any change
in her condition.

356
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,482
Hey. How's it going?

357
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,010
What's that for?

358
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,521
My life has been really complicated lately,
so I just need something simple.

359
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,485
This seat taken?

360
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,609
It's a free country.

361
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,490
Apparently.

362
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,566
The first time that we went after Zytle...

363
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,441
...I told you that this was my crusade.

364
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,330
- Doesn't seem to be the case anymore.
- You're right. It isn't.

365
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,923
- You know, I get that I was gone...
- No, you weren't gone. You were dead.

366
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,845
And all of us, including me,
we were ready to hang it up.

367
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,766
Why didn't you?

368
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,602
Because we realized we weren't just fighting
for you, we were fighting for ourselves too.

369
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,526
That includes Roy.

370
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,643
And yes, that includes Laurel.

371
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,047
She's not a soldier.

372
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,602
- Neither were you.
- It's not the same thing and you know that.

373
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,884
What I know, Oliver,
is that you started something.

374
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,649
Something strong enough
to live on past you.

375
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,609
Question is...

376
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,610
...can you live with what it's become?

377
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,882
Oliver, are you all right?

378
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,721
I told them you were on the ferry.

379
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,327
I'm sorry.

380
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,011
- They tortured you.
- I sold you out.

381
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,410
No, you didn't.

382
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,286
Because we were never going to Shanghai.

383
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,686
I lied. A precaution just in case
you were captured.

384
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,644
Then how'd they find you?

385
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,966
They didn't.

386
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,481
When I found out you'd been taken,
I came back.

387
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,727
You're an idiot.

388
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,322
Maybe. But I will not let you face
Waller alone for my actions.

389
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,205
Now we're both gonna get tortured.
Or worse.

390
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,481
Great plan.

391
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,244
I must speak with Agent Waller.

392
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,610
Hey! Why'd you...?

393
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,963
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

394
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,167
H9)'-

395
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,850
Hey, he)'-

396
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,329
- Hey.
- How are you feeling?

397
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,801
When Zytle hit me with Vertigo, I...

398
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,805
I saw Sara.

399
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,844
She was alive.

400
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,888
And she was calling me a fraud.

401
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,727
I was crazy to think that I was fit
to wear Sara's jacket.

402
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,563
So much as follow in her footsteps.

403
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,167
You're right.

404
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,569
I hope I'm not out of line here...

405
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,123
...but I think Sara wore her mask
just as much to hide her demons...

406
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,685
...as she did to help people.

407
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,968
And I don't see that with you.

408
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,963
You have a light inside of you
that Sara never had.

409
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,648
So maybe you should stop trying to be Sara.

410
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,441
And just be yourself.

411
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,411
Thank you.

412
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,811
What's that?

413
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,129
One of the chemical drums Zytle stole
tonight sent out a GPS signal.

414
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,800
Why?

415
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,841
Because he just opened it.

416
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,688
I dig your place.

417
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,247
I'm sorry I interrupted the tour.

418
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,410
Pretty sure you saw everything
you needed to.

419
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,484
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

420
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,844
This was nice.

421
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,571
I almost took it personally
when you said I was simple.

422
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,167
Well, I never said that you were simple.

423
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,006
What?

424
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,160
Nothing, it...

425
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,249
It's just something my father once said.

426
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,210
We were sitting in this little taberna
in Corto Maltese...

427
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,131
...drinking this amazing Carménére...

428
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,928
...and he said that for centuries...

429
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,728
...noblemen had been using
the rich aroma of red wine...

430
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,810
...to cover up a very different scent.

431
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,210
Cyanide.

432
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,565
Tell me who you are
and what you think you're doing here.

433
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,047
Serving my master, Ra's al Ghul.

434
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,691
- Please.
- Don't struggle.

435
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,201
I can do this so you won't feel a thing.

436
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,721
Get away from her.

437
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,406
If you beg forgiveness for trying to harm
my daughter, I'll grant you a quick death.

438
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,841
I'd never give you the
satisfaction, Al Sa-Her.

439
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,162
You're unarmed
and you have nowhere to run.

440
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,250
But there's someplace I can go
where you won't dare to follow.

441
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,688
Daggett Pharmaceuticals. 5th and Kingsley.

442
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,168
Looks like Zytle found a place to change
those chemicals into Vertigo.

443
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,401
And he's got hostages.

444
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,204
- Where's Roy?
- I can't reach him.

445
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,284
Laurel.

446
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,686
Oliver.

447
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,089
There isn't anything that you can say to me
that I don't already know.

448
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,402
Actually, there is.

449
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,803
I must once again thank you...

450
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,210
...for letting us use your laboratory
this evening.

451
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,803
And my sincerest apologies
to your colleague here...

452
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,443
...but mistakes will not be tolerated.

453
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,409
Werner Zytle.

454
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,646
- This ends now.
- As you wish.

455
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,525
May I suggest a grand finale?

456
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,764
Chlorine trifluoride.

457
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,610
Oliver, I'm registering an enormous spike
in thermal activity.

458
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,764
- The whole place is gonna blow.
- You have to get out of there.

459
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,886
Not yet.

460
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,242
Go. Run! Now!

461
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,806
Unh!

462
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,080
I'm surprised.

463
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:29,531
Usually women don't return
for a second go with me.

464
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,883
- Hi, sis.
- You're not her.

465
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,204
You're not real.

466
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,607
Oh, I'm quite real.

467
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,325
You lied to me, Laurel!

468
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,171
Straight to my face! My own daughter!

469
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,051
Sara was my daughter.
I deserved to know. I had a right.

470
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,930
To grieve! To mourn!

471
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,643
And who do you think you are
to take that away from me, huh?

472
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,808
Who do you think you are?

473
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,168
- I'm sorry.
- I know you are.

474
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,363
She said she's sorry,
but she would do it again.

475
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,404
You keep my own daughter's death a secret
because you think I'm too weak for the truth?

476
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,291
You think you can wear my mask?

477
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,528
You think you can be me?

478
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,290
No.

479
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,727
And I'm done trying to be.

480
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,846
Oliver, are you there?

481
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,327
- It's over.
- No, it's not.

482
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,646
You have to get home.

483
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,325
It's Thea.

484
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,647
Okay, all good.

485
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,243
- Hey.
- ls everything okay?

486
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,326
Oh, yeah, just the usual insurance policy
search and seizure.

487
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,807
Seems like I'm a high-risk case.

488
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,729
Wonder what gave them that idea.

489
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,051
What's the matter? You okay?

490
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,165
Um...

491
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,481
There's, um...
There's something that I have to tell you.

492
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,446
And I didn't tell you...

493
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,847
I didn't tell you before
because I was worried about your health.

494
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,961
But I realized...

495
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,765
...that you deserve to know.

496
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,047
I already know it.

497
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,485
Sara's off God knows where, and yet there's
another blond in a mask running around...

498
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,365
...tuning up the bad guys,
and it's you, isn't it?

499
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,405
Sweetheart, come on. It's all right.
It's okay.

500
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,409
It's okay, honey.

501
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,809
I mean, look, I am pissed as hell,
but, you know, we'll figure it out.

502
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,691
- We figure out everything.
- No, no. No, Daddy, that...

503
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,769
That isn't what I was gonna tell you.

504
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,002
What I was gonna tell you...

505
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,162
...is about Sara.

506
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,289
No.

507
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,249
Dad.

508
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,160
No.

509
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,606
- No.
- Dad.

510
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,851
Not again.

511
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,888
- Daddy.
- Not my baby. Not again.

512
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,764
Sweetheart.

513
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,086
I can't do this.

514
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,245
Thea?

515
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,088
It's okay. You're okay.

516
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,531
I thought that I was stronger.

517
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,647
I thought that I could keep myself safe.

518
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,126
- Who was he?
- One of Ra's' agents.

519
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,565
Roy...

520
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,724
...can you give us a minute?

521
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,810
I really hope you're not expecting
a "thank you."

522
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,686
No parent needs gratitude
for saving their child.

523
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,887
I didn't ask to be a part of this.

524
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,367
I didn't ask for any of this.

525
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,449
Maybe you were right.

526
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,166
Maybe we can't do this without him.

527
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,084
But I am never gonna forget
the things you've done.

528
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,484
- Or the person that you are.
- Understood.

529
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,122
But before we can begin...

530
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,489
...there's something that only the two
of you can do.

531
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,887
Ra's al Ghul preys upon the fears
of his enemies.

532
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,763
Conquer your own fear...

533
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,330
...and you eliminate
that critical advantage.

534
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,044
For you...

535
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,925
...there is only one place on earth
uniquely suited...

536
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,849
...to doing that.

537
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,730
So you're leaving again?

538
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,207
She's got a point, man. You just got back.

539
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,004
It's just for a few days.

540
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,806
Ordinarily, I wouldn't do this.

541
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,645
But it's for Thea.

542
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,211
And if you've shown me anything,
it's that this city...

543
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,647
...is more than safe in your hands.

544
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,447
All of your hands.

545
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,645
Thank you.

546
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,565
Ollie told you we're heading out for a bit?

547
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,327
You cool with it all?

548
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,048
After the whole Chase thing,
I think it's gonna be a little while...

549
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,368
...before I'm cool with anything.

550
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,361
What was that for?

551
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,321
Take your pick.

552
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,127
Saving my life or standing up to Oliver
about Malcolm.

553
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,769
I should get going.

554
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,886
Come on, Speedy, we have four more miles
to make before nightfall.

555
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,170
Ugh. God.

556
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,245
I get that Malcolm wants to whip us
into shape so we can face the League...

557
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,841
...but don't you think
this is a little bit excessive?

558
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,891
We've been here for two hours.
Are you complaining already?

559
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,406
I started thinking it after
the first 10 minutes.

560
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,282
Well, give it time.

561
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,002
Eventually, this place will feel like home.

562
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,651
It does not look like home.

563
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,491
It was for me. For other people,
this is purgatory.

564
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,849
You're not dead,
if that's what you're wondering.

565
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,523
Once again, you have the good fortune
of being uniquely qualified to help me.

566
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,046
Me?

567
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,806
Why?

568
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,685
Chien Na Wei has left Hong Kong.
We've tracked her here.

569
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,245
Here?

570
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,289
Where are we?

571
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,928
Welcome home, Mr. Queen.
