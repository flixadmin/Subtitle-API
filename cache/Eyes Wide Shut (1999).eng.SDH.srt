ALICE: isn't it on the bedside table?

3

How do I look?

Perfect.

7
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:24,403
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,031
It's great.

9
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:28,325
You're not even looking at it.

You always look beautiful.

Did you give Roz the
phone and pager numbers?

00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:03,355
Roz.

Okay, Roz, we're going now.

Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up

-You can watch that.
-Can I stay up until you get home?

-No, darling.
-BILL: It'll be a little late for that.

there, so help yourself.

Alice, look at you. God,
you're absolutely stunning!

-He does?

BILL: Not a soul.

46
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,589
Why do you think Ziegler invites
us to these things every year?

47
00:03:55,809 --> 00:04:00,269
This is what you get
for making house calls.

You see that guy at the piano?

49
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:17,323
I went to medical school with him.

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,661
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

52
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:29,048
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

you're enjoying yourselves.

You go and say hello, and I'll

Bill Harford! How the
hell are you, buddy?

64
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:20,928
-How long has it been?
-I don't know. Ten years?

65

And a couple.

-Sure.

Thanks, I think. So how you doing?

Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

I see you've become a pianist.

How about you? You
still in the doctor business?

"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

74
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:54,627
Yes, or in my case: "Never
a doctor, never a doctor."

I never did understand
why you walked away.

Did you ever read the Latin
poet Ovid on <i>The Art of Love?</i>

91
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:58,161

man who wouldn't mind if we danced.

Don't you think one of
the charms of marriage

a necessity for both parties?

You were very kind to me once.

126
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:41,779
Only once? That sounds
like a terrible oversight!

00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,352
BILL: What happened?

164
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,816
VICTOR: Well, she was…

165
00:13:24,324 --> 00:13:28,488
She was shooting up and
she had a bad reaction.

166
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,530
BILL: What did she take?

167
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:35,992
A speedball or a snowball or
whatever the hell they call it.

168
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:38,043
It's heroin and coke.

169
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:42,999
BILL: Heroin and coke?

170
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:46,843
Anything else?

171
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:51,758
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

172
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:53,934
How long has she been like this?

173
00:13:54,396 --> 00:13:57,604
Maybe five minutes, six
minutes, something like that.

174
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:58,930
What's her name?

175
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:01,315
Mandy.

176
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,153
Mandy?

177
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:08,948
Mandy?

178
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,736
Can you hear me, Mandy?

179
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:17,699
Can you hear me? Move
your head if you can hear me.

180
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:22,294
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

181
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:24,088
You can hear me.

182
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,510
Can you open your eyes for
me? Mandy, can you do that?

183
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:32,555
Let me see you open your
eyes. There you go, come on.

184
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:35,759
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

185
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:38,804
Look at me. Look at me.

186
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:42,732
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

187
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:45,393
Good.

188
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:48,270
Good.

189
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,534
I love Victor's art
collection, don't you?

190
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,116
Yes.

191
00:14:57,457 --> 00:14:59,323
It's wonderful.

192
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:03,835
Have you ever seen his sculpture gallery?

193
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,001
No.

194
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:09,841
I haven't.

195
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:15,427
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

196
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:19,760
Do you like the period?

197
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:24,643
I do.

198
00:15:25,276 --> 00:15:27,438
I adore it.

199
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,989
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

200
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:35,442
Would you like to see it?

201
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,325
I can show it to you.

202
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,830
We won't be gone long.

203
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,048
Maybe…

204
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,843
Not just

205
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,431
now.

206
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:25,742
That was really one hell of
a scare you gave us, kiddo.

207
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:28,667
Sorry.

208
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:39,804
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

209
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:42,966
Better.

210
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:57,072
You are a very, very lucky girl.

211
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,566
You know that?

212
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,411
I know.

213
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,789
You're gonna be okay this time.

214
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:11,287
But you can't keep doing this.

215
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,538
You understand?

216
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:17,042
Yeah.

217
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,837
You're going to need some
rehab. You know that, don't you?

218
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,224
I know.

219
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:28,723
Okay.

220
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,688
Okay.

221
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:37,606
Well, Victor…

222
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:41,365
I'll leave the rest to you.

223
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:44,318
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

224
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:48,247
No, I'd keep her here for another hour.

225
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,948
Another hour?

226
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:54,791
Then I'd have someone take her home.

227
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:58,507
Okay. Okay.

228
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,336
Good night, Mandy.

229
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:04,046
Listen…

230
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:07,515
I can't thank you enough for this.

231
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,476
-You saved my ass.
-I'm glad I was here.

232
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:13,146
Bill, I probably…

233
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:17,525
I know I don't have to mention this,

234
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:20,645
but this is just between us.

235
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:22,396
Of course.

236
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,190
Thanks.

237
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:49,807
I think I've had a little
too much champagne.

238
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:56,522
I think I have to go and
find my husband now.

239
00:18:56,734 --> 00:19:01,352
But I'm sure he'll be all
right on his own a little longer.

240
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:05,272
Yes,

241
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:08,317
but will I?

242
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:10,702
Of course you will.

243
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,036
No.

244
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:19,669
I really have to go. I have to go.

245
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:21,667
You don't, you know.

246
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:26,001
Yes, I do.

247
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:28,424
Alice?

248
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:33,183
I must see you again.

249
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,604
-That's impossible.
-Why?

250
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:40,849
Because…

251
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,687
I'm married.

252
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:52,050
BILL: Good morning, Lisa.

253
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:54,379
Good morning, doctor. Your mail.

254
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:57,511
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

255
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,343
-Sure.
-Thank you.

256
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:02,895
-Good morning, Sarah.
-Good morning, doctor.

257
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:06,157
<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house…</i>

258
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,227
<i>…not a creature was
stirring, not even a mouse."</i>

259
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:15,992
Okay. That's fine. You
can put your gown on.

260
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,415
Hold this for Mommy.

261
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:25,803
-Looking forward to Christmas?
-Yeah.

262
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:28,588
-Does this hurt?
-Yeah.

263
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:44,182
-Right there?
-Yeah.

264
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:57,069
Daddy's gonna like that.

265
00:21:57,786 --> 00:21:59,493
Very good choice.

266
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:02,620
"... Before me…

267
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:08,085
…when I jump into my bed."

268
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,254
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

269
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,052
BILL: I've taken care of that.

270
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:20,046
ALICE: Good.

271
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:24,384
So how do you feel about
wrapping the rest of the presents?

272
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:28,270
Let's do that tomorrow.

273
00:23:14,318 --> 00:23:16,434
Tell me something.

274
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,693
Those two girls

275
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,156
at the party last night…

276
00:23:35,006 --> 00:23:36,997
Did you

277
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:40,376
by any chance

278
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:43,093
happen to

279
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:47,553
fuck them?

280
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:51,519
What?

281
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:57,100
What are you talking about?

282
00:24:01,115 --> 00:24:04,779
I'm talking about the two girls

283
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:08,944
that you were so blatantly hitting on.

284
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,700
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

285
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,746
Who were they?

286
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:25,716
They were just a couple of models.

287
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:34,308
And where did you disappear
to with them for so long?

288
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:36,479
Wait a minute.

289
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:39,057
Wait a minute.

290
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:44,863
I didn't disappear with anybody.

291
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,278
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well,

292
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,989
and I got called upstairs to see him.

293
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:00,753
Anyway, who was the
guy you were dancing with?

294
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:09,800
A friend of the Zieglers.

295
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:13,883
What did he want?

296
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:16,177
What did he want?

297
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:20,226
What did he want?

298
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:24,527
Sex…

299
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:28,526
Upstairs.

300
00:25:29,618 --> 00:25:31,484
Then and there.

301
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:35,450
Is that all?

302
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:38,366
Yeah, that was all.

303
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:41,373
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

304
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:47,211
That's right.

305
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:49,839
Well, I guess that's understandable.

306
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:55,011
Understandable?

307
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:58,055
Because you are a very

308
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:01,267
very beautiful woman.

309
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:02,685
Whoa.

310
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:04,107
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

311
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,725
Wait.

312
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:11,402
Because I'm a beautiful woman

313
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:15,906
the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me

314
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,125
is because he wants to fuck
me. Is that what you're saying?

315
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:29,587
Well, I don't think it's
quite that black and white…

316
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:36,591
But I think we both
know what men are like.

317
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:40,593
So on that basis

318
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:45,766
I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

319
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:50,732
There are exceptions.

320
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:56,275
And what makes you an exception?

321
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,703
What makes me an exception is that

322
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,377
I happen to be in love with you.

323
00:27:07,464 --> 00:27:09,046
And because we're married,

324
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:13,546
and because I would never lie to you,

325
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,803
or hurt you.

326
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:27,515
Do you realize that what you're saying

327
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:31,143
is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models

328
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,903
is out of consideration for me?

329
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:37,148
Not because you really wouldn't want to.

330
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:40,284
Let's just relax, Alice.

331
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:43,079
This pot is making you aggressive.

332
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:46,700
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

333
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:49,561
Why can't you ever give
me a straight fucking answer?

334
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:52,338
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

335
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,759
I don't even know what
we're arguing about here.

336
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,177
I'm not arguing.

337
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:03,429
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

338
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:05,393
Where I'm coming from?

339
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:14,561
Let's say, for example, you
have some gorgeous woman

340
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:18,902
standing in your office naked,

341
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:21,779
and you're feeling her fucking tits.

342
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:23,781
Now, what I want to know…

343
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:28,992
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

344
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:33,329
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

345
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,127
It's all very impersonal,

346
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:39,926
and you know there's
always a nurse present.

347
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:45,345
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

348
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,595
Exactly.

349
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:51,351
Sex is the last thing on my
mind when I'm with a patient.

350
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:56,819
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed

351
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,271
do you think she ever has fantasies

352
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:03,780
about what handsome
Dr. Bill's dickie might be like?

353
00:29:05,872 --> 00:29:10,160
Come on, I can assure
you sex is the last thing

354
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:14,627
on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

355
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,746
And what makes you so sure?

356
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,799
If for no better reason

357
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:27,306
because she's afraid
of what I might find.

358
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:32,978
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

359
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,431
What then?

360
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,067
I don't know, Alice…

361
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:41,900
What then?

362
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,777
Women don't…

363
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:52,452
They basically just
don't think like that.

364
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,288
Millions of years of evolution, right?

365
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:02,586
Men have to stick it
every place they can,

366
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:06,011
but for women, it is just
about security and commitment,

367
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,467
and whatever the fuck else!

368
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,426
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

369
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:16,597
If you men only knew.

370
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:22,106
What I do know is you got
stoned, you tried to pick a fight,

371
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,439
and now you're trying to make me jealous.

372
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,820
But you're not the jealous type, are you?

373
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,155
No, I'm not.

374
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,570
You've never been
jealous about me, have you?

375
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:32,654
No, I haven't.

376
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,365
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

377
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:39,540
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

378
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,122
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child,

379
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,129
and I know you would
never be unfaithful to me.

380
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,633
You are very, very sure of yourself

381
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,134
aren't you?

382
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,844
No.

383
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,350
I'm sure of you.

384
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,448
Do you think that's funny?

385
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,167
All right. Fuck it.

386
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,754
Now we get the fucking
laughing fit, right?

387
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,676
Do you…

388
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,515
Do you remember last summer at Cape Cod?

389
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,645
Yes.

390
00:31:50,449 --> 00:31:53,532
Do you remember one
night in the dining room

391
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,906
there was this young naval officer,

392
00:31:56,121 --> 00:32:00,706
and he was sitting near our
table with two other officers?

393
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,246
BILL: No.

394
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:10,091
The waiter brought him a
message, at which point he left.

395
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,964
Nothing rings a bell?

396
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:15,007
No.

397
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,927
Well…

398
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,934
I first saw him that
morning in the lobby.

399
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:30,444
He was checking into the hotel,

400
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:34,148
and he was following the
bellboy with his luggage

401
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:36,817
to the elevator.

402
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:45,743
He glanced at me as he
walked past. Just a glance.

403
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:48,745
Nothing more.

404
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:59,215
But I could hardly

405
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,475
move.

406
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,649
That afternoon…

407
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:19,986
Helena went to the
movies with her friend…

408
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:25,865
And you and I made love.

409
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:33,498
And we made plans about our future,

410
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:38,628
and we talked about Helena.

411
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,006
And yet

412
00:33:43,143 --> 00:33:45,851
at no time

413
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:49,809
was he ever

414
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:54,769
out of my mind.

415
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:05,158
And I thought if he wanted me

416
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:09,541
even if it was only,

417
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:12,919
for one night…

418
00:34:17,218 --> 00:34:20,927
I was ready to give up everything.

419
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:24,046
You.

420
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,141
Helena.

421
00:34:30,773 --> 00:34:34,482
My whole fucking future.

422
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:38,353
Everything.

423
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:49,289
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time

424
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:53,201
you were dearer to me than ever.

425
00:34:57,716 --> 00:35:00,799
And at that moment, my love for you

426
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:04,677
was both…

427
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:12,182
Tender and sad.

428
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:25,778
I barely slept that night…

429
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:31,993
And I woke up the
next morning in a panic.

430
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:38,120
I didn't know whether I
was afraid that he had left,

431
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:42,962
or that he might still be there.

432
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:50,508
But by dinner…

433
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:57,013
I realized he was gone…

434
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:05,654
And I was

435
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:08,657
relieved.

It's so unreal.

464
00:39:56,926 --> 00:39:58,963
Daddy had such a good day.

465
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:05,553
His mind was clear, and he
remembered so many things.

466
00:40:08,645 --> 00:40:10,761
Then he had a little dinner,

467
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:14,391
and he said he felt like taking a nap.

468

I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most,

I'm sure your father

Oh, God, I hope so.

I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen

477

01:37:24,469 --> 01:37:27,302
I don't know how many I was with.

980
01:37:30,433 --> 01:37:35,302
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men…

981
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:41,057
Just fucking all these men.

982
01:37:45,531 --> 01:37:48,273
I wanted to make fun of you

983
01:37:49,993 --> 01:37:52,405
to laugh in your face.

984
01:37:55,707 --> 01:38:00,668
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

985
01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:17,928
That must have been when you woke me up.

986
01:39:02,189 --> 01:39:03,645
Shit!

987
01:39:37,766 --> 01:39:39,928
-Hi.
-Hi.

988
01:39:40,727 --> 01:39:42,809
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

989
01:39:50,278 --> 01:39:51,518
Anything else?

990
01:39:52,822 --> 01:39:54,563
No, thank you.

991
01:40:01,414 --> 01:40:02,779
Excuse me.

992
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:06,954
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Café?

993
01:40:07,169 --> 01:40:10,582
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

994
01:40:15,135 --> 01:40:19,629
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

995
01:40:19,848 --> 01:40:22,806
He's playing piano over there right now.

996
01:40:23,102 --> 01:40:24,592
Nick Nightingale?

997
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,603
Sure, he comes in here.

998
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:33,184
Look, maybe you can help me

999
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:37,029
because it's important
that I get in touch with him.

1000
01:40:38,242 --> 01:40:39,983
Do you know where he's staying?

1001
01:40:40,661 --> 01:40:41,822
Well…

1002
01:40:43,664 --> 01:40:46,747
I don't know if he'd want
me to give out his address.

1003
01:40:46,959 --> 01:40:49,326
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

1004
01:40:49,628 --> 01:40:52,086
I'm actually an old friend of his.

1005
01:40:53,674 --> 01:40:55,164
Well, doctor…

1006
01:40:57,677 --> 01:41:01,295
He'll be playing there
tonight. Can't it wait until then?

1007
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:04,047
Listen…

1008
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,219
To be perfectly honest…

1009
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:10,262
It's a medical matter.

1010
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:14,979
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

1011
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:43,170
Excuse me.

1012
01:41:44,891 --> 01:41:47,098
Hi! How can I help you?

1013
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:51,052
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

1014
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:55,223
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

1015
01:41:55,525 --> 01:41:57,812
-He checked out?
-Yes.

1016
01:42:01,072 --> 01:42:05,031
-Did he leave a forwarding address?
-No, I'm afraid not.

1017
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:08,160
When did he check out?

1018
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,621
About 5:00 this morning.

1019
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:13,206
5:00?

1020
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,831
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

1021
01:42:17,047 --> 01:42:19,835
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

1022
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:22,132
Look…

1023
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:26,842
Did you notice anything

1024
01:42:27,182 --> 01:42:28,638
I don't know

1025
01:42:29,309 --> 01:42:32,347
unusual about him when he left?

1026
01:42:34,356 --> 01:42:35,767
Unusual?

1027
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:39,349
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

1028
01:42:40,903 --> 01:42:42,353
No, I'm an old friend of his.

1029
01:42:42,488 --> 01:42:43,603
Really?

1030
01:42:44,073 --> 01:42:45,563
I'm a doctor.

1031
01:42:48,869 --> 01:42:53,204
-Well, Bill…?
-Sure.

1032
01:42:55,584 --> 01:42:58,497
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill

1033
01:42:58,754 --> 01:43:02,088
because there was
something a little strange

1034
01:43:02,299 --> 01:43:04,791
about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

1035
01:43:05,135 --> 01:43:07,502
Really? What was that?

1036
01:43:08,764 --> 01:43:09,879
Well…

1037
01:43:15,688 --> 01:43:20,228
He came in this morning, about 4:30 a.m

1038
01:43:20,818 --> 01:43:22,729
with two men.

1039
01:43:23,737 --> 01:43:25,444
Big guys.

1040
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:28,948
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

1041
01:43:29,159 --> 01:43:32,822
But they weren't the kind of
people you'd fool around with

1042
01:43:33,121 --> 01:43:34,828
if you know what I mean.

1043
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:39,115
Anyways

1044
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:45,165
I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

1045
01:43:45,925 --> 01:43:50,840
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

1046
01:43:51,848 --> 01:43:53,009
Scared?

1047
01:43:53,308 --> 01:43:54,890
Yes. Yes.

1048
01:43:55,768 --> 01:43:57,384
He said he wanted to check out.

1049
01:43:57,645 --> 01:44:01,513
And then he went upstairs to
his room with one of the men.

1050
01:44:01,816 --> 01:44:05,684
The other guy stayed down
in the lobby and settled his bill.

1051
01:44:06,446 --> 01:44:10,656
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

1052
01:44:10,825 --> 01:44:12,532
But they saw it and took it,

1053
01:44:12,785 --> 01:44:15,652
and said that any mail
or messages for him

1054
01:44:15,914 --> 01:44:20,453
would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

1055
01:44:21,293 --> 01:44:23,785
And then they just took him off in a car.

1056
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:27,420
Do you have any idea where they went?

1057
01:44:27,841 --> 01:44:29,707
No, not a clue.

1058
01:44:34,806 --> 01:44:35,921
Well…

1059
01:44:38,185 --> 01:44:39,425
Anyway…

1060
01:44:41,855 --> 01:44:44,017
I certainly appreciate your help.

1061
01:44:44,232 --> 01:44:45,848
Anytime, Bill.

1062
01:44:46,109 --> 01:44:47,099
CLERK: Bye.

1063
01:45:21,936 --> 01:45:24,519
MILICH: Oh, the good doctor!

1064
01:45:24,730 --> 01:45:26,061
Mr. Milich.

1065
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:31,360
-Was your outfit a success?
-Yes, it was. Thank you.

1066
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,235
Good, good.

1067
01:45:33,406 --> 01:45:38,401
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

1068
01:45:40,997 --> 01:45:44,740
I think you forgot the mask.

1069
01:45:46,043 --> 01:45:47,533
It's not there?

1070
01:45:48,504 --> 01:45:51,041
Maybe you left it at the party?

1071
01:45:56,095 --> 01:45:57,677
I don't think so.

1072
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:03,177
I must have lost it. Could
you put it on the bill, please?

1073
01:46:03,393 --> 01:46:04,383
Sure.

1074
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,556
Here we are.

1075
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:16,195
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble

1076
01:46:16,406 --> 01:46:19,865
25 for the mask. Sorry…

1077
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:24,281
Three hundred seventy-five.

1078
01:46:26,916 --> 01:46:28,202
Yes, dear?

1079
01:46:28,543 --> 01:46:29,999
Come, come.

1080
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:34,209
Would you like to say
hello to Dr. Harford?

1081
01:46:35,467 --> 01:46:37,959
-Hello.
-Hello.

1082
01:46:43,516 --> 01:46:46,349
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

1083
01:46:47,312 --> 01:46:49,178
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1084
01:46:49,481 --> 01:46:52,723
-Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
-MAN: And you too.

1085
01:46:53,692 --> 01:46:55,933
MILICH: Well, Dr. Harford

1086
01:46:57,196 --> 01:46:58,812
here is your receipt.

1087
01:47:00,115 --> 01:47:02,356
I'm tearing up your deposits,

1088
01:47:03,535 --> 01:47:05,867
and thanks for the business.

1089
01:47:10,459 --> 01:47:13,747
Mr. Milich, last night…

1090
01:47:16,548 --> 01:47:18,960
You were going to call the police.

1091
01:47:19,259 --> 01:47:20,249
Well…

1092
01:47:20,511 --> 01:47:24,596
Things change. We have
come to another arrangement.

1093
01:47:24,848 --> 01:47:29,763
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again

1094
01:47:30,395 --> 01:47:32,136
anything at all

1095
01:47:33,148 --> 01:47:35,685
it needn't be a costume.

1096
01:47:57,797 --> 01:47:59,128
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

1097
01:48:03,177 --> 01:48:04,417
Come in.

1098
01:48:06,139 --> 01:48:08,881
-Tuna salad and black coffee.
-BILL: Thanks.

1099
01:48:09,934 --> 01:48:12,972
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1100
01:48:13,187 --> 01:48:18,148
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at
2:30 and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1101
01:48:18,526 --> 01:48:22,736
Well, something's come up, and
I'm not going to be able to see them.

1102
01:48:22,989 --> 01:48:26,653
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize,

1103
01:48:26,909 --> 01:48:28,775
-and make new appointments.
-Sure.

1104
01:48:29,245 --> 01:48:33,330
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1105
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,905
SECRETARY: No problem.

01:52:16,884 --> 01:52:17,965

BILL: Hi.

1109
01:52:24,642 --> 01:52:27,304
Any calls for me?

1110
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,479
ALICE: Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1111
01:52:32,775 --> 01:52:35,233
-Hey, gang.
-Hi, Daddy.

1112
01:52:36,153 --> 01:52:38,064
Look, I got all these right.

1113
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:40,271
You got all of those right?

1114
01:52:40,825 --> 01:52:42,566
Every single one of them?

1115
01:52:42,952 --> 01:52:44,238
That's good.

1116
01:52:44,453 --> 01:52:46,035
You hungry?

1117
01:52:47,163 --> 01:52:48,449
Sort of.

1118
01:52:48,665 --> 01:52:50,451
Want to eat at 7?

1119
01:52:50,667 --> 01:52:52,999
Seven? Listen, can we make that earlier?

1120
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:57,170
I have some appointments at the office.

1121
01:52:57,382 --> 01:52:59,419
You have to go out again tonight?

1122
01:52:59,676 --> 01:53:00,666
I'm afraid so.

1123
01:53:00,844 --> 01:53:04,337
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1124
01:53:04,973 --> 01:53:07,431
We'll see about that, okay?

1125
01:53:10,019 --> 01:53:12,101
HELENA: He could be a watchdog…

1126
01:53:12,313 --> 01:53:13,803
We'll see.

1127
01:53:14,023 --> 01:53:16,765
ALICE: Come on,
baby, let's finish this off.

1128
01:53:17,026 --> 01:53:20,610
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1129
01:53:20,822 --> 01:53:25,441
And Mike has $1.75.

1130
01:53:25,702 --> 01:53:29,320
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1131
01:53:29,539 --> 01:53:31,871
HELENA: $0.75?

1132
01:53:33,793 --> 01:53:37,206
ALICE: So is it gonna be a
subtraction or an addition?

1133
01:53:40,924 --> 01:53:44,212
"How much more" means
that it would be a subtraction.

1134
01:53:44,386 --> 01:53:47,424
Yeah, because you're
going to be taking. Right.

Of course it was Nick's fault.

02:16:22,675 --> 02:16:25,884
all they did was put
Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1301
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:30,050
By now he's probably back with his family

1302
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:32,556
banging Mrs. Nick.

1303
02:16:33,852 --> 02:16:37,095
The clerk said he had
a bruise on his face.

1304
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:42,354
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1305
02:16:43,445 --> 02:16:46,403
That's a hell of a lot
less than he deserves.

1306
02:16:47,241 --> 02:16:51,360
I don't think you realize what kind
of trouble you were in last night.

1307
02:16:52,788 --> 02:16:54,904
Who do you think those people were?

1308
02:16:55,582 --> 02:16:57,698
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1309
02:16:57,918 --> 02:17:01,252
If I told you their names... I'm
not gonna tell you their names,

1310
02:17:01,463 --> 02:17:05,206
but if I did, I don't
think you'd sleep so well.

1311
02:17:08,846 --> 02:17:10,962
Was it the second password?

1312
02:17:12,349 --> 02:17:14,090
Is that what gave me away?

1313
02:17:16,228 --> 02:17:18,468
Yes, finally.

1314
02:17:20,606 --> 02:17:22,893
But not because you didn't know it.

1315
02:17:24,819 --> 02:17:27,732
It's because there was
no second password.

1316
02:17:28,948 --> 02:17:33,442
Of course it didn't help a whole
lot that those people arrive in limos,

1317
02:17:33,661 --> 02:17:36,153
and you showed up in a taxi.

1318
02:17:36,414 --> 02:17:40,123
Or that they found the receipt
from the rental house in your coat

1319
02:17:40,334 --> 02:17:43,452
made out to you-know-who.

1320
02:17:52,847 --> 02:17:54,463
There was a…

1321
02:17:58,519 --> 02:18:00,226
There was a…

1322
02:18:01,188 --> 02:18:04,647
There was a woman there…

1323
02:18:10,447 --> 02:18:12,233
Who tried to warn me.

1324
02:18:17,913 --> 02:18:19,153
I know.

1325
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:26,661
Do you know who she was?

1326
02:18:32,010 --> 02:18:33,171
Yes.

1327
02:18:40,685 --> 02:18:42,392
She was a hooker.

1328
02:18:51,947 --> 02:18:53,608
Sorry, but

1329
02:18:54,783 --> 02:18:56,774
that's what she was.

1330
02:19:01,205 --> 02:19:02,366
A hooker.

1331
02:19:12,007 --> 02:19:13,213
Bill…

1332
02:19:17,221 --> 02:19:19,713
Suppose I told you

1333
02:19:21,350 --> 02:19:24,263
that everything that
happened to you there

1334
02:19:25,771 --> 02:19:29,890
the threats, the girl's warnings

1335
02:19:30,109 --> 02:19:32,851
her last-minute intervention

1336
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:36,859
suppose I said that all of that

1337
02:19:38,242 --> 02:19:40,904
was staged.

1338
02:19:43,038 --> 02:19:46,906
That it was a kind of charade.

1339
02:19:48,502 --> 02:19:50,458
That it was fake.

1340
02:19:55,049 --> 02:19:56,414
Fake?

1341
02:19:58,177 --> 02:20:00,760
Yes. Fake.

1342
02:20:12,275 --> 02:20:14,186
Why would they do that?

1343
02:20:15,028 --> 02:20:16,268
VICTOR: Why?

1344
02:20:17,572 --> 02:20:19,279
In plain words

1345
02:20:20,158 --> 02:20:22,695
to scare the living shit out of you.

1346
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:27,283
To keep you quiet about where you'd been,

1347
02:20:27,790 --> 02:20:29,497
and what you'd seen.

1348
02:20:49,603 --> 02:20:51,185
Have you seen this?

1349
02:21:08,538 --> 02:21:10,529
Yes, I have.

1350
02:21:16,004 --> 02:21:19,122
I saw her body in the morgue.

1351
02:21:23,637 --> 02:21:25,093
Was she…

1352
02:21:27,933 --> 02:21:31,141
Was she the woman at the party?

1353
02:21:38,984 --> 02:21:40,224
VICTOR: Yes.

1354
02:21:43,447 --> 02:21:44,903
She was.

1355
02:21:55,751 --> 02:21:57,082
Victor…

1356
02:21:59,171 --> 02:22:01,754
The woman lying dead in the morgue…

1357
02:22:03,759 --> 02:22:05,625
Was the woman at the party.

1358
02:22:08,055 --> 02:22:09,216
Yes.

1359
02:22:14,311 --> 02:22:19,181
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1360
02:22:20,067 --> 02:22:23,559
You called it a fake, a charade.

1361
02:22:25,196 --> 02:22:28,564
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade

1362
02:22:28,825 --> 02:22:32,659
ends with somebody turning up dead?

1363
02:22:38,585 --> 02:22:43,204
Okay, Bill, let's cut
the bullshit. All right?

1364
02:22:43,423 --> 02:22:46,211
You've been way out of your
depth for the last 24 hours.

1365
02:22:46,467 --> 02:22:49,967
You want to know what kind of
charade? I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1366
02:22:51,181 --> 02:22:54,845
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice

1367
02:22:55,059 --> 02:22:59,644
that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1368
02:22:59,856 --> 02:23:03,474
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1369
02:23:03,693 --> 02:23:06,731
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1370
02:23:08,156 --> 02:23:12,570
When they took her
home, she was just fine,

1371
02:23:13,202 --> 02:23:14,943
and the rest is in the paper.

1372
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:18,829
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1373
02:23:19,041 --> 02:23:23,251
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1374
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:29,591
Come on. It was always gonna
be just a matter of time with her.

1375
02:23:29,968 --> 02:23:31,718
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1376
02:23:31,803 --> 02:23:35,671
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1377
02:23:52,574 --> 02:23:56,693
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1378
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:59,782
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1379
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:03,581
But life goes on.

1380
02:24:04,001 --> 02:24:05,412
It always does

1381
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:07,126
until it doesn't.

1382
02:24:08,756 --> 02:24:10,622
But you know that, don't you?

1383
02:27:35,292 --> 02:27:37,784
I'll tell you everything.

1384
02:27:43,216 --> 02:27:45,503
I'll tell you everything.

1385
02:28:37,353 --> 02:28:39,560
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1386
02:28:56,455 --> 02:29:00,790
She's expecting us to take
her Christmas shopping today.

1387
02:29:25,525 --> 02:29:26,606
That's nice.

1388
02:29:26,859 --> 02:29:29,442
I could put Sabrina in here.

1389
02:29:30,196 --> 02:29:32,608
It's really pretty.

1390
02:29:32,824 --> 02:29:34,815
It's old-fashioned.

1391
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:45,200
He's big.

1392
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:48,833
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1393
02:29:49,048 --> 02:29:50,334
You do?

1394
02:29:52,635 --> 02:29:54,842
Well, you're gonna have to wait and see.

1395
02:30:00,851 --> 02:30:01,966
Alice?

1396
02:30:08,984 --> 02:30:11,021
What do you think we should do?

1397
02:30:16,199 --> 02:30:17,655
What do I think we should do?

1398
02:30:17,909 --> 02:30:19,195
HELENA: Look, Mommy!

1399
02:30:28,545 --> 02:30:31,207
What do I think? I don't know.

1400
02:30:33,383 --> 02:30:35,169
I mean, maybe…

1401
02:30:47,189 --> 02:30:50,681
Maybe I think

1402
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:53,732
we should be grateful.

1403
02:30:59,742 --> 02:31:01,324
Grateful

1404
02:31:01,911 --> 02:31:06,906
that we've managed to
survive through all of our

1405
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:09,457
adventures…

1406
02:31:11,921 --> 02:31:14,253
Whether they were real,

1407
02:31:14,757 --> 02:31:16,998
or only a dream.

1408
02:31:26,268 --> 02:31:30,102
Are you sure of that?

1409
02:31:34,026 --> 02:31:35,642
Am I sure?

1410
02:31:51,459 --> 02:31:53,200
Only as sure as I am

1411
02:31:53,461 --> 02:31:57,295
that the reality of one night

1412
02:31:58,591 --> 02:32:01,458
let alone that of a whole lifetime…

1413
02:32:03,972 --> 02:32:06,384
Can ever be the whole truth.

1414
02:32:13,148 --> 02:32:15,139
And no dream is ever

1415
02:32:17,026 --> 02:32:18,812
just a dream.

1416
02:32:27,287 --> 02:32:29,368
The important thing is

1417
02:32:31,248 --> 02:32:32,989
we're awake now,

1418
02:32:34,293 --> 02:32:36,625
and hopefully…

1419
02:32:39,673 --> 02:32:41,880
For a long time to come.

1420
02:32:45,554 --> 02:32:47,044
Forever.

1421
02:32:49,224 --> 02:32:50,680
Forever?

1422
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:54,510
Forever.

1423
02:32:56,899 --> 02:33:00,517
Let's not use that word. You know?

1424
02:33:01,862 --> 02:33:03,819
It frightens me.

1425
02:33:14,082 --> 02:33:17,200
But I do love you…

1426
02:33:20,338 --> 02:33:22,045
And you know

1427
02:33:23,174 --> 02:33:25,336
there is something very important

1428
02:33:25,593 --> 02:33:28,301
that we need to do as soon as possible.

1429
02:33:29,639 --> 02:33:30,925
What's that?

1430
02:33:34,101 --> 02:33:35,557
Fuck.
