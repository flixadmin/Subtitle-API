1
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,240
I hear they might promote Bryukhanov.

2
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,578
This little problem we have
with the safety test,

3
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,914
if it's completed successfully...

4
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:48,002
Yes, I think promotion's very likely.

5
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,047
Who knows, maybe Moscow.

6
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,426
Naturally, they'll put me in charge
once he's gone,

7
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,262
and then I'll need someone
to take my old job.

8
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,308
I could pick Sitnikov.

9
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,943
I would like to be considered.

10
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,865
We'll keep that in mind.

11
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:23,913
Viktor Petrovich, preparations
for the test have gone smoothly.

12
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:27,291
Comrade Dyatlov's been working
per my instructions,

13
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,836
and Reactor 4 output's been
reduced to 1,600 megawatts.

14
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,007
With your approval, we're ready
to continue lowering power to...

15
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,258
We have to wait.

16
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:38,928
Is, uh...

17
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:41,972
Are you going to ask me
if there's a problem, Nikolai?

18
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,266
You can't read a fucking face?

19
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,228
Three years,
I've tried to finish this test.

20
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,437
Three years.

21
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,114
I've just had a call from
the grid controller in Kiev.

22
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,366
He says we can't
lower power any further,

23
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,742
not for another 10 hours.

24
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,661
A grid controller?
Where does he get off...

25
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,372
It's not the grid controller's
decision, Dyatlov.

26
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,874
It's the end of the month.

27
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,420
All the productivity quotas.

28
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,214
Everyone's working overtime.
The factories need power.

29
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,049
Someone's pushing down from above.

30
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,676
Not that we'll never know who.

31
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,303
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

32
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,603
So, do we have to scrap it or what?

33
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,480
No, I don't think so.

34
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,733
If we need to wait 10 hours, we wait.

35
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:38,237
Running at half power, we're not
going to have stability issues?

36
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,948
- No, I should think...
- I'm not asking you.

37
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,327
DYATLOV: It's safe.

38
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,204
We'll maintain at 1,600.

39
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,707
I'll go home, get some sleep,
come back tonight.

40
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,041
We'll proceed then.

41
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,003
I'll personally supervise the test.

42
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,547
And it will be completed.

43
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,886
Well, I'm not waiting around, then.

44
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,555
Call me when it's done.

45
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,237
How do you feel?

46
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,200
You went to the doctor yesterday.
How is your health?

47
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,411
You don't know?

48
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,956
CHARKOV: From Vienna.

49
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,666
Do you read German?

50
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,298
It says, "At last a Soviet
scientist who tells the truth."

51
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,967
Obviously, I resent the insinuation,

52
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,176
but I think it's fair to say

53
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,554
you made an excellent impression
at the conference.

54
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:11,056
Turns out, you're quite good at this.

55
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,517
At what? Lying?

56
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,562
Statecraft, Legasov. Statecraft.

57
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,231
The West is now satisfied

58
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,151
that Chernobyl was solely
the result of operator error,

59
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,652
which it essentially was.

60
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,155
We have you to thank for that,

61
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,698
and we intend to.

62
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,079
"Hero of the Soviet Union."

63
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,290
Our highest honor.

64
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,043
They haven't even given it to me.

65
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:42,838
"Promotion to director
of the Kurchatov Institute."

66
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,593
I'm humbled.

67
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,222
I don't think there's anything humble
about you, Valery Alexeyevich.

68
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,183
These rewards are not yours yet.

69
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,644
First, your testimony at the trial.

70
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:00,648
Comrade Charkov,
I understand my duty to the State.

71
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,901
But you gave us assurances.

72
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,154
The reactors would be made safe.

73
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,698
It's been months.
No changes have been made.

74
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:13,118
- No changes even discussed.
- First, the trial.

75
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,914
Once it's over,
we will have our villains,

76
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,167
we will have our hero,
we will have our truth.

77
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,129
After that,
we can deal with the reactors.

78
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,491
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

79
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,035
(SIGHS)

80
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,424
Did you take a train?

81
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,010
Yes, I took a train.

82
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,763
Now let's talk about Vienna.

83
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,474
I'm not here to scold you.

84
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,478
I know how the world works
despite what Shcherbina says.

85
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,690
So, why are you here?

86
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,693
Because I'm brutally stubborn.

87
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,070
Which you were hoping for.

88
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,287
Charkov is saying they're going to fix
the reactors after the trial.

89
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,458
- Do you believe him?
- (SNICKERS)

90
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,171
The State will never
willingly fix the reactors

91
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,591
because acknowledging the problem
means admitting that they lied.

92
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,384
They will have to be forced.

93
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,812
At the trial,
you're going to tell the truth.

94
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,857
You're going to convince the jury.

95
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,609
It's a show trial.

96
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,278
The jury's already been
handed their verdict.

97
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,696
I'm not talking about them.

98
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,953
The Central Committee have invited
members of the scientific community

99
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,454
to observe the trial.

100
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,874
Our colleagues, from Kurchatov,

101
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,377
from Sredmash, from Minenergo,

102
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,047
they will be sitting in the crowd
listening to every word you say.

103
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,341
A jury that only we know is there.

104
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,928
And when your testimony arrives
at the moment of the explosion?

105
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,016
That is when our jury
will finally hear the truth.

106
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,728
- And do what with it?
- Insist on reform.

107
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,649
Not just to the RBMK,
but the entire industry.

108
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,733
No, no, no.

109
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,318
- They can't function without us.
- No, no, no.

110
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,403
If we...

111
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,532
Do you know what happened to Volkov,
the man whose report you found?

112
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,995
They just removed him
from his position at the Institute.

113
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,206
Sacked for the crime of knowing.

114
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:52,212
And you think that these scientists,
handpicked to witness a show trial,

115
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,507
will somehow be stirred
into action by me?

116
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,803
Because of some heroic stance
I take in defiance of the State?

117
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,138
Yes.

118
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,264
Why?

119
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,767
Because you're Valery Legasov,
and you mean something.

120
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,606
I'd like to think that if I spoke out,
it would be enough.

121
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,734
But I know how the world works.

122
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,781
They will shoot me, Khomyuk.

123
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,496
You told me to find out what happened.

124
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,707
I spoke to dozens of people.

125
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,002
Every word they said, I wrote down.

126
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,588
All in these books.

127
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,507
These are the ones
who are still alive.

128
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,217
These are the ones who are dead.

129
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,928
They died rescuing each other.

130
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,264
Putting out fires,
tending to the wounded.

131
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,099
They didn't hesitate.
They didn't waiver.

132
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,268
They simply did what had to be done.

133
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,353
So have I.

134
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,647
So have I.

135
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,816
I went willingly to an open reactor.

136
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,153
So I've already given my life.

137
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,697
Isn't that enough?

138
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,993
No, I'm sorry, but it is not.

Comrade Legasov of the Kurchatov

163
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,467
and Comrade Boris
Evdokimovich Shcherbina,

164
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,637
Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers

165
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,515
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

166
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,078
(DOOR CLOSES)

167
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:10,554
It began with,
of all things, a safety test.

168
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,516
Why was there need
for a safety test at all?

169
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,395
Reactor number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

170
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:23,817
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

171
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,863
Eleven days later,
on the last day of the year,

172
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,201
plant director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document,

173
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:39,624
certifying the completion
of the construction of the reactor.

174
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,671
As a result of finishing the work
before the end of the year,

175
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,801
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

176
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,264
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

177
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,727
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

178
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,607
But their work was not finished.

179
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,528
And this document was a lie.

180
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,490
In order to sign this certificate,

181
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,953
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

182
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,830
and yet, one remained.

183
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:26,504
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

184
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,716
A series of pumps, here and here,

185
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,844
send a constant flow of cooling water
through the core.

186
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,847
The core's heat
turns the water to steam,

187
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,225
and the steam spins the turbine here,

188
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,935
and the result is electricity.

189
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,563
But what if a power plant
has no power?

190
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,193
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

191
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:53,365
A blackout, equipment failure,
or an attack by a foreign enemy?

192
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,326
If there's no power,

193
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,162
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

194
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,998
And without water, the core overheats,

195
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,625
the fuel melts down.

196
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,211
In short, a nuclear disaster.

197
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,420
The solution?

198
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,341
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

199
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,718
So, problem solved?

200
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,470
No.

201
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,598
Bryukhanov knew that the problem
was not solved at all.

202
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,060
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

203
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,521
to reach the speed required

204
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,815
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

205
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,901
and by that time,
it would be too late.

206
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,196
So we arrive at the safety test.

207
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,783
The theory was this,

208
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,077
if the facility lost power,

209
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,037
the turbine, which had been spinning,

210
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,999
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

211
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,877
What if you could take the electricity
it was still generating

212
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,421
and transfer it to the pumps?

213
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:53,341
What if the dying turbine could keep
the pumps working long enough

214
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,512
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

215
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,723
(COUGHS)

(COUGHS)

217
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,019
Any questions?

218
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,815
No. Continue, please.

219
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,986
To test this theory,

220
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:17,490
the reactor is placed in a reduced
power mode, 700 megawatts,

221
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,326
to simulate a blackout condition.

222
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,329
Then the turbines are turned off,

223
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,372
and as they slowly spin down,

224
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,291
their electrical output is measured

225
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,336
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

226
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,504
The science is strong,

227
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:37,260
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

228
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,598
Now, the first time they tried,
they failed.

229
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,601
The second time they tried,
they failed.

230
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,395
The third time they tried,
they failed.

231
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,815
The fourth time they tried

232
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,527
was April 26th, 1986.

233
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,416

(LOW INDISTINCT CHATTER)

236
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,275
To understand
what happened that night,

237
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,403
we have to go back 10 hours earlier,

238
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,864
April 25th, the day the test
was meant to take place.

239
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,410
By 2:00 in the afternoon,
the reactor has been lowered by half

240
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,621
from its normal output level
of 3,200 megawatts

241
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,957
to 1,600 megawatts and is stable

242
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,960
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test,

243
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,586
700 megawatts.

244
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,882
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

245
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,303
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

246
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,682
a further reduction in the electricity
until after midnight.

247
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,101
They are asking for a 10-hour delay.

248
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,229
This is the first critical moment,

249
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,940
the first link
in the chain of disaster.

250
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,402
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

251
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,364
These three men allowed it to proceed.

252
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,201
Why was this delay so dangerous?

253
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,454
It created two problems.

254
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,290
One of them is scientific in nature,

255
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,668
and the other is very human.

256
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,754
This is the one
we will consider first.

257
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,759
At midnight, there is a shift change.

He's got more hair on his face
than on his balls.

there's instructions of what to do,

00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,377
of his mission into space

319
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,629
until the moment
that he is on the launch pad.

320
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,964
I want you to imagine that all he has

321
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,634
is a list of instructions
that he has never seen before,

322
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,761
some of which have been crossed out.

323
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:16,015
This is exactly what was happening
in the control room of Reactor 4.

324
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,394
The night shift had not been trained
to perform the experiment.

325
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,063
They hadn't even been
warned it was happening.

326
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,065
Leonid Toptunov,

327
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,734
the operator
responsible for controlling

328
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,278
and stabilizing the reactor
that night was

329
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,699
all of 25 years old.

330
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,035
And his total experience on the job?

331
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,371
Four months.

332
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,875
This is the human problem
created by the delay.

333
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,879
But inside the reactor core,

334
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,090
in the space
between the atoms themselves,

335
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,260
something far more dangerous
is forming.

336
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,761
A poison.

337
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,348
The time is 28 past midnight.

338
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,744
Comrade Legasov.

339
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,433
(TROLLEY RUMBLING)

340
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,825
I'm pleased to see some
of my colleagues here

341
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,578
from the Kurchatov Institute
and Minenergo.

342
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,081
(CLEARS THROAT) But you don't
need to be a nuclear scientist

343
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,167
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

344
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,295
You only need to know this.

345
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:14,050
There are essentially two things
that happen inside a nuclear reactor.

346
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:20,515
The reactivity, which generates power,
either goes up or it goes down.

347
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,183
That's it.

348
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,895
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

349
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,066
Uranium fuel.

350
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:37,406
As uranium atoms split apart
and collide, reactivity goes up.

351
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,450
But if you don't balance
the reactivity,

352
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,536
it never stops rising. So...

353
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,207
Boron control rods.

354
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,962
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

355
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:56,175
But there's a third factor
to consider, water.

356
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,388
Cool water takes heat
out of the system.

357
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,808
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void."

358
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,311
In an RBMK reactor
of the type used at Chernobyl,

359
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:11,232
there's something called
a "positive void coefficient."

360
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,483
What does that mean?

361
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,697
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

362
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,866
the higher the reactivity,

363
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,869
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

364
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:23,953
which means...

365
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:28,291
It would appear we have
a vicious cycle on our hands.

366
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,419
And we would, were it not for this...

367
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:42,930
And we would, were it not for this,

368
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,308
the negative temperature coefficient.

369
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:52,315
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive,

370
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,526
so fuel increases reactivity.

371
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,113
Control rods and water reduce it.

372
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,574
Steam increases it,

373
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,118
and the rise in temperature
reduces it.

374
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,706
This is the invisible dance

375
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:12,460
that powers entire cities
without smoke or flame.

376
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,879
And it is beautiful,

377
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,465
when things are normal.

378
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,219
As uranium splits apart
to release energy,

379
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:25,723
it breaks down
into a new element, xenon.

380
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,726
Xenon reduces reactivity.

381
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,354
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

382
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,357
When the core
is running at full power,

383
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,318
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

384
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,612
But because of the delay,

385
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:44,533
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has been held
at half power for 10 hours.

386
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,495
The xenon did not burn away.

387
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,291
It built up, poisoning the core.

388
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,503
We're starting to lose balance.

389
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:59,382
- (COUGHING)
- LEGASOV: At 28 minutes past midnight,

390
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,468
the reactor is now primed
to slow down.

391
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,514
And yet, in less than an hour,
it will explode.

392
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,643
If you can't understand
how a stalled nuclear reactor

393
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,437
could lead to an explosion,
I don't blame you.

394
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,274
After all, you don't work in the
control room of a nuclear power plant.

395
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,569
But as it turned out,

396
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:24,657
the men who did
didn't understand it either.

397
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,081
Easy now.

398
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,708
Take it down.

399
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,836
Good. Like that.

00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,421
DYATLOV: You should have
finished by now.

401

We're following protocol
for reduction rate.

402
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,383
You're procrastinating.

403
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,927
There are 10 other men in this plant
who would've done it already.

404
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,346
(WHISPERS) Keep working.
You're doing fine.

405
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:00,234
Kirschenbaum, come get me
when these old women are ready.

406
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,610
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

408
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:25,468
Okay, very slow now.
Let's ease it down to 700.

409
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,141
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow.
- I didn't move any rods there.

410
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:45,154
- What is this?
- I'm not even touching it.

411
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,305
We did everything right.

412
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,765
I think that
maybe the core is poisoned.

413
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,266
Well, if you thought
the core was poisoned,

414
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,894
then you didn't do everything right,
because you're choking my reactor!

415
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,020
Get it back up!

416
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,314
I think if we turn off LAC,

417
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,316
it may be possible
to get more control.

418

- Do it. Go.
- Switch off local automatic control.

We have to shut all the way down.

- No.
- AKIMOV: We could be in a xenon pit.

We have to shut down
and wait 24 hours.

No. We're doing the test tonight.
Raise power to 700.

- Don't talk to me about rules.

- No, no. We fell from 50%.

438
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,415
- AKIMOV: 50% is even worse.
- The rules don't say 50.

There is no rule!

440
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,753
Comrade Dyatlov, I apologize,
but what you're saying makes no sense.

441
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,755
- Raise the power.
- No.

442
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,967
I won't do it. It isn't safe.

443
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,062
Safety first. Always.

444
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,399
I've been saying that for 25 years.

445
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,484
That's how long
I've done this job, 25 years.

446
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:48,861
Is that longer than you, Akimov?

447
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,029
Yes.

448
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,323
- Is it much longer?
- Yes.

449
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,950
And you with your mother's tit
barely out of your mouth?

450
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,705
So if I say it's safe, it's safe.

00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,500
"but if I didn't do what he said,
I would be fired."

Leonid Toptunov.

476
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,880
One day before he died.

477
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,800
No, Comrade Dyatlov,
you were in the room.

478
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,636
You ordered them to raise the power.
This is a fact.

Court is now in recess.
Thirty minutes.

(COUGHING)

483
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,363
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

484
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,407
Not really, no.

485
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,244
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

486
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:49,458
The Jews were killed in pogroms,
and Stalin forced the Poles out.

487
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:53,379
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

488
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,631
But after the war,

489
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,051
people came to live here anyway.

490
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:04,014
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

491
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,307
but they didn't care.

492
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,103
Dead Jews, dead Poles.

493
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,355
But not them.

494
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,194
No one ever thinks
it's going to happen to them.

495
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,406
And here we are.

496
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,375
How much time?

497
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,752
Maybe a year.

498
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,423
They call it a... (COUGHS)

499
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,675
They call it a "long illness."

500
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,468
It doesn't seem very long to me.

501
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,763
I know you told me,
and I believed you.

502
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,933
But time passed, and I thought

503
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,519
it wouldn't happen to me.

504
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,021
I wasted it.

505
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,816
I wasted it all for nothing.

506
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,361
For nothing?

507
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,615
Do you remember that morning
when I first called you,

508
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,617
how unconcerned I was?

509
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,578
I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

510
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,957
but when they told me they were
putting me in charge of the cleanup

511
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,419
and they said it wasn't serious,
I believed them.

512
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,422
You know why?

513
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,884
Because they put you in charge.

514
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:23,886
(SOFTLY) Yeah.

515
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,391
I'm an inconsequential man, Valery.

516
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,852
That's all I've ever been.

517
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:35,981
I hoped that one day
I would matter, but I didn't.

518
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:41,195
I just stood next to people who did.

519
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,116
There are other scientists like me.

520
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,577
Any one of them could
have done what I did.

521
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,870
But you...

522
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,791
Everything we asked for,
everything we needed.

523
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,630
Men, material, lunar rovers.

524
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,384
Who else could have done these things?

525
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,264
They heard me,
but they listened to you.

526
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:14,102
Of all the ministers
and all the deputies,

527
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:17,814
entire congregation of obedient fools,

528
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,735
they mistakenly sent the one good man.

529
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,821
For God's sakes, Boris,

530
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,242
you were the one who mattered most.

531
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,058
Ah, it's beautiful.

532
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,784
- (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
- (SIGHS)

533
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,935
STEPASHIN: Comrade Legasov.

534
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,575
LEGASOV: The time is 38 past midnight.

535
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,411
The reactor is nearly shut down.

536
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,872
The operators of Reactor 4 are locked

537
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,124
on a path that leads
directly to disaster.

538
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,335
There's no way to turn back.

539
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:04,212
They do not yet know it,
but the die is cast.

540
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:08,675
At 30 megawatts,
xenon is still being created,

541
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,510
but none of it is burning away.

542
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,681
The reactor is drowning in poison.

543
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:19,102
To make matters worse,
the reactor isn't hot enough

544
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,772
to produce sufficient steam.

545
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:26,485
The only way to safely raise
power from this state

546
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:30,906
is to do it very, very slowly
over the course of 24 hours.

547
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,992
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

548
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,996
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action.

549
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,249
They begin pulling control rods out.

550
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:42,918
Dozens at a time.

551
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,004
Halfway out,
three-quarters of the way out,

552
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,882
still, the power does not budge.

553
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,677
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

554
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,555
There were 211 control rods
in Reactor 4.

555
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:00,310
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

556
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:04,398
Remember, control rods
are the brakes on this car.

557
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:11,613
Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

558
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:15,909
As for the fuel, it's gone cold,

559
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,994
so the negative
temperature coefficient

560
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,664
is no longer
weighing down the reactivity.

561
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:24,626
But even still,
the xenon poisoning is so strong,

562
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,296
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

563
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,508
The control rods are out.

564
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,428
The emergency system
has been disconnected.

565
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,680
The only thing keeping
the reactor in check

566
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,349
is water and xenon.

567
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:43,353
It's 1:00 in the morning.
The test is minutes away.

568
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:20,015
I'm sorry, this is all we can get.

569
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,934
It's 200 megawatts.
We've pulled almost everything out.

570
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,978
If that's all we have,
that's all we have.

571
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,982
- But the test requires 700.
- Stolyarchuk, let's get ready.

572
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,734
- Switch on pump four.
- AKIMOV: No, wait a second.

573
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,778
- DYATLOV: Stolyarchuk...
- We have barely enough steam as it is.

574
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,280
The turbine is going too slow for
the test to deliver any valid results.

575
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,740
- It's enough.
- And if we add more water,

576
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,492
- there will be even less...
- I said it's enough.

577
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:39,743
I know what I'm doing. Stolyarchuk.

578
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,459
Main pump four, connected.

579
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,544
We should warn Khodemchuk.
The pipes are gonna be...

580
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,129
Never mind him. Kirschenbaum?

581
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:54,424
(ALARM SOUNDING)

582
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:57,219
The steam in the separator drum
is too low, five atmospheres.

583
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,013
All right, let's all help him.
Get it up as best you can.

584
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,226
(ALARM CONTINUES)

585
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,393
We should stop.

586
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,729
DYATLOV: Turn that fucking thing off.

587
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,524
You have 15 minutes.

588
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,568
LEGASOV: Fifteen minutes.

589
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,239
They may as well have had 15 days.

590
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,325
The problem they were facing
was not solvable.

591
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,036
The power was too low.
The water was too high.

592
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,746
The test was already ruined.

593
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,791
The results would have been useless,
but Dyatlov didn't care.

594
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,919
All he wanted to do was
report a completed test.

595
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,506
1:22 a.m.

596
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,092
Less than two minutes remain.

597
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:42,305
Yuvchenko, a mechanical engineer,
is in his office.

598

Perevozchenko,
reactor section foreman,

599
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,146
is in the refueling hall,

high above the 1,000-ton
steel reactor cover.

601
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:56,653
(RUMBLING)

602
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,738
Degtaryenko, Khodemchuk,

603
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:01,616
circulation operators,
are in the pump room.

604
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:07,122
None of them
have been told about the test.

605
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,040
None of them know
what is about to happen.

606
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:14,880
At 1:22 and 30 seconds,
Toptunov sees a report

607
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,592
from the reactor's
SKALA computer system.

608
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,138
Based on the absence
of sufficient control rods,

609
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,391
the computer is recommending
that the reactor be shut down.

610
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,774
Well, of course it's saying that.
It doesn't know we're running a test.

611
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,028
All right, comrades.

612
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,365
Another few minutes,
it will all be over.

613
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:43,825
Kirschenbaum, when you're ready.

614
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,244
We did everything right.

615
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,248
KIRSCHENBAUM: Oscillograph on.

00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,960
Closing number eight throttle valve.

617
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,630
STOLYARCHUK: Generator rotor
beginning rundown.

618
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,799
LEGASOV: 1:23 and four seconds.

619
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:04,512
With every decision, they have pulled
this reactor back like a slingshot,

620
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,640
further than anyone has ever pulled.

621
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,808
Now the test begins.

622
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:12,312
The pumps are shut down,
and they've let go.

623
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,193
The pumps stop moving water
through the reactor.

624
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,947
Uranium fuel is now
unchecked by fresh coolant,

625
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,990
unchecked by control rods.

626
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:27,077
The balance immediately swings
in the opposite direction.

627
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,288
In less than a second,
reactivity increases.

628
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,041
Inside the core,

629
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,460
the remaining water is
quickly converting to steam.

630
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,712

of the rods that enter the core

are the graphite tips.

And when they do,
the reaction in the core,

699

which had been rising, skyrockets.

700

Every last molecule of liquid water
instantly converts to steam,

701

which expands and ruptures
a series of fuel rod channels.

00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,107
It would be embarrassing
to kill you now.

790
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,233
And for what?

791
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,654
Your testimony today
will not be accepted by the State.

792
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,073
It will not be disseminated
in the press.

793
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,575
It never happened.

794
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:02,206
No, you will live,
however long you have,

795
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,751
but not as a scientist, not anymore.

796
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:10,715
You'll keep your title
and your office,

797
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:16,262
but no duties,
no authority, no friends.

798
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:17,680
No one will talk to you.

799
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:19,890
No one will listen to you.

800
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:25,771
Other men, lesser men,

801
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,608
will receive credit
for the things you have done.

802
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,862
Your legacy is now their legacy.

803
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:35,156
You'll live long enough to see that.

804
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,953
What role did Shcherbina play in this?

805
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:42,788
None.

806
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:44,707
He didn't know what I was gonna say.

807
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,711
What role did Khomyuk play in this?

808
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:50,379
None.

809
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,673
She didn't know either.

810
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,678
After all you've said and done today,

811
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:03,392
it would be curious
if you chose this moment to lie.

812
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:10,608
I would think a man of your experience
would know a lie when he hears one.

813
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,948
You will not meet or communicate
with either one of them ever again.

814
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,912
You will not communicate with anyone
about Chernobyl ever again.

815
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,665
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

816
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,626
that when you finally do die,

817
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:32,838
it will be exceedingly hard
to know that you ever lived at all.

818
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,011
And if I refuse?

819
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,309
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

820
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,644
(CHUCKLES)

821
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:49,939
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

822
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,441
Oh, that's perfect.

823
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,152
They should put that on our money.

824
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:28,602

LEGASOV: (ON TAPE)
To be a scientist is to be naive.

826
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:12,021
We are so focused
on our search for truth,

827
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:16,275
we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.

828
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:21,030
But it is always there,
whether we see it or not,

829
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:23,073
whether we choose to or not.

830
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,868
The truth doesn't care
about our needs or wants.

831
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,620
It doesn't care about our governments,

832
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:30,039
our ideologies, our religions.

833
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,959
It will lie in wait for all time.

834
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:39,173
And this, at last,
is the gift of Chernobyl.

835
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,717
Where I once would fear
the cost of truth,

836
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,427
now I only ask,

837
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,556
"What is the cost of lies?"

838
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:56,482
