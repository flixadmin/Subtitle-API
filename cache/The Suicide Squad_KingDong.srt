1
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,215
I got another 15.

2
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,559
Not today, you don't. You're up.

3
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:46,623
You know the deal.

4
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,746
Successfully complete the mission,
you get ten years off your sentence.

5
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:54,800
You fail to follow my orders
in any way

6
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:58,668
and I detonate the explosive device 
in the base of your skull.

7
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,023
Good dog.

8
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,332
We are a black ops unit. Meaning,
nothing you see here ever happened.

9
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,668
Savant.

10
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,957
Your commanding officer
will be Colonel Rick Flag.

11
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:09,857
Or would you rather be called Durlin?

12
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:11,832
I'd rather not be called at all.

13
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,965
But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

14
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:20,150
Well, welcome to "anything".

15
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:27,092
So this is the famous Suicide Squad.

16
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:29,617
Well, we consider that term degrading.

17
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:32,017
The official term is "Task Force X".

18
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:35,950
And love 'em or hate 'em, these are your
brothers and sisters for the next few days.

19
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,207
Oh!

20
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:42,793
Whoa.

21
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,520
Captain Boomerang.

22
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:01,184
Blackguard.

23
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:03,145
Mongal.

24
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:05,469
Javelin.

25
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,192
T.D.K.

26
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:10,664
Weasel.

27
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,633
And, of course...

28
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:17,242
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

29
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:18,785
Hmm, good to know.

30
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:20,403
Flag.

31
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:22,598
Oh, sorry. Comin' through.

32
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:23,832
Hey, Boomer.

33
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:25,633
What are you doing back in prison, Harls?

34
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:27,658
I got road rage. In a bank.

35
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,231
Oh. So sorry.

36
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,089
Comin' through.

37
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:31,200
- Turn it around. 
- There?

38
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,372
- No.
- Here?

39
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:33,403
Put it in there.

40
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,582
- Now you're safe.
- All right.

41
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:36,941
Thanks, man.

42
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:40,442
Prepare for liftoff. And away we go.

43
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,800
Harley and T.D.K.,
have they worked together before?

44
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,891
- Not yet. I'm excited.
- What does Savant do again?

45
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,862
It's Brian Durlin. He's an expert in
weapons and hand-to-hand combat.

46
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:59,283
Yeah, well, I'm putting 20 on him 
that he's gonna bite it.

47
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:02,153
Me too. And Weasel, Boomer and Mongal.

48
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,675
Is Mongal an alien or some type of god?

49
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,050
- What are you doing?
- Oh. Hey.

50
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:08,056
Just making sure 
everything was ready to go.

51
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,340
Just our normal, casual morning meeting.

52
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:11,825
Yeah, I just gotta, uh, do this thing.

53
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,275
Nothing weird about it.

54
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,442
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

55
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,467
Flag.

56
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:20,059
Yeah, we're T-minus five
from the drop.

57
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:22,840
Get the whole team safely 
to that beach, Colonel.

58
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:25,270
You will receive further orders once there.

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,658
We're in a butcher's freezer, Harls,

60
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:46,041
surrounded by dead hogs
hangin' on hooks.

61
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,767
Only they don't know it yet.

62
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,994
Leave him alone, Boomer.

63
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,455
What does T.D.K. stand for?

64
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,447
What?

65
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,252
Your name is T.D.K., correct?

66
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:57,486
Yeah.

67
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,261
And it stands for what?

68
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:03,200
It stands for me. It's what a name is.

69
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,049
Your name is letters?

70
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:07,096
All names are letters, dickhead.

71
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:13,244
I love your accent.

72
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,400
American women all love accents.

73
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,424
We do. 'Cause we don't got none.

74
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,856
Yo, is this a dog?

75
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:22,892
What?

76
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,103
I-Is this thing a dog?

77
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,486
- A... A dog?
- Yes.

78
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,788
What kind of dog do you think it is, mate?

79
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,867
I don't know, I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

80
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:33,559
I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

81
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,689
Since when does an Afghan Hound 
have bloody thumbs?

82
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,752
Oh, my God, is it a werewolf?

83
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:39,705
I've wanted to meet a werewolf forever.

84
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,674
Yo, they sat me next to a werewolf?

85
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,885
Yo, let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

86
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,369
Hey, hey,
he's not a werewolf, okay!

87
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:47,947
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

88
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,166
I mean, he's not harmless,
he's killed 27 children,

89
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,752
but, you know, we got him to...

90
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,717
I think he's agreed to do this.

91
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,767
Whatever the case,
just everyone get into position to drop.

92
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:58,580
Did anyone check on
whether Weasel could swim?

93
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,505
The Weasel is dead!

94
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,528
I repeat, the Weasel is dead.

95
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:46,794
Northeast, all clear. Approach the shore. 
Over.

96
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:48,802
Savant, hold your position.

97
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:50,856
Roger that.

98
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,302
Amateurs.

99
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,487
Waller, we're on the beach and dry.

100
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,784
- Blackguard. 
- Hey, guys! Hey.

101
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,752
Get down, you... 
There's fucking soldiers everywhere!

102
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,235
You can come out now, it's just me.

103
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,219
What the fuck is Blackguard doin'?

104
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:43,791
I'm the one who contacted you.

105
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,533
Is this what's supposed to happen? 
What the fuck?

106
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,573
Blackguard, get back into your position.

107
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:49,265
I brought everybody, look.

108
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,877
They're right behind me.

109
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:52,932
Whoa. Hey.

110
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:55,104
Hey, guys. Whoa.

111
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,842
We got a deal, right? Uh... Uh...

112
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,315
Waller, we're made.

113
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,010
I'm the one who called yo-

114
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,660
Blackguard sold us out.

115
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:11,799
He contacted 
the fucking Corto Maltese Army!

116
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,026
Waller, we need to retreat.

117
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,658
Negative, Flag. 
The mission is too important.

118
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,905
This is a tough group. You can make it.

119
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:20,617
Okey-doke.

120
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,312
Waller, with all due respect,
we're in the middle of a goddamn-

121
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:23,342
Harley, wait!

122
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,658
Whoo-hoo!

123
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:07,085
Zero-two-two-seven is wide open.

124
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,277
Colonel, dispatch The Detachable Kid.

125
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,200
T.D.K., two o'clock!

126
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,437
T.D.K. is "The Detachable Kid"?

127
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:36,976
What the fuck?

128
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:39,702
I didn't pick the damn team!

129
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:42,499
Don't worry, Flag, I got the bird!

130
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,187
Mongal! Don't!

131
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:49,023
Huh?

132
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:02,374
Strewth!

133
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,340
Boomer!

134
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,497
Savant is off the rails.

135
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:41,366
Savant, turn back.

136
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,327
Savant.

137
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:52,187
Savant, I'm warning you, this is desertion.

138
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:55,085
Savant!

139
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,952
This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

140
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:00,515
You are in violation of your agreement!

141
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,950
Oh, please! No.

142
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:10,367
Damn it.

143
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,411
How's Team Two holding up?

144
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,606
Team Two, check. Set point bravo.

145
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,342
All troops on the south beach are engaged.

146
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,794
Team Two is clear to go
on the north beach.

147
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:42,528
Congratulations, Bloodsport.

148
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,544
How'd you do it, Waller?

149
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,758
There's no soldiers 
out here on patrol at all.

150
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:03,380
Let's just say they were distracted.

151
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,245
Oh, jeez.

152
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:19,426
Oh.

153
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,005
Here you go, champ.

154
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,223
Excuse me.

155
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,411
Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

156
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:36,262
Robert DuBois.

157
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:41,471
A world-class marksman.
In his hands, anything is a deadly weapon.

158
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:46,364
His father was a mercenary who trained his
son to kill from the moment he was born.

159
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:50,715
He's in prison for putting Superman
in the ICU with a kryptonite bullet.

160
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:51,876
DuBois?

161
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,856
Same answer as the last time.

162
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,372
Piss off.

163
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:00,676
I'm not joining your goddamn Suicide Squad.

164
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,387
We'll see.

165
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,908
You have a visitor.

166
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,408
They said you got in trouble.

167
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:23,549
I stole.

168
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,067
You stole what?

169
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,965
- A style watch.
- A star latch?

170
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,910
A style watch. You can watch TV on it.

171
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,911
Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?

172
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:36,270
I don't know.

173
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,294
Next time you want to nick something, 
you take a partner,

174
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:40,817
and they can be your lookout.

175
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:42,653
That's your advice?

176
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:43,595
Yeah.

177
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,278
You're a terrible father.

178
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,090
Hey, I didn't ask to be a father 
in the first place.

179
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,442
You make that perfectly clear.

180
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,387
Your mother sprung that one on me.

181
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,989
Well, she's not around anymore,
so you can lay off of her, okay?

182
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:55,981
Oh, I tried to lay off her, but then
she dragged out the paternity test.

183
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:57,548
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

184
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:58,948
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

185
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,369
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

186
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,977
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

187
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:03,293
Fuck you!

188
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,341
I can't believe you don't care that 
I stole, only that I got caught!

189
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,934
I don't only care that you got caught,

190
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,138
I care that you got caught for stealing
something as stupid as a fucking TV watch!

191
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,060
It does other things too!

192
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:17,904
But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do! It's embarrassing!

193
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:22,177
No, what's fucking embarrassing
is having you as my father.

194
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,060
Yeah, well, I told you, Tyla,
when I came here that

195
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:37,558
any goodness I ever had in me had
been wrung out bare by my old man.

196
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,955
And I also told you to go out there 
and do your own thing

197
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,220
and stay far away from me
or anyone like me, didn't I?

198
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:49,181
So, why are you here when you and I both 
know I have nothing good to offer you?

199
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:54,242
Because my court date is coming up,

200
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,946
and Miss Waller said 
maybe you could help me out.

201
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:00,050
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

202
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:02,242
you're gonna send 
my 14-year-old daughter to prison?

203
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,267
No.

204
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,384
Your daughter is 16, DuBois.

205
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,345
You're a real father of the year.

206
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,158
Fine. You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

207
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:11,758
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

208
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:13,845
So, a year in juvie, no fucking problem.

209
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,298
Not juvie.

210
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:19,673
Being 16 in the state of Louisiana
means that under the right circumstances,

211
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,610
she could be tried as an adult.

212
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,441
And, if convicted, could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

213
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,308
And in here, well,

214
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,316
you never know what might happen 
to a frail young thing like that.

215
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,921
Shames me to say

216
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:38,577
that we have the highest mortality
rate in the entire U.S. prison system.

217
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:42,605
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

218
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,425
You're threatening my fucking daughter!

219
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,158
I'm protecting this country.

220
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:47,273
Everyone stand down.

221
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:48,090
Miss Waller, I-

222
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:49,730
Stand down!

223
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,678
I wouldn't take such extreme measures...

224
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,800
Oh, extreme? Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

225
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:02,050
...if this mission weren't more important 
than you could possibly imagine.

226
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,554
Fuck your mission.

227
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,270
You have the military experience necessary,

228
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:07,355
and everything in 
your psychological profile

229
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,575
tells me you have 
what it takes to be a leader.

230
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,467
No, I'm no fucking leader!

231
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:12,925
Then I'll make you one.

232
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,558
Are you in or out?

233
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,918
Good. Let's meet your team.

234
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,121
- Come on.
- Fuck me, man.

235
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:33,133
Let's go.

236
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:34,613
She was gonna kill his kid?

237
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:39,543
Each member of the team is chosen

238
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:42,996
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

239
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:47,633
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

240
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:50,242
In his hands, anything is a deadly weapon.

241
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:52,246
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

242
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,457
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

243
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:55,734
Are you having a laugh?

244
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:56,441
What?

245
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:59,469
You just said each member of the team 
is chosen for their unique abilities.

246
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:00,908
He does exactly what I do.

247
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,996
But better.

248
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:04,722
- I always hit my targets dead center.
- I hit them more in the center.

249
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,199
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

250
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:07,557
- I use smaller bullets.
- What?

251
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,933
They go inside your bullet holes
without even touching the side.

252
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,519
Next up is King Shark.

253
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:13,800
Holy shit.

254
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:15,527
What the fuck?

255
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:20,367
Some people claim that Nanaue is 
a descendant of an ancient shark god.

256
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:22,725
Whatever the case, he's strong and deadly.

257
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,996
Does it talk?

258
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,675
- Book read.
- Wow.

259
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,660
Book's upside-down.

260
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,313
See that? It's pretending to read a book.

261
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:33,567
So smart, me. Enjoy book so much.

262
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:37,050
Be a mite careful, as he's developed 
a taste for human meat.

263
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:37,979
Huh?

264
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,448
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

265
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,065
Ratcatcher 2.

266
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:44,675
Settle down!

267
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,783
Ooh.

268
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:47,391
What, we couldn't afford Ratcatcher 1?

269
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,323
He's dead. This is his daughter.

270
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,870
Cazo, will you be joining us?

271
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,950
I just woke up. I don't function well 
early in the morning.

272
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,589
My deepest apologies for disturbing you.

273
00:20:58,614 --> 00:20:59,842
Hmm, it's all right.

274
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,825
Get your ass out here!

275
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:10,089
Millennials.

276
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,268
Oh, no way.

277
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:16,959
That's not coming with us.

278
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,175
She controls rats.

279
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,592
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

280
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:22,343
This is Sebastian.

281
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:23,917
Say hello, Sebastian.

282
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,745
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

283
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:31,698
And finally, we have Abner Krill.

284
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:34,370
What's that 'round his neck?

285
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:35,633
A power dampener.

286
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,408
They call him the Polka Dot Man.

287
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:41,658
Polka Dot Man.
What's he do, throw polka dots at people?

288
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:45,284
He does.

289
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,426
He throws polka dots at people.

290
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:48,885
Hey, Polka Dot Man,

291
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,425
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

292
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,893
You fucking pussy!

293
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:57,182
These are soldiers?

294
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:58,832
We need to debrief.

295
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,893
Fuck.

296
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:14,737
Corto Maltese is a small island nation
off the coast of South America.

297
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:16,508
Over the past 100 years,

298
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:21,043
the country has been ruled with
an iron fist by the Herrera family.

299
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:25,192
But, a week ago, this guy,

300
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:28,800
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

301
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:31,457
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

302
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:36,742
took control of the Corto Maltese
government in a violent military coup.

303
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:41,725
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

304
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,408
Although the United States did not condone 
the excesses of the Herrera regime,

305
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:49,410
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

306
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:53,644
Luna, however, is virulently anti-American.

307
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:55,223
So, you want us to kill Luna?

308
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,373
No.

309
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:58,582
This is Jotunheim.

310
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,333
A scientific experimentation facility

311
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:05,858
containing something
known only as Project Starfish.

312
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:11,446
Our intelligence sources tell us that
Starfish is extraterrestrial in origin.

313
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,762
In the hands of the Luna regime,

314
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:18,203
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

315
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:26,140
Your mission is to infiltrate Jotunheim and
destroy every trace of Project Starfish.

316
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:27,883
How are we supposed to get in?

317
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:32,992
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker, is a geneticist
in charge of Project Starfish.

318
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:38,804
After hours, he hangs out at a
gentlemen's club known as La Gatita Amable.

319
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,746
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

320
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:44,015
and he can get you into Jotunheim.

321
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,710
Any questions?

322
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,195
What is that?

323
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:52,937
That is an overhead projector.

324
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:54,507
Do you ever use it anymore?

325
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,894
No, not really.

326
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,882
So, why don't you just throw it away?

327
00:23:57,907 --> 00:23:59,304
Peacemaker?

328
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:02,548
Starfish is a slang term for a butthole.

329
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:04,093
Think there's any connection?

330
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:07,580
No.

331
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:09,781
No...

332
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:10,842
Nanaue.

333
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,093
...connection.

334
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,326
Hand.

335
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,726
Yes, that is your hand, Nanaue, very good.

336
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:21,462
We're all gonna die.

337
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:23,320
I hope so.

338
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,610
Oh, for fuck's sake.

339
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,601
Control, we have a disturbance 
south of here.

340
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,550
It's just a diversion, Bloodsport.

341
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:57,658
All right, we cut through the jungle 
to get to Valle Del Mar.

342
00:24:57,683 --> 00:24:59,656
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

343
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:00,718
That's the word.

344
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:03,640
How we getting in? 
Especially with Charlie the Tuna here.

345
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:05,082
How the hell am I supposed to know?

346
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:07,783
You're the leader.
You're supposed to be decisive.

347
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:10,658
And I've decided that you should
eat a big bag of dicks, how's that?

348
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:11,867
You're being facetious,

349
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:13,791
but if this whole beach
was completely covered in dicks

350
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,734
and somebody said I had to eat every
dick until the beach was clean for liberty,

351
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,218
I would say no problemo.

352
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:20,910
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

353
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:22,437
Who knows why madmen do what they do?

354
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:23,712
Well, you know what I think?

355
00:25:23,737 --> 00:25:26,398
I think liberty is just your excuse
to do whatever you want.

356
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:30,007
Whether that's to eat a beach
full of dicks or killin' folk.

357
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:34,695
Oh, yeah?

358
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,906
At least I don't kill men for money 
like you.

359
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,431
Oh, here we go.

360
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,773
There's something wrong
with your skin.

361
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:43,734
It's just a rash.

362
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,015
That's a rash?

363
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,783
Oh, no.

364
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:05,309
You...

365
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:08,140
...are the only one...

366
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:13,117
...fit to carry my javelin.

367
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,247
Carry it for...

368
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:48,100
Carry it for who?

369
00:26:48,262 --> 00:26:49,973
For what? What the heck?

370
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:51,817
Who am I supposed to carry it for?

371
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:55,799
This is so frustratin'.

372
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,370
He just told me I have to carry 
this javelin for a reason,

373
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:00,067
but he didn't say why!

374
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,435
Waller? Waller.

375
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:05,997
Waller!

376
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:19,139
All right, we'll camp here, and tomorrow
we'll go straight through to the city

377
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:21,729
to get to La Gatita Amable by nightfall.

378
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,135
What?

379
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:54,501
How deep of a sleeper are you?

380
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:57,796
I was having
the most wonderful dream.

381
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,549
If it was you about to be eaten
by King Shark, then you're psychic.

382
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,408
I don't believe he would do that.

383
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:04,557
He has very kind eyes.

384
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:10,213
Hungry.

385
00:29:10,437 --> 00:29:11,916
You bastard!

386
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:14,596
Uh...

387
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:28,836
All right, calm down with the rats!

388
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:31,331
- What?
- I have a thing with rats.

389
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:33,217
- You have a thing with rats?
- Yes.

390
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:34,686
And you're on a team with me?

391
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,166
Not something I asked for!

392
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,924
What are you laughing at me for, man?
Why the fuck are you in your underwear?

393
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:41,370
Tighty-whities? Really?

394
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:42,452
Now, that's just racist.

395
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,041
No. It's not racist. 
They're tighty-whities.

396
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:46,104
Oh, come the fuck on.

397
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:49,036
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

398
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:50,190
What?

399
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,315
You didn't tell me 
you had a fear of rats, DuBois?

400
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,370
I'm an assassin! 
Why would I share my liabilities?

401
00:29:58,336 --> 00:29:59,586
For fuck's sake.

402
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:03,745
Aw. He's offering you a pretty leaf
to show you he means no harm.

403
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,346
Why the fuck would I want a leaf?

404
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,575
Just get the rats out of here!

405
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:16,948
- Oh, fuck's sake.
- Huh. Cool.

406
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:22,984
Hey, we gonna kill Megalodouche now, 
or what?

407
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,992
Nanaue's the strongest member of your team.
You need him to get into Jotunheim.

408
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,705
Yeah, well,
we can't function as a team

409
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,581
if we gotta watch our back from
one of our own eatin' our bollocks.

410
00:30:33,158 --> 00:30:37,627
Nanaue, would you eat your friends?

411
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:40,823
I no friends.

412
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:43,450
You have no friends?

413
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:49,815
If you did, would you eat them?

414
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,923
Yes.

415
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:58,127
No?

416
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:00,956
Then, can we be your friends?

417
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,575
Come on. He's obviously lying.

418
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:10,354
If I die 'cause I gambled on love,

419
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,666
it will be a worthy death.

420
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:16,604
Friends.

421
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:26,260
You are a little idiot.

422
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,940
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
I'm good at my job.

423
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:41,142
I found him. Check it out.

424
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,174
Look, right here, a mile north.

425
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:48,112
Task Force X, 
you have an additional mission directive.

426
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,573
We've located Colonel Rick Flag.
He's been taken by the enemy.

427
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:52,717
Rick Flag?

428
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,834
I know, you both served on special forces
in Qurac that took down Avral Kaddam.

429
00:31:56,854 --> 00:31:59,370
Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.

430
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:03,198
You had other operatives in Corto Maltese
and didn't tell us?

431
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:07,010
There was no tactical advantage, 
now there is.

432
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,258
I've uploaded the location on your MTS.

433
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:14,323
Terminate his captors 
with extreme prejudice.

434
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:19,209
Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.

435
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:21,984
Recover Flag before moving on to the city.

436
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:28,760
That's where they're holding Flag.

437
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:31,221
Nothing like a bloodbath to start the day.

438
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:33,303
They call you Peacemaker?

439
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:35,389
I cherish peace with all my heart.

440
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:38,448
I don't care how many men, women,
and children I need to kill to get it.

441
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,706
I thought you were the crazy one.

442
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:43,523
I am.

443
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:45,065
All right.

444
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:46,626
Let's get it.

445
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:50,617
Boss.

446
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:52,331
Gracias.

447
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:06,627
No, no, no!

448
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:40,704
No, no, no!

449
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:06,156
Hmm?

450
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,029
Non-lethal. You lose.

451
00:35:13,054 --> 00:35:14,919
Exploding compression bullets.

452
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:20,279
No one likes a show-off.

453
00:35:20,304 --> 00:35:23,029
Unless what they're showing off 
is dope as fuck.

454
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:27,911
Fuck. That's true.

455
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:45,117
He does throw polka dots at people.

456
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,485
I'm sorry it's so... flamboyant.

457
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,005
It looks cool. I think.

458
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:54,905
I don't like to kill people, but 
if I pretend they're my mom, it's easy.

459
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,404
T.M.I., mate.

460
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:06,682
DuBois?

461
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:08,331
Hey, Flag.

462
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:11,385
What the hell are you doing here?

463
00:36:11,743 --> 00:36:14,003
Waller told us that you were...

464
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:15,792
Uh...

465
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,008
Are you drinkin' tea?

466
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,075
This is Sol Soria, she's the leader 
of the freedom fighters,

467
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,434
the resistance trying to take down 
the current government.

468
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,034
They saved my life.

469
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:28,526
Oh, wow.

470
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:32,706
Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

471
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:36,333
We didn't see any people.

472
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:38,839
- Yeah, I didn't see anybody on the way...
- There's no one out there.

473
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,026
I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.

474
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:03,336
Typical Americans.
Just run in, guns blazing.

475
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:05,717
I know, this is messed up.

476
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:08,039
- These guys, they're...
- What's this one do?

477
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:10,883
They're fucking idiots,

478
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:14,360
but right now our objectives
align with yours.

479
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:18,617
If Jotunheim contains the technology
our intelligence says it does,

480
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:21,992
then it could be used on the people
of Corto Maltese as well as Americans.

481
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:26,950
That's why we need your help to
get into the city so we can stop 'em.

482
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,703
Is that rat waving at me?

483
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,899
It appears it is.

484
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,106
Why?

485
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:42,289
I'm gonna guess because it's friendly.

486
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:47,781
Luna and Suarez murdered my entire family.

487
00:37:49,653 --> 00:37:52,352
I'd make a deal with the Devil 
to stop them.

488
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:59,252
Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

489
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,007
to apprehend this Gaius Grieves.

490
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:19,627
Hey.

491
00:38:19,772 --> 00:38:20,691
What is this?

492
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,468
You slaughtered my staff!

493
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:25,148
They were loyal to the Herreras.

494
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:27,632
Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

495
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:30,324
They call you "Thinker", yes?

496
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,717
All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

497
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:36,187
Yes, makes my brain good.

498
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,968
Are you being sarcastic with me?

499
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:40,999
Hey! Hey.

500
00:38:41,024 --> 00:38:42,883
I shall do to you 
as we did to your employees.

501
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:43,968
Hey. Mateo!

502
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:51,908
What is this?

503
00:38:54,103 --> 00:38:56,054
Project Starfish.

504
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,226
It's been the primary focus of 
my experiments here for the past 30 years.

505
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:10,533
Here. What... What is it doing here?

506
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,257
Oh!

507
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:15,187
It is having little babies.

508
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:16,718
Not progeny,

509
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:19,265
extensions of itself.

510
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:25,351
They take hosts, and those hosts in turn 
become part of the central being.

511
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:30,460
It feeds on their consciousnesses.

512
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:35,200
Grows larger, more powerful.

513
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,585
So...

514
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:48,493
...where is this Project Starfish now?

515
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:20,075
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

516
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,132
But as I've noted,

517
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:26,617
I've been working with the beast 
for 30 years.

518
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:30,926
And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

519
00:40:31,551 --> 00:40:32,676
Well, then,

520
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:36,242
welcome to the team.

521
00:40:43,101 --> 00:40:44,217
Si, Camila.

522
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,671
Presidente.

523
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:53,593
You are making a big mistake
throwing me down here!

524
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:58,242
I will be outta here soon enough
and I will kill every last one of you,

525
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:02,142
Colto Maltese-tezios. Maltese-els.

526
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:04,584
Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

527
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:07,468
Whatever you Mario Kart-racing
d-bags are called!

528
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:09,887
Please.

529
00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:11,976
Put this on.

530
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:25,898
Oh, wow.

531
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:31,632
I'm a princess.

532
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:59,019
Senorita Quinn, on behalf of 
the entire staff of Our Honorable General

533
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:02,932
Presidente Silvio Eleuterio Luna,
it's a pleasure to serve you.

534
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:04,996
Gracias.

535
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,983
My mother said to count back again.

536
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:12,993
Ten, nine,

537
00:42:13,336 --> 00:42:15,467
eight, seven, six,

538
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:17,758
five, four, three,

539
00:42:17,783 --> 00:42:22,571
two, one. Ha! Coronel, beat that...

540
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:29,842
Oh.

541
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:32,492
Forgive my appearance, Senorita Quinn.

542
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:39,078
I have admired you from afar 
for many years now.

543
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,328
Senorita.

544
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,728
Me?

545
00:42:43,753 --> 00:42:47,047
You're a hero to me,
as well as to my people.

546
00:42:47,253 --> 00:42:49,795
I think you might got me confused.

547
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,977
Harley Quinn's fire and rebellion
in the face of American oppression

548
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:55,175
is something to which
my entire country aspires.

549
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,336
Oh.

550
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:57,923
I have prepared lunch.

551
00:42:59,398 --> 00:43:01,461
Would you be so kind as to join me?

552
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,453
I'm so kind, sure.

553
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:05,700
You want me to what?

554
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:08,872
To marry me.

555
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:10,492
You're joshing.

556
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,398
Might I be frank, Harley?

557
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,326
You might be.

558
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:18,623
Good, listen.

559
00:44:18,884 --> 00:44:21,717
Since I took control, the majority love me.

560
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:27,668
But some find me to be
an unacceptable leader.

561
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,717
What kinds of dicks would find that?

562
00:44:30,742 --> 00:44:32,950
Don't they know how awesome you are?

563
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:34,434
Have you shown them the birdies?

564
00:44:34,459 --> 00:44:37,693
It may sound archaic to someone 
from your part of the world,

565
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:41,318
but my people, the Corto Malteseans,
they're very old-fashioned.

566
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,435
Corto Malteseans, of course.

567
00:44:43,606 --> 00:44:45,459
And I am a bachelor.

568
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,966
So they want you to get hitched?

569
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:50,616
My people say 
you would make the perfect wife.

570
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,287
Because, you know, 
you symbolize anti-American fervor.

571
00:44:55,718 --> 00:44:56,724
Oh.

572
00:44:57,723 --> 00:44:59,537
But I am a romantic, Harley.

573
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:03,631
I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

574
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:08,693
However, upon spending the day with you,

575
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:13,177
I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

576
00:45:13,658 --> 00:45:15,408
You are perfect in every...

577
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:16,896
You are so freaking hot.

578
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:43,240
Harley Luna.

579
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:47,408
I like the ring of that.

580
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:13,715
That's Jotunheim?

581
00:46:16,312 --> 00:46:20,895
Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War II.

582
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:27,443
They built Jotunheim to continue
their unorthodox experiments.

583
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:32,598
Until the Herrera family accepted
the bounty on the Nazis' heads...

584
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:34,475
...and killed them all.

585
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,724
Wowza.

586
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:38,459
Many years ago, 
the rumors began of a beast.

587
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:43,334
These dark rumors helped the Herrera family
maintain power.

588
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,075
They would send their political enemies
and their families to the fortress,

589
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,506
never to return.

590
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:55,091
I have recently learned
these were not rumors.

591
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:01,341
They were murdering thousands
in bizarre experiments with this creature.

592
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:05,709
Well, it must be a big relief
to got it in your hands now, huh?

593
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:07,490
Absolutely.

594
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,033
Now, it is our enemies 
who shall be fearful.

595
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:18,825
If anyone dares to say a negative word 
about their new president today,

596
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:23,684
their parents, their children,
and anyone they ever loved

597
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:27,113
will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.

598
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,285
I'm sorry.

599
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:36,742
Recently, I made a promise to myself
that the next time I got a boyfriend,

600
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:39,626
I'd be on the lookout for red flags.
And if I saw any,

601
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:41,316
I would do the healthy thing...

602
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:43,575
...and I would murder him.

603
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,450
And killing kids?

604
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:50,467
Kind of a red flag.

605
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:54,189
I know, I know. I know
what you're tryin' to say.

606
00:47:54,214 --> 00:47:55,941
"Harley, why not just leave?"

607
00:47:55,966 --> 00:47:57,966
And I'd say,
"Why are you screaming at me?

608
00:47:57,991 --> 00:48:00,258
"I'm not deaf. I'm standing right here."

609
00:48:00,283 --> 00:48:01,910
And then I'd say,

610
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:06,371
"When your taste in men
is as bad as mine,

611
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,629
they don't just go away quietly.

612
00:48:11,434 --> 00:48:14,217
"They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

613
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:17,723
tell you that the music you like
ain't real music at all."

614
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:19,215
And all the cruelty...

615
00:48:25,923 --> 00:48:27,934
...tears you apart after a while.

616
00:48:40,887 --> 00:48:43,314
You were real pretty and all,

617
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:48,617
and R.I.P. to that absolutely beautiful
monster between your legs, but...

618
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,025
...all in all...

619
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:55,673
...I think you're more pretty like this,

620
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:58,900
with all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

621
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:04,071
I can't believe this thing had a bullet.

622
00:49:08,408 --> 00:49:11,867
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

623
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:30,467
What the hell are you doin'?

624
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:34,800
We're tired, Colonel. We need a rest.

625
00:50:34,825 --> 00:50:36,397
Goddamn hobbyists.

626
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:39,702
We cannot stop. We need to hurry
if you're going to help my people.

627
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,008
Hey. We're not here to help your people.

628
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:44,242
But she's right, we gotta keep moving.

629
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:46,392
I carry friend?

630
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:48,678
It's okay, Nanaue.

631
00:50:51,473 --> 00:50:53,515
It's happening to his face again.

632
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,756
It's nothing, I slipped.

633
00:50:54,781 --> 00:50:55,441
Hey...

634
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:58,600
Norman Bates, if that shit's contagious, 
we need to know.

635
00:50:58,625 --> 00:50:59,639
It's not.

636
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:02,533
- What is it?
- It's a...

637
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:07,428
It's an interdimensional virus.

638
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,858
Fuck is that?

639
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:15,928
My mother was a scientist at S.T.A.R. Labs,
and she was obsessed with turning me

640
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:18,514
and my brothers and sisters
into superheroes.

641
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,069
She infected me.

642
00:51:22,618 --> 00:51:25,686
Now, if I don't, you know,
expel the dots twice a day...

643
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,533
Then what?

644
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,561
They'll eat me alive.

645
00:51:32,845 --> 00:51:35,061
What happened to your brothers and sisters?

646
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,730
Some lived.

647
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:40,397
Some...

648
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:43,842
...died.

649
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:47,514
And your mom, where is she now?

650
00:51:52,572 --> 00:51:53,866
Everywhere.

651
00:52:01,391 --> 00:52:04,391
Okay. Let's move out.

652
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,780
Come on, we must hurry,
or we'll be late to meet my contact.

653
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:16,340
Nom, nom!

654
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,301
Are you Milton?

655
00:53:24,817 --> 00:53:25,908
Si.

656
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:32,970
Milton will drive you through town
and to La Gatita Amable.

657
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:36,325
There are clothes in the boxes
for all of you so you can blend in.

658
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:40,908
That said, the walking tiburon
is gonna have to stay out of sight.

659
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:42,590
I wear disguise.

660
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:46,208
Oh, you're going to wear a disguise.

661
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:47,108
Si.

662
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:48,637
Hey, he's learnin' Spanish.

663
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:50,988
And what kind of disguise?

664
00:53:51,013 --> 00:53:52,375
Fake mustache.

665
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:53,096
Oh.

666
00:53:53,121 --> 00:53:56,079
Yeah, fake mustache
isn't gonna cut it, mate.

667
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:02,957
There's gonna be a lot of soldiers 
watching Jotunheim.

668
00:54:03,918 --> 00:54:05,348
If they discover us there...

669
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:07,665
Let's pray they do not,
or you will all be dead.

670
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:11,293
If they do, 
that'll leave the palace vulnerable.

671
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,395
Luna and the other generals
will be left without protection.

672
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:26,426
You're a good man, Colonel Flag.

673
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:32,578
You still look exactly like yourself.

674
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,504
That's the worst fake mustache 
I've ever seen.

675
00:54:34,707 --> 00:54:37,050
And if you had fooled us,
we'd have to kill you,

676
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:40,160
shark-shaped bloke with a moustache
creeping up on us like that.

677
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:41,176
Fuck!

678
00:54:42,876 --> 00:54:44,376
You, you.

679
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,520
Aw.

680
00:54:49,545 --> 00:54:52,379
He always wants to be near you.

681
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,283
I think he senses good in you.

682
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:56,223
Yeah, there's no good in me.

683
00:55:01,363 --> 00:55:02,738
Damn.

684
00:55:02,763 --> 00:55:06,742
Supposed to play golf with Senator Cray 
this weekend. I'm gonna look a fool.

685
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:08,715
Waller, come in.

686
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,801
Ugh.

687
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:12,965
You missed.

688
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,323
Waller, do you copy?

689
00:55:14,348 --> 00:55:16,035
We're losing connection.

690
00:55:17,306 --> 00:55:18,418
Waller.

691
00:55:20,968 --> 00:55:22,168
Fuck's sake.

692
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,842
- Task Force X.
- Waller.

693
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:24,944
You there?

694
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:29,142
The military must have put
signal jammers around the city.

695
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,083
Your comms are down, but
we can still activate the bombs,

696
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,357
not to mention 
what will happen to your daughter.

697
00:55:34,382 --> 00:55:36,257
So, no funny business.

698
00:55:36,492 --> 00:55:37,952
Do you copy, DuBois?

699
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:39,467
Copy.

700
00:55:39,492 --> 00:55:40,710
Fuck you!

701
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,030
Hey, uh, all that stuff about his daughter,
you wouldn't really do that, right?

702
00:55:47,453 --> 00:55:50,147
You don't know half of what 
I would do, John.

703
00:56:10,649 --> 00:56:11,832
What?

704
00:56:12,562 --> 00:56:15,160
Why are you so afraid of rats?

705
00:56:17,494 --> 00:56:19,926
Why are you so in love with them, 
Ratcatcher 2?

706
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,183
You know what I think?

707
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:25,500
I think you have a serious case 
of daddy issues.

708
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:29,364
I have no issues with
how much I loved my father.

709
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:40,129
Although he was a genius,

710
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:46,360
we lived homeless in the streets
of Portugal 'cause of his...

711
00:56:49,457 --> 00:56:50,783
...burdens.

712
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,496
He built the machines I employ today...

713
00:56:57,702 --> 00:57:00,434
...and taught me the secrets
of calling the rats.

714
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:07,051
They brought us trinkets to live on.

715
00:57:08,082 --> 00:57:11,658
And they kept us warm at night,
when we would have frozen.

716
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:17,148
- But eventually...
- Papa.

717
00:57:18,022 --> 00:57:19,121
Papa, wake up.

718
00:57:19,146 --> 00:57:24,105
...my father's burdens
became too heavy to carry.

719
00:57:24,228 --> 00:57:25,645
No.

720
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,754
No, Papa.

721
00:57:26,779 --> 00:57:28,621
- And he was gone.
- Papa, wake up.

722
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,801
I took his machinery and came to America.

723
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:39,652
That is the dream, right?

724
00:57:41,223 --> 00:57:46,512
But I was arrested for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

725
00:57:46,537 --> 00:57:48,918
The state considered the rats a weapon.

726
00:57:52,254 --> 00:57:53,395
What?

727
00:57:56,301 --> 00:57:58,238
You remind me of my daughter,

728
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:00,895
the reason I'm here.

729
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:05,171
Why are you so afraid of rats?

730
00:58:06,046 --> 00:58:07,363
My old man.

731
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:12,520
When I was a lad,
if I didn't finish a task right,

732
00:58:12,545 --> 00:58:14,863
he would dole out the punishment.

733
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:20,832
And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

734
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,223
And it was full of starvin' rats.

735
00:58:27,028 --> 00:58:29,543
As imperfect my father was...

736
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:34,707
...he loved me.

737
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,770
I wish I could give that to you.

738
00:58:44,203 --> 00:58:48,105
Don't you worry, yeah?
I'm gonna get you out of here alive.

739
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,609
I'm going to get you out of here alive.

740
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:01,816
Senores, this is the place.

741
00:59:26,158 --> 00:59:28,575
So, when's this Thinker guy
supposed to be here?

742
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,043
Supposed to be in the next few hours.

743
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,072
Looks like we gotta find something to do
to pass the time.

744
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:33,176
Uh, miss?

745
00:59:33,481 --> 00:59:34,948
How about some, uh...

746
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,604
What do you guys drink
around here, Fernet?

747
00:59:37,629 --> 00:59:39,899
How about a round of Fernets for the table.
Comprende?

748
00:59:39,924 --> 00:59:40,613
Si.

749
00:59:40,638 --> 00:59:43,429
Hey, Pissmaker, we're on a mission.

750
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,771
Easy, Inspector Gadget.
A little drink never hurt nobody.

751
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:50,658
Except for the thousands of people killed
in drunk driving accidents every year.

752
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:54,113
Come on, DuBois,
this could be our last drink.

753
00:59:55,866 --> 00:59:57,105
Gracias.

754
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:58,827
Just one.

755
00:59:58,852 --> 01:00:00,855
- You're gonna be that guy?
- I'm gonna be that guy.

756
01:00:01,986 --> 01:00:03,184
Hey, chica.

757
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:05,730
Forgot the rat.

758
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,066
Here's to being alive in three hours.

759
01:00:13,483 --> 01:00:16,121
I'll be alive. You speak for yourself.

760
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,270
There you go, there you go.

761
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,262
Don't give any more to Polka!

762
01:02:04,486 --> 01:02:06,463
Go. Go.

763
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:20,717
That is a gun.

764
01:02:20,742 --> 01:02:22,200
So, smile.

765
01:02:24,132 --> 01:02:27,134
We're old mates 
who are gonna take a trip to Jotunheim.

766
01:02:29,978 --> 01:02:31,174
Yup.

767
01:02:31,517 --> 01:02:35,877
Even with my help, 
you think you can get into Jotunheim?

768
01:02:36,364 --> 01:02:40,259
Well, if we can't, I've got a Great White
out back that's looking for some chum.

769
01:02:40,284 --> 01:02:41,573
Now, come on.

770
01:02:44,243 --> 01:02:47,400
All right, nice and easy.

771
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:54,496
Oh, fuck.

772
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,280
All right...

773
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,741
Take him out through the back,
all right.

774
01:03:26,766 --> 01:03:29,266
Find my coordinates in the pad
and meet me in half an hour.

775
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:31,499
- What?
- Hey, did you hear what I said?

776
01:03:31,524 --> 01:03:32,815
- Yes, but...
- Go.

777
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:35,950
Let's go.

778
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,796
Hey, calm down.

779
01:03:41,213 --> 01:03:43,280
There's no need
to disturb everyone's night.

780
01:03:43,305 --> 01:03:45,217
I'm right here, I'm the one
you're looking for.

781
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:48,374
Yep, us too.
We're his American companions.

782
01:03:48,399 --> 01:03:49,357
What?

783
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,038
Come on.

784
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,062
Go.

785
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,343
Oh, God.

786
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,444
Move it!

787
01:04:08,601 --> 01:04:09,601
Come on!

788
01:04:09,973 --> 01:04:10,905
Hey!

789
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,140
Your equipment manipulates
animal behavior, clever.

790
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:28,457
I'm working on something
similar with humans.

791
01:04:28,482 --> 01:04:30,101
Be quiet, please.

792
01:04:30,126 --> 01:04:31,792
You are perceivably panicked.

793
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,179
I'm guessing that you are not
the alphas of this battalion.

794
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,507
Do you want a dozen angry rodents 
crawling up your ass?

795
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:39,905
My answer might not be what you expect.

796
01:04:41,918 --> 01:04:43,226
Go, go!

797
01:04:57,336 --> 01:04:58,965
I'm sorry for you.

798
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:03,825
But soon you will all be joining
your deranged compatriot, Harley Quinn.

799
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:06,990
Is Harley alive?

800
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:08,582
Not for long.

801
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:13,137
Mayor General Suarez can be rather harsh
when extracting information.

802
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,158
Dim mak.

803
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:35,700
That's the Cantonese term for it.

804
01:05:35,808 --> 01:05:37,981
In Japan, it's kyoshu jitsu.

805
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:44,723
In English, it's simply the Death Touch,
how to kill a man with a single blow.

806
01:05:45,453 --> 01:05:49,450
Of course it's possible...
to kill a man with a single blow.

807
01:05:51,133 --> 01:05:54,992
But it's a matter of chance,
and cannot be wielded with certainty.

808
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,692
That's what they say.

809
01:05:57,884 --> 01:05:58,929
They?

810
01:05:58,954 --> 01:05:59,790
Amateurs.

811
01:05:59,814 --> 01:06:01,231
- On one?
- One.

812
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:07,747
I don't smoke.

813
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:49,934
All right.

814
01:07:51,832 --> 01:07:53,434
Let's go to Jotunheim.

815
01:07:55,095 --> 01:07:56,239
Nope.

816
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,121
There's somethin'
we gotta take care of first.

817
01:07:59,146 --> 01:08:00,313
What?

818
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:27,778
I will ask again.

819
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:33,129
How many meta-power teammates
arrived with you to Corto Maltese?

820
01:08:35,122 --> 01:08:36,455
Sixty-nine.

821
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,938
Sixty-nine?

822
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,204
How could you get 69 troops into the...

823
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:35,691
You gotta be kiddin' me.

824
01:09:35,716 --> 01:09:39,008
You're gonna risk the entire mission for a
mental defective dressed as a court jester.

825
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:40,825
This coming from a guy that
wears a toilet seat on his head.

826
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,032
- We don't leave one of our own behind.
- You're okay with this?

827
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:45,457
No, but I've been around Flag
when he's got a rag in his mouth.

828
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:47,158
- Best not to tug it.
- Motherfucker!

829
01:09:49,133 --> 01:09:50,550
Hey, wake up, wake up.

830
01:09:50,661 --> 01:09:51,953
All right, let's go.

831
01:09:55,383 --> 01:09:57,050
All right, we'll enter 
through the third floor,

832
01:09:57,075 --> 01:09:59,408
go to the inner staircase,
and then down to the cellar

833
01:09:59,433 --> 01:10:00,900
where they usually keep their detainees.

834
01:10:00,925 --> 01:10:02,848
Hopefully, Harley's still alive.

835
01:10:02,873 --> 01:10:05,083
It's not a toilet seat,
it's a beacon of freedom!

836
01:14:11,128 --> 01:14:12,253
Hola.

837
01:14:22,395 --> 01:14:23,478
Um...

838
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:45,341
Ratatouille, what do you got?

839
01:14:46,283 --> 01:14:48,356
Third floor hallway's clear.

840
01:14:48,991 --> 01:14:50,239
Abner?

841
01:14:50,405 --> 01:14:52,692
There doesn't seem to be 
any incoming traffic.

842
01:14:53,879 --> 01:14:55,200
Bird.

843
01:14:56,571 --> 01:14:58,653
Nanaue, stay off the comm.

844
01:15:01,591 --> 01:15:04,258
Colonel, I got a clean shot
on the only one in the office.

845
01:15:04,283 --> 01:15:05,533
Just give the word.

846
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,775
Fire on three, two-

847
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,294
What are you guys doing?

848
01:15:19,413 --> 01:15:22,579
I... You. We're here to save you.

849
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,316
You were gonna... save me?

850
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:29,739
It was a really good plan, too.

851
01:15:30,231 --> 01:15:32,883
Well, I can go back inside,
and you can still do it.

852
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,512
That's patronizing.

853
01:15:35,043 --> 01:15:36,512
Yeah, no, it's not...

854
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,700
Uh, what's with the javelin?

855
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:42,258
I'm waitin' for God to tell me.

856
01:15:42,283 --> 01:15:44,067
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

857
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:46,997
Or Him. Or any of them, really.

858
01:15:47,022 --> 01:15:48,106
Okay.

859
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:49,877
Okay.

860
01:15:51,153 --> 01:15:52,783
Are you two all right, yeah?

861
01:15:52,808 --> 01:15:54,133
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

862
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:55,092
Harley Quinn.

863
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,367
Bloodsport.

864
01:16:01,427 --> 01:16:04,184
All right, 
who ate all the fucking empanadas?

865
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,783
Mine were very good. I had the chicken.

866
01:16:07,656 --> 01:16:08,911
All right,

867
01:16:09,176 --> 01:16:12,342
here's the deal.
We fail the mission, you die.

868
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,481
We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

869
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:19,342
If we find out you have 
personalized license plates, you die.

870
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,450
What? No.

871
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,716
If you mismatch blacks, you die.

872
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:23,625
No.

873
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,145
If you cough without
covering your mouth...

874
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,566
Harley. Those last three aren't things.

875
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,648
Although, probably don't need to say this,

876
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:32,552
but that isn't an open invitation for you
to cough without covering your mouth.

877
01:16:32,577 --> 01:16:34,442
All right, we're gonna need
you to drive the minibus,

878
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:36,972
with all of us inside, 
past the guards at the front gate.

879
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,723
Once through the gate, we'll use you
to get through the retinal scanner.

880
01:16:39,766 --> 01:16:41,940
There are security cameras everywhere.

881
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:43,517
They're being dealt with.

882
01:16:54,466 --> 01:16:56,809
We'll neutralize the soldiers there 
and enter.

883
01:16:56,834 --> 01:16:59,418
Once we're inside, we separate into teams.

884
01:16:59,443 --> 01:17:01,550
I am walking back and forth.

885
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:05,066
Okay. You're gonna lead me and
Ratcatcher 2 to Project Starfish.

886
01:17:05,091 --> 01:17:06,925
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

887
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:08,700
No, no, no, you're coming with me.

888
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:11,142
Our munitions expertise are needed 
to place the explosives,

889
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:14,255
starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

890
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,606
Once we're clear, we blow the tits 
off that thing, and go home.

891
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:20,895
This is suicide.

892
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,622
Well, that's kind of our thing.

893
01:17:23,504 --> 01:17:24,504
Yeah.

894
01:17:31,181 --> 01:17:33,015
This is insane.

895
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,441
Yeah, no.

896
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:27,875
I love the rain.
It's like angels are splooging all over us.

897
01:18:27,884 --> 01:18:29,572
It's good for cover.

898
01:18:29,597 --> 01:18:30,763
Yep, that too.

899
01:19:46,265 --> 01:19:47,757
You son of a bit-

900
01:20:08,257 --> 01:20:10,968
Input the emergency code. Now!

901
01:20:11,242 --> 01:20:12,742
Well, go on then!

902
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:38,957
Yo!

903
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,258
Okay, Pokey.

904
01:20:41,283 --> 01:20:43,794
You get a bomb, you get a bomb.

905
01:20:43,919 --> 01:20:45,842
Harley and I will meet you up 
on the second floor.

906
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:47,492
Yeah? All right.

907
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:32,317
God damn it, Nanaue.

908
01:21:33,223 --> 01:21:34,521
No!

909
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,599
Quit bein' a play baby.

910
01:21:36,984 --> 01:21:38,622
Peacemaker.

911
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,550
It's actually very nice.

912
01:21:41,575 --> 01:21:43,349
Just put it against the wall.

913
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:46,559
It looks nothin' like me.

914
01:21:46,584 --> 01:21:47,876
Move. Move it.

915
01:21:51,117 --> 01:21:52,242
This way.

916
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:13,942
Si.

917
01:22:20,242 --> 01:22:22,630
Vamonos. Vamonos!

918
01:23:04,778 --> 01:23:06,111
Good God.

919
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:11,002
If God existed, wouldn't this be proof
that he wasn't good at all?

920
01:23:11,663 --> 01:23:13,288
What the hell is this?

921
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:15,952
I thought you were looking 
for Project Starfish.

922
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:20,385
You've brought us visitors,
have you, Grieves?

923
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,909
Have you come to save me
from that madman?

924
01:23:22,934 --> 01:23:25,002
Thirty years he's kept me here.

925
01:23:25,027 --> 01:23:26,771
Tortured me.

926
01:23:26,796 --> 01:23:29,462
Had his way with me.

927
01:24:09,156 --> 01:24:11,760
I call it Starro the Conqueror.

928
01:24:12,056 --> 01:24:13,806
That's meant to be derisive.

929
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:16,026
Sorry, old chum.

930
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:18,854
These two are here to kill you.
It's out of my hands.

931
01:24:19,143 --> 01:24:20,987
We need to help these people.

932
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:24,617
Impossible, dear. They're corpses 
below those stars.

933
01:24:25,095 --> 01:24:26,470
Who are they?

934
01:24:27,817 --> 01:24:30,596
The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

935
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:32,034
Dissidents,

936
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,174
journalists,

937
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:36,546
political rivals,

938
01:24:36,825 --> 01:24:39,117
and their loved ones.

939
01:24:41,087 --> 01:24:42,765
Oh, please,

940
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,166
unclutch your fucking pearls, Flag.

941
01:24:46,335 --> 01:24:48,846
We serve the same master.

942
01:24:48,871 --> 01:24:50,737
We were sent here to stop you.

943
01:24:51,536 --> 01:24:52,661
Child,

944
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:57,717
your government didn't send you here
to protect the world from alien technology.

945
01:24:57,742 --> 01:25:01,658
Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

946
01:25:01,683 --> 01:25:03,933
You're a goddamn liar.

947
01:25:04,268 --> 01:25:08,213
American goddamn astronauts found Starro.

948
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:10,995
Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.

949
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,717
Although the Cold War was ended,

950
01:25:12,742 --> 01:25:17,283
your government saw the potential
in weaponizing such a powerful beast,

951
01:25:17,308 --> 01:25:22,596
but banish the thought of any such
experiments being held on American soil.

952
01:25:22,729 --> 01:25:27,924
Your people have always been squeamish
about the sacrifices necessary...

953
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:30,307
...for scientific advancement.

954
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:31,492
So,

955
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:36,132
the United States made a secret deal 
with the Corto Maltese government

956
01:25:36,157 --> 01:25:40,081
to conduct their illegal experiments 
here in Jotunheim.

957
01:25:40,106 --> 01:25:42,273
And they hired me to oversee them.

958
01:25:42,298 --> 01:25:46,325
And now, because of
a run-of-the-mill fucking military coup,

959
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,807
they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.

960
01:25:48,832 --> 01:25:51,998
Yeah! You're the real victim here.

961
01:25:52,023 --> 01:25:54,939
The hell you doing here? You're supposed
to be upstairs plantin' explosives.

962
01:25:54,964 --> 01:25:56,916
I told you I didn't trust him.

963
01:25:57,457 --> 01:25:59,612
Your records are located 
in those computers?

964
01:26:02,478 --> 01:26:04,901
Colonel, what are you doing?

965
01:26:05,376 --> 01:26:09,450
I joined the military to serve
my country, not to be its puppet.

966
01:26:10,658 --> 01:26:12,370
What are you doing?

967
01:26:15,425 --> 01:26:17,057
Who are you going to show that to?

968
01:26:17,092 --> 01:26:20,217
The press. Goddamn people deserve to know.

969
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,133
I'm tired of coverin' up 
their dirty little secrets.

970
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:24,041
This time these sons of bitches
are gonna be held account-

971
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:26,562
I can't let you do that, Colonel.

972
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:27,592
Excuse me?

973
01:26:27,624 --> 01:26:28,617
I'm truly sorry.

974
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,557
Miss Waller charged me with makin' sure
those records don't leave this building.

975
01:26:31,582 --> 01:26:35,717
Of course, I shoulda known.
Waller's always got a backup.

976
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,739
Come on, man, this isn't personal.

977
01:26:37,754 --> 01:26:40,462
Holdin' a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

978
01:26:41,455 --> 01:26:43,029
What is that?

979
01:26:43,249 --> 01:26:44,802
I'm gonna need that drive, Colonel.

980
01:26:46,425 --> 01:26:48,733
Those morons set off 
the explosives too early.

981
01:26:48,758 --> 01:26:50,175
Hand over the drive!

982
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,779
Let's go, come on!

983
01:26:52,568 --> 01:26:54,066
They experimented on children.

984
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:56,168
No one is sayin' what they did was right.

985
01:26:56,193 --> 01:26:58,342
They experimented on children!

986
01:26:58,367 --> 01:27:01,450
That information gets out, 
it causes an international incident!

987
01:27:01,499 --> 01:27:03,824
Keepin' the peace is worth any price,

988
01:27:03,849 --> 01:27:06,141
including the life of a hero 
like yours, sir,

989
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:07,497
so please...

990
01:27:08,986 --> 01:27:10,427
...don't make me do this.

991
01:27:49,286 --> 01:27:50,992
What have you people done?

992
01:28:07,269 --> 01:28:08,575
Sebastian, come!

993
01:28:42,349 --> 01:28:46,700
Okay, we gotta calm down.
Let's all just... Let's talk about this.

994
01:28:46,725 --> 01:28:48,475
I understand where you're coming from.

995
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,742
I crossed a line.

996
01:28:49,767 --> 01:28:51,300
Okay, I crossed a line!

997
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:55,592
I realize that, but I'm ready to change.
I am ready to change.

998
01:28:55,617 --> 01:28:57,700
And I didn't mean to hurt you...

999
01:30:47,712 --> 01:30:49,729
You motherfucker.

1000
01:31:29,169 --> 01:31:30,680
Peacemaker.

1001
01:31:32,449 --> 01:31:33,915
What a joke.

1002
01:32:07,158 --> 01:32:08,158
Cleo.

1003
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,461
Give me back the drive.

1004
01:32:32,764 --> 01:32:35,550
I told you that information can't get out. 
Fuck!

1005
01:32:35,575 --> 01:32:38,283
So, okay, okay, destroy the hard drive.

1006
01:32:38,308 --> 01:32:39,732
Why kill me?

1007
01:32:46,652 --> 01:32:48,396
Because I'm thorough.

1008
01:32:51,311 --> 01:32:52,633
Oh, my...

1009
01:32:52,658 --> 01:32:53,748
Sorry, kid.

1010
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:55,600
No, no...

1011
01:33:05,326 --> 01:33:06,842
All right, troops are coming.

1012
01:33:06,867 --> 01:33:08,908
This floor, and then nine floors left. 
Let's go!

1013
01:33:08,933 --> 01:33:10,045
Come on!

1014
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:33,400
New dumb friends.

1015
01:34:46,492 --> 01:34:47,992
Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1016
01:35:15,451 --> 01:35:17,758
Has anyone got eyes or ears on any more?

1017
01:35:17,783 --> 01:35:19,158
They killed Milton!

1018
01:35:21,095 --> 01:35:22,842
Milton was still with us?

1019
01:35:23,045 --> 01:35:24,315
Where'd you think he was?

1020
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,518
I don't know. 
I thought he stayed back with the bus.

1021
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:27,675
What was Milton gonna do?

1022
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,992
He was helping us!

1023
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:32,100
- Who's Milton?
- What?

1024
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,842
I don't remember any Milton.

1025
01:35:33,867 --> 01:35:37,342
Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

1026
01:35:37,367 --> 01:35:40,701
Somebody named Milton 
has been with us the whole time?

1027
01:35:40,728 --> 01:35:41,646
Yes!

1028
01:35:41,671 --> 01:35:42,667
I don't think so.

1029
01:35:42,692 --> 01:35:45,857
I think I would've noticed
if a guy named Milton's been with us.

1030
01:35:46,123 --> 01:35:50,200
It's not a very common name. I don't think
I've ever even met Milton.

1031
01:35:50,459 --> 01:35:52,420
Are you messing around right now?

1032
01:35:52,548 --> 01:35:56,639
He was a really nice guy,
and he sacrificed himself to help us.

1033
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:58,451
And now look at him.

1034
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,982
He's dead.

1035
01:36:01,906 --> 01:36:06,225
Oh, that guy! Milton, Milton.

1036
01:36:10,133 --> 01:36:12,800
So, when did this great love affair 
with Milton start?

1037
01:36:12,825 --> 01:36:15,748
I liked him from the beginning, okay?
I just didn't say anything until-

1038
01:36:18,285 --> 01:36:19,545
No!

1039
01:38:14,497 --> 01:38:17,568
Harley! Give us a hand!

1040
01:38:26,173 --> 01:38:27,132
Hey!

1041
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:39,871
Vamos. Vamos.

1042
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:24,910
Oh!

1043
01:40:14,406 --> 01:40:16,739
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1044
01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:21,480
Oh, fuck off!

1045
01:40:22,337 --> 01:40:23,300
Oh.

1046
01:40:43,196 --> 01:40:44,405
Sorry, kid.

1047
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,283
No, no, no.

1048
01:41:41,181 --> 01:41:42,688
How?

1049
01:41:42,713 --> 01:41:44,254
Smaller bullets.

1050
01:41:49,496 --> 01:41:51,538
He killed Colonel Flag.

1051
01:41:53,175 --> 01:41:55,384
He wanted to share this with the press.

1052
01:41:55,407 --> 01:41:59,907
It's proof the American government
was behind Project Starfish the whole time.

1053
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:36,295
Whoa. Whoa.

1054
01:42:51,325 --> 01:42:52,908
I think it's trying to get out.

1055
01:42:52,933 --> 01:42:53,909
What?

1056
01:42:53,933 --> 01:42:54,724
Starro the-

1057
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:18,992
Whoa.

1058
01:44:27,992 --> 01:44:29,889
Cover your faces!

1059
01:45:18,095 --> 01:45:19,225
Si.

1060
01:45:19,617 --> 01:45:20,741
Si.

1061
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,426
- Whoa.
- What the fuck is that?

1062
01:45:55,821 --> 01:45:57,405
Uh... Hey, guys?

1063
01:45:59,944 --> 01:46:01,735
Oh, shit, there's...

1064
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,931
This city is mine.

1065
01:46:52,766 --> 01:46:55,626
Uh, Miss Waller, 
I think the feed is back up.

1066
01:46:58,288 --> 01:46:59,913
Oh, my God, Miss Waller!

1067
01:47:00,332 --> 01:47:03,197
We've got a freaking kaiju up in this shit!

1068
01:47:12,575 --> 01:47:14,671
Task Force X, come in. Are you there?

1069
01:47:17,929 --> 01:47:19,507
Uh-huh.

1070
01:47:19,532 --> 01:47:22,350
Whatever signal jammers
were blocking our communications

1071
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:24,375
must have been in the building
you just demolished.

1072
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:27,447
Yeah, well, we've got a mite issue 
over here, Waller.

1073
01:47:27,472 --> 01:47:29,638
It's Project Starfish, Miss Waller.

1074
01:47:29,663 --> 01:47:31,280
It's headed towards the city,

1075
01:47:31,305 --> 01:47:33,858
and I think it wants to feed on 
as many people as it can.

1076
01:47:38,362 --> 01:47:39,718
Not our problem.

1077
01:47:39,743 --> 01:47:41,843
If you've destroyed Jotunheim
and the records within,

1078
01:47:41,868 --> 01:47:43,550
you've achieved the objective.

1079
01:47:43,575 --> 01:47:46,200
Corto Maltese is no longer a U.S. ally.

1080
01:47:46,225 --> 01:47:48,187
If anything,
the White House will consider

1081
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:51,263
fomenting disruption in a hostile nation
a positive development.

1082
01:48:24,769 --> 01:48:26,227
You heard what she said.

1083
01:48:47,492 --> 01:48:48,793
Fuck.

1084
01:48:54,106 --> 01:48:56,133
Bloodsport is off mission.

1085
01:48:56,158 --> 01:48:57,367
What the...

1086
01:48:58,283 --> 01:48:59,996
She'll kill you, you know.

1087
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,850
That's her business.

1088
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:04,800
I knew Sebastian sensed good in you
for a reason.

1089
01:49:04,825 --> 01:49:07,325
Just keep that fucking rat
away from me.

1090
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:09,715
Ratcatcher is also off mission.

1091
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:12,012
Bloodsport, Ratcatcher, turn around.

1092
01:49:12,037 --> 01:49:13,707
Where go, friends?

1093
01:49:14,419 --> 01:49:15,559
Nanaue!

1094
01:49:17,101 --> 01:49:19,590
I know what I'm carrying the javelin for.

1095
01:49:29,796 --> 01:49:31,383
Krill, turn around now!

1096
01:49:31,408 --> 01:49:33,325
Turn back now, God damn it!

1097
01:49:36,351 --> 01:49:37,244
Open it.

1098
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:37,786
Miss Waller-

1099
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:38,717
Open it!

1100
01:49:40,075 --> 01:49:42,325
What are you doing, Task Force X?

1101
01:49:47,611 --> 01:49:48,744
Fuck!

1102
01:49:51,343 --> 01:49:53,092
Turn around now, God damn it!

1103
01:49:53,117 --> 01:49:55,072
You dumb pieces of shit!

1104
01:49:55,911 --> 01:49:57,361
Motherfuckers!

1105
01:49:58,455 --> 01:50:03,369
God damn it, Task Force X, 
this is your last motherfucking warning!

1106
01:50:07,384 --> 01:50:10,580
Oh, my God! What the fuck did you do?

1107
01:50:12,497 --> 01:50:13,997
All those people, John.

1108
01:50:14,931 --> 01:50:16,098
Little kids.

1109
01:50:20,871 --> 01:50:25,332
Task Force X, the creature
is headed to Calle Principal.

1110
01:50:25,357 --> 01:50:28,549
Avoid Avenida Medrano.
There is a swarm of infected.

1111
01:50:28,574 --> 01:50:32,500
So, your clearest path is Calle Aguero.

1112
01:50:32,525 --> 01:50:35,483
Get on the satellite, Dale,
you fucking dickhead!

1113
01:50:35,508 --> 01:50:36,899
Yes, ma'am.

1114
01:51:59,119 --> 01:51:59,881
Huh?

1115
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:07,834
Harley, take the high ground!

1116
01:52:13,867 --> 01:52:16,950
Nanaue! Monster is nom nom!

1117
01:52:17,895 --> 01:52:20,187
Monster nom nom?

1118
01:52:20,512 --> 01:52:21,679
Yes!

1119
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,779
Abner, do you see who that is?

1120
01:52:33,842 --> 01:52:34,633
Huh?

1121
01:52:34,658 --> 01:52:36,325
It's your mom!

1122
01:53:09,111 --> 01:53:11,278
I'm a superhero!

1123
01:53:12,543 --> 01:53:14,420
I'm a motherfucking super-

1124
01:54:04,145 --> 01:54:05,162
God!

1125
01:54:11,556 --> 01:54:15,670
No! No!

1126
01:54:33,593 --> 01:54:34,693
Oh, no...

1127
01:54:42,337 --> 01:54:48,295
This city is mine!

1128
01:54:49,051 --> 01:54:51,459
This city isn't yours.

1129
01:54:51,986 --> 01:54:54,404
This city isn't ours.

1130
01:54:55,242 --> 01:54:57,388
This city is theirs.

1131
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:02,929
Oh, hell.

1132
01:56:22,533 --> 01:56:24,271
Why rats, Papa?

1133
01:56:25,309 --> 01:56:29,451
Rats are the lowliest and most despised
of all creatures, my love.

1134
01:56:30,645 --> 01:56:32,193
If they have purpose,

1135
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:35,490
so do we all.

1136
01:58:21,603 --> 01:58:23,511
I was happy,

1137
01:58:24,112 --> 01:58:28,566
floating, staring at the stars.

1138
01:59:01,808 --> 01:59:04,808
A group of escaped convicts
saved a city of millions

1139
01:59:04,833 --> 01:59:07,894
on the small island nation
of Corto Maltese today.

1140
01:59:08,714 --> 01:59:10,075
That's my dad.

1141
01:59:11,509 --> 01:59:16,200
Because of these people, Corto Maltese 
will have free democratic elections

1142
01:59:16,225 --> 01:59:18,967
for the first time in 90 years.

1143
01:59:18,992 --> 01:59:20,700
Viva Corto Maltese!

1144
01:59:20,783 --> 01:59:23,242
Viva Corto Maltese!

1145
01:59:23,317 --> 01:59:25,972
Viva Corto Maltese!

1146
01:59:26,747 --> 01:59:28,400
That's my dad.

1147
01:59:37,825 --> 01:59:38,891
Yeah.

1148
01:59:41,486 --> 01:59:42,657
Yeah.

1149
01:59:43,653 --> 01:59:46,040
Oh, that's just a taste
of what's on that drive.

1150
01:59:46,065 --> 01:59:48,357
I've uploaded it all to a secure server.

1151
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:51,062
Now, if you kill any one of us,

1152
01:59:51,087 --> 01:59:53,360
or my daughter ever sees
the inside of a prison,

1153
01:59:53,385 --> 01:59:54,842
it goes public.

1154
01:59:54,925 --> 01:59:58,383
If we all go free,
it never has to see the light of day.

1155
01:59:59,994 --> 02:00:02,578
I told you I'd make you a leader, DuBois.

1156
02:00:03,966 --> 02:00:05,344
You got a deal.

1157
02:00:25,410 --> 02:00:26,540
Nanaue.

1158
02:00:42,592 --> 02:00:44,967
Look, I know Flag wanted to
give the drive to the press,

1159
02:00:44,992 --> 02:00:48,389
but we just saved a whole bloody city.
We can't have it all.

1160
02:00:51,504 --> 02:00:52,834
Flag was my friend.

1161
02:00:52,859 --> 02:00:54,146
Mine too.

1162
02:00:56,067 --> 02:00:57,900
And I haven't got many of those.

1163
02:01:00,312 --> 02:01:02,553
I could be your friend, Milton.

1164
02:01:02,968 --> 02:01:04,068
Not my name.

1165
02:01:04,093 --> 02:01:05,256
What?

1166
02:01:05,716 --> 02:01:08,050
What are you talkin' about?
We just had a conversation

1167
02:01:08,075 --> 02:01:10,617
for, like, three hours
about how your name is Milton.

1168
02:01:10,642 --> 02:01:11,600
Didn't.

1169
02:01:12,287 --> 02:01:13,842
- Yes, we did.
- No.

1170
02:01:14,307 --> 02:01:15,436
Our ride's here.

1171
02:01:19,154 --> 02:01:20,445
Nom nom?

1172
02:01:20,616 --> 02:01:23,825
Really? That is what you're thinkin' about
right now?

1173
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:26,392
No. That nom nom though.

1174
02:01:26,417 --> 02:01:27,998
No, it's not nom nom.

1175
02:01:29,825 --> 02:01:30,873
No!

1176
02:10:54,805 --> 02:10:56,690
Said they found him in the rubble.

1177
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:58,700
They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

1178
02:10:58,725 --> 02:11:01,468
I wasn't certain how safe it was,
shipping him back here.

1179
02:11:01,493 --> 02:11:04,195
But, if anything,
he's shown he's resilient.

1180
02:11:04,643 --> 02:11:07,820
It'll take some surgery, but eventually
we'll get him back up to speed.

1181
02:11:10,216 --> 02:11:12,133
You realize this is revenge, right?

1182
02:11:12,156 --> 02:11:13,957
Waller knows we double-crossed her,

1183
02:11:13,982 --> 02:11:17,273
and she's getting back at us by
saddling us with this douchebag.

1184
02:11:17,298 --> 02:11:18,398
Yep.

1185
02:11:18,577 --> 02:11:20,968
I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

1186
02:11:20,993 --> 02:11:23,523
Oh, is that what you heard?
Because not quite.

1187
02:11:25,234 --> 02:11:27,116
What do you guys want him for?

1188
02:11:27,946 --> 02:11:31,000
Just to save the fucking world, that's all.
