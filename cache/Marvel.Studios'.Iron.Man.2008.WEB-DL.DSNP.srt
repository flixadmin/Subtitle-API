Is it a good representation

No. The Springs was actually

So?

Tony, we're

Obie, I just don't
want a body count
to be our only legacy.

634
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,720
That's what we do.
We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

a good enough job.

639
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,280
We can do better.
We're gonna do
something else.

another look into

643
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,920
Ah, come on.
The arc reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!

644
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,400
Tony, come on.
We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

645
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,600
It works.
Yeah, as a science project.

646
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,560
The arc was
never cost effective.

647
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,360
We knew that
before we built it.

648
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,600
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

649
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,800
Maybe.

650
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,840
Huh? Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that in what?

That's what they say.

a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

Never mind who told me.
Show me.
It's Rhodey or Pepper.

Okay, Rhodey.

Listen to me, Tony.
We're a team.
Do you understand?

There's nothing we can't do

a heads-up, okay?

Tony.

It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

692
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,720
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

No.

<i>last night.</i>

1513
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:38,120
<i>There have been unconfirmed</i>
<i>reports that a robotic</i>
<i>prototype malfunctioned</i>

1514
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:40,800
<i>and caused damage</i>
<i>to the arc reactor.</i>

1515
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:43,840
<i>Fortunately, a member</i>
<i>of Tony Stark's</i>
<i>personal security staff...</i>

1516
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,840
"Iron Man."
That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1517
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,400
I mean, it's not
technically accurate.

1518
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,600
The suit's
a gold-titanium alloy,

1519
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:52,280
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1520
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:54,000
Here's your alibi.

1521
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,960
Okay.

1522
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,200
You were on your yacht.
Yeah.

1523
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:00,440
We have port papers
that put you in
Avalon all night,

1524
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,200
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1525
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,440
See, I was thinking
maybe we should say
it was just Pepper and me

1526
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,320
alone on the island.

1527
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,880
That's what happened.
All right.

1528
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:12,080
Just read it,
word for word.

1529
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,000
There's nothing
about Stane here.

1530
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:18,880
That's being handled.
He's on vacation.

1531
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,240
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.

1532
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,800
But what about
the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1533
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:27,840
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy,
don't you think?

1534
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,200
This isn't
my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.

1535
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,600
Just stick to
the official statement,

1536
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:34,280
and soon,
this will all
be behind you.

1537
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,640
You've got 90 seconds.

1538
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,760
Oh, Agent Coulson?

1539
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,360
I just wanted to say
thank you very much
for all of your help.

1540
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,360
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1541
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:51,200
From the Strategic Homeland...

1542
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,880
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1543
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:54,480
Right.

1544
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,960
Let's get this
show on the road.

1545
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,360
You know,
it's actually
not that bad.

1546
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,680
Even I don't think
I'm Iron Man.

1547
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,360
You're not Iron Man.
Am so.

1548
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,920
You're not.
All right,
suit yourself.

1549
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,000
You know, if I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.

1550
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:11,520
She'd be a wreck,
'cause she'd always
be worrying

1551
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:12,640
that I was going to die,

1552
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:15,080
yet so proud of
the man I'd become.

1553
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:18,880
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1555

crazy about me.

1556
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,440
Tell me you never
think about that night.

1557
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,400
What night?
You know.

1558
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:34,040
Are you talking about
the night that we danced
and went up on the roof,

1559
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:41,320
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1560
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,640
and you left me there,
by myself?

1561
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,400
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1562
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,480
Mmm-hmm.

1563
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,680
Thought so.

1564
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:58,120
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all,
Miss Potts.

1565
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,760
<i>And now, Mr. Stark has</i>

1566

1573
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:23,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark,
but do you honestly
expect us to believe that

1574
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:27,280
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that
conveniently appeared,

1577
