1
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,091
- You swear it?
- CATELYN: By the mother.

2
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:16,554
My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.

3
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:25,229
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.

4
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,733
Your son can go on
calling himself King in the North.

5
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,236
The Starks will have dominion
over all lands north of Moat Cailin,

6
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,196
provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

7
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,364
And the wording of this oath?

8
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:38,075
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

9
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,873
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

10
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,255
And in return for my son's loyalty?

11
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,759
In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.

12
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,093
When that's done,

13
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,556
Baratheon and Stark will fight
their common enemy together,

14
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,308
as they have done many times before.

15
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,650
Our two houses have always been close,

16
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,030
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

17
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,531
Negotiate a peace with your brother.

18
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,784
Negotiate with Stannis? (CHUCKLES)

19
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,078
You heard him out there.

20
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:25,039
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

21
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,959
Please bring my terms to your son.

22
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,921
I believe we are natural allies.

23
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,339
I hope he feels the same.

24
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,384
Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

Stannis will be here in an hour.

00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,106
When he arrives,
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

47

Your former companions
will fight for the privilege

48

of selling you to their new king.

49
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,947
And you want that privilege for yourself.

50
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,658
You will note that I am standing here
talking to you,

51
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,535
not Stannis.

52

There's no time for this.

53
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,538
Ride back to Highgarden, sister.

I'm not running from Stannis.

Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.

I don't believe that.

You don't believe that.

Who gained the most from our king's death?

59
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,050
Stannis.

60
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,052
I will put a sword through his righteous face.

You can't stay here.

62
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,974
He would have been a true king,

00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,726
a good king.

64
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,144
LITTLEFINGER: Tell me, Ser Loras,

65
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,772
what do you desire most in this world?

66
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,941
Revenge.

67
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,485
I have always found that
to be the purest of motivations,

68
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,905
but you won't have a chance
to put your sword through Stannis,

69
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,740
not today.

70
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,826
You'll be cut to pieces
before he sets foot on solid ground.

71
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,538
If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.

72
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,165
You can't avenge him from the grave.

73
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,919
Bring the horses.

74
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,881
Please.

75
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,038
He was very handsome.

76
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,748
He was, Your Grace.

00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,916
"Your Grace."

78
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,171
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.

00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,299
And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

Do you want to be a queen?

81
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:49,928
No.

82
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,558

Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark
in some way.

00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,745
Really? Who'd have thought?

88
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,164
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,

89
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,833
while still others say
it was Stannis himself who did it

90
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,086
after negotiations went sour.

91
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,004
Whomever did it, I say well done.

92
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,422
It's not what Varys says.

93
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,133
He says Renly's army
is flocking to support Stannis,

94
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,845
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

95
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,264
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

96
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,393
And I say Father raised you
to have too much respect for money.

97
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,146
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.

98
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,439
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

99
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,942
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

100
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,110
She'll be safer in Dorne.

101
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,195
Yes, I know how concerned you are
for her safety.

102
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,072
It so happens that I am.

103
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,450
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and I don't blame her at all for you.

104
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,120
So clever.

105
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:01,083
Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?

106
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,961
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

107
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,213
They are going to attack us.

108
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,756
We need to be ready.

No need to concern yourself over it.

110
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,887
The king is taking personal charge
of siege preparations.

111
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,182
May I ask specifically
what the king has in mind?

112
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,685
You may, specifically,
or you may ask vaguely.

113
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,812
The answer will be the same.

114
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,820
It's important that we talk about this.

115
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,617
It's the king's royal prerogative

116
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,246
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

- No.
- That's a lie right there.

122
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,809
It is not a lie. Why would I lie?

123

Tell me,

124
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,357
if the vile allegations
against my brother and sister are true,

125
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,111
do you think it will make Jaime
more likely to kill you or less likely?

When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

127

I'm telling you the truth.

128
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,327
The smart money would be on more likely.

129

She's making wildfire.

will give him sympathy for yours.

I suppose there's only one way to find out.

They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

When did she tell you this?

138
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,433
I heard her talking with the pyromancer.

139
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,939
And the other night, after I left her,
she went to meet him.

I swear to you.

141
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,526
Swear to me on what?

Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn

150
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,882
to please kill you
if anything should happen to me.

should happen to Lord Tyrion.

I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

Fools love a fool.

158
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:40,075
I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was,
not the man he grew to be.

159
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,451
I need to speak to you

160
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,537
- about what I saw in that cave.
- I thought I made it clear to you

161
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,955
there'd be no need to speak to me
on this matter.

162
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,039
Your Grace, I...

163
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,458
I've never known you to need
to hear a thing twice.

164
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,129
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

165
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,630
You've come to lecture me on truth?

166
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,048
I've come to tell you that what I saw...

167
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,301
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

168
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,472
Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.

169
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,516
They won't be able to resist us now.

170
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,226
Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.

171
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,729
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the Iron...

172
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,439
I'll hear no more about it.

173
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,866
MAN: Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.

174
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,911
When do we sail for King's Landing?

175
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,246
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.

176
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,206
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.

177
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,500
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

178
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,754
we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.

179
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,882
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

180
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,177
That's not your concern.

181
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,805
If you take King's Landing
with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

182
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,141
I never thought I'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

183
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,852
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

184
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,188
Oh, truth again.

185
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,690
All right, what's the truth?

186
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,568
The hard truth?

187
00:12:56,652 --> 00:13:00,447
She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.

188
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,576
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
and you obey.

189
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,373
What do you believe?

190
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,921
You won those bannermen from Renly.

191
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,548
Don't lose them to her.

192
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,306
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

193
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,852
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

194
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,815
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

195
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,484
was spent evading ships, not attacking them.

196
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,152
The other lords won't be happy.

197
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,239
Most of those lords
should consider themselves lucky

198
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,574
I don't hang them for treason.

199
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,746
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

200
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,725
GIRL: I've got it! I've got it!

201
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,060
MAN: So it's that one there at the top,
on the right.

202
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,565
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

203
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:20,152
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

204
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,737
What do we have?

205
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,448
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

206
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,993
Well, I've never actually been able
to kill people with it.

207
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,454
Good thing. I'd be out of a job.

208
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:32,622
What about your father?

209
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,250
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

210
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,919
He's very busy.

211
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,923
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.

212
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,217
We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,

213
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,802
not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

214
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,096
MAN: Corruption.
CROWD: Yes!

215
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:52,642
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

216
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,021
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings

217
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,441
and we're surprised
when the fruit of their incest is rotten?

218
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,609
(CHEERING)

219
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,487
Yes, a rotten king.

220
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,448
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

221
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,742
Not after what he did to your birthday present.

222
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,661
The king is a lost cause.

223
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,081
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

224
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,834
A dancing king,
prancing down his bloodstained halls

225
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,505
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

226
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,798
(LAUGHING)

227
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,675
You have to admire his imagination.

228
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,677
He's talking about you.

229
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,931
What? Demon monkey?

230
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,350
People think you're pulling the king's strings.

231
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,560
They blame you for the city's ills.

232
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,938
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

233
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,273
You don't need to convince me.

234
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,527
Demon monkey.

235
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,177
(MEN LAUGHING)

236
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,766
Yeah, come on.

237
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,226
THEON: You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?

238
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,771
I'm your commander. Welcome.

239
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,608
Stop.

240
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,902
Stop!

241
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,156
Your captain commands you to stop!

242
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,284
Where are we headed, Captain?

243
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,330
The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.

244
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,876
There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,
if you do your jobs well.

245
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,087
And who decides if we've done our jobs well?

246
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,257
I do.

247
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,426
Your captain.

248
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,511
(ALL LAUGHING)

249
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:57,601
I have been reaving and raping
since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.

250
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,606
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

251
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,901
Don't reckon I've got much use
for a captain at all.

252
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,988
I'm thinking I can do the job of captain
real well myself.

253
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,240
All I need is a ship.

254
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,120
You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?

255
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,920
You could do that,
take the ship, head out on your own.

256
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,840
And I will hunt you down, drag you back here
in chains and hang you for a traitor.

257
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,468
Stop. We yield.

258
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,974
Congratulations on your first command.

259
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,685
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

260
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:41,978
Oh, I'm not here for you.

261
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,398
I was just on my way to Red Harbor.

262
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:49,110
I've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.

263
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,737
Too narrow.

264
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,115
You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

265
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,409
That would never happen.

266
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,955
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

267
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,374
This lot, though...

268
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,211
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

269
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,677
Come on, I'll take you out.

270
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,762
Who are you?

271
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,847
Dagmer, your first mate.

272
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,268
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

273
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,105
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

274
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,481
That would be good for a laugh.

275
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,609
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

276
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,862
And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

277
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,364
You're not.

278
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:40,203
And yet that's the task my father has given me
to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.

279
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,998
They're all Iron Islanders.

280
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,626
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

281
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,845
THEON: The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

282
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,264
The seat of the House of Tallhart,

283
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,891
a more impressive prize
than a few fishermen's daughters.

284
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,771
- What, you don't think we could take it?
- No, we could.

285
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,940
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

286
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,318
As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

287
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,446
the Starks would send their men
to take it back.

288
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,281
And then...

289
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,332
Take me to my ship.

290
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,006
The Starks have overextended their lines.

291
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,924
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

292
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,843
keeping their men and horses fed.

293
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,012
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

294
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,930
The cold won't beat them.

295
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:45,727
Our spies report growing discontent
among the Northern lords.

296
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,273
They want to return home
and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

297
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,109
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

298
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,154
they would report growing discontent
amongst the Southern lords.

299
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,782
This is war, no one's content.

300
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,329
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

301
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,957
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

302
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,629
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.

303
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,215
You've been waiting for him to fail.

304
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,260
He is not going to fail, not without our help.

305
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,849
So how do we stop him?

306
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,768
REGINALD: We've worked
through the night, my lord.

307
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,646
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

308
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,689
Yes, I think you would, Reginald.

309
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:35,485
And because you're my cousin,
I might even let you wake from that sleep.

310
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,114
Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

311
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,032
My wife's in Lannisport.

312
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,159
Well, then you'd better start riding.

313
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,997
Go, before I change my mind
and send her your head.

314
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,125
If your name wasn't Lannister,

315
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,837
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

316
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,842
Not wine, water.

317
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,844
We'll be here for some time.

318
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,142
Girl.

319
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,645
Where are you from?

320
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,522
Maidenpool, my lord.

321
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:17,068
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

322
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,946
House Mooton, my lord.

323
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,739
And what is their sigil?

324
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,121
A red salmon.

325
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,874
I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

326
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,043
You're a Northerner, aren't you?

327
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,381
Good. One more time, where are you from?

328
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,633
Barrowton, my lord.

329
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,594
House Dustin.

330
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,346
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

331
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,935
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

332
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,441
They call him the Young Wolf.

333
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,817
And?

334
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,196
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant dire wolf.

335
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,535
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

336
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,579
They say he can't be killed.

337
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,540
And do you believe them?

338
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,585
No, my lord.

339
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,713
Anyone can be killed.

340
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,931
Fetch that water.

341
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,682
A girl says nothing.

342
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,062
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

343
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:22,151
No one hears,
and friends may talk in secret, yes?

344
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,449
A boy becomes a girl.

345
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,993
I was always a girl.

346
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,161
And I was always aware.

347
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,956
But the girl keeps secrets.

348
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,293
It is not for a man to spoil them.

349
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,588
You're one of them now.

350
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,467
I should have let you burn.

351
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,556
And you fetch water for one of them now.

352
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,351
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

353
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,771
- I didn't have a choice.
- You did.

354
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,815
I did.

355
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,401
And here we are.

356
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,156
A man pays his debts.

357
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,366
A man owes three.

358
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:11,826
Three what?

359
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,205
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.

360
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,417
And only death may pay for life.

361
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,087
You saved me and the two I was with.

362
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,215
You stole three deaths from the Red God.

363
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,554
We have to give them back.

364
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,934
Speak three names

365
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,937
and the man will do the rest.

366
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,483
Three lives I will give you,

367
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,276
no more, no less,

368
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,653
and we're done.

369
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,821
I can name anyone

370
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,532
and you'll kill him?

371
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,410
A man has said.

372
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,915
The one who tortures everyone.

373
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:00,750
A man needs a name.

374
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,752
I don't know his name.

375
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,671
They call him the Tickler.

376
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,422
That is enough.

377
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,635
Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.

378
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,025
MORMONT: He's not here yet.

379
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,736
He'd have seen us, blown the horn.

380
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,321
JON: When will he come?

381
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,074
The Halfhand does things in his own time.

382
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,535
My uncle told me stories about him.

383
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,036
Most of them are true.

384
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,415
I heard the Halfhand
spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

385
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,708
The whole winter.

386
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,252
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

387
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,212
Had to wait for the thaw.

388
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,966
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

389
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,261
Well, possible for the Halfhand.

390
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,138
Beautiful, isn't it?

391
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,724
Gilly would love it here.

392
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,561
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,676
At least you'll keep warm.

The Fist of the First Men.

397
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,350
Think of how old this place is.

398
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,562
Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,

399
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,106
before the Andals took Westeros
from the First Men.

400
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,901
Before I die, please, stop talking.

401
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:55,782
Thousands and thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here where we're standing

402
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,992
all through the long night.

403
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,830
What do you think they were like,
the First Men?

404
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,248
Stupid.

405
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:07,418
Smart people don't find themselves
in places like this.

406
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:09,629
I think they were afraid.

407
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,050
I think they came here
to get away from something.

408
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,553
And I don't think it worked.

411

JON: One blast is for rangers returning.

412
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,524
Wildlings is two blasts.

413
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,985
So you got to stand there waiting,

414
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,112
wondering.

415
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,697
One blast for friends,

416
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,659
two for foes.

417
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,538
And three for White Walkers.

418
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,710
It's been a thousand years,

419
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:52,505
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

420
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,799
But if it's been a thousand years,
how do you know?

421
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,469
- Well...
- BOTH: I read it in a book.

422
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,555
Look.

423

It's Qhorin Halfhand.

424
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,144
Aye, we'll live another day.

425
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,605
Hurrah.

426
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,784
Take care, my lord.

427
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,996
I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,

428
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,999
"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."

429
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,627
Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.

430
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,171
It could well be true.

431
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:39,302
The substance burns so hot,
it melts wood, stone, even steel,

432
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,804
and, of course, flesh.

433
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:47,143
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

434
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:55,860
After the dragons died, wildfire was the key
to the Targaryen power.

I've seen pushing carts around army camps

438
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,287
making grand claims
about jars full of pig shit.

439
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,666
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

440
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,085
The substance is fire given form.

441
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,505
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

442
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,632
To do what?

443
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:21,385
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

444
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,013
How much do you have?

445
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:31,103
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

446
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,690
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in ten,

447
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,860
but all the real soldiers
are in the Riverlands with your father.

450
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,783
but things can get a bit messy.

'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,
he's flinging them right back at us.

Men die, men shit themselves, men run,

00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,166
which means pots falling,

454
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,001
which means fire inside the walls,

455
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:58,839
which means the poor cunts trying to defend
the city end up burning it down.

456
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,925
My friend remains unconvinced.

457

He would not dare insult my order

Well, he's not living anymore.

00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:07,760
And I fixed the heel on this one.

482
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,678
Thank you, my friend.

483
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,850
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?

484
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,312
They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

485
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,563
It is known.

486
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,776
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos...

487
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,863
The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to Khal Drogo.

You would look like a real princess
in Xaro's...

492
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,057
She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.

You should wear it, Khaleesi.

What is the House of the Undying?

00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:49,690
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

and drink shade of the evening.

546

It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.

So soft, they actually believe

I'm sorry.

572
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,963
My own mother died on the birthing bed

573
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,465
when I was very young.

574
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,346
It's a bloody business.

575
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:48,350
What comes after is even harder.

Once you're safely back

But Stannis has a great army around him.

581

His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

582
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,536
I'm as good as any of them.

583
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,664
I should never have fled.

584
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:14,209
Renly's death was no fault of yours.

585
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,253
You served him bravely.

586
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:19,548
I only held him that once

587
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,676
as he was dying.

588
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,139
He's gone, Brienne.

589
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,560
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

590
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,814
Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

591
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,613
I do not know your son, my lady.

592
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,660
But I could serve you, if you would have me.

593
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,913
You have courage.

594
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,834
Not battle courage, perhaps,
but, I don't know,

595
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,421
a woman's kind of courage.

596
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:03,008
And I think that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

597
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,595
Promise me that you will not hold me back
from Stannis.

598
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,771
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

599
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:24,738
Then I am yours, my lady.

600
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:30,619
I will shield your back
and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.

601

I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

I can't keep watch all day and all night.

615
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:28,468
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

to help watch over your flock

Torrhen's Square
is barely 40 leagues from here.

00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,544
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

628
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,464
Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.

629
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,549
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

630
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:08,800
We have to help them.

631
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:12,304
Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,
but I can gather 200 decent men.

why should they protect us?

Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

635
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:23,774
Won't take long, my lord.

- (BIRD SQUAWKS)
- BRAN: So, what does it mean?

637
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,332
Ask your Maester Luwin.
He's the one studying books all the time.

638
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,752
I did ask him.
He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

639
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,171
Must not mean anything, then.

640
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,297
You're lying.

641
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,258
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

642
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:53,261
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

643
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,263
You didn't give me an honest answer.

644
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,016
That's not the same as being a liar.

645
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,726
Well, it's not far off.

646
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:03,271
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

647
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,985
In the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

648
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,696
Now who's a liar?

649
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,493
What did you see in your dream?

650
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,914
Something bad?

651
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,625
Tell me, boy.

652
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,631
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

653
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,802
I saw waves crashing against the gates

654
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,639
and the water came flowing over the walls...

655
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:42,269
It flooded the castle.

656
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,023
Drowned men were floating here,

657
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:49,109
in the yard.

658
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,947
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

659
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,369
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

660
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,662
I know.

661
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,124
- It's just a stupid dream.
- I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

662
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,251
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

663
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,919
Osha.

664
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,504
The three-eyed raven,

665
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:14,176
what do they say about it north of the Wall?

666
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,681
They say all sorts of crazy things
north of the Wall.

667
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,315
- (WIND HOWLING)
- (HORSES NEIGHING)

668
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,111
QHORIN: There.
MORMONT: Where?

669
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,863
On that mountain.

670
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,449
SAMWELL: I don't see very well.

671
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,575
JON: A fire.

672
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,371
There's a fire.

673
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,083
The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.

674
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,712
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

675
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:54,382
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honor.

676
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,468
How many wildlings have joined him?

677
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,554
From what we can tell, all of them.

678
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:07,479
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

679
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,231
They're almost ready to make their move.

680
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:13,068
- Where?
- Somewhere safe.

681
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:14,861
Somewhere south.

682
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,572
Can't just march into their midst.

683
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:21,493
And we can't wait for them here with nothing
but a pile of stones to protect us.

684
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,579
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

685
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,833
Mance was one of us once.

686
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,585
Now he's one of them.

687
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,588
He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.

688
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:37,509
They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.

689
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:41,847
They're gonna be more organized than before,
more disciplined,

690
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,974
more like us.

691
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,270
So we need to be more like them,
do things their way.

692
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,690
Sneak in, kill Mance,

693
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,569
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.

694
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,780
- And to do that...
- We need to get rid of those lookouts.

695
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:01,199
It's not a job for 400 men.

696
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:03,952
I need to move fast and silent.

697
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:08,164
Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.

698
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:11,376
Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

699
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:16,339
I've been called lots of things,
but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.

700
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:17,507
(LAUGHING)

701
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:19,885
You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

702
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:21,678
I've fought and killed a wight.

703
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,680
How many rangers can say that?

704
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,098
He's the one?

705
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:29,185
Aye. You killed a wight.

706
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,773
You also let an old man beat you bloody
and take your sword.

707
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:35,358
(ALL LAUGHING)

708
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:36,693
QHORIN: Craster?

709
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,154
In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.

710
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:45,160
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.

711
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,455
It would be no trouble.

712
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,468
Well, I hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.

713
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,888
Go on.

714
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,314
XARO: So, tell me,

715
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,943
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

716
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:21,613
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

717
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:23,365
He's my advisor,

718
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,158
my friend.

719
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,743
Unlikely.

720
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,746
I can almost always tell what a man wants.

721
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,040
And what about what a woman wants?

722
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,000
Much more complicated.

723
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:37,879
You, for example, what do you want?

724
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:41,716
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

725
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,218
Why?

726
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,178
Because I promised my khalasar
I'd protect them

727
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,305
- and find them a safe home.
- (CHUCKLES)

728
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,600
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?

729
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:52,811
I want them because they're mine by right.

730
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:56,147
The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

731
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,732
Ah, a conqueror.

732
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,069
And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?

733
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:05,907
No. I come from nothing.
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

734
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:08,159
except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.

735
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:10,912
So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.

736
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:15,000
You're a conqueror, too.
You're just less ambitious.

737
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,334
(CHUCKLES)

738
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,340
What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?

739
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,093
At the gates of the city, you bled for me.

740
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,261
Why?

741
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,432
I will show you why.

742
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:37,272
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

743
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,192
The hardest steel does not make a mark.

744
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:46,614
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth
their weight in gold if they could break into it.

745
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,534
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.

746
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,037
They all went home empty-handed.

747
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:55,290
The only thing that can open this door

748
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:57,584
is this key.

749
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,044
And behind the door?

750
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:02,589
(XARO CHUCKLES)

751
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,549
And it can all be mine?

752
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,469
All? Let us say half.

753
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:14,100
More than enough
to buy horses, ships, armies...

754
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,019
Enough to go home.

755
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,897
All I have to do?

756
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:20,607
Is marry me.

757
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,069
That was a romantic proposal.

758
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:28,031
I've already married once for love,
but the gods stole her from me.

759
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,286
I come from nothing.

760
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,206
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

761
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:39,626
But marry me,
and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms

762
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:43,088
and our children
will be princes and princesses.

763
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:47,133
See?

764
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,928
I have more ambition than you thought.

765
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:55,100
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.

766
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:58,061
Robert Baratheon is dead.

767
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,362
JORAH: If you cross the sea
with an army you bought...

768
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,781
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war with one another.

769
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:12,367
Four false kings destroying the country.

770
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,120
To win Westeros,
you need support from Westeros.

771
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:17,497
The usurper is dead.

772
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,000
The Starks fight the Lannisters,
and Baratheons fight each other.

773
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:24,379
According to your new friend
who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

774
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,507
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army

775
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,218
or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge of the world.

776
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,804
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

777
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,932
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

778
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,185
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

779
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,521
And if I'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,

780
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,231
we'd all be dead by now.

781
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,484
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

782
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:50,071
- but you must...
- Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

783
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,409
- I only want...
- What do you want?

784
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,536
Tell me.

785
00:49:57,245 --> 00:50:00,248
- To see you on the Iron Throne.
- Why?

786
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,624
You have a good claim.

787
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,918
A title. A birthright.

788
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,672
But you have something more than that.

789
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:12,218
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

790
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:15,471
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

791
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:19,434
Someone who can rule and should rule.

792
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,520
Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.

793
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:28,610
There are times when I look at you
and I still can't believe you're real.

794
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,917
So what would you have me do,
as my advisor?

795
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,382
Make your own way.

796
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,594
Find your own ship. You only need one.

797
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,472
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

798
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,476
And how do I get the ship?

799
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,561
I'll find it for you.

800
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,314
A sound ship with a good captain.

801
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,280
I look forward to meeting him.

802
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,661
Khaleesi.

803
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,422
(DRAGONS CHIRPING)

804
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:39,389
(WATER SIZZLING)

805
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,484
You should stand sideface.

806
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,568
Sideface?

807
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,072
Sideways.

808
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,448
Why?

809
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:59,367
Smaller target.

810
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:03,413
Am I fighting someone?

811
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:04,747
You're practicing for a fight.

812
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,376
You should practice right.

813
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,005
- (LOUD THUD)
- (WOMAN SCREAMING)

814
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,256
MAN: Guards!

815
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:17,468
Did you see anything?

816
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:22,390
Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

817
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:28,730
Go up the battlement.

818
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,698
Move away.

819
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:42,910
Stand back. He's dead.
