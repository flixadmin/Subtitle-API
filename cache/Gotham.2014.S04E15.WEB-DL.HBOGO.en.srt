1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,400
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm arresting you for the murder
of the boy you blew up

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,480
under the Crown Point Bridge.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,600
You blew that kid sky-high.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,520
You are a lying!
You are a lying traitor!

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,200
I need you as the head of the GCPD.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,960
Let them think you're a hero.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,400
I screwed up, Harv.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,440
Sofia hired the Pyg
and I covered it up.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,240
- We all have to make sacrifices.
- No!

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,680
It was all about family.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,280
Never said it was a happy family.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,040
My friend thinks
we're here to rob you.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,240
But I know you torture plants
in the name of science,

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,640
Roland Charles.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Lee Thompkins may have made Ed
strong but I see the other you.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,680
The Riddler.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,840
I'm back.

19
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,040
What's that smell?

20
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,240
Uncle Penguin sent me to get you.

21
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,080
Come on, let's get ice cream.

22
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,800
{\an5}The Narrows is under new management.

23
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
{\an5}The Narrows is Sampson's turf.

24
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,400
{\an5}And Sampson well...

25
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,360
{\an5}collects protection.

26
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,960
{\an5}But people need to find out
what happens...

27
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
{\an5}when you don't pay.

28
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,240
{\an5}Please, my family.

29
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,600
Do I look like an animal to you?

30
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,200
{\an5}I wouldn't hurt your family.

31
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,440
{\an5}Unless they don't pay me.

32
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,400
{\an5}Before Don Falcone died,
he warned me,

33
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,720
{\an5}I had no idea
what I brought to the city.

34
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,880
{\an5}I now know
he was talking about the Pyg.

35
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
{\an5}Somebody must have told him.

36
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,240
{\an5}My guess, that person has evidence

37
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,280
{\an5}that links Sofia
to the Pyg's murders.

38
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,880
{\an5}Why not come forward
with what you know?

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,880
{\an5}It has to be more than
just my words against hers.

40
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,760
{\an5}Or are you afraid the truth
is gonna drag you down too?

41
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
{\an5}Harvey, we've been over this.

42
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,200
{\an5}- When did you know?
- I swear,

43
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,520
{\an5}I had no idea
until after it was too late.

44
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
{\an5}Now you can be pissed,
but this is bigger than both of us.

45
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,760
{\an5}I need to know I can count on you.

46
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,080
Yeah, Jim.

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
{\an5}I'll help you take
you take down Sofia.

48
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,960
But then you're gonna have to pay
for what you've done.

49
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,360
I personally guarantee it.

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,200
{\an5}I know an ex-Falcone assassin,
might have beans to spill.

51
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,600
Went by the name of
Scandinavian Skinner.

52
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,960
Sit tight.

53
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,680
I have history with The Skinner.

54
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,960
You know, you have like
no food in here, right?

55
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,840
Selina?

56
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,560
What are you doing here?
What's... what's wrong?

57
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,040
Why does something have to be wrong
for me to come by?

58
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,160
Seriously?

59
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,560
I need help.

60
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,240
You mean money?

61
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,040
I stole something, fenced it
and now I wanna get it back

62
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,880
and I'd steal it
but the fence is difficult.

63
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
So I need money.

64
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
Why don't you just ask
Barbara Kean for the money?

65
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
Because I don't wanna
get her involved.

66
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,440
Look, I'll... I'll pay you back.

67
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,120
I just... I don't have time because
if the fence sells what I...

68
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
But you still haven't told me
why you wanna give it back.

69
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,800
Because it's what I stole
from Roland Charles.

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,120
- The Wayne scientist...
- That Ivy killed.

71
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,720
I didn't know
she was gonna do that, Bruce.

72
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,080
And I... I just...

73
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,280
You feel bad.

74
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,120
Look, if you don't wanna help me
then I'll just find another way.

75
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,320
Let me get some cash.

76
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,600
There is oatmeal raisin cookies
in the blue tin.

77
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,120
Why are you dragging me here?

78
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,080
Cobblepot.

79
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,120
Guy called.
Want me to give you a message.

80
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,320
Finally.

81
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,960
"I could lend you a hand,
but you won't find me helpful.

82
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,440
My name may sound tasty
but the flavor is dreadful."

83
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,280
Is it knuckle sandwich?

84
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Yeah.

85
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,560
Hello, Agnes.

86
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
Or should I say The Skinner?

87
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,040
Detective Bullock.

88
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
I don't go by that name anymore.

89
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm retired.

90
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,720
- You kids, don't spoil your dinner.
- Okay, Grandma.

91
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm looking for someone

92
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
who might have been
Don Falcone's eyes and ears

93
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
when he was down south.

94
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,520
Why would I tell you that?

95
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,600
Because we have history.

96
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
That history got me
four years in the gulag.

97
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,360
Either you help me...

98
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,120
or I tell your beautiful
grandchildren

99
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,840
how heir Meemaw
used to skin people alive.

100
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,680
Hey kids, you want to hear
really funny story?

101
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,720
Alright. Alright.

102
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,040
Never mind.

103
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Falcone...

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
only really trusted the bookkeeper.

105
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,640
The one who always smelled of fish.

106
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,680
- Mr. Penn?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,720
Penn.

108
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,760
But good luck finding him.
I heard he's vanished.

109
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,880
Poof.

110
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,040
How is Martin gone?

111
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Never mind.

112
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,000
Penguin is coming.

113
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,360
Go to Arkham and kill him, now.

114
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,920
Okey-dokey.

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,520
Oh, by the way, a buddy of mine
just got out of the hospital,

116
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,800
and he was looking for work.

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,200
You mind if he tags along?

118
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Hiya.

119
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
Just make sure Penguin dies,
choking on his own blood.

120
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,800
- Why is Cobblepot in the infirmary?
- Heard he mouthed off to a guard.

121
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,960
Then slipped and hit his head.

122
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Like I said...

123
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,120
Bullock. This is a surprise.

124
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,520
Yeah, Oswald. Good to see you too.

125
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Just have a few questions
about a former employee of yours.

126
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,880
They got guns!

127
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Open that door!

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
Get out of the way. Clear out!

129
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,960
Move, move, move!

130
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Hey!

131
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,280
You two! Don't come any closer!

132
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,400
Bullock!

133
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,800
Dude, I thought you stopped
being a cop?

134
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,280
- Guess it didn't take, huh?
- Not so much.

135
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,600
- You remember Wendell, don't you?
- Howdy.

136
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
I don't know why you two are here,
and I don't care.

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,840
- Walk away!
- See.

138
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm afraid we can't do that.

139
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,080
We're not leaving here
without the Penguin.

140
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
Harvey, do yourself a favor.

141
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,920
Give us Penguin...

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,040
and leave to get drunk another day.

143
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,960
As tempting as that sounds, no.

144
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,360
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

145
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,280
It's okay.

146
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,760
We'll come back.

147
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,880
He's escaped.

148
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,280
Oswald Cobble pot has escaped!

149
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,560
Nygma.

150
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,640
- What?
- You're just different.

151
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Different how?

152
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,200
You're a complete douchebag to me
at the club.

153
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,760
And now you're not.

154
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,280
Listen Selina, about that night...

155
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,200
Oh, no. You're not gonna try
to apologize to me, are you?

156
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,320
- No, I just wanted to say...
- Save it.

157
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,040
Because you're probably gonna be
douchebag to me later anyway.

158
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,000
Missed you too.

159
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
Kitty cat.

160
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Back so soon?

161
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
What's up, Floyd?

162
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm gonna need that stuff,
I brought to you the other day.

163
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,160
You mean this stuff?

164
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
This stuff you try to break-in
and steal last night?

165
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
You think,
I wouldn't check the camera?

166
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Go ahead.

167
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,200
Remember what I said
about being a douchebag?

168
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,720
I'll pay double what you gave me.

169
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
This your bank?

170
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,960
How about I take the money...

171
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,160
and I keep your stuff?

172
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Next time...

173
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,720
take the deal.

174
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Got it.

175
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,320
I knew that as soon as I rescued
Martin that she send her hitman.

176
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,840
How is Martin?

177
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,280
Snug as a bug in a rug.
Here, will you hold this?

178
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,800
So, do you want to know
how I found him?

179
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,760
So turns out, Zsasz...

180
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,360
huge fan of the disco.

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,320
So, I dressed up as an old polis...

182
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,000
Perhaps another time.

183
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,240
Now that Martin is saved,
we need to focus on killing Sofia.

184
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,520
- We need a power base.
- I know.

185
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
That's why we're here.

186
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,240
Hello.

187
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,360
Ed. You're back.

188
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,200
How are you doing?

189
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,040
Worlds better.

190
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,000
Honestly thank you. I...

191
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,520
Oh no, what happened to your hand?

192
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,720
Sofia Falcone...

193
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,240
smashed it with a hammer

194
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,360
and then threw me out on the street.

195
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,720
And put Sampson
in charge of the Narrows.

196
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,560
- I see.
- But together,

197
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,400
we can get that bitch back.

198
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
Can show her she can't just take
everything we've built.

199
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,520
Yeah Oswald, she can't help.

200
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,560
What is this?

201
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,920
What is going on?
What's wrong with you?

202
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,600
I let him out of his cage and he,
in turn, helped me get out of mine.

203
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,000
Your him. The Riddler.

204
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Hi, Lee.

205
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,200
You know, it's really helping that
you were still running the Narrows,

206
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,800
maybe could help us, but...

207
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,080
- I guess not.
- Yeah, so what's your next

208
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,320
brilliant idea?

209
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,040
Sofia will have turned Falcone
mansion into a stronghold

210
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,000
It would impossible to get at her.

211
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,440
Oswald. You think I don't have
a backup plan?

212
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,440
Gonna have Victor Freeze
put you in a block of ice.

213
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm going to take you to Sofia
like a chilly Trojan horse,

214
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,080
pretend to hand you over.

215
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,360
Are you kidding me?

216
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,520
It's a fantastic plan.

217
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,720
- Try again!
- Alright, let me help.

218
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,320
Look, all of your old capos have
pledged their loyalty to Sofia...

219
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Do you think I can't handle it?

220
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
- I know you can't.
- Look what she did to me.

221
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,680
I will pull the trigger
on that bitch myself.

222
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,840
That's some tough talk.

223
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,200
But we both know that's just talk.

224
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,000
Enough! Both of you!

225
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,880
If we wanna fight Sofia,
we need muscle.

226
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I agree.

227
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,920
I can tell you where to look.

228
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,880
Don't you think he misses you?

229
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,000
Who's she talking about?

230
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,720
Grundy!

231
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,880
You down here, big fella?

232
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,080
Your best friend and pal.

233
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,600
Edward Nygma.

234
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,960
Hey, guess what? I'm smart again.

235
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,880
There he is.

236
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,960
Pale skin, nobody upstairs,
who's my buddy?

237
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,480
Correct, you.

238
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,480
Oh, boy. So we're corralling allies.

239
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,760
Penguin and I are gonna kill
Sofia Falcone,

240
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,480
and we need a big galoot like you for
cannon fodder. How's that sound?

241
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
What's your problem?
Why you looking at me like that?

242
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Oh, dear.

243
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,760
You're not the only one
who got smart.

244
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,200
Okay, Butch. I helped you.

245
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,480
You remember? Hot? Hot hand?

246
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,200
Yeah? Ed put out fire.

247
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,240
But you're not Ed anymore.

248
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,720
And I'm not Grundy.

249
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,360
- Where the hell is Ed?
- He'll be here.

250
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,840
No.

251
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,640
No, he betrayed me too. I know it.

252
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,040
I should never
should have trusted him.

253
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,160
Calm down.

254
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,880
No! Do not tell me to calm down.

255
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
You have no idea
what I've been through.

256
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,880
Calm down. Ed will be here.

257
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,000
He will bring Grundy
and we will make Sofia pay.

258
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,400
I can't wait any longer.

259
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,320
How did Nygma get in touch
with Penguin anyway?

260
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
I don't know.

261
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,000
Nothing's ever easy with you, is it?

262
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,680
It's always like find Lee
and then she'll point us to Ed

263
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,160
and then we'll find Penguin.

264
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
And he'll tell us where to find Penn.

265
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
Or we could just talk to Oswald
right now.

266
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
Hey, you son of a...

267
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,360
What are you doing here?

268
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,080
We're looking for an Arkham escapee

269
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,640
about yea tall, walks with limp.
Mommy complex.

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,280
Those trumped-up charges
you use to put me away,

271
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,960
have lost their teeth.

272
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,240
Martin is still alive.

273
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,960
- So, produce him.
- Nope.

274
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,200
He is not safe

275
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,560
until Sofia Falcone
has been dealt with.

276
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Permanently.

277
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,160
I think you and I want
the same thing, Oswald.

278
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,120
We both want Sofia to go away.

279
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,760
Then turn around and walk away.

280
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,160
Let me do what I do.

281
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,160
No. I want her in jail
and for that I need evidence.

282
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
I want you bookkeeper, Mr. Penn.

283
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,120
Where he know about...

284
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,680
That little weasel was working
for her!

285
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,520
Yeah, he was working for her.

286
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,280
For Don Falcone. Everybody.

287
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,800
You might wanna check
your management style, pal.

288
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,920
I will kill him. I will kill him.

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,120
Oswald, Oswald.

290
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Calm down you show us...

291
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,200
where we can find Mr. Penn...

292
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,360
and I'll let you walk away.

293
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,560
I don't believe you.

294
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,000
Sofia sent Zsazs to Arkham
to kill you.

295
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
Her goons' run the Narrows.

296
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,240
How long do you think it's gonna
take until she finds you?

297
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
I overheard Mr. Penn talk about
a place just out of town.

298
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,640
Near the Tricorner.
The spa Bosh Sumka.

299
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,440
Offers special therapy.

300
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,840
If he's hiding, he's probably there.

301
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,960
Oswald.

302
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Thank you.

303
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,400
That's really nice, now put
your hand behind your back.

304
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
No. No. We had a deal!

305
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,720
Harvey, what are you doing?

306
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,680
If you wanna look the other way,
Jim, fine.

307
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,560
I didn't agree this squad. Come on!

308
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
No!

309
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,360
No!

310
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
- I will not forget this!
- Relax.

311
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,200
The information on Penn is good

312
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,720
at least you'll be free
of Sofia Falcone.

313
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,920
Well, well, well.

314
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Sofia is gonna be very curious
to know why you're looking for Penn.

315
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,520
Hey, Penguin. Remember me?

316
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Oh, God. No.

317
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
Wait, is Penn important or something?

318
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,680
That's a yes. You see that?

319
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,000
That's his "yes" face.

320
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,360
Get him in the car.

321
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,880
Guess I'll have to go dig him up
myself.

322
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,800
Now, you boys wanna come quietly...

323
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,960
or do you wanna do it the fun way?

324
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,480
The fun way. Nice.

325
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
- Lee?
- Shut up and get down.

326
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Lee!

327
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,720
Come on. Let's get out of here.

328
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,760
We need to get to Penn
before Zsasz does.

329
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,040
We need a car.

330
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Migraines still?

331
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
It's like I've being hit in the head
with a brick.

332
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
What is that stink?

333
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,440
Should've known.

334
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,440
Grundy smells like old dentures.

335
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,400
It's him.

336
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,160
I know, I can smell him.

337
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,560
Hello, Barbara.

338
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,000
Scary.

339
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Nygma tried to recruit me
against Sofia.

340
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,440
He's working for Penguin.

341
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,080
I figured after all Ed did to you,
you should be the one who kill him.

342
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,760
Wait, Butch.

343
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,240
Don't just walk away again.

344
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,480
Tabby, I wanna find a way to get
back to the old me.

345
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,520
I promise.

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Any ideas?

347
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,520
You okay?

348
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
I'm fine.

349
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,440
We send Nygma back to Sofia.

350
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
She would torture him
to get to Penguin.

351
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,080
Lee has no more allies.
Boom, rebellion quells, we're heroes.

352
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,000
Then, what about Nygma?
He just gets to walk away?

353
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,520
When Sofia doesn't need him anymore,
she'll kill him.

354
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,320
Same end result, none of headache.

355
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,040
Well, we did find Penguin,
but then he got away

356
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,960
So why aren't you looking for him
instead of wasting my time?

357
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Because I also found out that Gordon
is looking for Mr. Penn.

358
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,480
Find Penn before Gordon does.

359
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,400
Yeah, so Penn, Penguin

360
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,240
I mean, where are we, priorities-wise

361
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,240
Do both.

362
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,400
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

363
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,080
Don't bother.
Without you, I can't get to Sofia.

364
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Touching.

365
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,920
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

366
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
Believe it.

367
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,600
No Ed, no Grundy.
We're running out of time.

368
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,840
You know this cockamamie scheme
will probably get me killed.

369
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,800
If it puts Sofia in the ground,
I'm okay with that.

370
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,440
Last time you came to me
with one of your schemes

371
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,920
to regain the city.

372
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,520
You promised every resources
I needed to reverse my condition.

373
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,920
So that didn't happened.

374
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,440
An omission. I regret
and will rectify if given the chance.

375
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
God!

376
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,840
You cannot honestly tell me
you were happy here.

377
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,440
Tinkering away on whatever...

378
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,880
Don't touch that.

379
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,040
You need money for your research.

380
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,160
Sofia wants Penguin.

381
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,680
So, you deliver him to her,
you can name your price.

382
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,440
I may have something.

383
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,160
Keep this on you. It's on a timer.
Best I can do on short notice.

384
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,640
Being frozen affects my brain
the way it did Nygma.

385
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,040
- I cannot afford...
- Ready?

386
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,160
- Not yet...
- Don't care.

387
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,040
So now, you're gonna return it?

388
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,880
- Selina, you said...
- Can you do it?

389
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,760
That's really why you came to me.

390
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,720
It wasn't about the money.

391
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,160
You did not kill Roland Charles.

392
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,400
I was there though.

393
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,520
What am I supposed to say? I...

394
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,080
I stole your jewelry.

395
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,880
Sorry.

396
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,000
Sometimes that's enough.

397
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,600
His strength of mind is impressive.

398
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,600
You are going to tell me
where to find Penguin.

399
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,160
Or I will make all of this look like
a pleasant dream.

400
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Okay.

401
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,160
I can be done with the teeth
the eyes or the mind.

402
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
What am I?

403
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,120
I can be humorous
but I'm never funny!

404
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,240
What am I?

405
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,160
Tell me where he is.

406
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,840
I am telling you!

407
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,880
You're too stupid to figure that out.

408
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,160
Miss Falcone, you got a visitor.

409
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,800
Kinda in the middle of something.

410
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,080
Guy's got Penguin.

411
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Bring him in.

412
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,880
Well, this is unexpected.

413
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,920
I heard you were looking for Penguin?

414
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,120
He never was a great boss.

415
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,840
Well, well, Oswald.

416
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,800
Is he alive in there?

417
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
Maybe.

418
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,760
I want 100,000.

419
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Pay him.

420
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,080
I'm not even gonna ask.

421
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,440
Oh, by the way,
I found out where Penn is.

422
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,400
Take him to the docks, shoot him,
and throw him in the river.

423
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,520
Watch Penguin.

424
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
Let's go get Mr. Penn.

425
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Lovely Ms. Gonzalez. Well done.

426
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,480
Pull it little harder.

427
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,680
That... that's it, Mr. King, come on.

428
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,120
What fresh level hell is this?

429
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,840
Who's hungry?

430
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,720
GCPD!

431
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,840
GCPD!

432
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,520
We're looking for Arthur Penn.

433
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
What are you doing?

434
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,800
Anonymity is a strict edict here
at the resort.

435
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,080
- I bet.
- What is going on?

436
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,880
- That's him.
- Penn! Penn!

437
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,840
Oh, no.

438
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Let's take a walk.

439
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
As you were.

440
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Mr. Cobblepot.

441
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,440
You're working for her too.

442
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,760
- I assure you...
- Of course, you are!

443
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,440
- Where is she?
- You don't understand.

444
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,320
Where is she?

445
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Is it done?

446
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,400
Sofia left before I could kill her,
she's on her way to stop Gordon.

447
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,240
<i>Meet me at the Spa Bosh Sumka,
and we will kill her together.</i>

448
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,200
Nygma was here.

449
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Miss Falcone
tried to get him to turn on you.

450
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
What?

451
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,920
He endured the tremendous
amount paid.

452
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,960
He wouldn't give you up.

453
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Where is he now?

454
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,320
Her thugs took him to the docks...

455
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,360
to kill him.

456
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,960
I worked for Don Falcone
for years...

457
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,000
before Mr. Cobblepot.

458
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,760
When Sofia came to Gotham,

459
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,440
Don Falcone asked me
to keep an eye on his daughter.

460
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,360
She found out.

461
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,520
So you made another deal with her.

462
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,760
You weaselly triple agent you

463
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,280
It's how you stay alive
in this business.

464
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,160
And she let me live...

465
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,880
as long as I informed to her
about Mr. Cobblepot.

466
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,240
That's how she was able to stay
one step ahead of Penguin,

467
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,520
with inside information.

468
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,360
- Then what?
- She asked me to put her in touch

469
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
with Lazlo Valentine.

470
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
The Pyg.

471
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,640
So, I did.

472
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,400
But I told Don Falcone right away.

473
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,320
Alright. You're coming with us.

474
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,880
We need your statement
for the record.

475
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Get down!

476
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,160
Get Penn out of here,
he's all that matters.

477
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,160
We gotta get you to the hospital.

478
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,760
Gunshot will draw attention.

479
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,960
Cops will be here soon,
I can make it 'til they arrive.

480
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,440
James Gordon.

481
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,400
We could've had a good thing,
you and I.

482
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,560
You just had to go and ruin it.

483
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Go.

484
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,200
That's an order.

485
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,800
Get Penn. Get Gordon.

486
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,360
Get out!

487
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,840
Lee!

488
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,160
- Where's Sofia?
- In there, with Jim.

489
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,280
Take the car.

490
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,640
He's hurt, bad.

491
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Get in.

492
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,920
Can't catch a break today.

493
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,360
Let's go get milkshake.

494
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,960
Jim, you really are
such a disappointment.

495
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,240
Would it have been so bad?

496
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
Being in the palm of my hands?

497
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,480
Having me chip away at your soul
little by little?

498
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Was it so important to rob me
of my revenge?

499
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,520
It wasn't about me.

500
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,960
I wasn't gonna give you the GCPD.

501
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,000
Of course, it was about you.

502
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,200
Your pride, your arrogance.

503
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,080
Do you think that what I was
asking for was any different

504
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,840
that what my father had for 30 years?

505
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,920
You mean your father who you killed?

506
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Yes.

507
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,840
I killed him.

508
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,160
Because he disappointed me.

509
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,680
Just like you.

510
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,920
You know, Jim...

511
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,320
oddly enough, I still care for you.

512
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,240
Beg me for your life.

513
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,600
Ask for forgiveness.

514
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,840
And we can start over.

515
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Sofia...

516
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,600
go to hell.

517
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,480
James Gordon.

518
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
This is where our story ends.

519
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,880
- You.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Me.

521
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,040
Stay with me, Jim.

522
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,280
Jim. Do you hear me?

523
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,040
Come on, come on!

524
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,560
Hey, I got a riddle for you.

525
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,320
What's got a bullet in his head
and sinks to the bottom of a river?

526
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
You.

527
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,440
The real torture...

528
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,280
is that those idiotic words
will be the last I ever hear.

529
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,440
Just do it!

530
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Oswald.

531
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
How?

532
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,720
Did you already kill Sofia?

533
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
No.

534
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,120
She left the mansion to pursue
Jim Gordon.

535
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,280
Why don't you just stay at the home,

536
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,040
wait 'til she came there
and killed her?

537
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,080
Then I wouldn't have been here
on time.

538
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,200
You gave up your revenge for me?

539
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,920
Trust is so very hard to find
in Gotham.

540
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,120
But I trust you, Ed.

541
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,680
I have a strong desire...

542
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,080
to never, ever see this pier again.

543
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,080
Oh, I agree.

544
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Hey.

545
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,800
Hey.

546
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
Surprised you're alive?

547
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Yeah.

548
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Yeah.

549
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,400
- How?
- How do you think?

550
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,560
Lee.

551
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,480
She kept you alive
'til the medics get there.

552
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,960
Even one-handed
she's a damn good doctor.

553
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,440
Sofia?

554
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
In a coma.

555
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,440
Amazing she's not dead.

556
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Harvey.

557
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,480
When I get out of here
I'm gonna confess.

558
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,040
My connection to Sofia,
my role with The Pyg, all of it.

559
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,120
I got to come clean.

560
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,600
No.

561
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
What do you mean?

562
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,880
Who would benefit from that? You.

563
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,880
You get to be the martyr.

564
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Feel better about yourself.

565
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,920
The GCPD looses its hero. No!

566
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,200
You want to pay your debt...

567
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,480
you live with it.

568
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Just like I do.

569
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,320
So, Sofia wins after all.

570
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,440
It's what the city needs.

571
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,760
Where's Lee?

572
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,160
She went back to The Narrows.

573
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,040
Said she had unfinished business.

574
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,920
Nobody knows? There, you like it?

575
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,320
Hit him again!

576
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,920
- Not so tough now?
- Get him!

577
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,920
Smash him up! Come on!

578
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,080
Alright, I'll go.

579
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,640
I'll go.

580
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,960
Oh, I know you'll go.

581
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,480
Just not yet.

582
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,840
Hold his hand.

583
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,360
No. No!

584
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
No!

585
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,440
What are you doing? No!

586
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,440
No. No!

587
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,560
No!

588
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,960
No. Stop!

589
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,960
With Sofia gone, Penguin is going to
try to take control of Gotham again,

590
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,280
maybe even try and kill us.

591
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,760
Could you just give me a second?

592
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,080
Barbara, we have to act.

593
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,240
We can't just stand around here
doing nothing.

594
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,480
I said shut up!
