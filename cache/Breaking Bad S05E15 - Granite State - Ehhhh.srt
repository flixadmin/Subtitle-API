<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,322
He was out here with those feds...

3
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:13,715
Shouldn't we maybe find out
what he told them first?

4
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:14,660
Get out.

5
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:17,345
- Put the knife down, please.
- Get out!

6
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:23,886
I need the police.
My dad...

7
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:30,505
<i>You have no right to discuss
anything of what I do.</i>

8
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:32,522
What the hell do you know
about it anyway?

9
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,257
<i>Nothing!</i>

10
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:06,856
You can come on out.

11
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:22,068
It's an actual store.

12
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,805
I guess I figured Vacuum Cleaner Repair
was a term of art.

13
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,816
If you would step right here
on this blue spot.

14
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:38,430
Leave your luggage
where it is for the moment.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,170
That good?

16
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,548
- Sure.
- What about this?

17
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:56,677
I'll Photoshop that out.

18
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:07,519
Oh, Nebraska.
What's in Nebraska?

19
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:09,220
You.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,106
From now on.

21
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,994
It's gonna take me some time
to get your new situation fixed.

22
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:16,756
Until then,
you're gonna be staying here.

23
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:19,364
I got a place downstairs,
out of sight.

24
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:23,745
It's not the Ritz-Carlton,
but it's comfortable enough for short-term.

25
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,395
How short-term?

26
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:29,324
Considering you got your face up on
buses and billboards all over town,

27
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:31,470
I'm thinking...

28
00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:33,803
two days.

29
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:35,589
Maybe three.

30
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:38,532
Only thing is,

31
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,771
and I don't like to do this, but...

32
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,505
you'll have a bunk mate.

33
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:47,142
Oh, yeah?
He's still here?

34
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:49,442
For the moment.

35
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:52,577
He's a special case.
Gonna take some doing.

36
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:57,578
How's he holding up?

37
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:01,906
You be the judge.

Steve too.

88
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,110
They're out there,
and we're gonna find them.

89

You have my word.

90
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,077
Sir.

91
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,540
Call it in, get her out of here.
Move.

92

<i>I get to his door,</i>

93
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:19,339
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>

94
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,143
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>

95
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,812
<i>And I thought, you know,</i>

96
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:25,590
<i>maybe...</i>

97
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:29,338
<i>I knocked on his door.</i>

98
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:33,035
<i>The music stopped,
and then he was right there.</i>

99
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,232
<i>When he saw the gun,
he thought...</i>

100
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,495
- Hey, Kenny.
<i>- I know he died.</i>

101
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:41,345
Does this pussy cry
through the entire thing?

102
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:45,970
Just watch.

103
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:47,645
<i>Kept saying that...</i>

<i>You know,
"You don't have to do this."</i>

<i>His eyes were so big.</i>

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,282
- Such a bitch.
- <i>...high-fiving,</i>

107
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:57,734
- He won't quit.
- <i>because it worked,</i>

108

<i>Drew Sharp.</i>

113
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:17,833

114
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,854
<i>Todd,</i>

115
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,389
<i>that opie, dead-eyed piece of shit,
pulls out a gun...</i>

116
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:26,573
<i>and shoots the kid.</i>

117

we're talking about?</i>

<i>Boom.</i>

120
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:35,267
<i>Like it was nothing.</i>

121
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,880
Hey, Uncle Jack.
Hold up.

122
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,551
I think we should keep him
for a while,

123
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,755
get a couple of cooks
under our belt.

124
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:57,812
You seriously giving me
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

125
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,110
He ratted you out.
Personally.

126
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,249
We still got 600 gallons
of methylamine.

127
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,371
Meth?
Who gives a shit about meth?

128
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:04,674
We won the lottery here.

129
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:07,299
We've got all the money
in the world.

130
00:06:07,582 --> 00:06:09,709
You're talking to me
about selling crank?

131
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,254
I mean, this is millions, Uncle Jack.
No matter how much you got,

132
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:14,723
how do you turn
your back on more?

133
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:20,586
You...

134
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:22,708
little...

135
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:25,215
son of a bitch.

136
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:31,798
It's that Lydia woman.

137
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:34,300
You're sweet on her,
you little bastard.

138
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:36,352
Hey, Kenny, you believe this?

139
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:39,636
Hey, it's all about this right here?

140
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,169
Come on.

141
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,498
You can do better.

142
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:50,286
I mean, that one's so uptight, she's probably
got a wood chipper for a coochie.

143
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:53,500
You stick it in down there,
you're pulling back a stump.

144
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,966
What the hell.

145
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,791
Heart wants what
the heart wants, right?

146
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:08,056
Let's go back and watch some more
of that crybaby rat.

147
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:05,115
How thick is it?

148
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:09,710
This is mild steel?

149
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:14,826
No, this would be cash.

150
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:31,560
What?

151
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:33,712
Nothing.

152
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:35,537
Hey, you know what?

153
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:38,800
Make yourself useful.

154
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,519
Give me a list
of hitters, mercenaries.

155
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:44,757
Yes, yes, I remember.
You've got concerns.

156
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:47,793
Don't worry. We'll take
the time to vet them.

157
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,912
Make sure there are no
undercover cops on the team.

158
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:53,786
Five should do it.

159
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:57,101
Providing they're
the right men for the job.

160
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,725
I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but...

161
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,033
who are we hitting?

162
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,938
Jack Welker.
And his men.

163
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:12,629
They murdered Hank.
They stole my life's work.

164
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,615
I don't know any hit men.

165
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:17,677
You know a guy who knows a guy.

166
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:21,027
Just get me the contacts.
Anybody in that world.

167
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:23,864
I'm paying top dollar.
We'll find them.

168
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,166
You mind if I give you
a nickel's worth of advice?

169
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,348
Just for old time's sake?

170
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:33,314
You're worried about
your wife and kids?

171
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:34,803
Don't leave.

172
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:38,212
The way things are right now,
some people, not me, mind you,

173
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:41,463
but some people might say
you're leaving her high and dry.

174
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,050
Some people would be
ignorant on the facts.

175
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:46,980
Some people wouldn't know

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,755
that as far as the police
are concerned,

177
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,356
Skyler is a blameless victim.

178
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,935
No, no, no.
Go ahead.

179
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,016
Get it off your chest.

180
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:00,840
Go on.

181
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:04,084
The phone call was a smart move.
Kudos to you.

182
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,896
Odds are it was recorded.
It's gonna play great for a jury.

183
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,341
It might even
buy her a mistrial.

184
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,885
In a year and a half.

185
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:13,230
Until then, if they don't have you,
they're going after her.

186
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,012
There's no point.
She knows nothing.

187
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,400
Well, too bad for her, then.
She's got nothing to trade.

188
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:22,066
I hate to be a downer here,
but there are two DEA agents missing.

189
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:23,330
Presumed dead.

190
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,867
You think the feds are gonna just let that go
'cause you hit the ejector seat?

191
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,982
First thing they're gonna do, they will
RICO your wife and kids out of the house.

192
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:33,245
That condo is gone.

193
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,934
Your bank accounts,
they're frozen.

194
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:38,111
Her picture's probably
on TV right now, next to yours.

195
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:40,238
- Who's gonna hire her?
- Money's no problem.

196
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,628
Well, I don't mean
to contradict you,

197
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:44,949
but getting it to her,
impossible.

198
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:47,758
The feds are just praying
that you'll make contact.

199
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:50,290
Internet, the phone...
it's all tapped.

200
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,747
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

201
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:55,618
But every time he tried to get his
nest egg to his granddaughter,

202
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,505
it ended up
in Uncle Sam's pockets.

203
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:02,091
So you propose what?

204
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:05,283
Stay.

205
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:07,062
Face the music.

206
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:10,502
Hey, I mean, how much time
have you got left?

207
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,068
You walk in with
your head held high.

208
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,703
You'll be the John Dillinger
of the Metropolitan Detention Center.

209
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:16,931
How bad is that?

210
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:19,115
And you bring a barrel
full of drug money,

211
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:21,647
maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

212
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,464
Maybe they let your family
stay in the house.

213
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,836
After all, the house predates
the criminal enterprise.

214
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:29,772
God, you think I want to run?!

215
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,491
This is the last thing
that I want.

216
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:34,835
This...
this changes nothing.

217
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:38,196
What I do, I do for my family.

218
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:40,925
My money goes to my children.

219
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:43,191
Not just this barrel.
All of it!

220
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:48,928
I'm going to kill Jack
and his entire crew,

221
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,290
and I'm gonna
take back what is mine

222
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,195
and give it to my children.
And then, and only then...

223
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,645
Am I through.

224
00:11:57,856 --> 00:11:59,568
Do you understand?

225
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:04,272
Everything good?

226
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,431
Define "good."

227
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:09,361
You're set.
Time to go.

228
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,746
You'll be a little longer.

229
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,003
I'm still working
on transportation.

230
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:15,968
Change of plans.

231
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:17,371
He's coming with me.

232
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:18,920
No.
No, that's not...

233
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,234
We're going together.
I can use him.

234
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:26,044
I'll give you two a minute.

235
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,163
Hey, I'm a civilian.

236
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,343
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

237
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:33,004
I'm nobody's lawyer.
The fun's over.

238
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:35,126
From here on out,
I'm Mr. Low Profile.

239
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:38,092
Just another douche bag with a job
and three pairs of Dockers.

240
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:40,746
If I'm lucky, month from now,
best-case scenario,

241
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,541
I'm managing
a cinnabon in Omaha.

242
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,878
You're still part of this.
Whether you like it or not.

243
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,033
I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

244
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,782
You remember what I told you?

245
00:12:57,706 --> 00:12:59,661
It's not over...

246
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,993
unti...

247
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,348
It's over.

248
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,649
...this goes to trial.

249
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,561
Is she even listening?

250
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,619
Mrs. White?

251
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:13,647
Are you following all this?

252
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:16,265
Do you understand
what's happening here?

253
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:19,231
Yes.

254
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:22,159
I understand.

255
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,923
I understand
I'm in terrible trouble.

256
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,863
I understand that you
will use everything...

257
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:35,186
in your power against me
and my children unless...

258
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:38,278
unless I give you Walt.

259
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:41,976
But the truth is,
I can't give you what you want.

260
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,311
I don't know where he is.

261
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:56,288
All right, go and discuss this
with your lawyer here.

262
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:59,238
Rack your brain.

263
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:03,259
And hope you can come up
with something we can use.

264
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:17,850
<i>4-17?</i>

265
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,099
4-17. No activity.

266
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:11,485
Ma'am, is there anybody
else in the house?

267
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,431
What about your son?

268
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,610
If I go look in his room,

269
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,514
am I gonna see him?

270
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:21,290
He's not gonna pop out
and surprise me?

271
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:26,381
If this guy takes his hand away,
are you gonna scream?

272
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,450
He's at his friend's house.

273
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,361
He's been there all week.

274
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:35,813
Please...

275
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,654
Please don't hurt my baby.

276
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,412
- Please, please.
- Ma'am.

277
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,256
We got a lot of respect for your husband.

278
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:47,205
There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

279
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:51,267
Okay? We know that you've
been talking to the police,

280
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:53,817
and that's okay.
You gotta do that.

281
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,845
But you've seen some people.

282
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:01,188
Like that lady
who came into the car wash.

283
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:04,627
The one with the black hair.

284
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,702
You said anything about her?

285
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,470
You sure about that?

286
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:17,062
I didn't.

287
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:20,953
The police don't need
to know anything about her.

288
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:29,875
Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to say it.

289
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:31,923
I...

290
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:33,102
will...

291
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:33,945
not...

292
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,492
say anything about her.

293
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:38,254
Ever.

294
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:40,810
I swear.

295
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,973
Okay.

296
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:56,184
When we leave, you're not gonna go
running to those police officers out front?

297
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:58,865
No.

298
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,405
Okay.

299
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,850
Okay.

300
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,713
'Cause you really
don't want us coming back here.

301
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,812
Don't.

302
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,983
Stay where you are.

303
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:08,068
We'll talk like this.

304
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:12,461
Okay.

305
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,442
So that thing
that we talked about,

306
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:19,279
I went to
Mr. and Mrs. White's house...

307
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,887
You don't...

308
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,255
have to say the name.

309
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:27,760
Sure.
And it went really good.

310
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,453
I mean, the message
was received loud and clear.

311
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:34,512
The message?

312
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,577
Yeah. Look...

313
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:39,034
I know you did your best.
I just think...

314
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,977
Hi.
What can I get you?

315
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,682
Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

316
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:45,459
And I'll need more stevia.

317
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:46,962
Sure.

318
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,302
The person we're discussing
saw my face.

319
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:59,456
You're not Western Union, Todd.
We can't just settle for you sending messages.

320
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:04,452
Really, if you'd been there,
I think you'd see it different.

321
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:06,822
We threw a real scare into her.

322
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:11,110
She seems like a nice lady
watching out for her kids.

323
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:12,798
So...

324
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:16,098
You're not going to have a problem with her.
I can pretty much guarantee it.

325
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:18,188
I wish I had your certainty,

326
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,704
but I'm not like
you and your uncle.

327
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:23,335
I'm just... I'm not used
to this kind of risk.

328
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:25,904
We're gonna have
to take a break.

329
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:32,287
I have 50 pounds
vacuum packed and ready to go.

330
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:35,360
And I wish you all the luck
in the world with it.

331
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:38,438
It's 92%.

332
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,510
I'm sorry?

333
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:45,935
92%.

334
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,591
Truly?

335
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:54,095
Tested it twice. And it's blue.
Just like before.

336
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:56,046
92.

337
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,139
That's Heisenberg level.

338
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,874
He's not with you?

339
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:05,957
Well, next best thing.
Pinkman.

340
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,776
They're looking for Pinkman.

341
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:11,339
Well, they're not going to find him.
He's with us,

342
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,320
and he's not going anywhere.

343
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:23,568
Come on, Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys
in Europe have been begging for, right?

344
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:33,227
I just think we work together... good.

345
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:37,772
We make a good team.

346
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,776
I think it's kind of...

347
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:44,662
mutually good.

348
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,812
92%.

349
00:22:23,244 --> 00:22:25,019
Mr. Lambert,

350
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:27,972
welcome to New Hampshire.

351
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:47,599
All right.

352
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,391
Let's have a look
at this place.

353
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:54,527
You got about a month's
worth of food on hand,

354
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:58,269
most of it's canned goods,
but there's steaks in the freezer.

355
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:02,166
You got a generator outside,
works on LP.

356
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:05,125
Ought to be enough in the tank
to last out the winter.

357
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:10,397
It's only 15 amps, but that ought
to do for the lights, TV, and the freezer.

358
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,487
That's a wood-burner.

359
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,875
Ought to warm
the place up pretty good.

360
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,439
Plus you can cook on it.

361
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,397
On the TV front,
the reception's pretty much nil.

362
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,619
You got some mountains
in the way.

363
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:26,693
Weather's right, you might
be able to catch Montreal,

364
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:29,604
but mostly you'll be
limited to DVDs.

365
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:33,695
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

366
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:35,931
Two copies.

367
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:39,116
I'm not much of a movie guy.

368
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:43,273
I'll make a supply run
next month.

369
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:47,148
You want something else
to watch, put it on the list.

370
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,270
Supply run.

371
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,670
$50,000 for a trip to Costco.

372
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:54,283
It's risk.

373
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:58,094
And risk is what you're paying me for,
not toilet paper.

374
00:23:58,392 --> 00:24:02,189
Risk and a 4,400-mile
round trip.

375
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:04,162
Mr. Lambert,

376
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:08,968
my clients and I don't usually have
an ongoing relationship.

377
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:13,034
Normally, you and I would have
already gone our separate ways, but...

378
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,932
you're you.

379
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:19,155
Where's the phone?

380
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:20,490
No phone.

381
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:24,652
Up here, ice storms
equal service calls,

382
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,069
equal you in cuffs.

383
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:28,749
Internet?

384
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,022
Same deal.

385
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,936
Also satellite, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

386
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:38,264
You want news, I'll bring
the Albuquerque papers.

387
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:40,180
Whatever you need, just...

388
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,364
- Put it on the list.
- Yeah.

389
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:45,896
Look,
I have business to conduct.

390
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,310
Your business is your business.

391
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,616
My business is keeping
you out of custody.

392
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:56,681
You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

393
00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:58,987
Your face is all over TV.

394
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:01,374
You are the hottest client
I have ever had.

395
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:03,095
By far.

396
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:05,867
It stands to reason

397
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:08,414
you've got to keep
out of sight.

398
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:13,142
And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

399
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:14,696
Nothing.

400
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:19,029
There's a little one-horse town
eight miles down the hill.

401
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:21,302
There's not a thing
on God's green Earth

402
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:23,932
that I can do to stop you
going down there.

403
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,004
All I'm saying is,

404
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:28,796
if you leave this place,

405
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,291
you will get caught.

406
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,640
And, I gotta tell you,

407
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:37,300
if I find out that
you've left the reservation,

408
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:40,110
I won't be coming back.

409
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,182
That is for my own safety.

410
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:44,128
You understand?

411
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:47,652
Sure.

412
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:50,460
You know how to work the stove?

413
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,837
- The flue can be tricky.
- Yeah.

414
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:53,285
I got it.

415
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,811
You paid good money for this.

416
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:04,877
You got two acres up here,
lots of woods, nice, warm place.

417
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,389
Seems to me just the spot
for a man to rest up,

418
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,312
think on things.

419
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,672
If you look around,

420
00:26:14,565 --> 00:26:16,427
it's kinda beautiful.

421
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:19,380
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.

422
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:21,783
See you in a month.

423
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:00,350
Tomorrow.

424
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:05,748
Tomorrow.

425
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:56,301
Come...

426
00:29:04,971 --> 00:29:07,145
That's not my chocolate
chip, is it?

427
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:09,674
You're gonna spoil him.

428
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:15,520
Hey, you awake?

429
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,369
Yeah.

430
00:29:19,548 --> 00:29:21,660
We had some Ben and Jerry's.

431
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,998
There's peanut butter cup
and "Americone Dream."

432
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,694
I didn't know what you liked,
so I got you some of each.

433
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,208
There you go.

434
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:51,994
So that batch that you
just cooked was 96%.

435
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:55,952
Kinda figured you deserved
a little something.

436
00:29:57,618 --> 00:29:59,070
Thanks.

437
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:16,045
Well...

438
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:17,503
better get some sleep.

439
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:19,956
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

440
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,269
Got a whole new batch.

441
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:24,746
Hey, Todd.

442
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:25,676
Yeah?

443
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:30,345
Would you mind, uh,
leaving the tarp off tonight?

444
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:32,390
Well, might get cold.

445
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,748
No, I don't mind.
I just...

446
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,502
I just wanna see the stars.

447
00:30:40,732 --> 00:30:42,122
Sure.

448
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:43,703
Okay.

449
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,026
Thanks.

450
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:49,793
Well, goodnight, Jesse.

451
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,362
Night.

452
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:49,380
Okay.

453
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:28,677
Come on. Bitch.

454
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:21,432
Go ahead! Do it!

455
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:25,621
Just kill me now and get it over with,
because there's no way

456
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:29,227
I'm doing one more cook
for you psycho fucks!

457
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:49,947
Yes?

458
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,106
Hi, ma'am.
How you doing tonight?

459
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:53,520
You're Andrea, right?

460
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:55,982
How can I help you?

461
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:58,436
You know Jesse Pinkman?

462
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,248
Right? Well, I'm a friend of his.
My name's Todd.

463
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:04,916
I'm sorry to bother you
so late, but...

464
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,066
it's nice to meet you.

465
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:14,581
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

466
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,447
Yeah, he's okay.

467
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,448
Actually,
I brought him with me.

468
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:19,954
Jesse's here?

469
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,299
Yeah, he's right...
over there.

470
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:23,995
In that truck.

471
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:37,256
Where?

472
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,478
No!

473
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:47,807
Just so you know,
this isn't personal.

474
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,888
No!

475
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,889
Hey.
Settle down.

476
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:16,830
Settle down.

477
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:19,938
Hey, remember.

478
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,968
There's still the kid.

479
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:25,727
I brought you a couple
of cases of ensure.

480
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:27,588
Maybe put a little
weight on you.

481
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:28,812
Jesus.

482
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:30,835
I can barely read this.

483
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:32,932
Almost forgot.

484
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:36,734
Without a prescription, I had to take
an educated guess and shotgun it.

485
00:36:36,754 --> 00:36:38,678
One of these
ought to come close.

486
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,021
Did you check on them?

487
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,738
Is Skyler in a better place?

488
00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:49,984
Nah, she's still at that
place off of Eubank.

489
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:53,025
Kids are both still
with her for the moment.

490
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:55,400
There's no court date yet.

491
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,693
The news was talking
about a grand jury,

492
00:36:57,713 --> 00:37:00,113
but they didn't say when.

493
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:03,149
I saw her
public defender on TV.

494
00:37:03,608 --> 00:37:05,817
Looks like a deer
in the headlights.

495
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,024
Think I got socks
older than him.

496
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:12,796
What are they doing for money?

497
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,829
She's doing
taxi dispatch part-time.

498
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:19,048
Leaves the baby with a
neighbor when she goes in.

499
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:22,354
I saw her shopping one time.

500
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,830
She looks pretty good.

501
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,623
And she's using
her maiden name.

502
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:30,173
I wouldn't take that personally
under the circumstances.

503
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:32,171
Those working for you?

504
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,268
Oh, yeah.

505
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:37,135
I took a run by your old house.

506
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:40,892
The auction's still pending.
They put a fence up around it.

507
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,225
They put up a fence?

508
00:37:42,245 --> 00:37:45,538
Seems like the place
got to be kind of a tourist attraction.

509
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:47,950
Kids breaking in.
The neighbors complained,

510
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,510
so the bank put up a fence.

511
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,989
You ready?

512
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,462
Yeah.

513
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:09,605
Sorry about last time.

514
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,807
It should go better now.

515
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:15,749
I watched a couple
of YouTube videos.

516
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:18,730
It's all about
finding the vein.

517
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,006
Give it to me.

518
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,693
I'll do it.

519
00:38:36,905 --> 00:38:38,084
Here.

520
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:39,945
You do it.

521
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:44,287
Big fist.
Tight. There we go.

522
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,963
All right.

523
00:38:46,983 --> 00:38:48,585
It's just...

524
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:51,253
stick.

525
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:53,332
That's it. Okay. Hey.

526
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,739
Pretty good.
There you go.

527
00:38:58,258 --> 00:39:01,137
Think I had worse
my last physical.

528
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:07,705
I will see you on...

529
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,569
Let's see.

530
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:12,567
Afternoon of the 15th.

531
00:39:14,428 --> 00:39:16,575
Stay a little longer?

532
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:21,037
Yeah, I got a long trip
ahead of me.

533
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:24,859
Two hours?

534
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:29,646
I'll give you another $10,000.

535
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:37,030
Please.

536
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:42,020
$10,000.

537
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:45,978
One hour.

538
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:51,728
Cards?

539
00:39:57,946 --> 00:39:59,396
All right, well...

540
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:03,690
The game will be Seven Card.

541
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,169
I'll deal, since you are...

542
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:11,497
encumbered.

543
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:22,355
One of these days
when you come up here...

544
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:24,887
I'll be dead.

545
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:30,061
My money over there.

546
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:34,318
What happens to it then?

547
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:39,803
What if I ask you
to give it to my family?

548
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:48,907
Would you do it?

549
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:56,726
If I said yes...

550
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,634
would you believe me?

551
00:41:09,923 --> 00:41:11,871
You wanna cut the cards?

552
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:15,844
No.

553
00:41:23,203 --> 00:41:24,704
A king.

554
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,672
Two kings.

555
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:10,139
<i>Flynn White to the
Principal's office, please.</i>

556
00:44:19,716 --> 00:44:21,912
I'm sorry to pull you
out of class.

557
00:44:22,123 --> 00:44:23,531
It's your Aunt Marie.

558
00:44:23,551 --> 00:44:25,582
It sounds very important.

559
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,073
You can take it in here, okay?

560
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:29,239
Okay.

561
00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:30,587
Here he is.

562
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:33,223
Thank you.

563
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:36,139
Hey, Aunt Marie.

564
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:38,228
what's going on?

565
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:40,048
Hold on a sec, honey.

566
00:44:46,465 --> 00:44:49,096
<i>Son, it's me.
Please don't let on.</i>

567
00:44:49,357 --> 00:44:52,286
<i>Carmen's nearby, right?
She cannot know.</i>

568
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:54,991
<i>Son, are you there?</i>

569
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,299
Yes.

570
00:44:58,677 --> 00:45:01,146
It's so good
to hear your voice.

571
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:05,639
I...

572
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,197
I...

573
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:11,081
Son...

574
00:45:12,062 --> 00:45:14,705
the things that they're saying...

575
00:45:14,928 --> 00:45:17,844
<i>about me...
I did wrong.</i>

576
00:45:17,864 --> 00:45:21,405
<i>I made some terrible mistakes.</i>

577
00:45:21,425 --> 00:45:25,384
But the reasons were always...

578
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:33,916
Things happened that I never...

579
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:38,394
intended.
I never intended.

580
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,386
Listen.

581
00:45:44,406 --> 00:45:46,979
Son, we don't have much time.

582
00:45:46,999 --> 00:45:51,435
Is Louis' family
still at 4848 Newcombe?

583
00:45:52,162 --> 00:45:55,388
<i>Son, your friend, Louis Corbett,</i>

584
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:59,510
<i>does his family still live in that
same place up on Newcombe?</i>

585
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:00,798
Yes.

586
00:46:00,818 --> 00:46:01,678
<i>Okay, good.</i>

587
00:46:01,696 --> 00:46:04,048
Okay, he's a good kid.

588
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:06,170
He's like you.
He'll understand.

589
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,024
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>

590
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:12,754
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis,
but it's for you.</i>

591
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:16,057
<i>Your mother and your sister.</i>

592
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:20,053
There's money inside.

593
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:24,064
About $100,000.

594
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:25,888
Okay?

595
00:46:26,198 --> 00:46:27,638
I think.

596
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,410
<i>It was all that I could fit into the box.</i>

597
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,066
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>

598
00:46:33,086 --> 00:46:36,563
And if anyone says a word,
the police will take it.

599
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,263
<i>I wanted to give you so much more.</i>

600
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,993
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>

601
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:54,948
Do you understand?

602
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:00,842
Son?

603
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:04,677
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

604
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:11,074
You want to send money?

605
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,645
Yes. Good.

606
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:14,866
Good, good.

607
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:18,810
So you'll talk to Louis, right?

608
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,379
You killed Uncle Hank.

609
00:47:21,399 --> 00:47:23,153
You killed him!

610
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,729
Wait. Wait, son.

611
00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:28,282
No.
What you did to mom... you asshole.

612
00:47:28,302 --> 00:47:29,734
You killed Uncle Hank.

613
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:33,213
- Listen to me. You've got to listen to me.
- Just shut up. Just stop it.

614
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:34,566
Stop it.

615
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:36,613
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>

616
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:38,831
I don't give a shit.

617
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:39,626
You need this money.
Your mother...

618
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:43,224
- <i>You killed Uncle Hank. You killed him!</i>
- Your mother needs this money.

619
00:47:43,244 --> 00:47:45,706
- It can't all be for nothing.
- <i>What you did... Just shut up.</i>

620
00:47:45,726 --> 00:47:46,862
- Please.
<i>- Shut up.</i>

621
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:48,401
<i>- Shut up.</i>
- Please.

622
00:47:48,421 --> 00:47:50,565
<i>Will you just leave us alone.</i>

623
00:47:50,585 --> 00:47:52,489
You asshole!

624
00:47:53,005 --> 00:47:55,732
Why are you still alive?

625
00:47:55,752 --> 00:47:58,088
<i>Why don't you just die already?</i>

626
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,147
Just die.

627
00:48:41,884 --> 00:48:45,642
<i>DEA. Albuquerque District Office.
How may I direct your call?</i>

628
00:48:45,928 --> 00:48:47,306
I'd...

629
00:48:47,326 --> 00:48:49,813
I'd like to speak to the agent...

630
00:48:50,723 --> 00:48:53,937
in charge of the Walter White investigation.

631
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,114
<i>Who may I say is calling?</i>

632
00:48:58,132 --> 00:48:59,687
Walter White.

633
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:04,365
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

634
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:06,866

635
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,403
<i>Sir, are you still there?</i>

636
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,905
<i>You ready for that drink now?</i>

637
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:23,408
Dimple Pinch. Neat.

638
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:25,711
You got it.

639
00:49:58,257 --> 00:50:01,190
<i>For us, it's always
been science first, and...</i>

640
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,567
Wait. Would you...

641
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:06,551
Would you go back, please?

642
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:08,151
<i>...more of a byproduct.</i>

643
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,141
- There.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

644
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:10,924
What, this?

645
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:11,934
Yes.

646
00:50:11,954 --> 00:50:16,910
<i>But just yesterday, your charity,
the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz Foundation,</i>

647
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,588
<i>announced a $28 million grant</i>

648
00:50:20,608 --> 00:50:22,847
<i>for drug abuse treatment centers</i>

649
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:24,807
<i>throughout the Southwest.</i>

650
00:50:24,827 --> 00:50:27,575
<i>Charlie, the Southwest is our home, and</i>

651
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:31,138
<i>we couldn't just ignore
what's going on in our own backyard.</i>

652
00:50:31,158 --> 00:50:34,539
<i>But I'm sure you're aware that there
are people who suggest other motives.</i>

653
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,711
<i>Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times</i>

654
00:50:38,157 --> 00:50:40,446
<i>wrote a column suggesting</i>

655
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:44,817
<i>that the grant was a kind
of publicity maneuver</i>

656
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:48,490
<i>to sure up the stock price
of Gray Matter Technologies</i>

657
00:50:48,627 --> 00:50:53,468
<i>because of your association
with Walter White.</i>

658
00:50:53,488 --> 00:50:55,983
- <i>Well, that's not exactly the way...</i>
- <i>To cleanse yourselves,</i>

659
00:50:56,003 --> 00:51:00,356
<i>so to speak, of having a methamphetamine kingpin</i>

660
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:03,060
<i>as cofounder of your company.</i>

661
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,090
<i>Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.</i>

662
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:10,059
<i>I have to believe that the investing public
understands we're talking about a person</i>

663
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,139
<i>who was there early on,</i>

664
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,866
<i>but who had virtually nothing to do with
the creation of the company,</i>

665
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:17,732
<i>and still less to do with growing it
into what it is today.</i>

666
00:51:17,752 --> 00:51:21,542
<i>So what was Walter White's contribution?</i>

667
00:51:21,562 --> 00:51:24,281
<i>You know, to be honest...</i>

668
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:25,341
<i>Honey?</i>

669
00:51:25,361 --> 00:51:27,823
<i>- The company name.
- The company name.</i>

670
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:30,615
<i>We came up with it
by combining our names.</i>

671
00:51:30,635 --> 00:51:33,431
<i>"Schwartz" means black,
black plus White makes gray.</i>

672
00:51:33,451 --> 00:51:34,945
<i>It's Gray Matter Technologies.</i>

673
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:36,992
<i>Exactly.
As far as I can recall,</i>

674
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:39,598
<i>his contribution begins and ends right there.</i>

675
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:42,626
<i>There are continuing reports
of blue methamphetamine,</i>

676
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:46,277
<i>considered his signature product
throughout the Southwest,</i>

677
00:51:46,297 --> 00:51:49,953
<i>and some evidence
of reaching as far as Europe.</i>

678
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,703
<i>So my question is,</i>

679
00:51:51,723 --> 00:51:54,632
<i>is Walter White still out there?</i>

680
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:56,861
<i>No, he's not.</i>

681
00:51:57,022 --> 00:52:00,341
<i>You sound very sure.</i>

682
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:01,913
<i>I am.</i>

683
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:07,013
<i>I can't speak to this Heisenberg

684
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:08,741
<i>but...</i>

685
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:10,781
<i>whatever he became,</i>

686

<i>the sweet, kind, brilliant man</i>

687
00:52:13,928 --> 00:52:17,726
<i>that we once knew,
long ago, he's gone.</i>

688
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,627
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>
