1
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,243
Now I see why they call
this place bizarre.

2
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,412
Jade, it is a bazaar.

3
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:17,216
Anywhere grown men
play with baby toys
is bizarre in my book.

4
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,851
Uncle is not playing.

5
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:22,221
This rattle's filled
with the enchanted teeth
of mongoose,

6
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,822
which will lead us
to the snake,

7
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,426
which possesses the power
of invisibility.

8
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:30,462
Do you think our search
will take long, sensei?

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,698
(Rattling)
Oh! No. I do not.

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,837
(Rattling)

11
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,106
The snake we seek
must be within.

12
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,741
Jackie, take basket!

13
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,111
Oh!

14
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,281
Do not even breathe.

15
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,851
Cobras are
very poisonous.

16
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,686
I know.

17
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,455
They say you can
hypnotize 'em

18
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,390
by looking right
into their eyes.

19
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,658
Jade!

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,759
(Rattling)

21
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,194
Ugg! Uncle!

22
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,730
But not our snake.
Put basket down.

23
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,765
Ugg. How?

24
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,300
Quickly, of course.

25
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:12,304
We must find real snake
before dark forces arrive.

26
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,073
Ahh!

27
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,260
Aah!

28
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,428
Huh?

29
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,998
(Hiss)

30
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,600
Ow.

31
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,802
You!

32
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,707
Billy goat!

33
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,342
Uh, mommy!

34
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,877
Whoa! Mrs. t?

35
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,645
What brings you
to bizarr-o world?

36
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,914
And when are you leaving?

37
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,682
Mother, what
a coincidence

38
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,352
bumping into you
all the way in India.

39
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,887
Coincidence?

40
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,355
You invited me!

41
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,757
Uh-oh.

42
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,260
Tohru!

43
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:44,863
You did not tell uncle
you invited spider woman!

44
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,265
(Moans)

45
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,601
See? Even Jackie moans with
displeasure at her arrival.

46
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,470
Uh, Jackie?

47
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,838
Are you all right?

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,275
Jackie, how many fingers
do you see?

49
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,510
(Groaning)

50
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,280
(Gasps) Jackie has
been bitten by snake.

51
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,416
Well, what a co-inky-dink.
We're looking for a snake.

52
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,859
These strange men,
they appeared
out of thin air.

53
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,428
They used to be men.
Now they're card-carrying
members

54
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,963
of the forces of darkness.

55
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:20,299
Stop them,
tohru!

56
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,534
Yarrgg--ulp.

57
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,038
My baby will not fight
forces of darkness!

58
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,507
(Laughs) Hear that?

59
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,511
Yeah. Tohru's mommy won't
let him come out and play.

60
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:36,315
Heh heh. Maybe
he needs his
diaper changed.

61
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,951
(All laugh)

62
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:41,386
Hohhh!

63
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,721
Stop them, Jackie!

64
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,025
Eh, hello.

65
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,037
Jackie!

66
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,560
Heh heh. That's called
the slippery cobra technique.

67
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,762
Whoa.

68
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,764
I'm not sure
who's dizzier.

69
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,432
Chan or me?

70
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,072
Maybe we should get
Jackie to a doctor.

71
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,708
We must find snake
before dark forces do,

72
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,311
then uncle
will cure Jackie.

73
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:43,382
Do not worry. I once
saw television program
about cobra poisoning.

74
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,784
Jackie only in stage one.

75
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,854
Very slight dryness
of mouth.

76
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,622
(Wheezes)

77
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,397
(Jackie wheezing)

78
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,465
Wa...Ter...

79
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,168
Must have...Water.

80
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,870
Wa...Ter.

81
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,607
Thank you.

82
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,294
Yarrr...Matey!

83
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,629
Stage 2?

84
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,431
Stark-raving madness.

85
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,266
Shiver me timbers!
Yo ho ho!

86
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,435
(Humming popeye theme)

87
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,503
Luckily stage 2
very brief.

88
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,849
Do not understand.

89
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,118
Locator spell was warm
near first basket.

90
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,586
Now it is cold.

91
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,490
(Rattle)

92
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,926
(Gasps)

93
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,861
The magic snake!

94
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,565
Oh, look! It is
getting away!

95
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,868
And so are we!

96
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,936
See ya.

97
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,506
Uncle, if daolon wong
gets the snake,

98
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,707
he'll have the power of--

99
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,142
shh!

100
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,613
The talisman power
of invisibility

101
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:26,685
lies within the snake
within the egg.

102
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,154
(Rattling)

103
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:32,457
Uncle, you so sly.

104
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,092
Do not tell your mother.

105
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:38,397
She has big mouth,
and dark forces must not
discover the truth.

106
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,401
It is best if we
treat Jackie before
onset of stage 3.

107
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,903
What happens
in stage 3?

108
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,671
(Moans)

109
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,107
Jackie lies motionless
on ground.

110
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,146
Jackie needs root
of Willow tree.

111
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:58,350
Yes, Willow tree perfect,
if Jackie had chapped lips.

112
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,086
Then what does
madam tarantula
recommend?

113
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,721
Sycamore sap.

114
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,856
Jackie does not
have athlete's foot.

115
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,625
Must use garlic.

116
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,160
Too much garlic!

117
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,829
No such thing
too much garlic.

118
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,665
Uncle knew you were vampire.

119
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,133
Grrr. Junk seller!

120
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,068
Oh, blood sucker!

121
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,544
Jade: Hey...
It's working!

122
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,978
Hello.

123
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,448
Good thing I
was here to help.

124
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,383
What kind of uncle
are you?

125
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,985
I would never let
my tohru play
with snakes.

126
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,187
Mother, please.

127
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:38,323
There is no need to be
so overprotective.

128
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,025
Overprotective?

129
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:43,161
Mother is not
overprotective!

130
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,330
You must eat.
It is past
lunchtime.

131
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,232
Yes, mother.

132
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,203
I am feeling
much better.
Thank you.

133
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,039
Of course you are,
thanks to my remedies.

134
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,106
Mine!

135
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,174
No, mine!
No, mine!

136
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,242
No, mine.
Mine!

137
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,211
Mine!
Mine!

138
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,446
Ah! You yell too much.

139
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,748
Gives me headache.
I am going to bed.

140
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,586
You are old yeller.
And that is uncle's room.

141
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,556
Billy goat's suitcase
on my bed?

142
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,892
He has no respect
for other people's things.

143
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,760
(Sniffs)

144
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,500
Garlic, fahh!

145
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,704
Bad for snake bite,
but good for headache.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,674
Ahh...

147
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:34,446
Essence of snake eggshell
even better.

148
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,056
Mmm...

149
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:50,262
Ahh, headache disappearing.

150
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,334
Ah, head feeling much--
(Gasps)

151
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,136
Where is my head?

152
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,138
Ohh!

153
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,283
Some kind of magic.

154
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,717
A trick!

155
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,719
Billy goat did this to me!

156
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,856
He will pay!

157
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,958
Mother means well,

158
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,328
but sometimes
I think she forgets
that I am a grown man.

159
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,196
Uh, very grown.

160
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,800
When she gets in your face,
tell her to give
you some space.

161
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,735
She would just take it
the wrong way.

162
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,137
(Sighs)

163
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,506
I love her,
but sometimes...

164
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,342
I wish mother
would just disappear.

165
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:41,813
Oh, be careful what you
wish for, tohru.

166
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,952
Mother, I made warm milk
for you.

167
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,888
Mommy?

168
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,359
Aw, why can't we go help
tohru look for his mom?

169
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:58,964
Because uncle must guard egg
from forces of darkness
while Jackie recuperates,

170
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:04,235
and because uncle must beat
Jade in a friendly game of
mah-jongg.

171
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,437
Well?

172
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,805
The concierge
said mother

173
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,808
scheduled a bus tour
to the Taj Mahal.

174
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,177
Told you
the dark chi dudes
didn't get her.

175
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,545
Of course
they did not.

176
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,780
She is more fearsome
than they.

177
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,816
Grrr.

178
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,485
Whoa-aah!

179
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,187
Sensei, are you
all right?

180
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,290
(Giggles)

181
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,428
Chair very slippery.

182
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,264
Now, it is your move,
Jade.

183
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,639
Whoa! I win!

184
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,341
Uh-huh, uh-huh!
It's my birthday!

185
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,010
I won! You lost!

186
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,612
Impossible!

187
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,016
I know three dark warriors

188
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:55,420
who are finally about to make
daolon wong a happy wizard.

189
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,222
Let's not be hasty.

190
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:00,025
This snake
can make us invisible.

191
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,695
We can sneak
into any movie
we want for free.

192
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,033
Ahem.
If ol' crazy eyes
can't see us,

193
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,836
we can sneak up
and stomp the chi
outta him.

194
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,039
And force him
to turn us back

195
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,441
into our normal
old selves.

196
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,410
Yeah!

197
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,312
Talisman power...Ho!

198
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,317
Hey, I can still
see you guys.

199
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,287
Uh, 'cause
we're all invisible.

200
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,855
Ohh!

201
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,925
I was never any good
at science.

202
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,076
Hiya, boss.

203
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,911
Ratso here
was wondering

204
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,047
if you needed
any pictures
hung, big d.

205
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:01,286
All that I need
is for you to bring me
the correct snake!

206
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,964
(Screaming)

207
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,939
Are you certain
you won't return home
with us, tohru?

208
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,042
I should wait here
for mother to return
from her tour.

209
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,111
Good thing we are leaving.

210
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,113
Hotel has terrible draft.

211
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,550
Whoa!

212
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,954
Hotel gives uncle
the willies.

213
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,423
It is as if spirits lurk.

214
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,791
(Knock at door)
Bellhop!

215
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,426
Ahh! Jackie!

216
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,528
Bellhops are
very careless.

217
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,731
You must not
let them carry bag
containing snake egg.

218
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,799
Uggh!

219
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,136
Is that a fact?

220
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,004
Hey, it's a trick.

221
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,739
Snakes don't
lay eggs.

222
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,841
Yeah!

223
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,178
Ok, you got me.

224
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,313
Wait.
Do they?

225
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,416
Get chan!

226
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,958
So, the egg is magic.

227
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,363
Finn: Chan!

228
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,175
Jackie!

229
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,010
Egg very fragile!

230
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:35,013
If it breaks, talisman power
could be released.

231
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,115
Or a baby snake
could get hurt.

232
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,983
Jackie needs backup.
Oop!

233
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,585
Too dangerous!

234
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:41,786
Aww...

235
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,988
Tohru, help Jackie.

236
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,759
I cannot climb
up there, sensei.

237
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,328
Good. Too dangerous.

238
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,466
The egg, chan,
or we scramble you.

239
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,472
I prefer over easy.

240
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,914
Egg roll!

241
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:13,918
Huh?

242
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,022
Whoa...
Whoa...

243
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,828
Invisible snake
or flying one?

244
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,506
Ohh!

245
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,334
Why did egg not break?

246
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,637
Mrs. t: Because
chicken eggs
are fragile.

247
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,705
Snake eggs
are durable.

248
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,741
Mommy?

249
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,709
Oh. Hello.

250
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,745
Someone's here.

251
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,651
Whoaaaa!
Whoaaaa!

252
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:24,088
Unlike egg,
forces of darkness
do not bounce.

253
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,824
Tohru,
catch your mother!

254
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,267
I...Had better
go fetch the egg.

255
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,969
I'll go with.

256
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,237
Do not worry, mother.

257
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,006
Sensei will find a way
to make you visible again.

258
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,742
Why? She is
more pleasing to
the eyes this way.

259
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,778
This is my choice, tohru.

260
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,813
I will remain invisible

261
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,983
so that I may always
protect my baby.

262
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,685
(Gulp) Always?

263
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,192
Tell me you
have my snake.

264
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,795
Uh...
Right here,
big d.

265
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,464
And I cannot see it?
Why?

266
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,633
'Cause
it's invisible.

267
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,735
Look! There it goes!

268
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,406
Whoa! It's climbing up
my pants.

269
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,276
Whoa-oaa-oaa!

270
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,279
So be it.

271
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,447
Whoa.

272
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,727
There!

273
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,133
Paper beats rock!

274
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,903
Mine!

275
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,905
Whoop.

276
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,780
Ooh ooh!
Ow ow!
Aii aii!

277
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,625
Whoa!

278
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,764
Chow: Mine!

279
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,001
Hey...

280
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,536
The egg's a dud.

281
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,938
Not dud.
Snake invisible.

282
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,339
Duh.

283
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,275
Poor little guy's
scared.

284
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,144
He activated
the talisman power
for protection.

285
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,748
End of the trail.

286
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,884
For you!

287
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,791
I told you, no fighting
forces of darkness.

288
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,560
Not even the skinny one?

289
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,961
Ha ha ha!

290
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:20,565
That's right, tohru.
Listen to mommy.

291
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,867
Gohh! Gaa! Unh!

292
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,771
Had enough of mommy?

293
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,307
Heh.
Come and get me.

294
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,374
Mother!

295
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,310
Remain in safety zone,
tohru.

296
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,114
Ha ha ha.
Where am I,
over here?

297
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,915
Or am I over here?

298
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,051
Mommy!

299
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,319
(Gasps)

300
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,788
Grrr....

301
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,357
Nobody touches my mommy.

302
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,925
Heh heh.

303
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:51,729
Aah!

304
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,064
Uhh.

305
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:56,400
Sometimes I can
take care of myself,
mother.

306
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,402
And you.

307
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,670
My baby.

308
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,083
Any last wishes, chan?

309
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,290
Uhh!
Oof!

310
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,032
Jade, what
are you doing?

311
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,367
Shh!

312
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,911
Told you they
can be hypnotized.

313
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,350
Now, let's get you
back to section 13
with the other animals,

314
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,052
for your safety.

315
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:51,856
Sensei says
this is the only way to
make you visible again.

316
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,525
Hmph. Probably poison.

317
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,929
Or garlic.
(Grumbles)

318
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,999
(Gasps)

319
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,669
What?
What is it?

320
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,537
Do not look
in mirror.

321
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,342
Aaaah!

322
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,944
Billy goat!

323
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,513
You will pay
for this!

324
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:16,881
Aiiya!

325
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,382
Tohru: Mommy, no!

326
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,051
See? Your fault.

327
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,087
Told you antidote
should always
contain garlic.

328
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,298
Jade: Hey, Jackie, did you
do well in school?

329
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,101
Kind of.
I'm very bad boy.

330
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,636
I don't want to get up
in the morning.

331
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,737
Later on. Later on.

332
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,505
The teacher
been training me,

333
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,940
become very disciplined.

334
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,244
Get up 5:00 in the morning,
