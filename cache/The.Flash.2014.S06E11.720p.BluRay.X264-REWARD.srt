1
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,093
Surprise, babe.

2
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:51,511
Yeah, wow.

3
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,347
This is not a banana.

4
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:57,142
I know Valentine's Day isn't
for a couple of days,

5
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,601
but I thought, why not?

6
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,731
Let me surprise my hubby before
some crazy meta-of-the-week strikes.

7
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,358
Here, I got it. How's your arm?

8
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:08,820
Oh, um, I mean, it stings,
but it's a bit better.

9
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,903
Yeah?

10
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:11,990
You know,
if you really want a banana,

11
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,913
- I could always go in the kitchen...
- No. No.

12
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,327
No, I don't want a banana.
This all looks awesome.

13
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:20,457
I mean, the pancakes
are really... round.

14
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,127
- Hmm.
- I'm just excited to taste them

15
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,337
with my mouth.

16
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,721
Oh, my God. When did you learn to...

17
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,433
I mean, these are really good.

18
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:39,893
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,106
Is this fresh-squeezed?

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,275
Mmm-hmm. Oh, um...

21
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:52,363
We may or may not now
own a very expensive juicer.

22
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,614
I got to say, you're full
of surprises this morning.

23
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,621
Well, the day is young.

24
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,182
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm?

25
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:04,626
Wait, how did you have time
to get a spread like this together?

26
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,544
I mean, it sounded
like yesterday was insane.

27
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,213
Yeah, it was.

28
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,341
Which is why Team Citizen
is regrouping

29
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,759
before we go after Carver again.

30
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:17,972
And as for all this,
thank God for 24-hour grocery stores.

31
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,306
Amen.

32
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,494
This is your reminder.

33
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:25,563
You have a reservation at Giovanni's
February 14th at 7:00 p.m.

34
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,650
You know what? If we also made
a reservation for tonight,

35
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,026
we could up our chances

36
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,403
of having an emergency-free
Valentine's Day dinner.

37
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:35,740
Well, I don't care when we have dinner,
as long as we're together.

38
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,245
Alexa, set a reminder
to call Giovanni's today at noon.

39
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,330
Okay, I'll remind you.

40
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,624
Great. You finish eating.

41
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:45,667
I will.

42
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,920
- I'm gonna go take a shower.
- Okay.

43
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,339
You're amazing.

44
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:59,055
Son of a motherless goat,
you do not want to test me.

45
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:01,891
Oh, thank God, it's just you.

46
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:03,852
You're out of tape.

47
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:07,146
Uh, did you just let yourself in?

48
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:10,608
Relax. I'm not some
whack job meta-killer

49
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:14,362
with crazy-good aim
and ulterior motives... anymore.

50
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,824
Another house call
from Dr. Light would suck,

51
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,201
but I was actually
talking about Nash.

52
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,078
He's a total stage-one clinger.

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,456
Didn't you get shot yesterday?

54
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,335
Shouldn't you be soaking
in a tub of frozen peas or something?

55
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,089
And miss out
on my first Valentine's Day? No way.

56
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,801
I hate Valentine's Day.
And I have a lot of work to do, so...

57
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:41,055
You know, it's my understanding
that there are two kinds of people

58
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,640
who hate Valentine's Day.

59
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,477
One, those who think
it's a made-up holiday by Big Candy,

60
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,022
or two, those with a broken heart.

61
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,065
I think you're the second one.

62
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,401
No, I'm not.

63
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,987
Really? Uh, I think, actually, you are.

64
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,240
And I think Mr. Emerson Fairweather

65
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,659
is the emo dope who's responsible.

66
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,040
We met after a gig his band played.

67
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,041
Mmm-hmm.

68
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,002
Anyway, it didn't work out.

69
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,922
"Another Valentine's Day
waiting for love.

70
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:15,006
Let the drinking begin!

71
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,134
#CoffeeNotCocktails."

72
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,511
Ugh. Look, you're perfect
for each other.

73
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,805
You have something in common.
You're both miserable.

74
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,475
Thanks for the reminder.

75
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,019
You know, maybe
you and Mr. Fall Out Boy

76
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,188
could go off and be mopey together,

77
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,565
and then you wouldn't hate
Valentine's Day.

78
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:33,816
I'm sorry. Have we met?

79
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,195
Look, it says here, he's gonna be
back at Jitters tomorrow.

80
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,697
And you know what? So are we.

81
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,701
'Cause I'm gonna get
the two of you back together

82
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:45,036
for some V-Day love. Cupid demands it.

83
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,290
What?

84
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,877
I'm glad we decided
to do dinner tonight.

85
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,087
It's awesome.

86
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,422
Celebrating Valentine's together,
even if it's early.

87
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,589
Yeah.

88
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:02,178
No Crisis,
no dark future looming over us.

89
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,055
Feels nice.

90
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,431
It really does.

91
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,308
<i>Buona sera.</i>

92
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,356
I'm so sorry. We don't speak Italian.

93
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,278
And, uh, can we just
get another minute?

94
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,404
<i>Grazie.</i>

95
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,325
Uh...

96
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,077
What?

97
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,080
What? Do you speak Italian?

98
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh, uh, well...

99
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:34,794
You know that story I was writing
a few months ago on Little Italy?

100
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:37,547
Well, I picked up a phrase or two.

101
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,465
Like, um...

102
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:45,179
It's a curse word. But it literally
means "pig misery."

103
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:46,638
Yeah, weird, right?

104
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,646
Roses are red.

105
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:57,025
Violets are blue.

106
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,361
Step forward, Saul Frankel...

107
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,699
or I'll kill all of you.

108
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,328
Oh.

109
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,790
And they say chivalry is dead.

110
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,793
Hand over the case, love.

111
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,879
You know what'll happen
if you take this?

112
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,300
I know what will happen to you...

113
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,344
if I don't.

114
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,355
Ah.

115
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,905
Darlings!

116
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,948
Long time no see.

117
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:48,576
Did I interrupt date night?

118
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,786
C.C.P.D.

119
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,789
Amunet Black,
I'm placing you under arrest

120
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,540
for robbery and aggravated assault.

121
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:57,543
So very official, Mr. Allen.

122
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,463
But aren't you just a CSI?

123
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,715
I'm still a cop who can arrest you.

124
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,008
Oh, okay.

125
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,677
Well, by all means,
let me help you with the first bit.

126
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:10,515
I have the right to remain silent,

127
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:13,184
which will come in handy
if you don't want me

128
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,770
letting that
little secret-identity-cat

129
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,774
out of its flashy red bag.

130
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,193
So, why don't we just
call this a warning?

131
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,028
I'll be on my way. No harm...

132
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:25,863
no cowl.

133
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,615
I'm supposed to just let you leave?

134
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,783
Bloody right.

135
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,160
Don't think of coming after me.

136
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:34,747
'Cause if I see you in your onesie

137
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:40,002
or any one of your frigid
or bendy superhero friends,

138
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,047
I will hold it against all of you

139
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:47,301
and tell the world your real identities.

140
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,010
Savvy?

141
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,057
That's right.

142
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:56,936
Because behind every great man
is a woman rolling her eyes.

143
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,774
Ta-ta, sweethearts.

144
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,574
So much for date night.

145
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,992
Pig misery.

146
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,708
There's no trace of Amunet?

147
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,391
It's like she vanished.

148
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,354
Yeah, she does that.

149
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,547
Were there any rumblings
that she was back in town?

150
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,799
None. But Captain West
has all officers

151
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:27,967
searching on high alert.

152
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,427
Great. Thanks, Korber.

153
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,224
Barry, Amunet has been off the grid
for so long

154
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,494
that, if she's back,
it must be for something big and bad.

155
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,062
And I'm pretty sure it involves
that device that she stole.

156
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:41,480
I know.

157
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,084
Hey, don't worry.
We're gonna find her.

158
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,295
Still can't believe I just
stood there and let her walk out.

159
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,486
Barry, it's not your fault.

160
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,907
We knew that her knowing your identity
would come back to bite us.

161
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,076
Yeah, time to find her
the old-fashioned way.

162
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,554
I'm gonna run
some sweeps of the city.

163
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,079
Whoa, whoa. She said no onesies.

164
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,873
Please don't call it that.

165
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,041
What I'm trying to say is,

166
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,543
we can't risk her
putting Team Flash on blast.

167
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,421
Okay. I mean,
we also can't do nothing.

168
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,756
We won't.

169
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,383
If you wanna figure out
a criminal's plan,

170
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,052
visit their playground.

171
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,392
This is a bad idea.

172
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,562
Challenging an entire drug cartel
to a knife fight, that's a bad idea.

173
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:22,646
Fun, though.

174
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,650
This? This is nothing.
Just go over there and talk to him.

175
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,903
He really does look miserable.

176
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,130
Yeah, I'm sure
he's over there working

177
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:33,032
on some sad-sack song
to perform tomorrow night.

178
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:36,327
Trust your awesome life coach,
and just get over there.

179
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,536
What do I even say?

180
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,820
I don't know. You said
you could be yourself around him,

181
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,332
so go do that.

182
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,125
You're right.

183
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,509
Don't worry.
I'm sure they're just good friends.

184
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,766
A really good friend.

185
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,938
- Allegra...
- I knew this was a bad idea.

186
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,482
Next time
you wanna play life coach, don't.

187
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,025
Uh...

188
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,990
I still think
it's better if I go.

189
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:17,368
Babe, this is a known spot
that Amunet used to recruit her crew.

190
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,078
Besides, a cop can't
just waltz in there.

191
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,681
Okay, but it's mostly criminals
in there. It's really dangerous.

192
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:24,333
Barry, it's my job
to get information out of people.

193
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,103
Amunet's not gonna be there,

194
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,254
but if someone knows
where she's headed next,

195
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,840
I can get them to talk.
It's what I do.

196
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,843
Besides, if things get dicey,
we have our code word.

197
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,094
"Banana."

198
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,179
You hear that, you come fathwooming.

199
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:38,264
Mmm-hmm.

200
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:40,850
Okay, fine. Just be safe, please.

201
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,685
Scout's honor.

202
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:10,963
Whiskey, rocks.

203
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,383
You look familiar.

204
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,637
He must read <i>The Citizen</i>. Get out.

205
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,140
<i>Get out.
Get out of there, Iris.</i>

206
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,768
Maybe I have one of those faces.

207
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,812
I'm looking for Amunet Black.

208
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,697
You don't seem like her type.

209
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,623
Got a problem, Lars?

210
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:52,296
Banana. Banana! Banana!

211
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,798
<i>Banana!</i>

212
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,299
<i>Banana! Banana!</i>

213
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,176
<i>Banana, Iris!</i>

214
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,928
Now, do I seem like her type?

215
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,639
Seems like I need a new bouncer.

216
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:05,767
You interested?

217
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,103
I'll keep it in mind.

218
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,065
Now, for the last time,
where is Amunet?

219
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,608
Last I heard,

220
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,403
she was heisting
some specialized tech...

221
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,905
from this spot.

222
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,459
Thanks for the drink.

223
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,256
Hey, what happened?
I heard glass breaking.

224
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,801
Nothing. I broke a bottle
over some loser's head.

225
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:38,883
You what?

226
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,320
Barry, don't worry.
Everything's fine.

227
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,012
I was playing a role
to get information.

228
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:46,100
Okay, well, I...
That was maybe crossing a line.

229
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,311
I'm sure they have some sort of
mob doctor in there somewhere.

230
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,832
Okay, but, I mean, it was reckless
and it could have backfired.

231
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:54,442
But it didn't
because I knew what I was doing.

232
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,068
And we got this.

233
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,198
Is this Amunet's next target?

234
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,783
Let's go get her.

235
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,624
Oh, I do love loud noises.

236
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,333
Yeah!

237
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,885
For the lady who has everything.

238
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:32,146
Well, your source at the bar was right.
She's here.

239
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,773
Yeah, but what is she doing?

240
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,234
- You have any idea what that tech is?
- No.

241
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,738
But I'm betting it's connected
to the first device she stole.

242
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,323
We have to figure out how to stop her

243
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,686
before things get...

244
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:55,668
Worse.

245
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,713
Just what I was looking for.

246
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,049
Goldface is working with Amunet?

247
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,592
Well, they did used to date.

248
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,261
You're too late, Keith.

249
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,055
Oh, Leslie.

250
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,323
You know
I can't let you leave with that.

251
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,519
I don't think
they're working together.

252
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:12,769
No.

253
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,022
This is a gang war.

254
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,786
I suppose you're here
to steal what's mine.

255
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,411
Typical.

256
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,704
What's yours?

257
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,750
Baby, that device belongs to me.

258
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,921
Oh, here we go again
with the possessive man routine.

259
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,966
The vinyl records were mine, Keith.

260
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,842
Since when did you like Radiohead?

261
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,805
I had <i>OK Computer</i> on 180-gram vinyl

262
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,431
with a triple-gatefold sleeve!

263
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,058
Overrated.

264
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,424
You skipped out with my
<i>Straight Outta Compton</i> soundtrack.

265
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,316
Oh, please! Like you even knew
who N.W.A. were before you met me.

266
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,120
Security! Freeze!

267
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,863
Don't anybody move.

268
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,284
Took some doing,
setting up that deal.

269
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,407
And you just stroll out of Giovanni's
with my score?

270
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,038
Sorry, not sorry.

271
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:14,975
- Baby...
- I said, freeze.

272
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,799
You know I'm not letting it
go down like that.

273
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,790
Oh, come on.

274
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,778
Looks like
somebody's lost their touch.

275
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,971
I said, put your hands in the air!

276
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,054
Really?

277
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,267
Looks to me like somebody's lost
their gym membership.

278
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:47,448
- Barry.
- What?

279
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,342
It'll be bad if Amunet knows
the Flash is here.

280
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,845
Okay, but that guard might be
really hurt. I have to do something.

281
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,787
But...

282
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,893
Yeah, well,
no amount of gym time

283
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,312
could help me lift all your baggage!

284
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,030
Still strong enough
to lift this, though.

285
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,518
Are you okay? Are you okay?

286
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:17,936
Bye, Felicia.

287
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,442
How did you lift that?

288
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,070
Uh, adrenaline.

289
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,865
Stay here, okay? You'll be okay.

290
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:33,869
Where are they?

291
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,080
- Gone.
- What?

292
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,390
Well, let's go after them.
We have to get the case.

293
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,499
Who needs the case...

294
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,085
when you've got what's inside?

295
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,386
Oh, my gosh.

296
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,347
- Hey. Did you find anything?
- Uh-uh.

297
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,684
- Why are you so tired?
- I don't know.

298
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,828
I mean, to keep Amunet
and Goldface from seeing me,

299
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,705
I had to run so fast,
I was practically invisible.

300
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,731
But it's getting bad out there.

301
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,234
I mean, their gangs
who are just trading attacks.

302
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:09,363
It's like both sides think that
the other has the second device.

303
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,656
Yeah, I called my dad.

304
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,534
He said that Amunet and Goldface
are sticking to criminal targets,

305
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,536
like each other's
stash houses, but...

306
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,873
I don't know. I think
they're trying to hurt each other,

307
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,125
not just their businesses.

308
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,992
Okay. All right, well,
until we know what they're after,

309
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,547
I guess I'll just keep patrolling
at super speed.

310
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,982
I'm just worried some innocent people

311
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,442
are gonna get
caught in their crossfire,

312
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,260
while we wait
for this thing to blow over.

313
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,762
I don't think it will, Barry.

314
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,307
When Amunet and Goldface
were arguing at Ivo,

315
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,643
they used each other's real names.

316
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,979
They argued
about an old record collection.

317
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,273
That's personal.
Personal doesn't just blow over.

318
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,734
I mean, but what's personal
about stealing tech?

319
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,318
Okay, so I called Ryan Choi.

320
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:51,864
The first item that Amunet stole,
a specialized UV projector.

321
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:55,284
The second item was
a biome-simulated storage unit.

322
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:56,367
If you combine the two,

323
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,954
it can be used to transport
delicate, plant-based life.

324
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,749
They're after a plant? Why?

325
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,875
I don't know.

326
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,836
But if those two are after it,
it's probably dangerous.

327
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:06,879
Yeah.

328
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,882
So, a botanist source I used
from an old story is looking into it.

329
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,051
But I think there's a faster way
to figure this out.

330
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,803
Hmm.

331
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,181
We give Amunet what she wants.

332
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:19,348
What?

333
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,268
Yeah, we use the leverage we have.

334
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,895
We get close to Amunet,

335
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,330
and we solve this thing
from the inside.

336
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,900
No, I mean, that's... way too dangerous.

337
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,818
I mean, Amunet knows both of us.

338
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,069
- So?
- So...

339
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,529
So, we stay put.

340
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,992
You mean I stay put while you patrol.

341
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:39,244
Well, I mean...

342
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,996
You're the Flash.
You know best, right?

343
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,916
What? Iris, come on.
Look at the facts.

344
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,418
Screw facts, Barry.
I trust my intuition.

345
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,254
My intuition, by the way,
that saved my life from an assassin,

346
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,964
while you were on some island.

347
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,465
What?

348
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,719
Okay, what's going on?

349
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:59,765
It feels like ever since
you came back home the other night,

350
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,433
you've been acting kind of different.

351
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:05,062
I mean, the pancakes.
And the bottle-smashing...

352
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,606
Do you hear yourself right now, Barry?
Seriously?

353
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,609
My New Year's resolution?
Learn how to make pancakes.

354
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,654
And I told you
that I was playing a role.

355
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,073
Come on, Barry.

356
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:20,118
You know what?
Actually, I didn't forget my files

357
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,787
at the office last night.

358
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,707
I was following up on a lead.
So there.

359
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,752
You were following a lead
in the middle of the night?

360
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,313
I mean, something could
have happened to you.

361
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,649
That, Barry. That right there,
that's why I didn't tell you.

362
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,216
I don't need you to save me.

363
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,343
I can handle myself.

364
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,262
I even have my own team now,
Team Citizen.

365
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,429
I know.

366
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,432
And you know what? While you were
preoccupied with Crisis,

367
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,810
I was planning
to start a life without you.

368
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,521
And it was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do,

369
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,023
but I did it
because you asked me to, Barry.

370
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,236
I would do anything for you
and you know that.

371
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,698
But I can't be
your damsel in distress anymore.

372
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,618
And I cannot be the voice
inside your cowl, cheering you on.

373
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,163
I'm a reporter, Barry.
And I'm a damn good one.

374
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,457
And risky or not,

375
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,335
I deserve to be in that field
just as much as you do.

376
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:11,920
I know that.

377
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,005
I...

378
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,716
It just feels like...

379
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,304
I mean, I don't know. It doesn't feel
like we're connecting lately.

380
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,597
I've grown, Barry.

381
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,518
And I'm really proud
of the person that I am today.

382
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,314
I just wish
that you felt the same way, too.

383
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,650
Come on... Iris.

384
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,832
Ah.

385
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,002
It's just you.

386
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,339
Yeah, I thought, you know,
maybe it might be the...

387
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,175
You know, the girl, the, um...

388
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,345
What's her name? Abbondanza...

389
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,428
Allegra?

390
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,140
Yeah, Allegra, that's... That's her.

391
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,576
Why are you looking for her?

392
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,101
She's, uh... She's...

393
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,063
This nano-dimensional bucket auger,
it's hers.

394
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,981
And she wondered if
I was bucket-augering,

395
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,792
but now she wants
to bucket-auger, so I was like...

396
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,611
Anyway, what are you doing,
sitting here, drinking by yourself?

397
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:21,573
Yes, Valentine's Day drinking
to celebrate what a screw-up I am.

398
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:22,866
What is that?

399
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,286
Naltorian mead left to us
by one of the previous Wellses.

400
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:29,182
You know, back when there were
other Wellses in the multi-verse.

401
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,711
Sorry. Nash, I didn't...

402
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,005
It's fine. It's fine.

403
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:39,549
See what I mean?

404
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:43,470
Everything I touch turns out sucking.

405
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,891
I mean, how do I explain to Ralph
that he's wasted the last five months

406
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,935
trying to teach me
how to be a better person?

407
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:53,522
'Cause it doesn't matter
how much litter I pick up,

408
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:57,859
how many sick kids I read to,
I still don't get people.

409
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,154
I really thought I could help Allegra
fall back in love with her ex,

410
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,366
but, instead,
I just made a mess of everything.

411
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,621
You know, you got lost.

412
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,375
Now, you just
get back on the highway.

413
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,254
Find new inroads with this Allegra.

414
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,213
Easy-peasy.

415
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,027
You know, I don't know her very well,
but perhaps she's one of those people

416
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,970
that just sees things
in absolutes, right?

417
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,473
Black and white.
Missions fail or succeed, right?

418
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,493
Do you know what you need to do?

419
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,227
You need to get
back in there with her.

420
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,397
Open her up and show her that things
aren't just black and white.

421
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,776
Black and white,
that's just for death and taxes.

422
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,780
Everything else...

423
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,616
Everything else happens in the grays.

424
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,382
Wow.

425
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,593
Someone's not a fan.

426
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,598
Mrs. Flash.

427
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,268
However did you find your way here?

428
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,481
Well, there is
a very charming bartender

429
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:20,609
that is giving out tips
rather than collecting them. So...

430
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:24,237
Lars. I'll have to kill him.

431
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,699
- Hmm. Ladies first.
- Uh, wait.

432
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:30,118
Um, I know what you're after.

433
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,332
And I want in.

434
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,708
Hmm?

435
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,428
So, let me get this straight.

436
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:52,099
Iris West-Allen,
a sky-rocketing news media force,

437
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,558
daughter of the police captain,

438
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,103
devoted spouse of
the Scarlet Speedster, all of that,

439
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,940
but I'm supposed to believe
you're willing to give me

440
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,067
an invaluable piece of stolen tech.

441
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,070
Why, exactly?

442
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,115
Rappaccini's Daughter,

443
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,910
a rare orchid recently shipped
for study at CC Arboretum.

444
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,538
And why, on this
great big blue marble

445
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,915
do you think
that I would be interested in that?

446
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:21,336
Well, because what makes it rare
isn't that it blooms every 25 years.

447
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,379
Hmm?

448
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,424
It's the flower's pollen.
When adequately heated,

449
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,302
it could be synthesized
into a telepathic narcotic.

450
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,763
If you can read minds,
it would be much easier

451
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:36,393
to gain access to PIN numbers
to big, fat bank accounts.

452
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:42,649
Bravo. Well done.

453
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,571
But you didn't answer
the most important question.

454
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,909
Why the bloody hell
should I believe you?

455
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,663
Because I want to use the pollen.

456
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,291
For what?

457
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:03,211
Well, as you know,
I am married to the Flash,

458
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,089
and he's a man
who has a lot on his mind.

459
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:07,089
Mmm-hmm.

460
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,718
And lately, that hasn't been me.

461
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,849
And to tell you the truth, I'm afraid
that all this superheroing is...

462
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,059
ruining my marriage.

463
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,021
But if I could use the pollen,

464
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,064
then I could read his mind.

465
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,110
Why didn't you just say so?

466
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:30,155
That, I can believe.

467
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:35,869
Girl, I am no stranger
to roguish means for love.

468
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,412
You mean you and Goldface.

469
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:40,916
Men, they're all idiots.
Who needs them?

470
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,631
This could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

471
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,011
Come along.

472
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,096
We're going flower shopping.

473
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,521
Goldface's gang is...

474
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:08,610
throwing Molotov cocktails
at one of Amunet's warehouses.

475
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:12,822
They are retaliating by sinking
their latest delivery boat.

476
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,700
I mean, I know it's criminal-on-criminal
attacks right now,

477
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,370
but if we don't stop it, I mean,

478
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,498
it could be
a Valentine's Day massacre

479
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,124
where civilians get hurt.

480
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,086
Yeah, I'll keep doing sweeps.
I'll help wherever I can.

481
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,087
Mmm.

482
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:30,924
Well, I might have to roll out
a special meta task force.

483
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,169
- Mmm-hmm.
- Can you pull together Team Flash?

484
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,345
No, I can't. I mean,
she knows them all.

485
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,390
I have to protect their identities, too.

486
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,621
You know what, Joe? There's something

487
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,105
not right about this
Amunet-Goldface thing. It...

488
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,775
Iris thinks there's
something personal going on.

489
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,778
Well, I mean,
I do wish they were still a couple.

490
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,488
I mean, things were
a lot quieter out there and safer.

491
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,532
Some Valentine's Day, huh?

492
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,658
Mmm-hmm.

493
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,327
Barr...

494
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,205
You been looking down a lot.

495
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,375
My floor is not that interesting.
So, what's up?

496
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,715
It's Iris, actually.

497
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,590
I mean, she...
I don't know.

498
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,970
There's just something
that's suddenly off between us,

499
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,806
or at least it feels sudden to me.

500
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,933
What did she say about that?

501
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,185
She's grown...

502
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,147
and I haven't accepted it.

503
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,208
Mmm. I don't know
about that second part.

504
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,818
But that first part, she has grown.

505
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:35,238
She took down a Black Hole assassin.

506
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,782
And she led the charge
to find Ryan Choi during Crisis.

507
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,701
And she was the only one

508
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,704
who knew that Rosso
hadn't completely taken you over.

509
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,081
I mean,
who does that sound like to you?

510
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,003
I know, I mean, she has grown, and...

511
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,049
I guess she was right.
I mean, I didn't notice

512
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,842
because I was consumed with Crisis.

513
00:27:57,093 --> 00:28:00,221
Now we're just not clicking
like usual, though.

514
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,311
Do you think maybe she's grown apart?

515
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,230
Barry, no, no.

516
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,250
Neither one of you
are ever going to stop growing.

517
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,069
I mean, marriage is like a tree.
Bear with me. Look...

518
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:17,906
The branches,
they grow from the center.

519
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,200
They grow farther and farther away
from the center.

520
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,452
But what you have
to remember is, underneath,

521
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,413
the roots,
they're mirroring the branches.

522
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:26,831
They're growing just as much.

523
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,376
So, you're growing your foundation.

524
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,139
Now, of course,
you gotta tend to the soil,

525
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,629
communicate with each other,

526
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,383
take care of each other,
look out for each other.

527
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:40,512
But as the branches grow,

528
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,556
so does your foundation.

529
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,309
So you grow together.

530
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,026
Art therapy. Been there.

531
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,406
Look, I'm sorry about Jitters.

532
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,908
- I know you meant well.
- No, I'm sorry.

533
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:05,870
Look, my life coach
made my life better.

534
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,873
I was just trying to pay it forward.

535
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,253
I probably should have gotten
the whole story about your breakup

536
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,588
before trying to intervene.

537
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,800
I guess I haven't exactly been
an open book.

538
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,010
Why don't you start from page one?

539
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,348
After I got out of Iron Heights,

540
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,977
I wanted to take a shot
at living a normal non-meta life.

541
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,479
That's when I met Emerson.

542
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,648
And we became friends.

543
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,484
Then we went on a few dates,

544
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,403
had some laughs...

545
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:43,491
but it ran its course,
so I dropped it.

546
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:45,702
You ghosted him.

547
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:46,994
Kind of.

548
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,495
Why?

549
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,256
You didn't want him
to find out you're a meta.

550
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,509
Back then, I could barely
deal with my powers.

551
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,261
How could I expect someone else to?

552
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,264
Anyway, it was never
gonna work between us.

553
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,390
You don't know that.

554
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,686
I mean, you never gave him a chance
to find out who you really are.

555
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,939
It doesn't matter now. He probably
hates me for ghosting him.

556
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:18,067
Are you sure? Because maybe he's been
looking for you every day since.

557
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,653
Or maybe he forgot you existed.

558
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,864
Whatever it is, you don't know

559
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,533
because you've been filling in
the blanks without the facts.

560
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:29,913
Coming clean to Emerson might
actually make you feel a lot better.

561
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,124
And who knows?
Maybe you'll get a friend out of it.

562
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:38,254
But you can't assume
that life happens in black and white,

563
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,590
because life happens in the gray.

564
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,176
And you need to get out there
and live in it.

565
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:53,645
Keith and I were like fireworks
when we were together.

566
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:57,148
We shared the same ambitions,
and it ignited us both.

567
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,859
We inspired each other.

568
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,446
Rappaccini's Daughter was meant to be
our greatest score ever.

569
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,449
Even though
it only blooms every 25 years?

570
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:11,120
What can I say? We were optimists,
making plans for the future.

571
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,498
We knew that it was set
to bloom this year,

572
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:16,084
and once we had our hands
on its mind-reading powers,

573
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,670
no one would be able to stop us.

574
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,464
We would run this town together.

575
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:28,054
I felt like I could be myself
when I was with him.

576
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,974
He's the only one
who ever saw beyond all this.

577
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,684
He saw me for me.

578
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,103
So, what went wrong?

579
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,774
Hmm. As business boomed,
our relationship didn't.

580
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:43,611
Our passion wilted...

581
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:45,697
and died.

582
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,158
Well... I don't know, Amunet.

583
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,761
The way you two were trying
to kill each other?

584
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:54,706
Hmm. It's a fine line
between love and hate, my dear.

585
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,123
Thank you.

586
00:31:57,208 --> 00:32:00,628
Why don't you just tell him
how you feel, talk to him?

587
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,046
No.

588
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,384
I'm better off without him.

589
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,220
And when I get my hands
on that flower...

590
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,557
I'll run this town myself.

591
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,683
Come, my lovelies.

592
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,400
Hello, lover.

593
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,778
That case,

594
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,226
it looks like a larger version
of the tech that you stole.

595
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:34,203
This orchid is a lot like love.

596
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,498
It can only survive
in a carefully tended environment.

597
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:42,003
That glass device you gave me
is a miniature biome simulator.

598
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:46,716
The UV projector provides
a nurturing light.

599
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,509
Together...

600
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,101
Flowers?

601
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,605
You shouldn't have.

602
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,695
Seeing that you got the means
to transport the flower,

603
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:17,038
I figured I'd take them both
from you at once.

604
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,623
Consider it a Valentine's gift.

605
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:21,834
And here, I thought we weren't
exchanging gifts this year.

606
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,345
Happy Valentine's Day.

607
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:03,477
Barry, what are you doing?
Amunet can't see the Flash here.

608
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,421
I'm done playing her game.
And I would risk anything to save you.

609
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:09,233
After putting together
the leads that they dug up,

610
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:12,218
it wasn't hard to figure out that
they were after Rappaccini's Daughter.

611
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,803
They're gonna destroy each other.

612
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:16,073
Not if they both accept that
they still have feelings for each other.

613
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:18,307
Joe did say things were better
when they were together.

614
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:22,186
My life got better without you.

615
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,021
You're dead weight.

616
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,983
You were the biggest mistake
I ever made.

617
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:32,655
You always had this one
really bad habit.

618
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:33,823
Breathing!

619
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:38,453
You're nothing
but a cheap, bald Mr. T.

620
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:39,871
I'm gonna stop their crossfire.

621
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,627
I'd rather date Norvock than you!

622
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:49,213
Makes two of us.

623
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:53,593
Your American accent sucks!

624
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,845
So does yours!

625
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,015
I'm from Connecticut. I went to Yale!

626
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,142
Okay, stop! Just stop this!

627
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,620
You guys were happy together once,
right? Why'd you break up?

628
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,645
I thought I said...

629
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,272
She stopped listening to me.

630
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,149
I needed her support
when things went bad,

631
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,275
not her cold shoulder.

632
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,154
I got tired of him
always celebrating with his posse,

633
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:16,824
and only coming to me to whine
about his failures! It got old!

634
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,951
Okay. See, I mean,
you guys are talking now.

635
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,453
This is great, right?

636
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:23,414
I said, no onesie.

637
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,583
Okay. Why does everybody
keep calling it that?

638
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,043
Whatever you call it,

639
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,128
there's an awful lot of gold
in there, Flash.

640
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,546
Whoa.

641
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,805
Oh, God.

642
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,021
Now, where were we?

643
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:50,149
I was just about to tell you,
when I told you I liked your dog,

644
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,068
I lied! I'm a cat person!

645
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:55,905
The mud mask you use at night
smells rank. Real mud smells better.

646
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,284
Ow.

647
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:01,744
That didn't feel great.

648
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,663
Okay, it's no use.
There's no fixing them.

649
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,125
I have an idea,
but it might be reckless.

650
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,710
Okay, what's the plan?

651
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,670
Burn the flower.

652
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:16,425
Here you go again,
twirling your shiny spaghetti!

653
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,708
<i>I'd hold you forever,</i>

654
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,591
<i>but it still wouldn't be
enough time together.</i>

655
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:54,797
<i>The sight of your eyes
fills my heart with gold.</i>

656
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:56,715
Did it work?

657
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,486
<i>The stars at night
can only dream</i>

658
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,821
<i>they'd ever shine as bright as you.</i>

659
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:03,347
<i>I was always so proud
of the work you did at Yale.</i>

660
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,225
<i>Your natural
mud mask works wonders.</i>

661
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,894
<i>You complete me.</i>

662
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,312
What's happening?

663
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:10,897
I missed you.

664
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,482
I missed you, too.

665
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,864
<i>We are strong</i>

666
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,327
<i>No one can tell us we're wrong</i>

667
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:30,291
<i>Searching our hearts for so long</i>

668
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,752
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should take off my gauntlet.

669
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:34,170
Leave it on, girl.

670
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,880
- Daddy likes the metal.
- Ooh.

671
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,381
I can't unsee this.

672
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:40,426
Well, at least, it's less violent
than a gang war.

673
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,930
- Barely. Yeah.
- Yeah.

674
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,515
More links than I remember.

675
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,184
Happy Valentine's Day.

676
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:49,936
Happy Valentine's Day.

677
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:56,025
<i>Love is a battlefield</i>

678
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:07,745
- How'd it go?
- Better than I thought.

679
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:11,248
I said sorry for ghosting him.
Told him why.

680
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:12,667
He accepted my apology.

681
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,752
So, he's fine with you being a meta.

682
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:18,547
Yeah. Turns out his new drummer
is bioluminescent.

683
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,759
Emerson and I are gonna
be friends again.

684
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,053
And you know what?

685
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,014
I think that's what I was
really missing this whole time.

686
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:31,394
Him, too. He actually wants me
to go take a look at his new lyrics

687
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:32,478
before he goes on stage.

688
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,897
Look at you. Back to being a muse.

689
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:36,898
Yeah.

690
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:40,903
So, thanks...

691
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:44,198
for your help
with all the gray life stuff.

692
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,783
It's exactly what I needed to hear.

693
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,283
You're welcome.

694
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,371
Although I can't take all the credit,

695
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,164
a friend of mine did give me
some advice.

696
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:54,291
Well, tell them thanks, too.

697
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,544
They may not know me,
but they get me.

698
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,427
Frost, I mean...

699
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:06,428
you.

700
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,764
Got your message.
What's so important?

701
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,768
I thought you'd wanna know
that Allegra was here,

702
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,436
so you could give her
your tool thingy.

703
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,230
The... Are you kidding, really?

704
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,191
You bring me to a crappy Valentine's Day
open mic night for that?

705
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,900
Well...

706
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,946
Also, so I could tell you
that I owe you one.

707
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,823
The advice you gave,

708
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,742
it really helped me
get through to Allegra.

709
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,286
It was very insightful.

710
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,998
Almost parental.

711
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,920
You going somewhere with that?

712
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,131
I'm just saying,
if you ever wanna talk...

713
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,091
Like I said, I owe you one.

714
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:48,512
And, uh, I'm a very good listener.

715
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,166
Hell of a Valentine's Day, huh?

716
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,877
Next year, we lock ourselves
in the time vault

717
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,800
and don't come out till morning.

718
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:26,299
Listen...

719
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:28,803
I'm really sorry that

720
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:33,265
I made you feel like I wasn't seeing
all your success in a larger way.

721
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:35,601
- Babe, it's fine.
- No, it's not.

722
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:39,021
You've made a name for yourself,

723
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:41,899
and this city looks to you
and <i>The Citizen</i>

724
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,651
for the truth about what's going on,

725
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:48,072
and I am so proud of who you are

726
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,865
and all of your accomplishments.

727
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,618
I just...

728
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,746
For a moment today, I felt like...

729
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,083
maybe we were growing apart.

730
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,793
That will never happen.

731
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:03,003
I get that now.

732
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,840
And, babe, just remember
that no matter what changes,

733
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,093
you're always gonna be
my lightning rod, too.

734
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,471
- Iris West-Allen...
- Hmm.

735
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:14,640
will you be my Valentine?

736
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:16,600
You read my mind.

737
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,036
<i>Get away from him!</i>

738
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,413
<i>Barry!</i>

739
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,622
That's not me!

740
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,000
She's not me!

741
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,793
<i>Barry!</i>

742
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,713
<i>Barry!</i>
