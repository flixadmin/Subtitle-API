00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,592
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,199
I made a deal for you
to keep your ungrateful head

3
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,159
on your ungrateful neck
a little while longer.

4
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,869
Tyrion:<i> I'm sorry,</i>
<i>what am I grateful for?</i>

5
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,871
The opportunity to live
and die at the Wall

6
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,832
as punishment for a crime
I did not commit?

7
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,000
You threw your life away.
You threw it away.

8
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,628
It's not a joke.
You understand that,
don't you?

9
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,798
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

10
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,177
I couldn't--

11
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,263
I couldn't listen to her

12
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,765
standing there
telling her lies.

13
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,141
I couldn't do it.

14
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,686
You fell in love
with a whore.

15
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,771
Yes, I fell in love
with a whore.

16
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,567
And I was stupid enough
to think that she had
fallen in love with me.

17
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,198
That deal you made,

18
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,868
it was everything
Father wanted.

19
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,161
<i>You do see that?</i>

20
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,037
<i>He gets you back</i>
<i>as his heir.</i>

21
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,206
<i>The future</i>
<i>Lord of the Rock.</i>

22
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,001
And he ships me off
to Castle Black,

23
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,586
out of sight at last.

24
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,256
All so perfect.

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,220
It felt good
to take that from him.

26
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,558
He knows I'm innocent
and he's willing to
sacrifice me anyway.

27
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,059
He's willing
to sacrifice any of us.

28
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,936
Not you.

29
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,022
You're the golden son.

30
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,357
You could kill a king,
lose a hand,

31
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,818
fuck your own sister,
you'll always be
the golden son.

32
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,194
Careful.

33
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,572
I'm the last friend
you've got.

34
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,454
At least I got to tell
them what they really are.

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,706
Yes, brilliant speech.

36
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,208
They'll be talking
about it for days to come.

37
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,586
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>a realist.</i>

38
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,255
Didn't realize
you'd die for pride.

39
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,091
Don't give up on me
just yet.

40
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,636
I survived one
trial by combat,

41
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
even though you weren't
there to save me.

42
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,182
I can't save you
this time either.

43
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,894
<i>My training has proved</i>

44
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,772
that I can't beat
a stable boy with
my left hand.

45
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,900
Where's your sense
of adventure?

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,111
Even if you lose,
imagine the look

47
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,613
on Father's face
when you fall.

48
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,698
- ( chuckles )
- Our family name snuffed out

49
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,576
with a single swing
of the sword.

50
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,119
It is tempting.

51
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,538
( laughs )

52
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,845
Well...

53
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,890
Bronn fought for me once,
he'll do it again.

54
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,394
If he wins,

55
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,229
I expect I'll be
in his debt

56
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,189
for the rest
of my life.

57
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,983
If he wins.

58
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,401
Will you find him for me?

59
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:42,407
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

60
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,993
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

61
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,746
I'd enjoy watching Bronn
disembowel that pompous
child beater.

62
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,082
No.

63
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,960
Not Ser Meryn.

64
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,798
( shouting )

65
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,341
( gasping )

66
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,971
Guard:
<i>Go on, move it.</i>

67
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,265
And you.

68
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,142
Come on.

69
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,270
( shouting )

70
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,237
Mercy.

71
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,072
Please.

72
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,949
Please, mercy.

73
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,453
( grunting )

74
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,751
( shouts )

75
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,337
Ser Gregor.
Welcome to the capital.

76
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,216
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,181
You seem to be
in good form.

78
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,183
Who am I fighting?

79
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,393
Does it matter?

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,752
Could be food.

81
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,545
Could be soldiers.

82
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,519
( man groaning )

83
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,906
You shouldn't be sitting
out here like this.

84
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,283
Where else to sit?

85
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,161
Tried to walk back
to my hut,

86
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,956
hurt too much.

87
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,000
Then I remembered
they burned my hut down.

88
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,128
Who were "they"?

89
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,505
I stopped asking
a while ago.

90
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,345
That's not gonna
get better.

91
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,721
Doesn't seem so.

92
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,807
A bad way to go.

93
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,394
Haven't you had enough?

94
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,146
Of what?

95
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,109
I know.

96
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,319
Time to go.

97
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,364
Take matters into
my own hands.

98
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,199
<i>( groans )</i>

99
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,119
The thought
has occurred to me.

100
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,833
So why go on?

101
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,502
Habit.

102
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,174
Nothing could
be worse than this.

103
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:50,887
Maybe nothing is
worse than this.

104
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,474
Nothing isn't better
or worse than anything.

105
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,271
Nothing is just nothing.

106
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,777
Who are you?

107
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,073
My name is Arya.

108
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,201
Arya Stark.

109
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,456
You her father?

110
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,374
Her captor.

111
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,586
Bringing her to her aunt
for ransom.

112
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,465
A fair exchange,
that is.

113
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,054
Always held to the notion
of fair exchange

114
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,681
in all my dealings.

115
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,101
You give me,
I give you.

116
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,104
<i>Fair.</i>

117
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,565
A balance.

118
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,819
No balance anymore.

119
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,490
( groans )

120
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,452
Could I have
a drink?

121
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,871
Dying is thirsty work.

122
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,550
Wish it were wine.

123
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,511
So do I.

124
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,098
( grunts )

125
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,782
That's where the heart is.

126
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,329
That's how you kill a man.

127
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,498
( grunting )

128
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,042
( neck snaps )

129
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,712
( groaning )

130
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,798
The fuck you doing?

131
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,384
<i>There's a price</i>
<i>on your head.</i>

132
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,304
Guess that's what
the king does when you
tell him to fuck off.

133
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,722
The king's dead.

134
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,725
<i>He drank poisoned wine</i>
<i>at his own wedding.</i>

135
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,728
The bounty on you is for
killing Lannister soldiers.

136
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,229
100 silver stags.

137
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,315
And you thought you
were going to collect it?

138
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,276
<i>Didn't think very hard,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

139
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,988
You were Yoren's
prisoners when he was
taking me to the Wall.

140
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,325
He told me he'd fuck
me bloody with a stick.

141
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,287
This day's
really not working out
the way you planned.

142
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,372
He on your little list?

143
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,916
He can't be.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,294
I don't know his name.

145
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,088
What's your name?

146
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,842
- Rorge.
- Thank you.

147
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,929
( gasps )

148
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,476
You're learning.

149
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,192
-<i> ( horn blows )</i>
<i>- Man: Rangers returning!</i>

150
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,527
<i>( hammering metal )</i>

151
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,404
Man:
<i>They return!</i>

152
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,699
-<i> Rangers returning!</i>
<i>- Greetings.</i>

153
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,993
Man:
<i>Didn't think I'd see</i>
<i>you again.</i>

154
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,286
All right, Jon?

155
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,205
Welcome back, brother.

156
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,457
( men shouting )

157
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,132
Lord Snow.

158
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,096
<i>( Ghost barks )</i>

159
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,640
<i>This is no place</i>
<i>for wild beasts.</i>

160
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,683
Lock him away

161
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,852
or I'll let Hobb throw him
in tonight's stew.

162
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,027
<i>( men shouting )</i>

163
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,573
Come on, Ghost.

164
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,996
Mance's army was closing in
on Craster's Keep when we left.

165
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,582
We saw their campfires
from Osric's Hill.

166
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,376
They'll reach the Wall
before the next full moon.

167
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,003
I'm surprised you didn't
ride over and say hello.

168
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,256
The King-beyond-the-Wall
is your old friend, isn't he?

169
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,841
We need to prepare.

170
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,259
We've been preparing.

171
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,593
We should seal the tunnel.

172
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,387
( men murmuring )

173
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,930
Plug it with rocks
and ice.

174
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,598
Flood it
and let it freeze.

175
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,933
Alliser:
<i>And how would we</i>
<i>range north?</i>

176
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,018
- We wouldn't.
- Man:<i> Coward.</i>

177
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,937
You would cut off
our legs,

178
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,480
pluck out our eyes,

179
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,232
leave us cowering
behind the Wall

180
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,276
hoping for the storm
to pass?

181
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,862
We can't defend the gate
against 100,000 men.

182
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,239
This castle has stood
for thousands of years.

183
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,576
The Night's Watch
has defended her for
thousands of years.

184
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,787
And in all those
centuries, we have
never sealed the tunnel.

185
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,290
Have you ever seen
a giant, Ser Alliser?

186
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,333
<i>I have.</i>

187
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,085
The tunnel's gate
won't stop them.

188
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,379
The bars on those gates
are four inches thick.

189
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,256
Cold-rolled steel.

190
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,551
They won't stop them.

191
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,846
Remind me which order
you belong to, Lord Snow.

192
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,639
The stewards.

193
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,809
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

194
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,187
No.

195
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,897
Who would that be?

196
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,525
- The builders.
- Ah, the builders.

197
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,861
First Builder Yarwyck,

198
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,906
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

199
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,533
leaving us unable
to carry out our duties

200
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,453
as sworn brothers
of the Night's Watch.

201
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,830
Do you agree with him?

202
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,175
No.

203
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,470
Alliser:
<i>Given your deep knowledge of</i>
<i>the wildling army, Lord Snow,</i>

204
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,973
you and Tarly will take
night duties atop the Wall

205
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,392
until the full moon.

206
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,810
( men laughing )

207
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,729
<i>Moving on.</i>

208
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,399
<i>First Builder, we'll need</i>
<i>100 barrels of pitch</i>
<i>brought atop the wall.</i>

209
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,068
Yarwyck:
<i>Aye.</i>

210
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,820
<i>( door opens )</i>

211
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,951
<i>( footsteps )</i>

212
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,969
My lord.

213
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,014
You have new clothes.

214
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,684
Do you like 'em?
Eh?

215
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,562
Gloves are doeskin.

216
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,980
Softer than
a virgin's thighs.

217
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,356
<i>I sent for you</i>
<i>days ago.</i>

218
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,359
- I've been a bit busy.
- Doing what?

219
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,115
My lonesome
bachelor days are over.

220
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,994
I'm to wed
Lollys Stokeworth.

221
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,163
Lollys Stokeworth?

222
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,750
<i>She doesn't strike me</i>
<i>as your sort of girl.</i>

223
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,878
I wouldn't say I had
a single sort of girl.

224
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,255
She's dim-witted.

225
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,840
If I wanted wits,
I'd marry you.

226
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,801
When my sister arranged
this love match,

227
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:49,096
did she mention that Lollys
has an older sister?

228
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,431
Falyse.

229
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,808
Aye, I did know
about the older sister.

230
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,727
And you understand
the rules of inheritance?

231
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,520
Falyse is 40
and barren.

232
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,273
<i>She still gets</i>
<i>Castle Stokeworth</i>
<i>when her father dies.</i>

233
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,733
She does.

234
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,235
Unless she happens
to perish before her father.

235
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,154
Then Lollys gets the castle.

236
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,657
What? Ladies fall
from their horses

237
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,285
and snap their pretty
necks all the time.

238
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,829
You and my sister
deserve each other.

239
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,874
<i>Why did you bother</i>
<i>to come here?</i>

240
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,258
You once said
if anyone ever asked
me to sell you out,

241
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,968
you'd double their price.

242
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,220
Is it two wives you want
or two castles?

243
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,972
One of each will do.

244
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,643
But if you want me
to kill the Mountain
for you,

245
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,478
it'd better be
a damn big castle.

246
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,647
I'm a bit short
on castles at the moment.

247
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,774
But I can offer you
gold and gratitude.

248
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,400
I have gold.

249
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,902
What can I buy
with gratitude?

250
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,654
You might be surprised.

251
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,365
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

252
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,075
Your sister's
a Lannister, too.

253
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,910
My wife is heir
to Winterfell.

254
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,830
<i>If I emerge from this</i>
<i>with my head still</i>
<i>on my shoulders,</i>

255
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,626
<i>I may one day rule</i>
<i>the North in her name.</i>

256
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,671
I could carve you out
a big piece of it.

257
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,839
If and may and could.

258
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,175
It's bloody
cold up north.

259
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,678
Lollys is soft and warm.

260
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,513
And close.

261
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,015
If I gave you the choice
between fucking Lollys

262
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,226
and fighting the Mountain,
you'd have your britches down

263
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,686
and your cock out
before I could blink.

264
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,521
Does he frighten
you so much?

265
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,690
I'd be a bloody fool
if he didn't frighten me.

266
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,775
He's freakish big
and freakish strong.

267
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,361
And quicker than
you'd expect for a man
of that size.

268
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,031
Maybe I could take him,

269
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,200
dance around
until he's so tired

270
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,202
of hacking at me,
he dropped his sword,

271
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,329
get him off
his feet somehow.

272
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,872
But one misstep...

273
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,208
( snaps fingers )
...and I'm dead.

274
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,544
Why should I risk it?

275
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,754
Because you're my friend.

276
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,840
Aye, I'm your friend.

277
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,218
And when have you ever
risked your life for me?

278
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,354
I like you,

279
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,023
pampered little shit
that you are.

280
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,900
I just like myself more.

281
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,819
I understand.

282
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,738
I'm sorry it has
to be this way.

283
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,406
Why are you sorry?

284
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,491
Because you're
an evil bastard

285
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,118
with no conscience
and no heart?

286
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,163
<i>That's what I liked about</i>
<i>you in the first place.</i>

287
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,379
We had some
good days together.

288
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,506
Yes, we did.

289
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,020
<i>( bangs on door )</i>

290
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,606
What will you do?

291
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,193
I suppose I'll have to kill
the Mountain myself.

292
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,155
Won't that make
for a great song?

293
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,994
I hope to hear
them sing it one day.

294
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,963
<i>( bird screeching )</i>

295
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,639
How did you get in here?

296
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,390
Your door is well guarded,

297
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,810
but your window is not.

298
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,985
I swam to an island
a mile offshore for these.

299
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,488
Don't do that again.

300
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,283
Never met a woman who
didn't like wildflowers.

301
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,911
These are my
private quarters.

302
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,497
If I want you here,
I will summon you.

303
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,918
Forgive me, my queen.
I live to serve you.

304
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,260
<i>Tell me why you're here.</i>

305
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,057
I came to ask a favor.

306
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,685
I only have two talents
in this world--

307
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,854
war and women.

308
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,606
<i>You are staying here</i>
<i>in Meereen to rule.</i>

309
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,525
<i>That is a wise decision.</i>
<i>I respect it.</i>

310
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,694
But here in Meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

311
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,154
I've ordered the Second Sons
to patrol the streets

312
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,031
to stop
the revenge killing.

313
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,366
You've ordered us
to be night watchmen.

314
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,326
And as for women,

315
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,038
there are thousands
in Meereen you can pursue.

316
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,000
There is only one,

317
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,836
and she does not
want me.

318
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,297
You swore me your sword.

319
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,757
My sword is yours
till the day I die.

320
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,135
So if I command you
to stay in Meereen

321
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,511
and patrol the streets?

322
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,514
I'll stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets.

323
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,975
Send me to kill
your enemies.

324
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,311
Any enemy anywhere.

325
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,898
Let me do
what I do best.

326
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,109
Very well.

327
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,159
Do what you do best.

328
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,213
Take off your clothes.

329
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,242
( knocks )

330
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,953
Oh.

331
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,206
Come in, my queen.
Please.

332
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,208
I didn't mean
to disturb you, my lady.

333
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,043
You could never
disturb me.

334
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,670
I just wanted to speak
with you before we left.

335
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,006
Could you bring me
that vial over there?

336
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,469
The blue one.

337
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,974
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Not that one.</i>

338
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,309
You don't even want
to touch that one.

339
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,353
<i>Next to it.</i>

340
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,480
<i>That's the one.</i>

341
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,283
( inhales )

342
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,209
When I looked into
the flames this morning,

343
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,503
the Lord spoke to me.

344
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,213
He said,

345
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:42,926
"Tonight, you will
have your last good bath
in a long while.

346
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,095
Make it count."

347
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,933
A joke.

348
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,395
Not a very good one,
I'm afraid.

349
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,230
It was. I--

350
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:58,066
humor isn't my strength.

351
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,735
That's because
most jokes are lies

352
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,362
and you're devoted
to the truth.

353
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,782
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

354
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,243
Not always.

355
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,880
Most of these powders
and potions

356
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,882
are lies.

357
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,886
<i>Deceptions to make men</i>
<i>think they witnessed</i>
<i>our Lord's power.</i>

358
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,681
Once they step into
his light, they will see
the lie for what it was--

359
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,893
a trick that led them
to the truth.

360
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,604
<i>A pinch of this powder</i>
<i>in a bonfire</i>

361
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,899
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

362
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,818
And this one creates
a black smoke

363
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,237
that will make the bravest
man piss himself with fear.

364
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,449
And a drop of this
in any man's wine

365
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,993
will drive him
wild with lust.

366
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,373
Did you use it
with Stannis?

367
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,833
No.

368
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,088
Don't be upset.

369
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,382
Men never crave
what they already have.

370
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,178
It's only flesh.

371
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,847
It needs
what it needs.

372
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,270
No act done in service
of the Lord

373
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,023
can ever be called a sin.

374
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,443
I thank God every day
for bringing you to us.

375
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,904
And Stannis to you.

376
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:30,450
He wants to bring
Shireen with us.

377
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,788
I think that would be
ill-advised.

378
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,667
<i>My daughter has</i>
<i>heretical tendencies,</i>
<i>as you're well aware.</i>

379
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,379
I don't know if her
doubt is real or simply
meant to spite me,

380
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,882
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

381
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,139
I understand
how you feel.

382
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,473
Hmm.

383
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,851
But that
is impossible.

384
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,356
Why?

385
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,651
You don't need powders
and potions, my queen.

386
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,820
You don't need lies.

387
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:10,198
You are strong
enough to look into
the Lord's light

388
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,784
and see his truth
for yourself.

389
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,292
However harsh it is.

390
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,086
However hard for us
to understand.

391
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,173
<i>You don't need my help,</i>

392
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,925
<i>but I will need yours soon.</i>

393
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,053
When we set sail,
your daughter must
be with us.

394
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,559
The Lord needs her.

395
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,361
Jorah the Andal.

396
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,614
Are you here
to see our queen?

397
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,826
She's in a good mood.

398
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,343
Khaleesi.

399
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,012
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

400
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,807
You don't approve?

401
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,227
It's not
a question of approval,
it's a question of trust.

402
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,145
You neither
approve nor trust.

403
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,064
Why would I?
The man's a sellsword.

404
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,398
Didn't you fight for
the Golden Company

405
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,317
before pledging
your sword to my brother?

406
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,152
I did.

407
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,528
I trust you.

408
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,906
Daario Naharis
killed his captains

409
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,159
and dumped their heads
at your feet when he grew
tired of their commands.

410
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,328
How could you ever have
faith in a man like that?

411
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:42,165
I could never have faith
in a man like Daario.

412
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,211
That's why I've sent
him and the Second Sons
to retake Yunkai.

413
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,340
- You have?
- I have.

414
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,051
Without you there
to rule, Khaleesi,

415
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,928
I fear the masters
will simply bide their time,

416
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,138
wait for the invaders
to leave and reassert control.

417
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,226
That is why I've ordered
Daario to execute every
master in Yunkai.

418
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,855
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

419
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,774
They mutilate little boys
by the thousands.

420
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,277
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring
old men.

421
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,363
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

422
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,950
Herding the masters
into pens and slaughtering
them by the thousands

423
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,119
is also treating men
like beasts.

424
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,371
The slaves you freed,

425
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,665
brutality is all
they've ever known.

426
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,625
If you want them to know
something else,

427
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,127
you'll have
to show it to them.

428
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,045
And repay the slavers
with what? Kindness?

429
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,630
A fine?
A stern warning?

430
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,466
It's tempting to see
your enemies as evil,
all of them,

431
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,177
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every
war ever fought.

432
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,097
Let the priests argue
over good and evil.

433
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,682
Slavery is real.

434
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,642
I can end it.
I will end it.

435
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,103
<i>And I will end</i>
<i>those behind it.</i>

436
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,647
I sold men
into slavery, Khaleesi.

437
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:52,319
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

438
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,488
I wouldn't be here
to help you if Ned Stark
had done to me

439
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,867
what you want to do
to the masters of Yunkai.

440
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,124
The man who came
to me the other day
about burying his father.

441
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,835
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

442
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,920
He will accompany
the Second Sons

443
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,797
and serve
as my ambassador
to Yunkai.

444
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,842
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

445
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,304
He will explain the choice
they have before them.

446
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,514
They can live
in my new world

447
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,559
or they can die
in their old one.

448
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,149
Well, go and catch Daario
before he leaves.

449
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,109
Tell him
I changed my mind.

450
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,445
Yes, Khaleesi.

451
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,452
No.

452
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,999
Tell him<i> you</i>
<i>changed my mind.</i>

453
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,846
( Hound grunts )
Rat cunts.

454
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,392
Fucking whore.

455
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,853
<i>You're doing it wrong.</i>

456
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,773
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

457
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,859
<i>Otherwise it's gonna</i>
<i>get infected and fester.</i>

458
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,198
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right--

459
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,075
No fire.

460
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,370
It'll only take a second.

461
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,831
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

462
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,514
Shut up about it.

463
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,144
Shut up about everything.

464
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,771
Thanks to you,
I'm a walking bag of silver

465
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,232
anywhere the Lannisters
hold sway.

466
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,694
Which is everywhere
between where we are now

467
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,737
and where we're going.

468
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,410
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

469
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:09,497
getting myself cut
and stabbed and bitten.

470
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,627
No reward is worth
this much trouble.

471
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,755
<i>Wish I'd never</i>
<i>laid eyes on you.</i>

472
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,685
You say your brother
gave you that sword.

473
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,231
My brother gave me this.

474
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,819
It was just like you said
a while back.

475
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,237
<i>Pressed me to the fire</i>

476
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,240
like I was a nice
juicy mutton chop.

477
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,037
Why?

478
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,705
Thought I stole
one of his toys.

479
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:53,416
I didn't steal it.
I was just playing
with it.

480
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,465
The pain was bad.

481
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,467
The smell was worse.

482
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:09,807
But the worst thing
was that it was my brother
who did it.

483
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,898
My father,
who protected him...

484
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,569
told everyone my bedding
caught fire.

485
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,876
You think
you're on your own?

486
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,256
Let me wash it out

487
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,550
and help you
sew it up at least.

488
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,370
Brienne:
Bit of comfort
never hurt anyone.

489
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,706
We've been sleeping in
ditches the last few weeks.

490
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,375
I think we can treat
ourselves to a featherbed
for the night

491
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,336
and a hot meal
not cooked by you.

492
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,796
Couldn't agree
more, my lady.

493
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,798
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

494
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,842
Not working for your
former lord any longer.

495
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,511
- Yes, my lady.
- Don't get drunk.

496
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,306
No, my lady.

497
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,724
Hot Pie:
<i>Can I get you</i>
<i>anything else?</i>

498
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,434
No, this will do
nicely, thank you.

499
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,227
Kidney pie is wonderful.

500
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,646
Thanks.

501
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,899
I do my best.

502
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,235
A good kidney pie is all
about the ingredients.

503
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,405
<i>Flour, lard, water,</i>
<i>eggs, milk.</i>

504
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,449
Easy enough.
But the meat,

505
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,368
peacetime or not,
getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

506
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,995
and calves' kidneys
is not easy.

507
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,748
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

508
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,125
Got no right to cook
anything, them.

509
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,376
Oh, and the gravy.

510
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,253
Don't get me started
on the gravy.

511
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,838
<i>Very difficult</i>
<i>to get right.</i>

512
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,798
<i>See, a lot of people</i>
<i>give up on the gravy.</i>

513
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,009
You cannot give up
on the gravy.

514
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,594
No gravy, no pie.

515
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,971
Simple as that.

516
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,391
That's nice armor.
Are you a knight?

517
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,811
No.

518
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,065
Oh, it's just people with
armor are usually knights.

519
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,817
<i>Generally speaking.</i>
<i>From King's Landing,</i>
<i>though, aren't you?</i>

520
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,695
<i>From there myself originally.</i>
<i>Flea Bottom born and bred.</i>

521
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,989
<i>What brings you</i>
<i>to these parts?</i>

522
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,491
We're looking
for someone.

523
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,826
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

524
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,371
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17--

525
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,247
A girl, tall, red hair,
very pretty.

526
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,959
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using
a different name.

527
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,878
Starks?

528
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,759
What, like them lot
from "Winterhell"?

529
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,473
No, ain't seen
anyone like that.

530
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,433
I heard they was
all traitors.

531
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,435
Don't need
no traitors in here.

532
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,897
<i>I pledged my life to</i>
<i>their mother Catelyn Stark.</i>

533
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,149
I swore to her I'd bring
her daughters home.

534
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,115
Sure I can't get you
a bit more kidney pie?

535
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,422
What?

536
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,173
It's nothing, my lady.

537
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,385
You wouldn't be screwing
your face up like that
if it was nothing.

538
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,721
Don't want
to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don't.

539
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,639
You're not interesting
enough to be offensive.

540
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,893
The Lannisters
want Lady Sansa.

541
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,479
The Lannisters
have money.

542
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,398
People kill for money.

543
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,234
I don't think we should
be telling people

544
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,111
we're searching
for Lady Sansa.

545
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,749
My lady. My lord.
Could I have a word?

546
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,792
What about?
Not kidney pie.

547
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,419
<i>You seem</i>
<i>like a proper lady.</i>

548
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,713
<i>Someone who could</i>
<i>be trusted.</i>

549
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,092
I never met no Sansa Stark.

550
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,386
But I know her sister...

551
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,846
Arya.

552
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,769
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father
was beheaded.

553
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,438
She's presumed dead.

554
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,523
She weren't when I last
spoke to her.

555
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,942
- When was that?
-<i> Heading up north with</i>
<i>the Night's Watch.</i>

556
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,611
She was all dressed up
as a boy.

557
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,197
Like your ladyship,
only without the armor.

558
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,240
<i>Going by the name Arry.</i>

559
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,076
- So what happened to her?
- Well--

560
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,244
The quick version.

561
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,622
The Lannisters
took us prisoner.

562
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,290
We escaped.

563
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,125
The Brotherhood took
us prisoner.

564
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,752
They sold me
to the innkeep.

565
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,213
<i>They were gonna sell Arya</i>
<i>to her mother at Riverrun</i>

566
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,631
<i>along with another prisoner.</i>

567
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,341
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth

568
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,510
and a face like
a half-burnt ham.

569
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,595
-<i> Not friendly.</i>
<i>- The Hound.</i>

570
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,305
That's the one.

571
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,892
If you find her,
could you give her this?

572
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,727
She liked the last one
I gave her,

573
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,355
but, well, this one
turned out better.

574
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,408
Um, you were saying?

575
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,915
Brienne:
<i>Her mother's dead,</i>
<i>grandfather's dead,</i>

576
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,334
Walder Frey is
the new lord of Riverrun.

577
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,169
The Brotherhood
isn't going to Riverrun.

578
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,129
They'll take her
to the Eyrie, my lady.

579
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,173
Why the Eyrie?

580
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,551
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

581
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,928
Catelyn Stark's sister.

582
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,014
She's Arya's last living
relative with money.

583
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,517
She hates the Lannisters.

584
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,646
Lord Tyrion
made sure I knew

585
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,941
which house married which
and who hated who.

586
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,110
Sansa could
be there, too.

587
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,070
Aye, my lady.

588
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:57,822
Could be.

589
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,247
You sure about this?

590
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,127
No.

591
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,477
<i>( door opens )</i>

592
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,077
I imagined you'd be back
at the brothel at this hour.

593
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:49,957
I did spend some time
with an absolutely stunning
blonde the other day.

594
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,668
Mm, do tell.

595
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,172
I've got every kind
of filth down here

596
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,715
except the kind I like.

597
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,800
Your sister.

598
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,969
Oh.

599
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,604
Cersei approached me.

600
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,898
<i>We spoke a great deal</i>
<i>about her daughter.</i>

601
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,068
How worried your sister
is about her.

602
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,820
<i>She was trying</i>
<i>very hard to pretend</i>

603
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,906
<i>she had not come</i>
<i>to sway me against you.</i>

604
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,325
<i>I think she may have even</i>
<i>believed it herself.</i>

605
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,286
Making honest feelings
do dishonest work

606
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,664
is one of her many gifts.

607
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,917
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

608
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:38,089
It is rare
to meet a Lannister

609
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,634
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

610
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,305
She desperately wants
to see you killed.

611
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,808
She didn't need
to bother you.

612
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,436
It looks as though
I've taken care
of that myself.

613
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,814
<i>The joy she will feel</i>

614
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,566
<i>when my head</i>
<i>leaves my neck.</i>

615
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,945
She's wanted this
for a long time.

616
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,739
Yes, I know.

617
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,784
<i>We met, you and I.</i>

618
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,369
Many years ago.

619
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,330
I think I would
have remembered that.

620
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,542
Unlikely.
You had just been born.

621
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,338
Our father brought me
and my sister Elia with him

622
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,298
on a visit
to Casterly Rock.

623
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,384
<i>My first time</i>
<i>away from Dorne.</i>

624
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,803
I didn't like anything
about the Rock.

625
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,640
Not the food,
not the weather,

626
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,183
not your accents.

627
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,186
Nothing.

628
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,023
But the biggest
disappointment...

629
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,609
you.

630
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,113
You and my family
have more in common
than you might admit.

631
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,365
<i>The whole way from Dorne</i>

632
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,285
all anyone talked about
was the monster

633
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,371
that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

634
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,249
<i>A head twice</i>
<i>the size of his body,</i>

635
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,209
<i>a tail between his legs,</i>

636
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,295
claws, one red eye,

637
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,214
the privates of both
a girl and a boy.

638
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,175
That would have made
things so much easier.

639
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:08,512
<i>When we met your sister,</i>
<i>she promised she would</i>
<i>show you to us.</i>

640
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,764
Every day we would ask.

641
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,892
Every day she would
say, "Soon."

642
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,728
Then she and your brother

643
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,981
took us
to your nursery and...

644
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,360
she unveiled the freak.

645
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,114
<i>Your head</i>
<i>was a bit large.</i>

646
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,366
<i>Your arms and legs</i>
<i>were a bit small,</i>

647
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,993
but no claw.

648
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,121
No red eye.
No tail between your legs.

649
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,749
Just a tiny pink cock.

650
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,460
<i>We didn't try to hide</i>
<i>our disappointment.</i>

651
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,046
<i>"That's not a monster,"</i>
<i>I told Cersei.</i>

652
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,091
"That's just a baby."

653
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,095
<i>And she said,</i>
<i>"He killed my mother."</i>

654
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,597
<i>And she pinched</i>
<i>your little cock so hard,</i>

655
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,641
<i>I thought she might</i>
<i>pull it off.</i>

656
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,893
<i>Until your brother</i>
<i>made her stop.</i>

657
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,020
<i>"It doesn't matter,"</i>
<i>she told us.</i>

658
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,731
<i>"Everyone says</i>
<i>he will die soon.</i>

659
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,608
<i>I hope they are right.</i>

660
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,402
<i>He should not</i>
<i>have lived this long."</i>

661
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,825
Well...

662
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:18,040
sooner or later,
Cersei always gets
what she wants.

663
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,920
And what about
what I want?

664
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,633
Justice

665
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:31,137
for my sister
and her children.

666
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,139
If you want justice,

667
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,100
you've come
to the wrong place.

668
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,394
I disagree.

669
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:50,072
I've come to
the perfect place.

670
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,825
I want to bring those
who have wronged me
to justice.

671
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,120
And all those who have
wronged me are right here.

672
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,708
I will begin with
Ser Gregor Clegane,

673
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,669
<i>who killed</i>
<i>my sister's children</i>

674
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,922
and then raped her
with their blood still
on his hands

675
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,842
before killing her, too.

676
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,270
I will be your champion.

677
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,314
( exhales )

678
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,492
Hello, Robin.

679
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,870
What are you doing?

680
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,248
I'm building my home,
Winterfell.

681
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,124
At least I think I am.

682
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,127
I haven't been back there
in a very long time.

683
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,547
Why did you leave?

684
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,924
It's a long story.

685
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,135
I stay here in the Eyrie.

686
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,638
Mother says it's dangerous
on the roads and I have
to keep myself safe

687
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,640
because I'm the Lord
of the Vale

688
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,934
and the Lord of the Vale
is a very important person.

689
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,270
Yes, you certainly are.

690
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,605
When will you go back?

691
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,275
Probably never.

692
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,443
My family doesn't
live there anymore

693
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,946
and someone
burned it down.

694
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,782
Oh.

695
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,451
Does Winterfell
have a Moon Door?

696
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,120
No, I'm afraid not.

697
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,122
It's not high up
in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

698
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,457
- That sounds dangerous.
- ( chuckles )

699
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,043
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

700
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,670
What do you do with
all the bad people

701
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,047
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

702
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,716
I never did anything
with them at all.

703
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,677
Girls didn't take part
in that where I came from.

704
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,638
Well, I'm Lord
of the Vale.

705
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,142
When I grow up,
I'll be able to fly
anybody who bothers me.

706
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,394
Or you.
When we get married,

707
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,062
you can tell me
if you don't like somebody

708
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,440
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

709
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,483
Right through
the Moon Door.

710
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,987
I like the sound of that.

711
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,905
Let's put a Moon Door
in your Winterfell.

712
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,240
All right.

713
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,367
It can go in here
in this big tower.

714
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,328
Careful.
You've ruined it.

715
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,871
Now I'm going to have
to rebuild the whole thing.

716
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,789
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

717
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,541
It was already ruined
because it didn't
have a Moon Door.

718
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,834
I was fixing it.

719
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,336
Knocking things down
isn't fixing them.

720
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,879
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

721
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,423
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

722
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,925
( grunting )

723
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,264
( gasps )

724
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,395
- ( crying )
- Robin, I'm sorry, I--

725
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,272
Littlefinger:
<i>Children.</i>

726
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:16,236
-<i> I hit him.</i>
<i>- Yes, I saw.</i>

727
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,488
I shouldn't have done that.

728
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,866
No, his mother
should have

729
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,035
a long time ago.

730
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:26,497
Consider it a step
in the right direction.

731
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,583
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

732
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:33,212
Let me worry about
Aunt Lysa.

733
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,215
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

734
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,510
I'll never see it again.

735
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,306
A lot can happen
between now and never.

736
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,644
If you want to build
a better home,

737
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,480
first you must
demolish the old one.

738
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,527
Why did you really
kill Joffrey?

739
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,533
Tell me why.

740
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:10,791
I loved your mother more
than you could ever know.

741
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,838
Given the opportunity,
what do we do to those

742
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,006
who've hurt
the ones we love?

743
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,808
In a better world,

744
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,269
one where love

745
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:35,023
could overcome
strength and duty,

746
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,110
you might have been
my child.

747
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,407
But we don't live
in that world.

748
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,421
You're more beautiful
than she ever was.

749
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,841
Lord Baelish...

750
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,843
Call me Petyr.

751
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,703
<i>( wind whistling )</i>

752
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,247
<i>You wanted</i>
<i>to see me, Aunt Lysa?</i>

753
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,834
Come here, Sansa.

754
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,351
Do you know how far
the fall is?

755
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,354
No.

756
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,648
<i>Neither do I, precisely.</i>

757
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,192
<i>Hundreds of feet.</i>

758
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,110
It's fascinating

759
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,989
what happens to bodies
when they hit the rocks
from such a height.

760
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,325
The impact breaks them
right apart.

761
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,620
Like eggs dropped
on the floor.

762
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,206
Sometimes pieces
remain intact.

763
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,959
You'll find the head
sitting on its own.

764
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,044
Every hair in place.

765
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,964
Blue eyes staring
at nothing.

766
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,517
I know what you did.

767
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,229
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

768
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,731
I never should have
hit Robin, I know it.
I promise it won't happen--

769
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,608
Don't be coy with me,
you little whore.

770
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,486
You kissed him.
You kissed Petyr.

771
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,822
- I didn't.
You don't understand.
- I saw you.

772
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,741
You can't lie to me
because I saw it with
my own eyes.

773
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,035
- He kissed me.
I pulled away.
- Liar!

774
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,038
- ( whimpering )
- Whore! He is mine!

775
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,624
My father, my husband,
my sister,

776
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,710
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

777
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:03,922
That's what happens
to people who stand
between Petyr and me.

778
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,382
Look down!

779
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,926
Look down!
Look down! Look down!

780
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,929
Littlefinger:
<i>Lysa!</i>

781
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,765
Let her go.

782
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,104
You want her?

783
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,898
This empty-headed child?

784
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,567
Let her go.

785
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,737
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

786
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,989
I lied for you.

787
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,158
<i>I killed for you.</i>

788
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,452
Why did you bring
her here? Why?

789
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,787
I'll send her away.

790
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,292
I swear on my life.

791
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,961
I swear to all the gods.

792
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,964
Let her go, Lysa.

793
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,550
( crying )

794
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,013
( whimpering )

795
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,893
( sobbing )

796
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,276
Oh, my sweet wife.

797
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:12,032
My sweet, silly wife.

798
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,833
I have only loved
one woman...

799
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,670
only one,

800
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,089
my entire life.

801
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,429
Your sister.

802
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,474
( screaming )

803
00:49:45,941 --> 00:51:03,935
