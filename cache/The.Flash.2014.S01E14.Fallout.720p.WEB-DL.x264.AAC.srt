00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:05,602
My name is Barry Allen and I
am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,973
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,042
by something impossible.

5
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:13,112
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:17,016
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,752
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist.

8
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,621
But secretly, I use my speed
to fight crime

9
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,456
and find others like me.

10
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,292
And one day, I'll find who
killed my mother

11
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,361
and get justice for my father.

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,498
I am The Flash.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,033
Previously on <i>The Flash...</i>

14
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,768
That's Barry's old house.

15
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,703
Maybe it's been too long.
Everything's different.

16
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:38,937
Except that mirror.

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,339
This mirror might contain

18
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:43,142
Photographs of what happened
that night.

19
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,943
That blood belongs to one
of the two speedsters

20
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,211
that was here that night.

21
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,113
It's Barry's...
as an adult.

22
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,015
Mrs. Stein, have you seen
this person?

23
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,351
- Yes.
- He's not even Ronnie anymore.

24
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:55,187
He's Martin Stein walking around
in Ronnie's body.

25
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,623
Any attempt we make
to separate the two of them

26
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,259
Could be catastrophic
and nuclear.

27
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,579
Barry?

28
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,848
Barry, what happened out there?

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,751
Are you guys okay?

30
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,653
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

31
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,389
I think so.

32
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,257
Oh, God.
The nuclear explosion.

33
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,661
There's no telling how much
radiation we were exposed to.

34
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,429
Wait... wait, wait, wait, wait,
this can't be.

35
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,897
The Geiger counter in the suit...

36
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,599
It's reading less than
one millirad.

37
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,834
But that's normal.

38
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:45,037
There's no radiation.

39
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,972
Let's go.

40
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,391
Did it work?

41
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,593
Did you separate them?

42
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,294
I don't know.

43
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,969
Ronnie?

44
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,181
Tell me your name.

45
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,649
Ronnie Raymond.

46
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,918
Cait.

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,320
It's me.

48
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,627
Uh, pardon me.

49
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,264
Obviously, I need
a change of clothes.

50
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,901
Nice to see you in the flesh
again, Professor Stein.

51
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,071
We're coming home.

52
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,142
All of us.

53
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,884
- Ronnie Raymond.
- Cisco.

54
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,354
Man.
Ohh.

55
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,691
I missed you so much, man.

56
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,992
I shouldn't have locked you
in there.

57
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,461
Hey... don't.

58
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,996
Welcome back, Mr. Raymond.

59
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,331
Dr. Wells.

60
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,866
Caitlin told me
what happened to you.

61
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,568
I'm so sorry.

62
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,336
I'm responsible for putting
myself in this chair.

63
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,673
You are responsible for my
still being alive... thank you.

64
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,142
You said you'd bring him back,
and you did.

65
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:31,577
Thank you.

66
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,578
You're welcome.

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,146
Excuse me?

68
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:37,683
Are we all planning
to sing kumbaya next?

69
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,551
Professor Stein, I presume.

70
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,220
Harrison Wells.

71
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,821
Do you have somewhere
I can freshen up

72
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,623
And get a change of clothes?

73
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,225
Of course.

74
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,694
Right this way, Professor.

75
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,634
General, are you getting this?

76
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,703
Roger that, sergeant.

77
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,740
Sir, look at this.

78
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,108
Two imprints of impact.

79
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,811
Two imprints.

80
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,779
Two different people.

81
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,783
It's firestorm.
He's separated.

82
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,785
Your vitals appear
to be normal,

83
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,622
Except you have
a slight fever of 100.6.

84
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,257
Cait, I'm fine, I promise.

85
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,424
I know, but we just
need to be...

86
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,093
Shh.

87
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,128
Yep... just when I forgot
how awkward it was

88
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,463
To walk in on you two.

89
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,398
Well, you can get
used to it again.

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,533
So I did a full medical
workup on the Professor.

91
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,070
It turns out that now that he
and Ronnie are separated,

92
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,438
They no longer possess
the ability

93
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,107
To harness nuclear energy.

94
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,743
Professor Stein, you seem
to be running

95
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,311
A little hot as well.

96
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,079
Same as Ronnie... 100.6.

97
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,282
Hardly a sweat, Dr. Snow.

98
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:46,251
And hopefully now the only thing
Ronald and I have in common...

99
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,120
- It's Ronnie.
- Mm.

100
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,354
Hey?

101
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,189
You gonna miss being able
to fly?

102
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,625
Yeah, maybe if I was the one
holding the controller.

103
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,360
Meaning?

104
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,729
Meaning, you weren't the most
conscientious body-mate.

105
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,265
So you do not consider
keeping you alive

106
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,333
to be conscientious?

107
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,801
Alive?

108
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,202
We were living under
a bridge, eating garbage.

109
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,837
I did not determine
that it would be

110
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,140
My mind that would dominate
our existence,

111
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,876
But thank God it was.

112
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:13,178
I could feel
your fear and panic,

113
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,980
Emotions that likely
would have gotten us killed

114
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,048
In that state.

115
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,549
You kept me buried down.

116
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,518
You kept me from her.

117
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,522
Which is likely why
she's still alive.

118
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,856
Now I believe
you and I have spent

119
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,857
Quite enough time together.

120
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,125
Yeah.

121
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,527
I would like to go home
to see my wife.

122
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,595
- Mr. Allen will take you.
- Thank you.

123
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,269
- I need some pizza.
- You got it.

124
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,009
I can't believe it.

125
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,110
Oh... wait.

126
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:50,482
Uh... What should I say?

127
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:53,051
I don't think you're gonna
have to say anything.

128
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,290
Oh, Clarissa.

129
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:02,427
I'm so sorry I put you
through this.

130
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,940
Thank you.

131
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:18,009
Mister, uh...
Barry.

132
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,444
Yeah?

133
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:24,116
Barry, I... I know I can be
difficult, but thank you

134
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,885
for bringing me home.

135
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,221
I'll see you soon, Professor.

136
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,398
Hey.

137
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,565
I left you three messages.

138
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,102
About the lack of communication,
or that new hole

140
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,370
out in the badlands?

141
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,039
Uh, we're all fine, thanks.

142
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,343
I wasn't calling
about the explosion.

143
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,111
I have to show you something.

144
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,113
What?

145
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,930
It's smaller than I remember.

146
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,098
Yeah.

147
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,600
It's because you're bigger.

148
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,068
Have you been in here?

149
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,338
- I mean, recently.
- No.

150
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,677
I haven't been in this house
since that night.

151
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:31,416
Bar?
This mirror... you remember it?

152
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,952
Yeah.
It belonged to my grandma.

153
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,221
How is it still here?

154
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,457
Just be glad it is.

155
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,061
Look... I don't fully know
how Cisco did it, but...

156
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:47,866
Did what?
Joe, what are we doing here?

157
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:06,151
Mom.

158
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,820
You can definitely see
two very fast people

159
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,155
Fighting around your mother.

160
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,025
Two speedsters.

161
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,360
You see that?

162
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,995
The blood?

163
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,966
Cisco and I
had the DNA tested.

164
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,735
It's yours.

165
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,237
No, it's not.
That's impossible.

166
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,972
I wasn't even downstairs yet.

167
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,141
No, Barry.
Not that you.

168
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,543
This you.

169
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,012
Cisco had the samples
analyzed and the proteins

170
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:39,718
In the blood were that
of an adult, not a child.

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,186
But that means...

172
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,621
The second speedster,
the one trying to stop

173
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,622
The man in yellow...

174
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,992
Is the Flash.

175
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,426
That's me.

176
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,637
Time travel.

177
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,338
If the last five months
have proven anything,

178
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,307
It's that anything can exist,

179
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:05,210
But to actually
travel through time?

180
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,280
Well, the greatest minds
in human history

181
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,782
Put their collective genius
towards solving that puzzle.

182
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,251
So.
Is it possible?

183
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,786
Yes, it's possible.

184
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,422
But problematic.

185
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,559
Assuming you could create
the conditions necessary

186
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,427
To take that journey... well,
that journey would then be

187
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,795
Fraught with
potential pitfalls.

188
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,131
The Novikov principle
of self-consistency,

189
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,132
For example.

190
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,700
Wait, the what, now?

191
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,969
If you travel back in time
to change something,

192
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:35,240
Then you end up being
the causal factor of that event.

193
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,042
Like <i>Terminator</i>.

194
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,043
Ah.

195
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,644
Or is time plastic?

196
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,113
Is it mutable whereby
any changes to the continuum

197
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,816
Could create
an alternate timeline.

198
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:45,917
Back to the future.

199
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,586
Oh... saw that one too.

200
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:51,756
Doc brown.
Tremendous picture.

201
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,693
Right.
So what's the answer?

202
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,528
I might be a clever guy, Joe,
but if you're asking me

203
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,130
To give you a working theory on
how to travel through time,

204
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,366
I'm afraid I
just can't do that.

205
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,302
There is someone else
you can talk to about this.

206
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,878
Danish?

207
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,714
Why do you have a blueprint
of the S.T.A.R. Labs

208
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,649
Particle accelerator?

209
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,984
Do you actually know anything
about physics?

210
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,353
Not a thing.
Might as well be in Dothraki.

211
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:24,556
So what more is there
with the S.T.A.R. Labs story?

212
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,890
The only new piece
of information

213
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,525
Is the fact that
Harrison Wells admitted

214
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,427
That he was warned of
a potential disaster.

215
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,698
Yeah.
Why do you think he did that?

216
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,400
Because he's a good person?

217
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,435
- Is he?
- Yes.

218
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,304
He saved my friend's life.

219
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,206
He was struck by lightning
that night and Dr. Wells

220
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,407
And his team kept him alive.

221
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,908
So?

222
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,543
Your friend wouldn't
have needed saving

223
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,946
If Wells hadn't zapped him
in the first place.

224
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,981
It was an accident.

225
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,050
What if it wasn't?

226
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,418
So you think Harrison Wells

227
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,720
Wanted the particle accelerator
to explode?

228
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,389
Why would he do that?

229
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,358
I don't know what goes on
inside that building.

230
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,827
But I think you know
some people who do.

231
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,162
So you think I would
investigate my friends

232
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,864
Because you got me a danish?

233
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:09,501
I think that you'll do it
because you really want

234
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,937
To know what goes on
inside that building.

235
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,846
Harry?

236
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,648
Mrs. Stein, I'm sorry
to bother you here,

237
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,784
But is Professor Stein
here right now?

238
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,218
Well, after a year apart,

239
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,355
I'm not letting him
out of my sight.

240
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,792
S.T.A.R. Labs did quite a few
tests on Martin,

241
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,695
Didn't they... and they said
he was fine?

242
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,863
Yeah.
Why, is something wrong?

243
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,533
He just seems a little
different, is all.

244
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,334
Different how?

245
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,938
He's been asking for pizza.
Martin despises pizza.

246
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,674
Is that the delivery man?
Oh, Mr. Allen.

247
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,876
I suppose it's too much
to hope you moonlight

248
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:56,614
As a pizza boy.
I am famished.

249
00:11:56,616 --> 00:12:01,419
Okay.

250
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,924
Oh, bravo!
Please, come in.

251
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,426
Mr. Allen.

252
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,596
Oh, mmm.
What can I do for you?

253
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,531
I... I needed to talk to you
about a paper

254
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,100
That you wrote 25 years ago

255
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,701
For the oxford
university press.

256
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,369
I've written many papers
for that publication.

257
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,371
Could you be more specific
about the subject matter?

258
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,006
Time travel.

259
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,578
These are just a few
of the random thoughts

260
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,012
I've had on the subject.

261
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,514
Few?

262
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:33,251
See, I believe
that space-time

263
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,320
Is a free-flowing highway

264
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,756
That intersects
the physical world.

265
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:42,026
We live in... in the moments
between the on and off ramps.

266
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,229
Theoretically,
to travel through time,

267
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,232
One merely needs to find
a way onto the highway.

268
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,268
Okay, so... so you're saying
that this is actually possible

269
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,237
To... to travel
into the future?

270
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,905
Undoubtedly.

271
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,373
What about the past?

272
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,574
Yes.

273
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,077
My own personal choice
would be

274
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,479
The Chicago world's fair,
1893.

275
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,915
I... I think Nicola Tesla
and I would have

276
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,150
Some wonderful arguments.

277
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,851
What about you?

278
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:11,923
Would you be interested
in taking a trip into history?

279
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:17,262
I think that I already have.

280
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,831
Professor, um...

281
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,333
15 years ago,
my mom was murdered

282
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:27,572
And we recently discovered
some evidence that...

283
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,008
I was there that night,
and not just as a kid,

284
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,845
But as an adult.

285
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:39,617
That must be a side effect
of your incredible speed.

286
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:45,290
In some... Future date,
you actually move so fast

287
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,226
That the resulting
kinetic energy buildup

288
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:52,797
Smashes a hole in
the space-time continuum!

289
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:02,640
You seem disappointed
by the prospect.

290
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:06,477
I mean, if I do
somehow make it back there

291
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:12,417
To that night, then...
It means that I didn't save her.

292
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,119
My destiny is to fail.

293
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,493
And the boomerang goes flying
through the cortex,

294
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,729
Smashing everything
and Cisco's all,

295
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,132
"my bad.
This one's on me."

296
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,801
Sounds like you had
some crazy times.

297
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,836
Yeah, we have.

298
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,805
Are you ready for life
to get back to normal?

299
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,373
What do you mean?

300
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,243
I was thinking
we could leave town.

301
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,346
Start fresh somewhere.

302
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,515
Our lives are here.
My job is here.

303
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,752
Yeah, hunting meta-humans.

304
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,621
There's more to it than that.

305
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,456
And it's dangerous.

306
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,691
It can be.

307
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:59,163
Look, I stayed at S.T.A.R. Labs
because I believed in Dr. Wells.

308
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:04,535
But ever since Barry became
the Flash and we've been working

309
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,105
To keep this city safe,

310
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,441
I found a new way
to help people.

311
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,144
Look, Cait, I'm not
mad at anyone.

312
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,414
Okay, I know the accelerator
explosion was an accident.

313
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,250
But that building
took a year of our lives.

314
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,587
I don't want it
to take anymore.

315
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,757
Do you guys need anything else?
We're about to close up.

316
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,262
I'm good.
Babe?

317
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,697
Ronnie, get down.

318
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,368
- Get out of here.
- No, not without you.

319
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,337
I'm right behind you... go!

320
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,209
- Professor?
- Martin?

321
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,611
What's wrong?

322
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,881
I don't know, I...
I feel terrified.

323
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,883
My... my heart is racing.

324
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,528
Hands in the air!

325
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,264
I think... I think
Ronald is in trouble.

326
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,166
How could you know that?

327
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,034
Jitters.
He needs help.

328
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,336
Go!

329
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,709
Ronald Raymond.

330
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,011
Burning man himself.

331
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,546
Half of him, anyway.

332
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,981
Who are you?

333
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,783
General Wade Eiling,
United States Army.

334
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,352
What do you want?

335
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,887
Firestorm.

336
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,274
Stings, doesn't it?

337
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,477
Had that one developed
especially for you.

338
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,279
Micro fragments
attracted to kinetic energy.

339
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,981
Firestorm was
tonight's main objective,

340
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,784
But getting you...
that's just gravy.

341
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,824
Get in!

342
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,599
Gentlemen, we are at war.

343
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,708
You need to hurry,
Barry's wounds

344
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,709
Are starting to heal
with the fragments

345
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,411
Still under his skin.

346
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,713
This is just like that time
I stepped on a sea urchin.

347
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,048
Only much worse.

348
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,883
Just don't pee on me.

349
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,452
Uh, you know that's
a myth, right?

350
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,224
I'm so stupid.

351
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,760
Jason rush, the grad student
who was helping Professor Stein

352
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,163
With his firestorm research,
he said that the army

353
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,899
Took all of Professor Stein's
material when he disappeared.

354
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,534
I should have known
it was General Eiling.

355
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,935
Not your fault.

356
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,537
He still thinks you hold
the keys to the ultimate

357
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,539
Human weapon... both of you.

358
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,008
Okay, let's just finish this.
I gotta get to Stein's house.

359
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,109
Eiling's gonna be after him too.

360
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,577
Stein's fine.

361
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,346
- How do you know?
- He's right there.

362
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,683
I don't think Mr. Raymond
and I are as distinctive

363
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,419
As we had hoped.

364
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,788
I'm still inside Ronald.

365
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,091
There has to be a better way
to phrase that.

366
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,827
Beta, alpha, theta, delta...
all your brain waves

367
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,562
Are perfectly in sync.

368
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,465
The chances of that happening
are next to impossible.

369
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,834
Impossible's just another
Tuesday for us, remember?

370
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,770
Yeah, but this is like
some <i>twilight zone</i> level stuff,

371
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,438
And I say that knowing
full well that we have

372
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,639
A guy locked up
in our basement

373
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,141
Who can turn himself
into poison gas.

374
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,442
Wait, really?

375
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,010
Dude, that was, like,
week three.

376
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,480
Look, if this Eiling is as
dangerous as you say,

377
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,115
Then I need to warn Clarissa.

378
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,817
I promise, I can get Clarissa
out of the city in time,

379
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,919
But we need you to stay here.

380
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,789
Professor, I need you
to trust us.

381
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,691
Very well.

382
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,966
Hey.
Are you okay?

383
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,801
Yeah.

384
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,605
Yeah, it's just not
the S.T.A.R. Labs I knew.

385
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:04,008
Ronnie, this isn't
the world that you knew.

386
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,776
Tell me about it.

387
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,081
All right, here we are.

388
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,649
Uh, all right.

389
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,185
You guys can stay down
in Iris' old room.

390
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:17,655
- It's kind of small, but...
- hey.

391
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,956
- We have guests.
- Yeah, we do.

392
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,358
I hope that's okay.

393
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,960
<i>- Mi casa.
- This is Ronnie.</i>

394
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,396
Nice to meet you.

395
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,366
- Ronnie, the...
- Dead fiance.

396
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,535
Right.

397
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,370
- Beer?
- Thanks.

398
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,039
Dad?
Barry?

399
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,575
- Iris, hi.
- Hi.

400
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,576
What are you doing here?

401
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,378
Uh, it's Tuesday.

402
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,580
I was gonna make us dinner,
remember?

403
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,748
- Yep.
- Yeah.

404
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,049
Here, I'll help.
Got it.

405
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,084
I knew you'd forget.

406
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,819
Well, there's plenty
for everyone.

407
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,189
Caitlin, what brings you by?

408
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,157
There's a gas leak
in my apartment,

409
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,726
So Barry said that
we could stay here.

410
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,897
Oh, that's sweet of him.
And, uh, who's this?

411
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:04,001
- This is, uh...
- Her cousin.

412
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:08,873
- Sam.
- Visiting from Coast City.

413
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,976
You look really familiar, Sam.

414
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,812
Yeah, I... I have...
One of those faces.

415
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,547
So what's for dinner?

416
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,889
- Harrison.
- Wade.

417
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,626
I had a feeling
you would be wheeling by.

418
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,728
Tell me.

419
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,198
They still pulling needles
out of Barry Allen's hide?

420
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,203
I guess your sweet little
Flash didn't want

421
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:45,176
Sergeant Sans Soucie to die
looking into a mask.

422
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,378
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

423
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,021
I don't know how firestorm
works.

424
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:01,692
Well, you may not know
the how, but you know the who.

425
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,195
Both of them.

426
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:08,299
Thanks to you, it's the dawn
of a new age, Harrison.

427
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,801
Cold war, the war on terror.

428
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,603
We'll seem like cave men
fighting with sticks

429
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:17,575
Once those two freaks
bind together.

430
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:18,976
Well, you know where to find me

431
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:22,113
When you've come
to the right decision.

432
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,148
And I know you will.

433
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,351
After all, you're
the smartest guy I know.

434
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,734
Bar?

435
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,304
Should I have not shown you?

436
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,908
No, I had to know.

437
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,146
We have been through so much.
You have... all your life.

438
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,852
And you've been so strong.

439
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:06,324
But I am still your guardian,

440
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,093
And it's my job to guard you,

441
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,730
Not just physically,
but from heartache.

442
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,034
I can't help but feeling
like I just handed you

443
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,805
A brand new burden.

444
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:25,710
Yeah.
But it's our burden, right?

445
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:30,781
Yeah.
Yeah.

446
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,116
Hey, can I ask you something?

447
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,851
Mm hmm.

448
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,088
How did you know that the blood
in the house belonged to me?

449
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,125
You would have had to have
tested it specifically.

450
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:45,696
Cisco tested it against
everyone who worked

451
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,866
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

452
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:54,305
You wanted to know
if it belonged to Wells?

453
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:57,875
Joe.

454
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:03,013
Dr. Wells had nothing to do
with my mom's murder.

455
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,218
You believe that now?

456
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,453
Yeah.

457
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,122
Yeah, yeah... I do.

458
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,768
Cheers.

459
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,405
Cheers.

460
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,174
Delicious.

461
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,910
This is quite an impressive
facility.

462
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,713
Well, it was.

463
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:39,617
Now it's just a shell,
I'm afraid.

464
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,953
Must have been devastating,
seeing your life's work

465
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:46,424
Fall to pieces
before your eyes.

466
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:50,694
It was and yet,
it was the exact same moment

467
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,364
Your life's work came
to fruition.

468
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:56,100
My life's work?

469
00:23:56,102 --> 00:24:01,505
If living the last 14 months
as a conjoined meta-human

470
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:05,743
has taught me anything,
it's that my life's work

471
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:10,014
should have been being the best
husband I could to my wife.

472
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,888
Are you all right, Martin?

473
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,658
I apologize, it's just...

474
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,726
I feel a little light-headed.

475
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,265
Are you okay?

476
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,835
Uh... Yeah.

477
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,303
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

478
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,239
Just got a little dizzy
for a second.

479
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,682
You want the secret
to firestorm.

480
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,917
He has it.

481
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,020
See, Harrison?
We do work well together.

482
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,870
Oh, hey... hey.

483
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:06,904
You said you knew some of
the leftover scientists

484
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,305
At the S.T.A.R. Lab.

485
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,374
What about a Caitlin Snow, M.D.
You know her?

486
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,742
Yeah, I know her, why?

487
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,377
There was an incident
at a local coffee shop.

488
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,546
She was there.

489
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:18,349
That's jitters.
I used to work there.

490
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,185
Is there anything
you can't do?

491
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,319
Gimme this.

492
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,821
Witnesses swear
they saw soldiers

493
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,389
Shooting the place up,
so I contacted the army's

494
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,625
Media relations division
and asked,

495
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,293
"are soldiers permitted
to operate like that

496
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,394
On US soil?"

497
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,629
You know what they told me?

498
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,330
Hooah.

499
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,032
That's weird, Caitlin didn't
mention anything

500
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,567
The last time I saw her.

501
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,668
Really?

502
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,004
When and where was that?

503
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:44,742
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's
an explanation for all of this.

504
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,463
He didn't hurt you?

505
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,066
Barry, I told you...
only my pride is hurt.

506
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,367
Unfortunately, I'm not
in the position to take on

507
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,802
Armed soldiers.

508
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,404
Where do you think
Eiling took Professor Stein?

509
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,573
I imagine some off-the-books
military research facility.

510
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,141
We have to get him back.

511
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,977
Easy... Eiling has already
demonstrated he has the weaponry

512
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,146
To disable the Flash,
or worse.

513
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,982
Well, we can't let him
turn Stein into a weapon.

514
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,518
How do we find him?

515
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,459
What?

516
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,862
No abnormal brain activity.

517
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,197
All vitals steady.

518
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,532
You really think Ronnie
can somehow feel

519
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:42,967
Where they're keeping Stein?

520
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,635
Ronnie got dizzy when
the soldiers grabbed Stein,

521
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:47,137
And Stein developed
Ronnie's obsession with pizza.

522
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,273
I don't feel anything
right now.

523
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,241
Just keep trying.

524
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,242
Whatever this is,
it doesn't have

525
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,211
An on and off switch.

526
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:57,715
It's possible it's just some
kind of residual connection.

527
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,451
A temporary link
to your time together.

528
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,787
Wait.
I feel something.

529
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,593
I'm... I'm cold.

530
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,328
It's freezing in here!

531
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,199
My apologies.
It should warm up pretty quick.

532
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,040
I know what you want.

533
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:28,345
But my research was never
intended to be used as a weapon.

534
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,714
I joined the military
when I was 20 years old,

535
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,182
Professor.

536
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,318
My father had me convinced
that our greatest threat

537
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,386
Was the soviets.

538
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:37,821
Our greatest fear... nuclear war.

539
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,658
Then came terrorism

540
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,160
And Ebola.

541
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,829
And now, it's the age
of firestorm.

542
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,198
Soldiers enhanced
by your project, Professor.

543
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,867
Soldiers who can generate
energy blasts

544
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,635
With their bare hands.

545
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,871
Soldiers who can fly.

546
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:58,042
I would gladly die
before I see my life's work

547
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,044
Perverted in this way.

548
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:03,881
Good.
Because you will die, Professor.

549
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:09,420
How soon I let that happen,
though, is entirely up to you.

550
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:13,657
What's going on?

551
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,527
Last time I did this
was to a gorilla.

552
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,268
You're okay, man, we got you.

553
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,003
What's happening to him?

554
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,705
Nothing's happening to him.

555
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:31,075
It's happening to Stein,
and Ronnie is feeling his pain.

556
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,443
I was wrong.

557
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:33,444
The connection's
not temporary.

558
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:37,114
It's only getting stronger.

559
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,883
Just try and hold on.

560
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,186
Water.
Water.

561
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:55,399
My, my, my, my, my, my.

562
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:59,937
You show remarkable grit
for a teacher.

563
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,739
I am impressed.

564
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,641
Why don't we let you
catch your breath?

565
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,611
Think about how much more
of this you want to endure.

566
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,046
Hmm?

567
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:17,955
Ronnie, no!

568
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:18,922
Wait, Cait, wait.

569
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:19,990
He's cutting himself.

570
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,726
I know.
Let him.

571
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,477
Ronald.

572
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,956
Anything?

573
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,593
Nothing.
Nothing, just... Just cold.

574
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:01,165
Like a metal surface.
Pressure on and on and off.

575
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,270
Tap, tap.
Tap.

576
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,972
Tap.
Tap.

577
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,073
Tap, tap, tap.

578
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,074
Morse code.

579
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,643
I got this.

580
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,279
Same thing again.
Tap, tap.

581
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:15,981
Tap.

582
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,753
Tap, tap, tap.

583
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:25,255
- 27.
- What does it mean?

584
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:29,827
Army bases... they sometimes
go by numbers, like area 51.

585
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,962
Facility 27,
about 300 miles away.

586
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,630
It was shut down in 1961.

587
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,332
Well, that's where
they're keeping Stein.

588
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,934
Bet you that's where
they're keeping aliens too.

589
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,135
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

590
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,503
You can't.

591
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,071
I'm connected to Stein.
I have to go.

592
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,940
But did you ever stop
to think why your connection

593
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,775
To him is growing stronger
by the minute?

594
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:46,577
Maybe you're being drawn
back together.

595
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,646
Maybe your proximity will cause
you to re-merge into one.

596
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:54,017
And what happens to me
if he gets killed?

597
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,353
Cait, Barry was right.

598
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,255
The world is different now.

599
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,490
Look, I... I thought
we could get away,

600
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,393
Start a new life,
a normal life, together.

601
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,696
But there is no
normal life for us.

602
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:08,966
You will always risk your life
to try and help people,

603
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,134
And I will always be
the guy that runs

604
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:15,739
Into that pipeline for you.

605
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,040
The quantum splicer.

606
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,876
It was used to separate
you once.

607
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:21,812
Maybe it could be of use
to keep you you.

608
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:23,580
Thanks.

609
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,649
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait.

610
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:33,891
Come back.
All three of you.

611
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,960
Let's go.

612
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,377
Oh.

613
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:55,245
This place definitely
doesn't look too shady.

614
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,214
Stein's inside.

615
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:58,682
I can feel our connection
growing stronger,

616
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,317
Like he's pulling me.

617
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,152
It's as I feared...
the firestorm matrix

618
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,454
Is building toward
a proximity reemergence.

619
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,457
Like all matter,
it yearns to be whole.

620
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,864
If you do merge...

621
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:17,467
We might not be able
to separate you again.

622
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,269
We've been able to isolate
the firestorm matrix

623
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,138
Inside the subject's
cellular structure.

624
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,873
Excellent.

625
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,574
Professor Stein,

626
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,945
I'm afraid you have
made a terrible assumption...

627
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:31,481
That I need you alive.

628
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,984
Eiling has a gun
to Stein's head.

629
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,452
He's about to pull
the trigger.

630
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:41,959
He's here.

631
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,429
Ho!

632
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,397
Whoa... I never thought
I'd be happy to see you.

633
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,666
- Yeah, likewise.
- Let's get out of here.

634
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:05,482
Run!

635
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,184
Okay... come on,
come on.

636
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,591
Barry, I'm picking up some
serious ph numbers on your suit.

637
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,259
They hit me with some kind
of chemical.

638
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,627
It's a weaponized phosphorous.

639
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,830
Water or foam
won't extinguish it.

640
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:24,001
But you can't burn in a vacuum,
so you need to create one.

641
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,236
Run, Barry.
Run!

642
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,020
- We need to merge again.
- Ronnie, no!

643
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,287
Cait, we're dead if we don't.

644
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,822
Listen to me.

645
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,624
The last time you two combined,
you both fought it.

646
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,826
This time, don't.

647
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,596
Accept the change,
accept the balance.

648
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,431
Accept each other.

649
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,200
Once more unto the breach,
dear friend.

650
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:07,611
Cait... whatever happens, just
remember I'll always love you.

651
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,527
Can you hear me, Ronald?

652
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:24,594
Professor?

653
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:25,862
It appears we merged

654
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,364
Properly on this attempt.

655
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,499
Wells was right about balance
and accepting.

656
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,634
Behind you!

657
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,107
Ronald, there's more of them.

658
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,492
Eiling, this ends now.

659
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,394
Yes, it does...

660
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:58,728
For both of you.

661
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,734
An ion grenade.

662
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,770
Just bombarded your cellular
structure with enough ions

663
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,473
To destabilize your matrix.

664
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:14,911
Mr. Raymond, Professor Stein,
you're both fine Americans.

665
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,514
Your country thanks you
for your sacrifice.

666
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,754
That was a lot of running.

667
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:38,135
Ronnie?

668
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,670
- Home?
- Yeah.

669
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,423
I think it looks worse
than it is.

670
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,197
Ronnie or Stein?

671
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,632
It's me, Cait.

672
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,300
Excuse me.

673
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:12,402
It's both of us.
Somehow.

674
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,037
She's quite lovely.

675
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,406
Acceptance is
a powerful thing.

676
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,008
Powerful enough to reverse it?

677
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,210
I'm game if you are,
Mr. Raymond.

678
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,078
We could try.

679
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:49,773
I think we're getting
the hang of this quite nicely.

680
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,555
It's okay.

681
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,857
I understand.
You have to go.

682
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,259
How'd you know?

683
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:12,462
I'm connected to you too.

684
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,243
Where will you go?

685
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,811
Pittsburgh, maybe.

686
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,312
Professor Stein has
a colleague he thinks

687
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:32,048
Can help us learn more
about our abilities.

688
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,617
We can help you here too.

689
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,552
Eiling has already breached
S.T.A.R. Labs.

690
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,754
We need to stay
one step ahead of him...

691
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,123
For all of us.

692
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,426
- I'm coming back.
- We'll have pizza.

693
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,703
Godspeed, Mr. Allen.

694
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,438
You too.

695
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,144
As to our earlier conversation,
I believe in second chances.

696
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,179
You'll get yours.

697
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:07,183
Give it time.

698
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,987
- Ready, Ronald?
- Please stop calling me that.

699
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,757
I'll see you soon.

700
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,713
We love you.

701
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,626
I had Ronnie,
then I lost him.

702
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:52,429
Then I found him again,
but he wasn't actually Ronnie.

703
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:56,333
Then I got him back but just for
a day until I lost him again.

704
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:59,636
You guys are like 10 seasons
of Ross and Rachel,

705
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:04,841
But just, like, smushed
into one year.

706
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,278
I am not heartbroken this time.

707
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,780
I love Ronnie.
I always will,

708
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:16,019
But there's not this
devastating hole inside me.

709
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:20,256
I have a life,
and it's a good one.

710
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:21,658
Hey, guys.

711
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,526
- Iris, hi.
- Hi.

712
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,562
Where is your cousin?

713
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,597
Uh, he went home.

714
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,233
Oh.
Uh, where was that again?

715
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:33,236
Uh, midway.

716
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:36,373
Oh, I thought you said
Coast City.

717
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:39,709
Uh, midway via Coast City.

718
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,911
He moved around a lot.

719
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,547
That's always really hard.

720
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,283
All right, well.
Enjoy.

721
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,352
- Bye.
- See you.

722
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,229
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

723
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,897
It means that I'm gonna
help you figure out

724
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,333
What's going on
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

725
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:06,503
I think our burning man
used to work there.

726
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,540
- Yo.
- Hey.

727
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,411
So why'd you bring me here?

728
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:17,180
I don't know how
and I don't know when,

729
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:19,015
But one day soon,
I'm gonna be

730
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,750
In this house again,

731
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,685
15 years ago.

732
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,454
And I'm gonna fail...

733
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,855
Unless this time, I don't.

734
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,524
What are you saying?

735
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:31,861
Knowing that I'm supposed
to lose gives me the advantage.

736
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:36,833
Those images are a lesson
in what not to do.

737
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:40,403
When I face off against
the man in yellow,

738
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:43,907
I won't make the
same mistake twice.

739
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,176
You're gonna...
Change the past?

740
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:49,312
Joe...
I'm gonna save my mom.

741
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,435
What... what the hell was that?

742
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,571
It's good to
see you again, General.

743
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,306
Who are you?

744
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,842
Who am I?

745
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,751
Harrison...
You're one of them.

746
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:30,854
A meta-human.

747
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,922
Yes, I am.

748
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,425
And I protect my own.

749
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,396
What was that?

750
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,932
Now, that...

751
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,567
Is an old friend of ours.

752
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:47,570
General...

753
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,839
That... Voice...

754
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:53,676
It's in my head.

755
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,677
Dear God.

756
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,114
Not God.
Grodd.

757
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,942
Greg, move your head.
