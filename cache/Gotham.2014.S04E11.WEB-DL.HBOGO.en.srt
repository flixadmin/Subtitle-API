1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,320
Harvey is weak.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,440
And how many more cops need to die
because of his incompetence?

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,440
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the captaincy of Gotham Central.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,160
Nothing in Gotham is free.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
You wanted a gangster
to help you get rid of Penguin.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,840
This is what that help looks like.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,520
The whole town has gone hog-wild
for the Pyg.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,960
Turns out the Pyg's real name
is Lazlo Valentine,

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,320
and he just escaped.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,560
I haven't been looking for a cure
for your brain, Ed.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,560
Because I was afraid
that if I told you the truth,

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,280
you would go back to being
who you were before.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,160
And I like who you've become.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,440
I took the dark path.

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
Yes, you did. And it's gonna
be a long, bumpy journey back.

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,480
What?

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,280
- Hello, Victor.
- Where's the boy?

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,880
Alive for now.

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,520
If Oswald wants to keep it that way,

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,920
he will meet me under
the Crown Point Bridge.

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,800
You wanted a war, you've got one!

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,680
We will wait for Mr. Cobblepot
to send instructions.

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,960
Hello.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,320
Where is Penguin, little man?

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,600
This is Gordon.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
I need forensics in West End Alley.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,600
Black market doc.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,800
Pyg was here,
looks like he got a new face.

31
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,440
So, Penguin's out building support
amongst the gangs.

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,960
Pretty soon every criminal in Gotham
is going to be hunting us.

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,760
He's out building support
because we made him look weak.

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,520
We kill him and all the gangs
will support me.

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,720
I'm still a Falcone.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,040
Yeah, you mentioned that
about a billion times.

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,720
He doesn't know where Penguin is.

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,280
What?

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
I'll be right there.

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,120
Is that about Penguin?

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,640
No.

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,960
Harper.

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,960
We were an hour outside of Gotham
when I got waylaid by Victor Zsasz.

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
He took Sofia, gave me this.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,360
I woke up in Virginia.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,120
Damn it. I had a deal with Penguin.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,240
There's more.

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,600
We're getting word Penguin
had some meeting

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,720
under the Crown Point Bridge
late last night.

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,520
Gunfire, a car blown up.

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,480
Sofia Falcone was there.

52
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
All right. We have to find Penguin.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
- Harper.
- I'm good, Cap.

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,000
Put out a city-wide BOLO.
I'll find Sofia.

55
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,600
What about the Pyg?
I heard he escaped from Arkham.

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,640
Tracked him
to a black market surgeon.

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
He's already got a new face.

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,520
Lazlo Valentine is gone.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,000
- But if we don't find him, what...
- Focus on the bigger problem.

60
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,920
We've got a war to stop, people.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,160
So, are you going to tell us
why we're in your dad's house?

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,520
Why do you think?

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
Sofia.

64
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,560
You look tired.

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,280
Miss Kean.
It's good to see you again.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,280
Likewise. So this is weird.

67
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,320
Why are you here, Father?

68
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,520
What did I tell you when you asked
to return to Gotham?

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,000
- I know...
- What did I tell you?

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,160
- That I wasn't ready.
- Exactly.

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,440
And you came back anyway.

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,520
Perhaps I should've acted then.

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,040
But I was indulgent, curious.

74
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,920
Who is this daughter I raised?

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,920
Father, Penguin is weak.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,280
If you help me, we can end this.

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
I don't want Gotham.

78
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,800
I don't believe that.
You love this city.

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,080
I used to, yes,

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,360
but I'm dying, Sofia.

81
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,920
Someone else can have Gotham.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,280
What I care about now is my family.

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,560
And I am your family and I want this.

84
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,360
I deserve this. Gotham belongs to me.

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,560
Your actions have disgraced
our family.

86
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,680
Tell me how sleeping with Jim Gordon,
the man who killed your brother,

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,240
helped reclaim Gotham.

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
I'm sorry. What?

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,520
I have done many things
I will have to answer for.

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,680
But I always knew the meaning
of honor.

91
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,480
You have proven that you do not.

92
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
Children...

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,800
they can be such disappointments.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,680
I kill him, and this is over. Please!

95
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,320
You know why I came
when Penguin called?

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
It's because you were going to lose.

97
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,240
If you were anyone but my daughter,
you'd be dead right now.

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,440
{\an5}<i>Come on. Here we go.</i>

99
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,840
{\an5}Oh, good morning.

100
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,760
{\an5}- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
- In there.

101
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,280
{\an5}Dear, oh, dear.

102
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,400
{\an5}Good morning, officer.
My name is Alfred Pennyworth.

103
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,520
{\an5}Neighbors called
in a noise complaint.

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,920
{\an5}He's all yours.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
{\an5}Thank you.

106
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
{\an5}Right.

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,440
{\an5}Well.

108
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,160
{\an5}Good morning, Master Bruce.

109
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,400
{\an5}God!

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,720
{\an5}I do believe the party's well
and truly over.

111
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
{\an5}Morning, miss.

112
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,680
{\an5}Good morning, miss.

113
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,120
{\an5}G.C.P.D.

114
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,040
{\an5}I'm looking for my daughter.

115
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,000
{\an5}You can stop.

116
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,800
{\an5}She's with me.

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,560
{\an5}Carmine, I didn't expect to see you.

118
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,000
{\an5}I imagine not I arrived this morning.

119
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,440
{\an5}- You heard Sofia's in danger.
- Was in danger.

120
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,120
{\an5}I made a deal with Cobblepot.

121
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,880
{\an5}I take her out of Gotham today,
and she lives.

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,760
{\an5}I made the same deal.
He didn't keep it.

123
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,080
{\an5}He will with me.

124
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,120
{\an5}I'm glad I never killed you.

125
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,760
{\an5}- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.

126
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,720
{\an5}Killing you would have been
a kindness.

127
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,560
{\an5}You've no idea what you've brought
to your city.

128
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,240
{\an5}I imagine when you find out the truth
it will destroy you.

129
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,120
That's a comfort.

130
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
Another day.

131
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,920
Another man sending me out of Gotham.

132
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,600
We're both just trying
to keep you alive.

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,120
Tell yourselves that.

134
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,440
But what I know is that neither
of you believed in me.

135
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,000
It could've been so different.

136
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,320
Good-bye, James Gordon.

137
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
I doubt we'll see each other again.

138
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,800
The sun never shines here.

139
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
Everything I did,
I did for your love.

140
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,320
But that doesn't matter, does it?

141
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,800
What matters is that after everything
you've done,

142
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,120
I still consider you my daughter.

143
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,480
That's enough.

144
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,520
Mother planted those roses.
She loved them.

145
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
I want to take one with me.

146
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,120
Get down!

147
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,720
<i>Gotham is still reeling</i>

148
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,320
<i>from the violent death
of Carmine Falcone three days ago.</i>

149
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,560
<i>Falcone ruled the Gotham underworld
for nearly 30 years.</i>

150
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,840
<i>No arrests have been made,
and a strange quiet...</i>

151
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,560
How was the night, Master Bruce?

152
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,840
There's a mess in the Rolls.

153
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
You'll need a bucket.

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,840
<i>...girding itself
for further violence.</i>

155
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,320
<i>Which many had attributed
to the Pax Penguina.</i>

156
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,800
<i>Indeed the Don's claim
to the throne of Gotham...</i>

157
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,120
He shouldn't have come back.

158
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,040
<i>...in most recent years,
by a new breed of criminal.</i>

159
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,560
<i>Leaving some to ask,
"Does Gotham still..."</i>

160
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,040
Yes, Victor?

161
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,280
You would've told me, right?

162
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
If you were gonna ice the old man.

163
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,360
Obviously!
Victor, I did not kill Don Falcone.

164
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,240
Well, everyone on the street thinks
you did.

165
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,800
So let them.

166
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,040
My hands are clean. You have my word.

167
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,400
<i>With Don Falcone's passing,</i>

168
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
<i>it is unknown how or indeed,
when the void of power</i>

169
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,480
<i>at the center of the city's
underworld will be filled.</i>

170
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,280
Sofia.

171
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,520
I came to the hospital.

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,240
I told them not to admit you.

173
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,520
I am truly sorry about your father.

174
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,320
You know it was Penguin.

175
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,480
And if I had evidence supporting that
I'd arrest him.

176
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,560
He is over there,
waiting to see my face and gloat.

177
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,640
He is a liar and a murderer
many times over.

178
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
But you need evidence.

179
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,120
I have to bury my father.

180
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,120
Excuse us.

181
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,840
Victor.

182
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
- Harvey.
- Jim.

183
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,640
Your leave is almost up.

184
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,280
Be good to have you back.

185
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,440
We'll see.

186
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,760
So why haven't you arrested
the little weasel?

187
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,800
Penguin still owns the judges.

188
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,400
If I arrest him,
and it's not rock solid, he'll walk.

189
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,480
So him whacking Falcone
and you sitting on your hands.

190
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,880
What good does that do?

191
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,400
It was Sofia who paid off the mayor
to make me captain.

192
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,080
I didn't ask her to.

193
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,520
Oh, well.

194
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,040
And pressing me to move on Penguin,
even before this.

195
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,560
I told you, didn't I?

196
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,000
That bill would come due.

197
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,320
I can't allow her to turn the G.C.P.D
into her own private army.

198
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,120
We've come too far.
This has to be by the book.

199
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,720
And forget Falcone.

200
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,520
Penguin's too smart to get nailed
for that anyway.

201
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,080
What do you mean?

202
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,680
Get him to do something
you can really bust him for.

203
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,040
And then yank his ass
off the street once and for all.

204
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
You're saying start a war.

205
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,560
I'm saying get him to start one.

206
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
You know he's gonna come for her.

207
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,640
I don't give a tinker's damn
about Sofia.

208
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,360
The way I see it, everything
that's happened down

209
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,360
to Don Falcone lying in that box,

210
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,720
comes from you deciding months ago
to go after Penguin.

211
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,720
This is all on you.

212
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,760
So finish what you started.

213
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,080
Goodbye, old friend.

214
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,760
I will not forget all
that you taught me.

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I had great respect for your father.

216
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,160
Once he's in the ground, you...

217
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,360
Excuse me.

218
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,360
Not here!

219
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,520
What are you doing, Jim?

220
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,120
Finishing what I started.

221
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,720
There you, get back.

222
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
- Stop.
- All right. All right.

223
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,080
Testing. Testing. One, two, three.

224
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,760
James Gordon!

225
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,320
James Gordon?

226
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,280
What do you want, Oswald?

227
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,160
You know what I want. Where is she?

228
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,760
No.

229
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,520
You're seriously going
to go to war for her?

230
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,120
I'm upholding the law.

231
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,120
No one gets to decide who lives
or dies in Gotham.

232
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,520
Can you not see, Jim,

233
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,200
she has manipulated you,
lied to you...

234
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,960
The law is the law.

235
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,080
Now either get over it,

236
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,520
or face the consequences.

237
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
Let's try it this way.

238
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,040
Sofia Falcone is in this building.

239
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,160
Whoever brings her to me
will be richly rewarded.

240
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
I'm going to count to five.

241
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,160
Count as much as you want, twerp.

242
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,360
Yeah, we don't work for you.

243
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,760
This man is asking you to risk your
lives to protect a gangster!

244
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,800
I am offering you money, huh?

245
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,680
And bonus, no one gets killed!

246
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,920
- Hey, Captain, can we?
- Sure.

247
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,480
- All right. Come on.
- Get off of me!

248
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,800
Blood will run, Jim! Mark my words!

249
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,440
Blood will run!

250
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
And it will be on your head!

251
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Get on that way!

252
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,720
Shut your beak.

253
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,640
- Enjoy the trip.
- Yeah.

254
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,640
From the first day
I put on the badge,

255
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,480
I was told things
could never change.

256
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,400
Gotham was corrupt.

257
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,080
G.C.P.D. was corrupt.

258
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Criminals and low lives ran things.

259
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,480
You just showed me different.

260
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,280
Penguin will be coming.

261
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,880
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.

262
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,720
Suit up!

263
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,400
Let's move, move, move!

264
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,960
Take them out.

265
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,240
Just let us go.

266
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,520
You obviously got your hands full.

267
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,000
Shut up!

268
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,360
Whatever.
They'll all be dead in a few minutes.

269
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,080
Listen, you stupid...

270
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,600
<i>Drop your weapons and come outside
with your hands up...</i>

271
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>Screw you, copper!</i>

272
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,360
More left.

273
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,040
She means your left.

274
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,360
Then say that.

275
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,760
Your left! Your left! Your left!

276
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,120
Yay, teamwork!

277
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,520
Penguin thugs in Cell Two.

278
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,760
- You're winning.
- So far.

279
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,320
But every gang in Gotham owes
Penguin allegiance.

280
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,000
I can't arrest them all.

281
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,480
So arrest Penguin,
wasn't that the point?

282
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,320
As long as he's using proxies,
he's protected.

283
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,400
I have to keep pressing him.

284
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,880
When his back's against the wall,

285
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,600
he'll do something
he can't take back or explain.

286
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,840
And then I'll have him.

287
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,760
So you're baiting him into committing
a public atrocity.

288
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,160
What if he already has?

289
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,000
There's this boy from my orphanage.
Martin.

290
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,120
Oswald cared for him.

291
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,200
I hid him away for his safety

292
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,000
but Oswald forced me into telling
him where Martin was,

293
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,720
and then put him in a car
and blew it up.

294
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,880
Why didn't you tell me this before?

295
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
Because I'm his enemy.
Who's going to believe me?

296
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,240
Also, I didn't see him plant
the bomb.

297
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,040
- So you have nothing.
- I didn't say that.

298
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,560
Oswald never understood the way
people cared for my father.

299
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,520
And one of those people
just called me.

300
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
How is Jim Gordon beating us?

301
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,200
Well, every cop in Gotham
is behind him.

302
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,120
I'm guessing he has great
leadership skills.

303
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,600
Victor, when this is said and done,

304
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,680
you and I need to have a frank
discussion about chain of command.

305
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
But now go do something horrific!

306
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,480
Show the G.C.P.D. exactly...

307
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,240
Oswald Cobblepot!

308
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,840
You're under arrest.

309
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,320
Have you completely lost your mind?

310
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,800
Nobody has to die.
We only want Cobblepot.

311
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,760
Well, see, Jim, that's a problem
as they work for me.

312
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,400
But, just so I know,
what's the charge?

313
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
Murder.

314
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
Enough! Enough!

315
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,280
I did not kill Don Falcone!

316
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,960
And I dare you to prove otherwise!

317
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,920
It's not for Falcone.

318
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,520
I'm arresting you for the murder
of the boy you blew up

319
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,440
under the Crown Point Bridge.

320
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,000
What's so funny?

321
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Nothing.

322
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,760
Well, everything, actually,
because, because you see...

323
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,720
He's not dead!

324
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,000
I only faked his death,

325
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,440
so that Sofia Falcone
couldn't use him against me.

326
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,080
She's the one who told you
I killed him, isn't she?

327
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,360
Then where is he?

328
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,360
He... I don't know.

329
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,600
Victor took him out of Gotham.
Tell him.

330
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,200
What's to tell?

331
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,080
You blew that kid sky high.

332
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,600
What?

333
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,080
You sent that pipsqueak
to Kingdom come.

334
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,840
No.

335
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,200
That's not true.

336
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,920
And I'll testify to that.

337
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,080
- What?
- Look.

338
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,560
I ain't taking the rap
for no kid murder.

339
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,440
- Hey, hey.
- Get him out of here!

340
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,760
You are a liar!

341
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,080
You are a lying traitor!

342
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,120
Victor Zsasz is a liar!

343
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,960
No! I will kill you! Traitor!

344
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,560
This...

345
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
doesn't give you a free pass,
you know?

346
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,080
Jim...

347
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,440
not now.

348
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,880
You did it, Cap. You won.

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,680
So I'm guessing Gordon doesn't know
the kid's actually alive.

350
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
Jim Gordon played his part.

351
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,800
He showed the underworld
that Penguin was weak.

352
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,920
That he did.

353
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,840
End of the day...

354
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
he's a Cobblepot.

355
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,000
You're a Falcone.

356
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,040
Smile, ladies.

357
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,120
It's a new day.

358
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,600
So, Sofia was as good as her word.

359
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,840
We got our club back.

360
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,760
Yippee. We get to serve drinks again.

361
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,600
It's just a base of operations.

362
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,200
But I am meeting with the designer
later to make it less...

363
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Penguiny.

364
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,760
Have fun.

365
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,120
Music to soothe the savage beast?

366
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,040
Something like that.

367
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
Alfred!

368
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,800
Oh, the front page up.

369
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,680
Didn't expect you to brave the light
of day for a couple more hours,

370
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
Master B.

371
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,760
Tommy wanted to go
to the horse races.

372
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,360
What's all this?

373
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,160
It's a little project of mine.

374
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,840
I like to call it,
"Operation Save Bruce Wayne."

375
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,640
Switzerland.

376
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,960
Few months up in the Alps,
you'll be tickety-boo.

377
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
Are you going to kidnap me?

378
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,240
No, I'm going to appeal
to your better angels.

379
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,000
And if that doesn't work,
I shall beg.

380
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,240
Please, Master Bruce.

381
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,480
If for no other reason, do it for me.

382
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,040
These past weeks, you know how much
I've thought about Ra's Al Ghul?

383
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
About my parents?

384
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
Not at all, Alfred.

385
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,760
All you're offering me is pain.

386
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,280
Well, there is no life without pain.

387
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,720
There's no love, there's no joy.

388
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't know about that,
I'm having a fair amount of joy.

389
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,960
A bloody miserable is what you are,
I mean, I can see it.

390
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,240
Alfred, I know you care about me.

391
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,960
But I'm asking you
to stop what you're doing.

392
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,080
I'm not who you thought I was.

393
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm not who my parents
might've wanted me to be.

394
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,520
- And I'm okay with that!
- I'm not okay with it.

395
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,440
- And I don't I believe it.
- And that's your problem!

396
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,200
Now I'm gonna go meet Tommy.

397
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,760
I can't let you do that,
Master Bruce.

398
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,480
You're going to stop me?

399
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,960
If need to be, yes.

400
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,120
You really think you can?

401
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,320
Oh, I know I can.

402
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,840
I just don't want you to make me try.

403
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,720
Well...

404
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,120
Don't do this, Master Bruce.

405
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,080
No, Alfred, we're doing this.

406
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,760
Getting slow, Master Bruce.

407
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,400
You haven't been training,
have you, son?

408
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,720
- Got a bit of ring rust.
- Really?

409
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,760
Because you're the only one
breathing hard, old man.

410
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,600
Stop it, will you!

411
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,120
Stop it!

412
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
- Stop it.
- Fine.

413
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,560
All right.

414
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,800
Fine.

415
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,680
Oh, no. Master Bruce, I'm so sorry.
I didn't...

416
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
I don't know what came over me,
mate.

417
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,760
I am in control!

418
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,520
I am in control!

419
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,280
Me, Ed Nygma.

420
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,560
But why would you want that?

421
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,080
You don't understand.

422
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,400
We had so much fun when we were me.

423
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, no.

424
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,320
Tell me it's not that.

425
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,520
Not what?

426
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,800
I leave when spurned.
I give all. I take nothing.

427
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,400
I can raise you to a king
or make you to a beggar.

428
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,680
What am I?

429
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,640
Okay, I'm just gonna tell you
because you're not going to get it.

430
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,440
- "Love."
- I am in control!

431
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,960
You're in love with Lee Thompkins.
You pathetic loser.

432
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,320
Shut up!

433
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,200
Ed angry at mirror?

434
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,560
No, Grundy,
I'm not angry at the mirror.

435
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,040
Ed angry at...

436
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,520
- Ed?
- That is...

437
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,080
surprisingly perceptive.

438
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,320
I need some air.

439
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,080
<i>This was the end of Solomon Grundy</i>

440
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,040
<i>This was the end of Solomon Grundy</i>

441
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,080
<i>This was the end of Solomon Grundy</i>

442
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,320
Where is Grundy?

443
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,680
I kidnapped you.

444
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,120
For the record, you're not light.

445
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,000
What pretty lady want?

446
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,640
When we were fighting,
you called me, "Tabby," remember?

447
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,720
Grundy want to go back to friend Ed.

448
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,280
Ed.

449
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,280
Right, your friend.

450
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,840
Well, your best friend, Ed, tied you
and me to chairs,

451
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,680
electrocuted you,
and cut off my hand.

452
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,400
Look at the scar. Ring a bell?

453
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,080
Remember me, Butch.

454
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,400
I'm Tabby.

455
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm your Tabby.

456
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,040
Grundy sorry.

457
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,800
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

458
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,800
Before, when you said my name,
I'd just hit you in the head.

459
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,440
Maybe that's the only way.

460
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,240
So you're gonna remember me, Butch.

461
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
Or I'm gonna beat your head in.

462
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,640
Pretty lady.

463
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
When I called,
I wasn't sure you'd come.

464
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,800
I was going to anyway.
We need to talk.

465
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,800
I agree.

466
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,080
I'm going to ask you not to do what
you're about to do.

467
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,480
Which is?

468
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,960
Unify the gangs.

469
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,840
Put the Falcones back in charge
of the underworld.

470
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,120
But wasn't that our deal?

471
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,840
I'd replace Penguin.
You'd be the law, I'd be the order?

472
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,360
No. And if you try and take over,
I will have to come after you.

473
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,760
James.

474
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,840
You're nothing if not predictable.

475
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,800
Now I think it's time you heard
my proposal.

476
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm not interested.

477
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,280
I think you are.

478
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,760
Surprise.

479
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,040
I know.

480
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,240
You thought I'd have a different face
because I killed that doctor.

481
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,160
That was just to throw you
off the scent.

482
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,200
That's not why he's surprised, Lazlo.

483
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,160
Can I tell him?

484
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,040
You came to this beautiful woman
because you had a problem.

485
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,520
A Penguin problem.

486
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,240
Pax Penguina was gonna last.

487
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
But Sofia had an idea.

488
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,400
I'd heard of a contract killer

489
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
that was impersonating serial
killers. So...

490
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,840
What if there was a killer?

491
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,920
Real vicious son of a bitch,

492
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,840
hunting the police,
all slice and dice?

493
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,360
I needed the police to turn
on Penguin.

494
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,560
I knew a few cops would have to die.

495
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,920
So you sent this monster to my city?

496
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,640
I let him improvise.

497
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,360
I'll admit.

498
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,600
I'm a little carried away with
the whole cooking folks routine.

499
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,240
I really got into the role.

500
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,560
Now, only hiccup was
that mess with her daddy.

501
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,600
That was you.

502
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,440
I gave him a chance, Jim.

503
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,080
And if he would've shown
one iota of appreciation

504
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,240
for everything I have done
for this family, for him...

505
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,720
he would be alive.

506
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,800
But I saw you shot.

507
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,440
There was another shooter there.

508
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,240
I had to do something to throw off
suspicion.

509
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,600
She wasn't about
to get herself plugged

510
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,880
by a bunch of yahoos in a car.

511
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,080
It was some pretty shooting,
if I do say so.

512
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,240
I missed all her vital parts.

513
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,280
I want you in jail.

514
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,400
And this time it's Blackgate.
You're gonna rot in there.

515
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,760
Jimmy, just...

516
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,760
That's done now.

517
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,400
My father had his moment of truth.
This is yours.

518
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,080
How many cops died under
the Pax Penguina?

519
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Not one.

520
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,080
It was you who couldn't stomach it.

521
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,200
It was you who came
to the Falcones for help.

522
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,560
There is a direct line
from your decision

523
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,120
to a dozen police officers
who have been brutally murdered.

524
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,800
You're insane.

525
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,080
Why not just kill me?

526
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,480
Because, Jim, I need you
at the head of the G.C.P.D.

527
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
- I need...
- Someone you can control.

528
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,200
You've been planning this
since the day we first met.

529
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,280
This isn't about Gotham.
This is revenge.

530
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,760
For me killing Mario.

531
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,240
You want to arrest me, arrest me.

532
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,800
But I will talk.

533
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,880
And the cops that died,

534
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,200
the friend that you betrayed,
will all have been for nothing.

535
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,000
The G.C.P.D. will crumble.

536
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,480
Penguin, or someone worse,
will take over.

537
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,800
And you will lose Gotham, forever.

538
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,320
Or...

539
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,240
take on this sin as your own.

540
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,560
Keep the G.C.P.D.

541
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,440
Let them think you're a hero.

542
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,560
But live knowing who you are,
what you've done.

543
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,240
That is my revenge.

544
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,800
<i>G.C.P.D.</i>

545
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,320
<i>G.C.P.D. How can I help you?</i>

546
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,760
<i>Hello, anyone there? Anybody?</i>

547
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,800
This is Gordon.

548
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,680
I'm at Sofia Falcone's.

549
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,600
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

550
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,480
Oh, thank Christ! You're safe.

551
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,960
Master Bruce, listen to me.

552
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,560
I don't want to fight anymore.

553
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,640
You win.

554
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,880
If this is how you want to deal with

555
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,360
what you've been going through,
then so be it.

556
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,080
I'm not gonna try and stop you.

557
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,360
But just know this.

558
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,040
you will remember who you are,
and when you do,

559
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,360
I will be right here.

560
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,680
No. You won't be.

561
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,720
I went to my lawyer and had him draw
up emancipation papers.

562
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,960
You're no longer my legal guardian.

563
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,160
I won't sign them.

564
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,360
You don't have to.

565
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,800
Now I'm going out.

566
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,280
If you're still here when I get back,

567
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,440
I'll go to the police
and show them my face.

568
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,640
- Master Bruce, please...
- Alfred, you're fired!

569
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,280
Now get the hell out of my house!

570
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,880
Butch!

571
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,080
Say something!

572
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,640
Say something.

573
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,240
I'm sorry.

574
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,720
I tried.

575
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,680
Harvey.

576
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,960
Was just dropping something off.

577
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,160
Oh, I heard you got the Pyg.

578
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,600
- And Penguin.
- Yeah.

579
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,440
So everything turned out well.

580
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,960
You didn't even need me.

581
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,680
You got a second? Could we...

582
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,440
They...

583
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,320
They believe in you.

584
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,360
Don't let them down.

585
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,880
What the hell happened to me?

586
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,760
True, I was...

587
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,480
Every single one of them!

588
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,920
Because of her! I will kill her!

589
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,400
I will flay her alive!

590
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,360
Her and Gordon and Zsasz! And...

591
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,120
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

592
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,880
Do not talk to me, you...

593
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,320
<i>I get it, pal.</i>

594
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,560
<i>This place is full of loonies.</i>

595
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,800
<i>I just thought,
we could help each other out.</i>

596
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,160
And how can you help me?

597
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:32,200
<i>Well, not to toot my own horn,
but I'm a very resourceful fellow.</i>

598
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,720
<i>So, toot.</i>

599
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,840
<i>Toot, toot.</i>

600
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,840
I know that laugh.

601
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,960
What do you say, pal?
I'll be your best friend.

602
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,800
Give me a smile.
