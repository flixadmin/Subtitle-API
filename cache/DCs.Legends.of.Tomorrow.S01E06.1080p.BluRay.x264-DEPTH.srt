1
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:04,547
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:07,092
<i>an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:09,594
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,012
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,932
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,850
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,061
<i>by the body I had sworn my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:19,562
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:22,023
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,525
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:26,611
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:30,865
<i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,469
We're in the Temporal Zone,
I don't understand.

14
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:34,619
No one should be able to--

15
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:36,287
<i>A scan of the vessel suggests</i>

16
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:38,206
<i>that it is the bounty hunter Chronos.</i>

17
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:43,461
We're crash landing.

18
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:46,256
In both place and time.

19
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:00,395
<i>Gideon, camouflage the ship.</i>

20
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:02,122
This doesn't look like
the type of place

21
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,815
we want to linger out in the open.

22
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:09,988
That looks a lot
like a Palmer Tech building,

23
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,157
<i>but why does it have a Smoak logo on it?</i>

24
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,702
Wait, this is Star City.

25
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,829
I thought you said the timeline was safe.

26
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:21,332
Yes, Star City was intact in 2016.

27
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:25,003
This... This is 2046.

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,425
Don't move.

29
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,012
- Thank God.
- I said, don't move.

30
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:38,308
It's me. It's Sara.

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,853
Hey, Oliver, look.
I know it's been a long time,

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,772
but don't you remember that Rip Hunter

33
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,565
recruited us to become Legends?

34
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,278
I never heard of any Legends.

35
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,203
Get back!

36
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,045
This guy a friend of yours?
I don't like him.

37
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,843
- What are you doing?
- It's called shooting back.

38
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,220
This can't be the Green Arrow.

39
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,642
That's not Oliver Queen.

40
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,063
Sure dresses like him.

41
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,234
Shoots arrows like him.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,212
Well, whoever he is,
I don't plan on sticking around

43
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,596
to get shish-kebabed by this dude.

44
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,491
Kid's right.
Let's stay behind and kill him.

45
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,954
We need to return to the ship!

46
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,346
All right, Rip,
tell us the truth.

47
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,765
You've all seen how
the timeline is malleable,

48
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,433
in flux until it is set.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,104
Well, this future is not set.

50
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,286
Remember when I told you it was dangerous

51
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,516
for any of you to know too much
about your own futures?

52
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,528
Well, the events that you dread
could very well come to be

53
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,321
due to your actions to prevent them.

54
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,615
You know what I think?
I think you think too much.

55
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:18,822
Believe me when I tell you

56
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,110
that the best thing for
yourselves and for this mission

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,997
is to make the repairs
to the <i>Waverider</i> here in 2046,

58
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,790
then head back to your own time

59
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,751
and make sure that
none of this ever comes to be.

60
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,674
It looks like the whole
propulsion system is jacked.

61
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,277
How do you even know
what we're looking at here?

62
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,654
Doesn't matter if it takes you
down the road or through time,

63
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:39,971
an engine's still an engine.

64
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,765
How long will it take you
to make repairs?

65
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,252
I'm not too sure, but it would go

66
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,852
a lot faster if I had some help.

67
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,478
Maybe Kendra could lend me a hand?

68
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,523
Enlist whoever is free to help.
I have this to contend with.

69
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,233
This is the neuromorphic interface

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,040
for Gideon's logic and navigation matrix.

71
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,696
Without it, Gideon cannot function.

72
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,757
Well, that explains how we got
stranded here in the future.

73
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,261
Palmer Tech was working on
a self-learning neuromorphic cortex.

74
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,166
<i>They surely would've
gone to prototype by 2046.</i>

75
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:04,996
We are gonna need that prototype.

76
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,599
Oh, Palmer Tech is now
Smoak Technologies,

77
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,124
but I'm sure I can still get us in.

78
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,209
As I said, we must keep you and Ms. Lance

79
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,520
separate from your future homes.

80
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:12,545
In any case,

81
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,672
there's a reason
why I recruited individuals

82
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:17,300
adept at misappropriating
others' property.

83
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,221
It's not money, it's not jewels,
it's not a valuable artifact.

84
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,474
You're just lucky I'd steal
anything right about now.

85
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,976
- As I suspected.
- We'll get your gizmo.

86
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,395
You just get this bucket flying again.

87
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,773
- I'm coming with.
- No. No, you are not.

88
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,900
You're too emotionally
connected to this city.

89
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,361
- We've been over this--
- I'm over you.

90
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,987
You've got us on a mission

91
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,594
to change the timeline for yourself,

92
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,908
and you won't even let us
look at our futures?

93
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,577
Now, I know this city
better than anyone else

94
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:47,038
and you're going to need me out there.

95
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,832
So, either I'm coming with,

96
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,668
or we can find out if the Time Masters

97
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,354
are as good at teaching people to fight

98
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,879
as the League of Assassins.

99
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:04,097
So, the rest of the team's on
a field trip to Palmer Tech,

100
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,224
now Smoak Technologies.

101
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,309
Palmer Tech sounds better,
right? Be honest.

102
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,812
Honestly, they sound about the same.

103
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,772
Even assuming our compatriots return

104
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,190
with a neuromorphic prototype,

105
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:16,859
we'll still need to prepare
Gideon for the new device.

106
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,696
And the engines could
definitely use some loving.

107
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,864
Actually, I could use
an extra pair of hands.

108
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,711
Oh, Raymond, why don't you
and Ms. Saunders

109
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,781
continue repairing Gideon?

110
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,995
And I'll assist Jefferson
with the engines.

111
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,503
If this is just
a potential future,

112
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,839
it doesn't matter
if we kill anyone here, right?

113
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,508
Well, to avoid the risk of a paradox,

114
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,846
it's probably best
to refrain from killing anyone.

115
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,015
I'm not gonna promise anything.

116
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,935
My sister's apartment
used to be over here.

117
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,104
I seem to remember
something about your father

118
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,605
being a police captain?

119
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,357
Your point?

120
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,609
He did one hell of a job.

121
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,612
My father, and everyone else,

122
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,614
would never have let this happen.

123
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,367
Unless they were all dead.

124
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:12,856
You really are pretty good at this.

125
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,960
Yeah, I was a shipyard welder in 1944.

126
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,130
No way! A real-life Rosie the Riveter?

127
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:22,109
<i>Is there anything</i>

128
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,218
<i>you can't manage
to put a positive spin on?</i>

129
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,386
<i>Uh...</i>

130
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,681
<i>I've got it! DMV.</i>

131
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,309
<i>So you do have a dark side.</i>

132
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:32,810
Are you making fun of me?

133
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,312
A little bit.

134
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:40,109
Doesn't mean I don't find your
unwavering optimism enjoyable.

135
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,279
<i>I find watching you weld enjoyable.</i>

136
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,949
Dr. Palmer, in case you weren't aware,

137
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,493
you are on an open channel

138
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,299
and we can hear everything you're saying.

139
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,581
Is it too much to ask for some
professionalism around here?

140
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,250
Why am I getting so upset?

141
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,108
<i>One moment, please.</i>

142
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,174
I'm not upset. You're upset.

143
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,342
No, I'm not.

144
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,677
My elevated blood pressure
confirms that you are.

145
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:10,139
I'm just...
I'm just getting annoyed

146
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,726
that those two are talking
instead of working. I mean...

147
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,872
- You like her.
- Dude, you're being crazy.

148
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:20,024
You do remember that we
share a psychic connection.

149
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,567
I can sense what you're feeling--

150
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,128
If that were true, then you would shut up.

151
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:26,823
Hey, it's no day at the beach
for me, either. Believe me.

152
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,535
It doesn't matter 'cause I don't
stand a chance with her anyway.

153
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,828
Now, why would you say that?

154
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,955
Because right now, my competition is

155
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,249
a billionaire genius
who built his own super-suit

156
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,543
and some other dude
she's known for 4,000 years

157
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,253
who she's destined to be with.

158
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,921
If I may offer one word of advice--

159
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,168
I really wish you wouldn't.

160
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,883
That word would be "confidence."

161
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,138
You've met my younger self.

162
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,390
I was quite the ladies' man.

163
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,476
Put yourself out there.

164
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,979
Good things will happen.

165
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,777
Palmer Tech's just two blocks up this way.

166
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,362
At least it used to be.

167
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,517
Take cover in there!

168
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,474
It's like World War III out there.

169
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,833
It's beautiful!

170
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,094
We need to find another route.

171
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:48,821
Ms. Lance, don't.

172
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,740
Sara! Damn it!

173
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,201
You two, don't move. We'll be right back.

174
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,619
Right.

175
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,065
We're not gonna sit here, right?

176
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,956
Imagine all the looting
we can do in this chaos.

177
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,541
Or we stretch our legs at that bank

178
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,376
we passed three blocks back.

179
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,807
Drop your weapons,
and hand over your wallets.

180
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,143
Wait, are you actually trying to mug us?

181
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,479
What is this, amateur hour?

182
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,439
If you don't do what my man says,

183
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,442
we're gonna crush you into the
pavement like a couple of ants.

184
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,902
Really?

185
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,738
What do you say
we teach these fellas a lesson?

186
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,031
Yeah.

187
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,251
That's what you get when
you don't follow directions.

188
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,586
Interesting. Hold this.

189
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,259
On second thought...

190
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,721
Where'd ya get that?

191
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,431
eBay.

192
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,939
Now, your boss will not be needing this.

193
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,488
Well, this has been fun,
but I think it's time to leave.

194
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,948
"Leave"?

195
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,284
Why would we leave?

196
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,668
Come on, sweetheart.

197
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,515
Don't move.

198
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,144
You.

199
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,729
You are persistent.

200
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,689
I saw you get shot point-blank.

201
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,026
It's high-density Kevlar.
Now, who the hell are you?

202
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,986
- Who are you?
- I'm the Green Arrow.

203
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,572
Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

204
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,743
No, he's not. Oliver Queen is dead.

205
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,499
How did Oliver die?

206
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,085
I don't know. No one does.

207
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:12,256
No one's seen him since...
Well, since the Uprising.

208
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,466
Uprising?

209
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,926
<i>It's just what people called it when...</i>

210
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,595
Well, when all this happened.

211
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,972
15 years ago, he brought an army with him.

212
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,932
Who brought an army?

213
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,100
I did.

214
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,689
No. It's not possible.

215
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,950
How did you get off Lian Yu?

216
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,037
Say something, damn it!

217
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,791
Ms. Lance? Who is this?

218
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,584
Somebody very dangerous.

219
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,437
Then now is not the right time
for me to say it,

220
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,742
but please remind me later
to tell you that I told you so.

221
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,965
How are you still alive, Slade?

222
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,342
Slade.

223
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,389
That's a name
I haven't heard in a long time.

224
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,106
How do you know my father?

225
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,109
He called you Ms. Lance.

226
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,821
Any relation to the late Captain Lance?

227
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,408
If so, you must have heard
stories about my father.

228
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,243
I knew your father.

229
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,453
He was insane.

230
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,872
Seems to run in the family.

231
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,792
I'm going to enjoy killing you.

232
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,045
Or we will!

233
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,094
Okay, bad idea.

234
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,346
Come on!

235
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,810
All right.

236
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,187
Grey and I have got
the mains back online.

237
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,356
Great. Uh, Ray's working on something

238
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,733
called the quantum manifold. Eh...

239
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,529
I can't seem to get this to cooperate.

240
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,781
Let me give it a try.

241
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,787
Hey, you actually seem to know
what you're doing here.

242
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,873
Well, yeah, machines are kinda my thing.

243
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,083
Plus, I've been looking
at the instruction manual

244
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,334
in my downtime, so...

245
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,438
Most people can't
follow the instructions

246
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,582
to build their new bookcase,

247
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,441
and here you are working on a spaceship.

248
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:20,885
A time-traveling spaceship
from the future, no less.

249
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,804
Well, when you put it like that,
I am kinda amazing.

250
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,764
And humble.

251
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,684
Hey. If you ever have any bookcases

252
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,011
that need putting together...

253
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,103
I'll know who to call.

254
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,902
So, Raymond.

255
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,530
When you were working
with Kendra earlier,

256
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,242
I couldn't help but notice there
might have been a little spark.

257
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,036
Really?

258
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,371
Oh, yes.
It was quite apparent.

259
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,748
And if I'm not mistaken,

260
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:53,876
I've noticed her throwing
one or two glances your way.

261
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,086
- Huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

262
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,964
- That's surprising.
- Is it?

263
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,132
Well, yeah.

264
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,010
I don't know. I hadn't really
considered her in that way.

265
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,515
Why are you bringing this up?

266
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,642
Geez, I feel like
I'm back in high school.

267
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,436
I honestly wouldn't know.
I skipped tenth grade.

268
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,604
And eleventh.

269
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:16,232
I haven't really spent
that much time with Kendra.

270
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,734
Other than time that we shared with her

271
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,194
<i>and her reincarnated soulmate,</i>

272
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,238
or people trying to kill us.

273
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:26,617
All the more reason
to avoid personal attachments.

274
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,788
The ship may be large,
but our group is small.

275
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:32,540
Hmm.

276
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,376
Yeah. Preaching to the choir, Professor.

277
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:40,047
We're aboard the <i>Waverider</i>
to save the world, not hook up.

278
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,675
Yes. Quite right.

279
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,229
Hey, you!

280
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,982
I'm terrible with names.
I'm gonna call you Fonzie.

281
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,067
- Yeah!
- And call you Kenickie.

282
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:02,486
- Yeah!
- Anyone else here need a name?

283
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:06,115
Your Highness, can I get
a moment of your time, please?

284
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,491
Sure.

285
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,870
Isn't the future great?

286
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,748
We really should be
getting back to Rip and Sara.

287
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,916
Why?

288
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,128
Because I'm not looking to
put down roots here.

289
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,839
Why not? It's everything
we've ever wanted.

290
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,633
I've got a gang that does
everything I tell 'em to.

291
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,135
I've got a fur coat.

292
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,304
I've got a chalice.

293
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,471
Speaking of...

294
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,683
What about stopping Savage?

295
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,102
What about it? You were the one who said

296
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,021
we're in this for the score, remember?

297
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,897
We could live like kings here.

298
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,191
No cops, no heroes.

299
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,319
Just some fool in a green hoodie.

300
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,987
It's Christmas every day.

301
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,656
Ah. My sweets.

302
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,666
Slade had a son?

303
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,086
Look, Oliver tried.

304
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,714
He tried to raise an army
to fight Deathstroke, but...

305
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,884
Look, everyone just wanted to evacuate.

306
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,845
How can you save a city
that doesn't want to be saved?

307
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,848
A moment.

308
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,326
Sara, I know what you must be thinking,

309
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,350
but none of what has
transpired here is your fault.

310
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,312
Nor do you have the means to change it.

311
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,065
But Vandal Savage's future is preventable.

312
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:26,820
I implore you, please,
stay focused on our mission.

313
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,760
We're very grateful for your assistance,

314
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:34,024
but we really must be moving
along to Smoak Technologies.

315
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,914
What for? That place
has been cleared out for years.

316
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:40,084
But a lot of Felicity Smoak's
projects got relocated.

317
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,502
Where?

318
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,629
Come on.

319
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,179
You didn't say that Felicity's
equipment would be here.

320
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,724
Well, where else did you think it'd be?

321
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:14,785
Mr. Queen's base of operations

322
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,620
appears to have seen better days.

323
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,331
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

324
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,291
The place got attacked

325
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,877
after Grant Wilson
outed Queen as the Green Arrow.

326
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,176
Let's just find what we're
looking for and get out of here.

327
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,141
<i>Whoever's there, get out!</i>

328
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,684
<i>I said, get out!</i>

329
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,312
Whoever you are, get out.

330
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,525
Oliver?

331
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,449
Hello, Sara.

332
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,827
Long time no see.

333
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,003
- Is that...
<i>- Oliver Queen.</i>

334
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,923
Everyone thinks that you're dead.

335
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,341
They're not wrong.

336
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,012
Put the arrow down, John.
You're embarrassing yourself.

337
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,015
- John?
- John Diggle, Jr.

338
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,689
My dad is dead
because I couldn't save him.

339
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,358
I don't deserve his name.

340
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,569
I'm Connor Hawke.

341
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,945
So, you won't take his name,

342
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,616
but it's all right to parade
around in someone else's outfit?

343
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,117
Well, someone has to.

344
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,038
Because the last time that
I checked, you were dead.

345
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,207
Everyone thought you were dead.

346
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,377
I've been trying to
hold this city by myself

347
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,047
because I thought you were gone.

348
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,721
What happened to you?

349
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:02,309
To Laurel, to my dad, Felicity--

350
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,395
They're gone. All of them.

351
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,730
What do you mean?

352
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,067
- Ollie--
- They're gone.

353
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,945
<i>What do you want me to say, Sara?</i>

354
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:16,740
30 years ago, you and Ray
hopped on a spaceship

355
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,951
and you never came back.

356
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,118
We will.

357
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,454
I don't want to say that

358
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,039
things would have ended differently

359
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,646
if you and Ray had been here, but...

360
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,671
But if we were,
it could've made the difference.

361
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,589
If you thought I was dead,
what are you doing here?

362
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,925
We were looking
for a neuromorphic prototype

363
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,760
that Felicity Smoak was working on.

364
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,847
Felicity left after everything
that happened.

365
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,349
<i>Everything her company was working on</i>

366
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,185
is being kept in a warehouse
at Adams and O'Neil.

367
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,272
The entry code is 4-5-8-7.

368
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,608
- Thank you, Mr. Queen--
- You found your way in.

369
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,193
Find your way out.

370
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,452
I gotta admit,
that wasn't bad advice, Grey.

371
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,246
So, things went well with Ms. Saunders?

372
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,414
Oh, yeah.

373
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,701
Well, I have more good news.

374
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,626
I was able to very subtly confirm

375
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,421
that Raymond has no romantic inclinations

376
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,965
towards your crush object.

377
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,301
Okay, well, once we've
sorted out my love life,

378
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,469
we need to update your vocabulary.

379
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,929
Can't wait.

380
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,256
I'm gonna go check on Kendra.

381
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,932
- Hey, confidence.
- Yeah.

382
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,854
I got the inertial dampeners back online.

383
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,457
Once the rest of the team returns
with the neuromorphic prototype,

384
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,649
Gideon will be good to go.

385
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,985
Excellent. The sooner
we get out of here, the better.

386
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,320
And thank you, by the way.

387
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,487
Whatever for?

388
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,822
Well, until you mentioned it,

389
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,909
I hadn't really thought
about Kendra in that way.

390
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,159
Because, you know,

391
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,726
she and Carter were destined
to be together in this lifetime.

392
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,331
But it's all changed.

393
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:51,543
And, you know, she's quirky,
and funny, and beautiful,

394
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:53,378
and a pretty good welder.

395
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,796
So, you know,

396
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:58,383
what about all those things
we were talking about?

397
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,427
- The mission and so forth.
- Oh...

398
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,472
We're all adults here, right?

399
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,224
Getting to know each other
a little bit better,

400
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,235
it's not gonna stop us
from saving the world.

401
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,021
Oh, boy.

402
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,494
Who invited them?

403
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:26,870
Word on the street is

404
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,557
Deathstroke is pissed about something.

405
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:29,873
Deathstroke?

406
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,208
What kind of name is that?

407
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,171
Party's over.

408
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,715
Everyone hit the streets,
hit everybody on them.

409
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,093
I want Green Arrow dead by morning.

410
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,845
Listen, pal. This is my gang.

411
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,348
The only orders they take are from me.

412
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,851
Hmm. Might be your gang,
but it's my city.

413
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,607
Green Arrow is running
with a female assassin in white

414
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,567
and a Brit in a brown coat.

415
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,069
Kill 'em all.

416
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,540
You heard the man. Let's go!

417
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,250
Looks like your new minions

418
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:16,461
are about to go on a citywide
manhunt for Rip and Sara.

419
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:19,423
- So what?
- They're gonna kill our friends.

420
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,758
Since when did they become our friends?

421
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:22,926
You tell me.

422
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,429
You and Raymond seemed to get
pretty tight back in Russia.

423
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:26,997
I've never been tight with anyone!

424
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,474
Mick, it's time to go.

425
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,395
- You're not the boss of me!
- Actually, I am.

426
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,028
Okay, let's both take a deep breath.

427
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,364
And we'll make ourselves a deal.

428
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,199
<i>You help me get to Rip and Sara.</i>

429
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,745
Once they're safe,
we can have this conversation.

430
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,038
Fair?

431
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,801
Thank you for agreeing
to accompany us, Mr. Diggle.

432
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,553
It's Connor.

433
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,239
It's not like I needed to stick around

434
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,806
Oliver Queen for anything.

435
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,776
- Did you know?
- Know what?

436
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,945
That this is what would happen
to my city.

437
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,782
Oliver said that the only reason
that things got so bad

438
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,634
was because Ray and I
weren't there to help.

439
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,298
Well, I suspected that might be the case,

440
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,662
but that's actually a good thing, hmm.

441
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,165
Once our mission is complete,

442
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,627
and you and Dr. Palmer are
returned to Star City in 2016,

443
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:42,339
you will both be present
to stop Grant Wilson's Uprising.

444
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,841
This future is only a potential timeline.

445
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,678
So this version of Star City,
this doesn't have to happen?

446
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,847
Correct. The future is always in flux.

447
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,850
Hopefully, this will never come to pass.

448
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,853
This world isn't real.

449
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,981
Let's split up and cover more ground.

450
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,786
Hello, beautiful.

451
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,766
There's too many of them!

452
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,778
Gentlemen, your timing is exemplary.

453
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,575
Where's Connor?

454
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,461
He's been taken.

455
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,176
These are Grant Wilson's men.

456
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,013
Mmm. The guy with the half-face
and the body armor

457
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,849
has a real mad-on
for the kid in the hoodie.

458
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,435
Can I have a word?

459
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,979
- Rip--
- I know what you're going to say.

460
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,624
- We have to get him back.
- Yes, that.

461
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,484
But you're forgetting
this future is only a potential timeline.

462
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,319
Yeah, where Grant Wilson kills Connor.

463
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,838
Wilson's not going to murder Connor

464
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:12,342
because once you're returned to 2016,

465
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,242
there won't be a Wilson or a Connor.

466
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,337
At least not
as we know them both right now.

467
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,539
Now that we rescued them,
let's have that chat.

468
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,251
You want to stay here.

469
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,859
I thought I made that pretty clear.

470
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,506
What I'm less clear on is why you don't.

471
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,383
A city of thieves and criminals.

472
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,343
Sounds like a lot of competition.

473
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,719
Then we wipe 'em out.

474
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,346
What I did to that other guy,

475
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,473
we do the same thing
to this Grant Wilson,

476
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,767
and anyone else stupid enough
to get in our way.

477
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,812
Take a look around, Snart.

478
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,897
We're living the dream.

479
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,316
Yeah. Speaking of which...

480
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,195
Sleep tight, buddy.

481
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,031
What happened to him?

482
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:56,950
Difference of opinion.

483
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,451
Right.

484
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,372
We need to get this, and
Mr. Rory, back to the <i>Waverider.</i>

485
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,881
Oh, Jefferson, perfect timing.

486
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,259
I'm in need of your mechanical acumen.

487
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,844
Okay, let's do it.

488
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,267
- What?
- What did you do?

489
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,703
I don't know what you're talking about.

490
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,937
You did something. What did you do?

491
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,230
Nothing. Nothing.

492
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,858
You know, this psychic connection thing,

493
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,318
it goes both ways.

494
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,837
And the moment that I walked in here,

495
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,113
I started feeling
really anxious and guilty.

496
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,760
You feel guilty. So, what did you do?

497
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,801
In my defense, I was only acting
in your best interests--

498
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:39,909
What did you do?

499
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,678
It's possible, in my attempt to discern

500
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,063
whether Dr. Palmer had competing
feelings for Ms. Saunders--

501
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,165
Oh, you didn't.

502
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,042
I may have inadvertently prompted him

503
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,128
to think of her in ways
in which he hadn't.

504
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,629
- Grey!
- I'm sorry.

505
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,381
My intentions were honorable.

506
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,635
Ah, it's cool.

507
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,264
- Is it?
- Yeah.

508
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,224
I mean, nothing's really changed.

509
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,392
Apart from the fact that

510
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,436
now I've got competition
I didn't have before.

511
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:11,232
But I should still have
confidence in myself, right?

512
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,860
Right.

513
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,614
Well, they're back. Where is Mr. Rory?

514
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,657
Sleeping it off.

515
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,451
We have the neuromorphic prototype.

516
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,952
Any luck with the ship's engines?

517
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,329
Yeah, it's all good.

518
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,582
<i>Is there something wrong, Ms. Lance?</i>

519
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,960
Well, all my friends and family are dead.

520
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,088
Except for Oliver Queen

521
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,632
who happens to be dead inside
and missing his left arm.

522
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,966
Sara, I have told you--

523
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,219
That this is just a potential future.

524
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,972
And that it's all gonna go back
when we return to 2016.

525
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,808
If we return.

526
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,601
<i>But what if we don't?</i>

527
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,645
We all know Carter's not coming back.

528
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,814
It's not like we have
the safest line of work.

529
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:55,276
I think, if Sara wants to
stay and help, then we should.

530
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,821
I mean, that's what
we signed up for, to be heroes.

531
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,072
I agree with Jefferson.

532
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,365
Yes, of course you both do,

533
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,134
because neither of you
understand the pitfalls

534
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,368
of changing the timeline.

535
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,828
<i>Meddling with the future</i>

536
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,163
is arguably more dangerous
than changing the past

537
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,748
because it is still in flux.

538
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,251
Your wife and son's death
are in the future.

539
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,753
You want us to change that.

540
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,672
Do not play that card with me.

541
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,923
<i>So what?</i>

542
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,883
Are you only willing to risk the timeline

543
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,051
if it's your own family?

544
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:22,429
I am not just trying to save my family.

545
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:26,724
And I'm not just trying to save
one city, but the entire world.

546
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,310
I'm not the one being selfish, Sara.

547
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,687
Go to hell.

548
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,814
Most likely.

549
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,693
If you want to go and save
Mr. Hawke, then be my guest.

550
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,821
I'll keep the ship here for
one hour. Then we're leaving.

551
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,365
With you on board or without.

552
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,331
Hello, Mick.

553
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,583
You son of a bitch!

554
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,084
Just calm down.

555
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,836
You lied to me!

556
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,547
Wouldn't be the first time.

557
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,799
<i>Remember the Del Rey currency exchange?</i>

558
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,719
The Blackhawk armored car job?

559
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,512
If I hadn't lied to you on those scores,

560
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,390
we'd both be in prison or dead.

561
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,517
<i>I'm the brains. You're the muscle.</i>

562
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,561
That's how it's always been.

563
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:15,190
And, on occasion,
I've had to call some audibles.

564
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:17,775
You have a habit of
getting in your own way, Mick.

565
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,487
Hmm. You're right.

566
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,155
You've lied to me about jobs before.

567
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,949
But then again, you lied to me
about this being a job.

568
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,327
It's not about the score anymore for you.

569
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,662
You'd rather save the world

570
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,664
than be my partner.

571
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,416
A real team player.

572
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,044
'Cause that's what it's gonna
take to defeat Savage.

573
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:39,506
Then what? More money? More power?

574
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,341
A life of leisure and sin?

575
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,134
Don't you get it, Mick?

576
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,178
We take out Savage,
this immortal monster,

577
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:46,666
can't you see what that gets us?

578
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,431
No. Tell me.

579
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,809
We'd be the two baddest
sons of bitches of all time!

580
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,686
I don't want a ticker-tape parade.

581
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,358
You know what I want from this world.

582
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,277
Yes.

583
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,446
To see it burn.

584
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,990
You lay a hand on me again,

585
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,076
you'll burn, too.

586
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,624
Oliver.

587
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,378
Oliver.

588
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,215
I thought I told you to go.

589
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,800
Grant Wilson has Connor.

590
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,927
They're gonna kill him.

591
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,304
He knew what he was signing up for.

592
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:31,391
And you know there's
nothing I can do to help him.

593
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,268
That's not the Oliver Queen that I know.

594
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,812
Maybe I'm not that person anymore.

595
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:41,234
Look at me, Sara. I'm literally
half the man I used to be.

596
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,861
Then that's the half this city needs.

597
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,656
He's got too many men, Ollie.

598
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,700
I can't do this by myself.

599
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,159
What about your friends?

600
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,995
I'm on my own.

601
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:53,705
Unless I'm not.

602
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,335
Come on, Sara.

603
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:02,338
I never got the chance to ask
Connor why he wears the hood.

604
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,048
But I know why.

605
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:07,427
It's because this city

606
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,512
will always need a Green Arrow.

607
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,692
Is the ship ready for departure?

608
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,819
No, Ms. Lance is not yet on board.

609
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,237
I gave her an hour.

610
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,507
- Hardly enough time for--
- And she's been 90 minutes.

611
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,131
How much longer are we supposed to wait?

612
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:34,912
It doesn't matter
that this is a potential future.

613
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,874
It doesn't matter that
this may never come to pass.

614
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,375
It may never be real.

615
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,836
For Sara, this is very real.

616
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,339
I know, which is why
I gave her an extra 30 minutes.

617
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,590
Gideon, what's our status?

618
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,526
<i>The</i> Waverider
<i>is operational, Captain,</i>

619
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,861
<i>but I can't guarantee for how long.</i>

620
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,386
- Explain?
<i>- We are cloaked,</i>

621
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:51,833
<i>but positioned dangerously close</i>

622
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,411
<i>to where the city's criminal element</i>

623
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,850
<i>is gathering to witness
the execution of Connor Hawke.</i>

624
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,353
<i>The longer we wait, the greater
the risk of detection</i>

625
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,396
<i>and further damage to the ship.</i>

626
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,231
Do you really want to risk being marooned

627
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:03,900
in this version of 2046 forever?

628
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,070
Certainly more than I want
to maroon Sara here.

629
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,863
She's our friend,

630
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:10,615
our teammate.

631
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,451
What's the point of stopping Savage

632
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:17,580
if we only become as immoral
as he is in the process?

633
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,393
You should be honored.

634
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,311
This is hallowed ground.

635
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:42,730
I took Oliver Queen's arm

636
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,816
in this very spot!

637
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,277
Well, then let me go,

638
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,446
and we'll see which one of us is tougher,

639
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:51,739
me or Queen.

640
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,616
I already know the answer to that.

641
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,493
Ready the prisoner.

642
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,918
Sir?

643
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,342
We saw her trying
to sneak past the perimeter.

644
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:12,844
<i>Sloppy.</i>

645
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,688
The League of Assassins
would be embarrassed.

646
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,307
What was your strategy here?

647
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:21,602
Did you really think
you could just turn up tonight

648
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,312
and kill me?

649
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,482
No.

650
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,485
It was just my job to distract you.

651
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,352
You're not Green Arrow.

652
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,521
You're just a punk in a Halloween costume.

653
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,357
Funny, I was gonna say
the same thing about you.

654
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,553
You want to fight the Green Arrow?

655
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:38,930
I'm right here.

656
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:59,325
How'd you convince Rip to stay?

657
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:01,536
Actually, sending in the cavalry
was his idea.

658
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,421
Where's Mr. Queen?

659
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,594
Connor!

660
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:42,910
Cowards, all!

661
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:48,749
Oliver?

662
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,751
It's good to see you again, Ray.

663
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:54,422
Kendra, thanks for the assist.

664
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:55,923
So, who's that?

665
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,884
<i>His name is Grant Wilson.</i>

666
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:03,139
Once upon a time, his father
Slade tried to ruin my life.

667
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,932
That is not a nice family.

668
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:07,935
That's good shooting, John.

669
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,109
It's Connor.

670
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:20,656
Either way, it's Green Arrow.

671
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,460
We have a lot of work to do.

672
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:34,545
Grant Wilson did a good job

673
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:37,381
of keeping the criminal element
in the city together.

674
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:39,967
Now there will be plenty
of people to fill the vacuum.

675
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,553
I feel like I should stay.

676
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,140
Before Ray left, he told me why
Rip brought all of you together.

677
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,850
It's important, Sara.

678
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:51,354
I just hate the idea of leaving
you here to fix it alone.

679
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,064
I'm not alone.

680
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,072
Just be careful, all right?

681
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,741
Well, you should know better than most,

682
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,368
I rarely ever am.

683
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,712
You watch his back.

684
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,507
Copy that.

685
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,843
Let's get to work.

686
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:36,440
All right.
Confidence. Confidence. Okay.

687
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:39,986
<i>So, uh, I think Rip might have</i>

688
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,238
<i>some of that vodka left in his cabinet.</i>

689
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:43,489
<i>And?</i>

690
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:45,533
And...

691
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,245
Maybe we could get a drink.

692
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:50,913
Are you asking me out?

693
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,040
Yes. No...

694
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:54,417
<i>I think so.</i>

695
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,002
Is that okay?

696
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,213
Yeah, that's totally okay.

697
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,382
Except that,

698
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,718
three months ago
I was a completely normal person

699
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:06,846
and now I'm a Hawk goddess,

700
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,556
traveling through time,

701
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,843
trying to avoid being killed
by an immortal psychopath

702
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:14,562
who murdered the man
I was destined to be with.

703
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,938
So...

704
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,025
I'm sorry, Ray,

705
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:22,570
I think my life's complicated
enough without throwing

706
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,822
whatever this is into the mix.

707
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,577
Yeah. I totally understand.

708
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,830
If I was a reincarnated
Egyptian priestess,

709
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,957
I'd probably feel the same way.

710
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,504
I'm gonna go check on Professor Stein.

711
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:47,428
Mmm-hmm, yep. All good here.

712
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,513
Absolutely no problems.

713
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:52,016
- Everything okay here?
- Yeah. Yeah.

714
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,309
Yeah, fine.

715
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:54,977
- You?
- Oh, yeah, good. Good.

716
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,645
That's good.

717
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,731
Uh...

718
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,775
How much of that did you hear?

719
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:03,986
Oh, enough. I'm sorry.

720
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:05,362
I'm sorry, too.

721
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:08,991
- You knew? Uh...
- Yeah...

722
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,785
- Yeah.
- You're not that subtle.

723
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:14,395
She would've picked me, by the way.

724
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:15,974
Keep telling yourself that.

725
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,001
She would've.

726
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,051
I'm just working on determining
our next destination.

727
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,695
I've considered your suggestion of hell.

728
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,347
But I think I'll give it a miss
for the time being.

729
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:34,391
I just wanted to say thank you

730
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,312
- for sending the team to back me up.
- Mmm.

731
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,357
As it turns out, you were right.

732
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:43,558
That must've been hard to say.

733
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:47,571
Of late I've discovered
that I still have a lot to learn,

734
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:49,323
I admit.

735
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,911
Including the fact that every
future is worth fighting for.

736
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,707
That said,

737
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,127
this mission is going to continue

738
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,878
to present us with difficult choices

739
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:06,215
and I need to know that you are
a member of this team.

740
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,676
I guess so.

741
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,098
All right, Gideon,

742
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,284
let's see if these repairs
that Martin, Ray and Jax made

743
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,351
are up to scratch.

744
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,720
<i>As far as I can tell,</i>

745
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,080
<i>Ms. Saunders did most of the work,</i>

746
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,581
<i>while the two gentlemen competed for her--</i>

747
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,440
Just get us out of here please, Gideon.

748
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:30,573
I'm gonna miss this place.

749
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:34,285
Yeah, they really seemed like
your kind of people.

750
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,079
I don't know who my people are anymore.

751
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:40,583
<i>So, where to next, Captain?</i>

752
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,227
Well, the beauty of this mission is that

753
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:43,544
the real question is not where,

754
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:44,753
but when.

755
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,715
<i>In which case, I suggest
that we next hit Savage</i>

756
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,592
when he least expects it.

757
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:29,465
