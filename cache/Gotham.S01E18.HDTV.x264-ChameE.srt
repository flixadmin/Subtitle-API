1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,910
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,340
This is, Reginald Payne.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,480
We served together, sir.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,290
Please, feel free to stay with us a few days.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,920
You're stealing from us?

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,010
Arnold Flass.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,430
You're under arrest for the murder of Leon Winkler.

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,430
I.A. ruled it a suicide.

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,940
Arnold Flass, you're under arrest.

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,260
I'm protected.

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,730
So... you're the one causing all of the fuss.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,860
You will take nothing from me.

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,960
Really?

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,350
No!

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,760
He has nothing concrete.

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,510
Now's the time to make a move on the kid.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,400
Slim pickings at the food court.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,090
Brought you a bagel. Thanks.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,650
Nothing for the invalid?

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,910
Sorry. Hospital food only.

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,970
- Doctor's orders. How you feeling? - All right.

22
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,370
Had a slight... puncture.

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,470
Leaked a bit.

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,570
So I know last night must be kind of a blur,

25
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,250
but do you have any idea who did this?

26
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:07,820
It-it was...

27
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,370
It was dark. It was very dark.

28
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,310
Saw a...

29
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,480
shadow and... 

30
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,870
my savior Master Bruce was leaning over me.

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,720
Did you get a look at the guy?

32
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,330
No.

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,960
Sorry. My captain keeps calling.

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,600
It's fine, Detective.

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,910
- Just-just go. - No, I can stay.

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,350
I really appreciate you sitting with Master Bruce,

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,800
but as you can see, I'm completely fine.

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,510
Go.

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,030
All right. I'll try and stop by later.

40
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,160
Thank you again for coming, Detective.

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,260
Why not tell him the truth?

42
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,950
Well, believe it or not,

43
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,470
Master Bruce, Reggie's a mate,

44
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,750
and you don't set coppers on your mates, do you?

45
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,850
But he nearly killed you.

46
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,520
I served with that bastard.

47
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,850
Anyone sorts him out, it's me-- nobody else.

48
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,990
It wouldn't be right.

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,350
Why would he stab you?

50
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,930
That's a bloody good question.

51
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,090
And one...

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,290
I mean to find out.

53
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,320
'Cause longer that bloody lunatic's out on the loose...

54
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,400
...the harder it's gonna be to find him.

55
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,470
Now, you just...

56
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,260
G-get back in bed, Alfred.

57
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,650
Just pass me my robe.

58
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,200
Get back in bed!

59
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,920
That's an order.

60
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,730
You're awake.

61
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,470
Wonderful.

62
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,640
How long have I been...

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Asleep?

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,360
Just since last night.

65
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,000
How do you feel?

66
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,410
My head hurts.

67
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,530
To be expected.

68
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,730
May I?

69
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,360
Who are you?

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,140
Dr. Francis Dulmacher.

71
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,340
Founder of this facility.

72
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,160
A pleasure.

73
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,090
I've gone to great lengths to meet you, Doctor.

74
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,960
Indeed you have.

75
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,510
I must say you have a remarkable constitution.

76
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,250
I wish I could say the same of all my patients.

77
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,480
So I'm a patient now?

78
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,750
No longer a prisoner?

79
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,000
I confess I don't know what you are.

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,930
You seize control of the basement,

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,650
take one of my guards hostage,

82
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,080
then scoop out your own eye.

83
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,090
What am I to do with you?

84
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,510
Simple. Make me your right hand.

85
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,350
I'm glad to see you've retained your sense of humor.

86
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,420
I'm not joking.

87
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,140
For the past ten years, 

88
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,360
I've been Carmine Falcone's top lieutenant.

89
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,380
I'm afraid the name means nothing to me.

90
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,560
I woke up hungry and alone in an underground cell.

91
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,810
In less than a week, I brought this place to a standstill.

92
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,980
Now, you've had me as your enemy.

93
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,270
Wouldn't you rather have me as your friend?

94
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,450
Such vim.

95
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,460
Such... panache.

96
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,350
Bravo.

97
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,090
And now you should eat.

98
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,150
I'll have a nurse come in with some food.

99
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,510
We'll talk more later.

100
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,090
Tricky things, eyes.

101
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,800
Our stock is frightfully low at the moment.

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,760
Oh, and apologies.

103
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,980
We couldn't match your original color.

104
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,190
We'll talk soon.

106
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,990
This can't be true.

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,990
I was prepping the case for the D.A.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,740
when word came down this morning.

109
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,750
Press got it last night, of course.

110
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,610
We had the murder weapon.

111
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,340
With Flass's prints.

112
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,180
There's no way.

113
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,000
Apparently, the defense dug up a witness,

114
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,670
cleared Flass of all charges.

115
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,510
- What witness? - No idea.

116
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,790
Only the judge and the lead attorneys were privy,

117
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,530
and our honorable D.A. is staying mum.

118
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,370
What about a subpoena?

119
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,900
We don't have sufficient grounds.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,310
But I did a little snooping around.

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,350
And?

122
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,040
The mystery witness was provided by Commissioner Loeb.

123
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Let me guess.

124
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,450
Loeb's reinstating Flass as head of Narco.

125
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,330
Worse.

126
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,330
He announced he's backing Flass for president

127
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,720
of the policemen's union in the upcoming election.

128
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,000
So you're telling me a man we know is a drug dealer

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,310
and a murderer is gonna potentially hold

130
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,940
a major position in the GCPD?

131
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,900
Clearly, Loeb's sending a message.

132
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,550
This is not gonna stand.

133
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,520
Look, I'm just as upset about this as you are, Jim,

134
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,980
but it's the commissioner.

135
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,620
Which is what makes it worse.

136
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,340
Jim! Jim!

137
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,240
Jimbo.

138
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,460
You heard the good news?

139
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,020
Hey, the boys are throwing me a welcome back down at O'Donnelys.

140
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,110
Figure you want to stop by.

141
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,050
Show support for your soon-to-be new president.

142
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,000
I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

143
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,470
You just don't learn.

144
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,920
Still want to take me down.

145
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,660
I'm like the phoenix.

146
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,620
I'll just rise

147
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,890
again and again and again.

148
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,960
Ah, Detective Gordon.

149
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,300
I had a presentiment I might be seeing you.

150
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,470
Arnold Flass is a murderer.

151
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,930
He belongs in jail.

152
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,040
Detective Flass was legally exonerated.

153
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,770
The judge heard testimony. The case is closed.

154
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,170
You used your connections to orchestrate his release.

155
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,890
You perverted the system.

156
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,440
Petulance and naiveté are a bad combination.

157
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,000
Know when you're beaten.

158
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,130
I was knee-deep in the Flass investigation.

159
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,250
There is no one with enough credibility

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,730
to trump our evidence.

161
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,280
I do enjoy when unwavering certainty

162
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,800
is undermined by the truth.

163
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,970
Look into the camera, state your name

164
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,030
and why you're here.

165
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,070
My name is Detective Harvey Bullock,

166
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,260
and I presented false evidence against 

167
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,850
my fellow GCPD detective, Arnold Flass.

168
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,480
Hey, there you are. Aw, dude.

169
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,440
Feel like a herd of cattle had a dance party

170
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,370
in my head last night.

171
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,210
What's up?

172
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,760
Why the hell would you lie to exonerate Flass?

173
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,760
Don't deny it. I saw the tape.

174
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,430
I'm not denying anything.

175
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,860
I did what I had to do.

176
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,620
If I didn't do what Loeb told me to do, I would've lost my job.

177
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,050
Probably gone to prison.

178
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,020
What does he have on you?

179
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,740
Harvey.

180
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,630
Do you honestly think you're the only one who had the orders

181
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,930
to take a punk down to the end of a pier

182
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,260
and put a bullet in his head? Huh?

183
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,660
The difference is my Cobblepot didn't come back.

184
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,480
Who'd you kill?

185
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,980
Some scumbag mobster.

186
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,670
Caught him coming out of a club one night.

187
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,420
My sergeant put a gun in my hand, held another to my head,

188
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,960
and said, "Make a choice."

189
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,550
I decided to keep breathing.

190
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,950
Damn it, Harvey.

191
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,070
So what?

192
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,550
What are you gonna do? Arrest me? Go ahead. Arrest me.

193
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,710
But don't stop there.

194
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,210
Half the cops in the GCPD have a Cobblepot,

195
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,660
and Loeb has the goods on all of them.

196
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,650
That is what Loeb does.

197
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,310
Well, it ends now.

198
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,720
Jim, hey.

199
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,740
Going after Flass was bad enough.

200
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,710
Going after Loeb is suicide, plain and simple.

201
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,680
So what?

202
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,450
Am I supposed to stay quiet?

203
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,800
Fall in line like the rest of you?

204
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,960
That would be a good idea.

205
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,420
Day I do that is the day I quit being a cop.

206
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,160
Oh, my.

207
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,160
Fun fact.

208
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,660
The human species attracts members of the opposite sex

209
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,370
via pheromones

210
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,950
secreted through saliva, sweat and urine.

211
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,970
Gross.

212
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,740
But... one can't always trust

213
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,340
such an animalistic method

214
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,950
to find a suitable partner.

215
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,830
What are you trying to tell me?

216
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,940
Arnold Flass was released.

217
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,500
I know that you two were dating,

218
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,490
and if the attraction wasn't intellectual--

219
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,910
how could it be with that gorilla?--

220
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,040
then it must be physical.

221
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,420
He's just... he's such a bad, bad, bad... 

222
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,490
I appreciate your concern.

223
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,650
But it won't be necessary.

224
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,180
I've realized there are far better men

225
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,080
in the world than Arnold Flass.

226
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,740
So Loeb's been collecting dirt on cops for years

227
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,650
and using it to control the department.

228
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,330
I doubt it stops there.

229
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,490
He's probably got leverage on businessmen, politicians.

230
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,570
He's got nothing on me.

231
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,630
Just checking.

232
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,710
Anyway, yeah, that's the source of all his power.

233
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,390
And you want to steal the dragon's gold.

234
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,020
If we find his cache of evidence and destroy it,

235
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,030
he'll be toothless.

236
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,360
Oh, I know Loeb.

237
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,980
He won't keep it anywhere obvious.

238
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,930
We could watch him, hope he leads us to it.

239
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,260
We don't have that kind of time.

240
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,320
Isn't there someone Loeb might have trusted?

241
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,070
Ex-friends?

242
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,880
An estranged wife?

243
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
Well, he was married.

244
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,170
She died 20 years ago.

245
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,200
Fell down the stairs.

246
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,780
Well, there were rumors Loeb killed her,

247
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,070
but nothing ever happened with it.

248
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,420
Still can't believe about your partner.

249
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,800
Why'd he do it?

250
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,960
What's Loeb have on him?

251
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,190
I don't know.

252
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,360
Well, it's got to be rough.

253
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,810
I know how it is with cops and their partners.

254
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,600
What is it?

255
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,800
What's the matter, Dent?

256
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,160
I thought that Lambusta case was settled.

257
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,850
And why the hell are we meeting here?

258
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,840
You'll see.

259
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,790
You know Jim Gordon?

260
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,850
What the hell's going on?

261
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,800
Have a seat.

262
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,340
Back before Loeb was Commissioner,

263
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,800
when he was a lowly homicide dick, you were his partner.

264
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,410
Yeah? That was 20 years ago.

265
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,820
But I always hear that cop partnerships are like marriages.

266
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,930
You know each other better than your wives.

267
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,680
Isn't that right, Jim?

268
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,620
That's right.

269
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,410
You digging up that old story about Loeb killing his wife?

270
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,200
He was with me when she died.

271
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,990
We know about the secret files.

272
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,630
What secret files?

273
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,850
Oh, that was good.

274
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,840
I almost believed him.

275
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,330
- What about you, Jim? - No.

276
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,630
You're out of your depth, kid. Both of you.

277
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,420
Swim back to shore.

278
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,460
He's got something on you, too, doesn't he?

279
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,330
He got you to do something for him.

280
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,320
What was it?

281
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,550
Robbery? Coercion?

282
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,470
Murder?

283
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,630
And all this time, he's been using it

284
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,510
to keep you under his thumb.

285
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,400
This is your chance to breathe easy again.

286
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,360
Take it, Griggs.

287
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,350
I don't know what you two are talking about.

288
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,560
If I did, I'd say talk to Xi Lu.

289
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,490
Chinese bookkeeper on Huron Street.

290
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,620
Loeb always said you want to keep something safe,

291
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,780
you give it to Xi Lu.

292
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,280
You want to bring in Bullock?

293
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,760
We might need him.

294
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,740
No.

295
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,490
Thanks, Joe.

296
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,550
I mean it.

297
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,300
I like the blue.

298
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,700
I'm so pleased.

299
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,070
Happy patient, happy doctor.

300
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,090
Mrs. Harris.

301
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,620
Hello, Doctor.

302
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,760
Don't forget-- jazz at 6:00 on the veranda,

303
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,960
but no martinis until the bandages come off, yes?

304
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,670
Good girl.

305
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,870
Kidney transplant.

306
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,210
We threw in a new face for free, and none too soon.

307
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,530
But you need a steady supply of organs.

308
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,680
Yes.

309
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,160
Which is suddenly something of a problem, thanks to you.

310
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,870
But I'm also a solution.

311
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,480
The people in the basement trust me.

312
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,400
Put me in charge,

313
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,080
and I promise you a dependable flow of healthy product.

314
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,920
Or I could save myself the trouble

315
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,470
and kill you and everyone downstairs.

316
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,280
Now, if that were an option, you would have done it already,

317
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,260
and you surely wouldn't have wasted this beautiful eye

318
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,640
on little old me.

319
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,180
I'd like to show you something.

320
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,230
People view themselves as unique, self-contained systems,

321
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,520
but we are merely a collection of parts.

322
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,830
What happens when I replace your eyes,

323
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,140
your face, your heart?

324
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,410
When do you stop being you and become something new?

325
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,630
That's what fascinates me.

326
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,710
Nice talk.

327
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,370
Do we have a deal?

328
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,490
Conditionally.

329
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,350
I will send you back to the basement,

330
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,810
you will retrieve my guard, and then prove to me

331
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,720
that you can provide me with the bodies.

332
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,260
A test.

333
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,280
And if I fail?

334
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,980
Oh, those who fail me still have their uses.

335
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,870
You may remember my former office manager.

336
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,830
Amusing, no?

337
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,220
"And then I looked at the stars,

338
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,130
and considered how awful it would be for a man

339
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,320
to turn his face up to them as he froze to death,

340
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,440
and see no help or pity in the glittering multitude..."

341
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,150
"You're..."

342
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,620
That's cheerful.

343
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,070
What are you doing here?

344
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,350
Ivy sneaks in a few times a week.

345
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,280
Steals food from the sickies.

346
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,240
She spotted you.

347
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,610
He okay?

348
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,780
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,530
Thanks.

350
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,230
Alfred was stabbed.

351
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,150
It was a friend of his from the army.

352
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,150
That sucks.

353
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,010
I think he was there because of me.

354
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,110
What are you talking about?

355
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,420
I had a meeting with the board of Wayne Enterprises

356
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,250
to tell them I was investigating them,

357
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,970
so they sent someone we'd trust to spy on us.

358
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,260
What was he looking for?

359
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,660
Some of my files were missing.

360
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,630
I think the other things he stole were just cover.

361
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,820
If I find him, I could find out who hired him.

362
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,390
He's-he's the key to everything.

363
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,640
You're gonna track him down?

364
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,000
Really? You?

365
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,290
I-I have to.

366
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,070
This... this is my fault.

367
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,900
Kid, you're out of your mind.

368
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,680
Look at him. Is that how you want to end up?

369
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,010
I don't expect you to understand.

370
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,340
- I'll help. - No.

371
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,330
I can't risk anybody else getting hurt on account of me.

372
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,900
You know how to find me.

373
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Xi Lu?

374
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,850
Detective Gordon, GCPD.

375
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,620
We have a few questions we'd like to ask you.

376
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,350
Is there somewhere we can talk in private?

377
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,590
Ask your questions, Detective.

378
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,180
It's about Commissioner Loeb.

379
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,840
We understand you two have a business relationship?

380
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,560
I do not know Commissioner Loeb.

381
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,310
Listen, old man, we can have a dozen ADAs

382
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,980
and cops here in ten minutes.

383
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,860
They'll confiscate every dollar in this place,

384
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,380
and you will go to jail.

385
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,230
Your name is Gordon.

386
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,450
That's right.

387
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,210
And you are Dent.

388
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,860
Yes.

389
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,830
Wait here.

390
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,860
Okay. Not good.

391
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,850
GCPD!

392
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,580
Drop your weapons now!

393
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,840
- Gordon...  - Yeah. Run!

394
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,570
Get in!

395
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,100
We got to go back there. You've got to call backup.

396
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Forget it! The place will be cleaned out in five minutes.

397
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,000
Thanks for stopping by.

398
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,640
I got enough on my conscience.

399
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,060
Griggs set us up.

400
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,240
Now Loeb knows we're after his evidence cache.

401
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,350
Griggs sent you?

402
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,460
Guy would turn on anyone to save his own skin.

403
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,810
You just got to scare him enough.

404
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,270
- We tried. - Let me.

405
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,180
Counselor, trust me, you're gonna want to sit this one out.

406
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,710
I want a name!

407
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,710
- Falcone! - What?!

408
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,620
The only person who knows where Loeb keeps his stash!

409
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,340
Falcone!

410
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,880
The two of them are in it together!

411
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,690
Loeb and Falcone!

412
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,960
You two are dead men!

413
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,270
You're going against Loeb and Falcone? You're dead!

414
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,160
Go! Before I lose my good cheer.

415
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,940
Go!

416
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,760
He has a point.

417
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,800
Yeah.

418
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,810
So what next?

419
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,220
Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones

420
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,710
who know where the stash is.

421
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,460
We need someone close to them, someone who'll talk.

422
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,740
That person doesn't exist.

423
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, he does.

424
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,370
Oh, yes.

425
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,230
Gentlemen.

426
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,650
So nice to see you.

427
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,570
What can I do for you?

428
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,750
You do realize what you're asking me to do?

429
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,170
If Don Falcone is working with

430
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,950
Commissioner Loeb to keep this trove of secrets hidden

431
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,840
and I help you uncover them,

432
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,160
I'd be betraying my patron.

433
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,370
- That's right. - If he found out, he'd...

434
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,520
well, he'd be very angry.

435
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,510
to say the least.

436
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,070
Enough with the hemming and hawing.

437
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,360
Are you gonna help us or not?

438
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,680
Let say, for argument's sake, I could help you.

439
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,620
What's in it for me?

440
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,430
I'll owe you a favor.

441
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,900
No questions asked?

442
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,880
Jim.

443
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,810
Yes.

444
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,980
Do you know what this is?

445
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,930
Madre Di Dios.

446
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,180
A hundred bottles made once a year

447
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,270
by monks in the Italian countryside.

448
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,050
It's Don Maroni's favorite.

449
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,220
What's your point?

450
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,210
Oh, it's just a piece of information

451
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,270
that might be useful one day.

452
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,060
I like information.

453
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,570
If I help you find where Loeb keeps his files,

454
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,980
you give me ten minutes alone with them.

455
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,360
I take what I want.

456
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,460
This is not a good idea.

457
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,600
Five minutes.

458
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,160
And you don't touch anything that has to do with cops.

459
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,040
Five minutes with the files and a favor from Jim Gordon?

460
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,950
Done!

461
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,120
So who's up for a road trip?

462
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,600
We have to give Fish more time.

463
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,730
She'll get us out of here; she promised.

464
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,620
Can't you see she abandoned us?

465
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,210
Got herself out and left us here to rot.

466
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,260
I say we kill this one,

467
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,290
let them know we're serious.

468
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,820
- Fish said... - Fish, Fish, Fish.

469
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,560
Where's Fish now?!

470
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,870
I'm disappointed.

471
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,490
I told you I was coming back.

472
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,960
What, you didn't believe me?

473
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,090
Family is built on trust, and that's what we are.

474
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,760
A family.

475
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,390
Fish, I tried, I did.

476
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,100
I know you did.

477
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,990
So where's everything you promised?

478
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,330
When do we get out?

479
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,070
First thing's first.

480
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,380
I spoke to the man upstairs

481
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,910
about our demands for better conditions, better food.

482
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,730
He asked for a show of good faith.

483
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,600
We're gonna return his guard.

484
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,330
Let him go.

485
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,680
Now.

486
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,380
Next...

487
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,290
What?

488
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,410
What are they doing?

489
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,350
I'm sorry, honey.

490
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,720
You're on the list. Doctor's orders.

491
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,100
Fish... Fish!

492
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,360
I told you, didn't I?

493
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,780
She's working for them now!

494
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,480
I warned you not everyone would live.

495
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,700
Their sacrifice means your survival!

496
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,260
And my promise remains the same.

497
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,830
You sure about this, Penguin?

498
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,480
You're telling me this is where Loeb keeps 20 years

499
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,080
of dirty secrets?

500
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,720
Doesn't feel right.

501
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,260
Well, maybe that's the point.

502
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,620
No one would suspect it.

503
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,640
What would you prefer, Detective Bullock?

504
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,500
A sign saying "Super secret blackmail hoard"?

505
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,800
You know, the last time the three of us took a ride, 

506
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,100
you were in the trunk.

507
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,020
I liked that better.

508
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,890
I told you,

509
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,470
I overheard Falcone on the phone to Loeb.

510
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,180
He said the farm was safe.

511
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,640
Now, I'll wait here, and when you're done,

512
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,710
flash the lights or something.

513
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,640
You're coming along.

514
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,970
But if whoever's inside sees me and reports back to Falcone...

515
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,210
Then you'll be in some really deep doo.

516
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,090
What'd you think, huh?

517
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,880
We were gonna go do your dirty work,

518
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,580
and then you were just gonna waltz in

519
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,600
and pick through the leavings?

520
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,310
Have some respect.

521
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,920
You fellas lost?

522
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,140
Good evening, sir.

523
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,170
We were sent by Commissioner Loeb.

524
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,080
Might we have a word?

525
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,300
Out of the cold?

526
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,160
Well, Marge is putting on some tea.

527
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,260
I love your house.

528
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,240
- It's so cozy. - Thank you.

529
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,950
How long have you two been here?

530
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,900
Oh, well,

531
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,230
about, uh, 20 years.

532
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,730
Ever since Mr. Loeb bought the place.

533
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,440
Hard to believe.

534
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,760
Time, boy.

535
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,130
You should've seen Margie back then.

536
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,960
Hot to trot.

537
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,680
What were you doing before that?

538
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,040
Oh, nothing much. Uh, Margie was a nurse over at Arkham.

539
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,490
And I working on the railroad.

540
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,240
Why are you men here?

541
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,370
Inspection.

542
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,500
Commissioner Loeb has some concerns about security.

543
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,570
We didn't hear nothing about it.

544
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,610
You didn't get a letter?

545
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,570
No.

546
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,800
That's odd.

547
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,690
Y-You should have gotten a letter.

548
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,190
You got I.D.?

549
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,440
Well, I don't know that that's necessary.

550
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,140
No, no. It's fine.

551
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,160
Jim Gordon, GCPD.

552
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,000
This is Detective Bullock.

553
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,180
We're on the Commissioner's personal detail.

554
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,640
He don't look like a cop.

555
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,630
I'm undercover.

556
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,110
Damn raccoons.

557
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,060
Jim, what do you say we get on with our inspection?

558
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,820
Perhaps you wouldn't mind showing us around.

559
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,140
Oh, absolutely.

560
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,290
Marge, would you mind fetching my keys?

561
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,250
Sure.

562
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,870
Now, listen,

563
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,040
before you go, 

564
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,960
you fellas have got to get a piece of Marge's cake.

565
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
She makes it with sour cream.

566
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,040
Tastes like a warm Sunday morning.

567
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,030
That's one hell of a big raccoon.

568
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,950
Maybe we should start upstairs.

569
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,510
Oh, just wait a lick for the keys.

570
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,200
Margie-pie, that was quick.

571
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,620
Ma'am, put down the...

572
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,440
Freeze!

573
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,830
Thanks, Jim.

574
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,000
- You saved my li... - Watch them.

575
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,820
You're lucky I have a soft spot for old ladies.

576
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,590
I-It's so quiet downstairs.

577
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,250
Is the party over?

578
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,300
I-I prepared a song.

579
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,770
It includes a dance and everything.

580
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
Who the hell are you?

581
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,320
I'm Miriam Loeb.

582
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,530
Did-did my father send you?

583
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,660
Ms. Kringle.

584
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,600
Oh, Mr. Nygma.

585
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,590
Ms. Kringle, I was wondering

586
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,580
if you had dinner plans this evening.

587
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,740
Actually, I... I do.

588
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,540
With Tom.

589
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,810
Have-have you met Tom?

590
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,060
You're the guy that likes riddles.

591
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,790
Hey, what has hands but can't clap?

592
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,400
A clock.

593
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,370
Correct.

594
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,840
He's good.

595
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,060
You're good.

596
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,700
Am I correct to assume that this is your...

597
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,390
uh, your new boyfriend?

598
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,340
Yeah... Yes, I guess so.

599
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,430
You betcha.

600
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,180
Congratulations, sir.

601
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,210
Thank you.

602
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,000
Well, we should probably get going. 

603
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,790
Okay.

604
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,910
It's nice to meet you.

605
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,210
Riddle man, next time...

606
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,730
I'm gonna stump you.

607
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,710
Yes.

608
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,790
Next time.

609
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,190
So, Miriam,

610
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,090
you live up here all the time?

611
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,100
Always.

612
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,810
Uh, ever since...

613
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,020
I, uh... I'm not alone though.

614
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,700
Father comes to visit on Sundays.

615
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,630
And we listen to the radio and play checkers.

616
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,780
He always lets me win.

617
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,230
My dad used to do the same thing.

618
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,500
Really?

619
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,420
Fathers are funny like that, aren't they?

620
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,380
Yeah, your dad's a real hoot.

621
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,110
Does he keep other stuff up here?

622
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,710
Like important papers or files or 

623
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,690
maybe rooms full of boxes?

624
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,730
No.

625
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,820
Why would he do that?

626
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,240
This is a waste of time.

627
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,430
Miriam...

628
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,580
...what happened to your mother?

629
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,580
She...

630
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,990
died.

631
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,860
I, um...

632
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,980
I've started a new hobby.

633
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,540
Would you like to see?

634
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,580
Sure.

635
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,070
Oh, great.

636
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,940
What are you doing?

637
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,310
Loeb's wife died 20 years ago.

638
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,190
Skull fracture from a fall down the stairs.

639
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,780
Miriam would've been a teenager.

640
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,560
So you think Loeb killed her? She was the witness?

641
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,340
That's why he keeps her cooped up here?

642
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,150
You said I wasn't the only one with a Cobblepot.

643
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,740
Maybe this is his.

644
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,840
I started making jewelry.

645
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,310
What's it made of?

646
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,030
Bones.

647
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,870
Starlings.

648
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,390
They, uh...

649
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,800
they land on my windowsill,

650
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,260
and... you can catch them

651
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,030
if you're really silent and still.

652
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,080
And I can be really silent and still.

653
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,730
Silent as a mouse.

654
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,780
Then what do you do?

655
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,490
I...

656
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,030
crush the back of their heads.

657
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,320
I just press down with my thumb.

658
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,760
It makes, like, a...

659
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,760
a popping noise.

660
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,260
Pop.

661
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,440
Miriam...

662
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,300
...can you tell us about your mother's death?

663
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,510
I'm a good person.

664
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,380
Sometimes good people make mistakes.

665
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,100
That's what Father said.

666
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,020
Did you make a mistake with your mother?

667
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,450
Was it like what happens with the birds?

668
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,970
No.

669
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,930
Not like with the birds.

670
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,430
Silly.

671
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,690
I had to use a candlestick on her.

672
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,320
She wouldn't stop singing either.

673
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,510
She knew that it was my night.

674
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,990
I was supposed to perform at dinner.

675
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,630
Not her.

676
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,210
So you hit her and she stopped.

677
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,980
And your dad covered it up.

678
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,700
He knew that it was my night.

679
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,510
I'm sorry, Jim.

680
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,750
They-they came at me. I tried...

681
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,950
Did you find what Loeb's hiding?

682
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,340
Is it here?

683
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,480
Yes.

684
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,330
Well, a deal's a deal.

685
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,630
You have to let me in there.

686
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,290
Who's he?

687
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,830
He looks just like a bird.

688
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,950
Oh, I love birds.

689
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,600
I see you still haven't learned the art of knocking,

690
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,790
Detective Gordon.

691
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,380
Miriam is sick.

692
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,740
She didn't mean to hurt her mother.

693
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,640
She just...

694
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,960
has these urges.

695
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,510
If you want to expose what she did, go ahead.

696
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,610
You think I can't weather the scandal?

697
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,700
I'm sure you could.

698
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,570
But that's not why you kept her locked away for 20 years.

699
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,000
Do enlighten me.

700
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,000
I think you love her.

701
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,780
I think you've done everything you can to keep her out of Arkham.

702
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,270
And you'll keep doing it.

703
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,980
You're willing to hold my daughter hostage to achieve your ends?

704
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,660
You're much colder than I thought.

705
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,710
So it seems.

706
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,310
I'll hand in my resignation today.

707
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,700
Just keep Miriam out of it.

708
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,150
No, you're not resigning.

709
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,750
You step down, I'll have someone else to deal with.

710
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,430
And chances are he'll be Falcone's lapdog, same as you.

711
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,100
With you...

712
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,830
I have leverage.

713
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,620
So what do you want?

714
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,800
Flass is tried.

715
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,670
Fairly.

716
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,490
And I want all the evidence you have on Bullock

717
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:10,550
and every other cop in the GCPD sent to Harvey Dent.

718
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,960
He'll decide who to prosecute.

719
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,760
No.

720
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,330
I do that, I'm a dead man.

721
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,790
I love Miriam, but I love living, too.

722
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,140
You can have Bullock's file.

723
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,060
But not the rest.

724
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,520
Fine.

725
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,460
And Miriam stays where she is.

726
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,950
Is that all?

727
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,940
There's one more thing.

728
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,680
It's become something of a habit to stand up here with Detective Gordon,

729
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,520
but with the coming election for president of the policemen's union,

730
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,130
there's no man I'd rather support.

731
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,220
Thank you, Commissioner Loeb.

732
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,600
It's a new day in the GCPD.

733
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,250
Sorry I missed your big moment.

734
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,560
I figured I'd catch the next one.

735
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,270
Your file.

736
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,190
It's everything Loeb has on you.

737
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,880
Always hated that picture.

738
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,170
You know, you tell yourself...

739
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,860
..."I'll just do this one bad thing,

740
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,960
but all the good things I'll do later will make up for it."

741
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,520
But they don't.

742
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,790
There's still that bad thing.

743
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,720
Penguin's gonna come asking for that favor.

744
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,220
Be careful.

745
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,930
I know we had a deal.

746
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,040
I let you go, and you escape the inevitable punishment

747
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,160
that will descend on your heads

748
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,470
when Commissioner Loeb hears of your failure.

749
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,200
Unfortunately, I was only able

750
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,780
to acquire one ticket to Arizona.

751
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,840
So who's it gonna be?

752
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,920
Margie and I have been together for 20 years.

753
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,420
We're not splitting up.

754
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,590
Life can be cruel sometimes.

755
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,780
How do we decide who goes?

756
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,730
I leave that in your hands.

757
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,550
Wait a minute!

758
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,740
Margie! Margie!

759
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,780
Here we go.

760
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,980
Here we go!

761
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,970
What time is the train?

762
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,680
Oh, there's no train.

763
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,100
- I just needed your help. - What?

764
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,300
I was down to one shell.

765
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,590
I've been thinking of introducing salsa night.

766
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,770
Do you think our guests would like that?

767
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,650
No.

768
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,510
Honest. Good.

769
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,610
But... I like salsa.

770
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,270
Tuesday it is.

771
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,270
So... you've completed your task,

772
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,310
and the lines of supply are open once again.

773
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,770
I am duly impressed.

774
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,940
Hope is a carrot easily dangled

775
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,670
in front of the desperate, Doctor.

776
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,190
And you have earned your carrot.

777
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,320
Welcome to upper management.

778
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,560
I think you'll find the view better than in the basement.

779
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,580
In fact...

780
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,240
You see why I can trust you.

781
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,410
Why I'm not worried about you betraying me and escaping.

782
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,960
Yes. I see.
