[in Spanish] Good morning.

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,860
Good morning, Mom.

00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,156
- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,783
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,326
- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting.

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,164
- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

8
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,041
- 6:40 a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,961
Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,132
- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

11
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,093
I still have to buy the
books, everything.

12
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,512
I told you I'll ask him,
my love, all right?

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,350
And you still haven't tied your shoes.
So, like I taught you, right?

14
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,854
We have the rabbit ear, we
go around the tree, and...?

15
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,272
And it goes in the hole.

[Steve] You threaten a man's family,
and you find out what he's made of.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,751
Pablo Escobar was made of
rage, revenge and terror.

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,465
Unable to lash out directly
at his enemies in Cali,

21
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,343
he went after their prized
legitimate business,

22
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,847
one they couldn't hide: their
beloved chain of drugstores.

23
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:43,394
And he blew them to shit along with anyone
unlucky enough to be standing nearby.

24
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,064
We're talking dozens of bombs.

25
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:51,444
He put the city of Bogotá on edge and
the Colombian government on notice.

26
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:56,616
Continue to ignore Los Pepes, refuse to
acknowledge their crimes, and you're next.

But terror brings more terror,

29
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,624
and Los Pepes responded with
their own special brand.

30
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,918
We came up with a name
for their displays.

31
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,796
- [in Spanish] Sit him there.
- [Steve] Colombian folk art.

[Steve] Like I said, you
can't make this shit up.

No matter how far you go...

[in Spanish] Look at that

...we'll take it one step further.

39
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,734
The gates of hell were

One... two... and three.

41
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,533
And everyone was scrambling
to get out of the fire.

42
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,702
Or climb into it.

- [Tata] Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

47
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,885
- [Hermilda] We shouldn't leave, Tata.
- [Tata] All of this is your fault.

48
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,846
If you'd listened to Pablo, my
brother would still be alive.

49
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,727
[Hermilda] Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

50
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:35,775
When you're always criticizing
him, doubting him, worrying.

[Hermilda] I would never

Tell her, Pablo.

55

Tell her it's not my fault, Pablo.

56

- [whispers] I know, Mom.
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.

00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:03,469
It's not your fault. I know.
It's not your fault.

We didn't want to make
you uncomfortable, Judy.

66
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:29,097
How considerate of you. So
that's why no one called me?

67
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,351
Because this lab belongs
to the Moncadas. Mmm?

68
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,730
So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

69
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,943
- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

70
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,864
- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

71
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,117
That is my cocaine.

72
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,705
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellín

73
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,583
until Pablo Escobar is dead.

74
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,045
That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.

75
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,007
That's the Cali cartel's strategy?

76
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,635
To keep making money while
the rest of us go hungry?

77
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:12,473
- You know we can't trust them.
- No. Not them or any of you.

78
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,353
We don't trust any drug trafficker.

Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.
All right?

What's bothering you?

00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,225
The killing of innocent
civilians, for starters.

Whether they're innocent
or guilty, I don't decide.

That's what priests are for, no?

The Castaños are crazier than ever,
and that wasn't part of the plan.

00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,245
But it's working.

Not if I stop providing you intel.

As far as the methods

105

well, those are the methods that have
Pablo's people hiding like rats.

I need you to help me find him.

He's Pablo's mouthpiece and his

What we want is to exterminate this rat.

00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,971
Confess. Do you regret it?

159
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,348
Marrying me, or what?

160
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,684
Not for a second.

161
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,948
[softly] They may separate us...

162
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,495
but they'll never be able to destroy us.

163
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,881
Go.

164
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,895
[whispers] The little bunny.
The little bunny.

165
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,147
I'll take care of him, all right?

166
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,441
Give me a kiss.

167
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,123

[sighs]

169
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:40,040
[Steve] Pablo was right. The government
couldn't stop his family from leaving.

170
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,920
But if you remember, he had some
bad history with Avianca Airlines.

171
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,092
And they made sure as
shit that everybody knew

172
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,636
the Escobars were
trying to fly the coop.

173
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,768
[in English] What we know is that
Escobar bought tickets for his family

174
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,272
on eight different outgoing
flights from Bogotá.

175
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,942
Destinations ranging from
Barcelona to Toronto.

176
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,528
Mr. President, we need to
prevent that from happening.

177
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,240
We need to keep the family in play.
If they're allowed to leave Colombia,

178
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,242
we're gonna lose leverage
in the hunt for Escobar.

179
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,746
Legally, there's no way we can stop
them from flying out of the country.

180
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,247
By applying pressure behind the scenes,

181
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,458
we can prevent the family from
being accepted upon arrival.

182
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,087
And if they're kept in Colombia, he's
gonna be worried about their safety.

183
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:33,302
He'll be more likely to make phone
contact, more likely to... make mistakes.

184
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,681
Because they're more likely to
become victims of Los Pepes.

185
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,691
Mr. President... if the family gets safe
haven, there's no telling what comes next.

186
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,904
Maybe Escobar surrenders,
maybe he goes to war.

187
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,784
The family is leverage.
We have to use it.

188
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,669
I agree.

189
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,927
I want one of your people with them
giving us updates, running interference,

190
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,055
and have them find out where they're
going. And stick with them.

- Hey, it's Messina.

194
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,616
I need you to grab your passport
and head to Bogotá International.

195
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,534
Where?

196
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,954
The Escobars are trying to flee the
country. Wherever they go, follow them.

197
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,332
- Yeah. When?
- Now. Once you spot them, check in.

198
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,335
- And Murphy, keep this under wraps.
- Yes, ma'am.

199
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,838
Who was that?

200
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,214
Messina.

201
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,344
- Where you going?
- Going out.

202
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,472
- With your passport?
- Yep.

203
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,724
- Oh, that's all I get?
- Yep.

[indistinct chatter over PA]

Uh, I'd like to get
some tickets, please.

206
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,596
For... which flight, sir?

207
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
Let's see. Madrid, London...

208
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,465
It's Murphy. Get me Messina.

209
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,435
Messina.

210
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,118
Hey, it's me. It's
the Frankfurt flight.

211
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,888
Germany. Shit.

212
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,933
Yes, Mr. Foreign Minister, but I'm not
talking about some Turkish date farmer

213
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,729
looking to drive a taxi in Berlin. I'm
talking about Pablo Escobar's family.

214
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,606
[sighs]

215
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,651
No. No, they haven't
committed any crimes.

216
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,946
[Steve] Due to events in
their fairly recent past,

217
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,658
Germany had some of the softest
immigration standards in Europe.

218
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,079
If you had a pulse, they
tended to let you in.

219
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,041
Now maybe that was good for mankind,

220
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,294
and it was certainly
good for the Escobars.

221
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,421
It was very bad for us.

222

[opera music plays on radio]

[clears throat]

225
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,816
The colonel's son.

226
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,947
He said you have some
technical background.

227
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,534
I took a couple of
engineering classes, sir.

228
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,205
And I built a ham in my parents' house.

229
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,335
Great. What do you know about RDF?

230
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,298
The basic concept, sir.

231
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,134
The basic concept.

232
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,098
All right.

233
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,978
Get acquainted. We go
out tomorrow afternoon.

234
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,604
And don't worry.

Unlike Carlos Castaño,
this won't hit back.

Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you not working?

Get to work. I'm not
paying you with candy.

Hey, boss. I just came
back from the airport.

We hit those fucking
drugstores pretty hard.

You tell us. Should we come home or...

No. Stay put. We're not done yet.

- I may need you again.
- Mmm.

Check this out. Ran him
through the CNP database.

Your boy's wanted.

- For what?
- Kidnapping and car theft.

I think Fernando Duque's on the run.
He's got his kid with him.

282
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,671
If he's that scared, maybe he's willing
to drop privilege and cooperate.

Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I...

I might have an idea
where he's holed up.

If he comes through for us, you think
we can get him out of the country?

00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,371
All of the money this family has, we
have because I've been a good lawyer.

314
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,541
- I do my job.
- I want to call my mom.

315
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,710
You want to call your mom?

316
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,213
Do you want to call your mom, or
do you want to behave like a man?

317
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,051
Are you going to be a pussy and
call your mom? That's a great idea.

318
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,637
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

319
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,433
Your room full of toys. Where
do you think it came from?

320
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,645
Hmm? You didn't complain during
the Christmases or the birthdays

321
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,981
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

322
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,651
But now you're complaining. Very well.
Very well. It's over.

323
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,490
It's over! Now that they're
going to kill me, it's over.

324
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,709
[Simon sniffles softly]

325
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,253
I'm sorry... Simon.

326
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,257
[whispers] I didn't mean to say that.

327
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,550
Forgive me.

328
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,805
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

329
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,484
[air hissing]

330
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,156
Was it a heart attack or what?

331
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,699
[Ricardo] You fainted, Pablo.

332
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,747
How many of those are you taking?

333
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,544
I've had a terrible headache.

334
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,422
- Those aren't any good, Pablo.
- [removes blood pressure cuff]

335
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,049
You shouldn't put so
much shit in your body.

336
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:45,598
You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

337
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,977
Three drops under your tongue in
the morning and two at night.

338
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,697
Have you ever been to Disney World?

339
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,241
I haven't.

340
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,162
It's beautiful.

341
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,208
It's very organized. Very clean.

342
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,339
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

343
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,259
Stress.

344
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,886
[Pablo] Mmm.

345
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,512
Stress is dangerous.

346
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,098
How's the weed working out?

347
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,060
I haven't been smoking a lot.

348
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:37,650
The first man who smoked
marijuana was a Chinese emperor.

349
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,863
He burned the plant because he
was attracted to its smell.

350
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,533
But when he inhaled the
smoke, he saw a blue jay.

351
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,415
And the bird told him to conquer
his neighboring empires.

352
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,083
And that's what he did.

353
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,547
All right.

354
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,843
With you until death, Don Pablo.

355
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,304
Thank you.

356
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,601
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

357
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,983
All right. Thank you.

358
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,877
Let's see, darling.
Color inside the lines.

359
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,880
There it is.

360
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,651
[woman speaks in German over PA]

361
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,408
[woman in English] Attention,
ladies and gentlemen:

362
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,828
We will be passing around
immigration cards.

363
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,296
[low chatter]

364
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,631
[quietly in Spanish] This is our stop.

365
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,555
Foreign ministry isn't cooperating.
We need more time.

366
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,682
Don't let them leave the airport.

367
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,728
- They do, it's over.
- Right, right, right. Talk to you soon.

368
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,908
Sir, I'm with the United States DEA.

369
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,577
There's passengers on this flight who
can't be allowed into this country.

370
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,748
Heard of Pablo Escobar? Cocaine? That's
his family. You can't allow them in.

371
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,668
Unless there is a problem with their
passports or any type of contraband,

372
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,878
they may enter Germany.

373
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,631
[murmuring indistinctly in Spanish]

374
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,468
What about if they're transporting a
large amount of foreign currency?

375
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,971
- [man] You would be certain of this how?
- I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.

376
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,058
I work with the DEA, been with this
family, I've been tracking Escobar

377
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,061
for a long goddamn fucking time.
It is in that bag.

378
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,480
- [man] In which item of luggage?
- [Steve] The maroon bag.

379
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,565
- [man speaks in German]
- Perdón?

380
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,109
- [man in English] Do you speak English?
- No.

381
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,237
I'm a hundred percent certain.
That burgundy bag.

382
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,156
Fucking hell.

383
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,910
[speaks German]

384
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,705
- Hello. Pablo Escobar? Familia Escobar?
- Sí.

385
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,748
[speaks in German]

386
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,501
- [in English] You speak English? German?
- No.

387
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,835
[speaking German]

388
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,462
- [in Spanish] What's going on?
- What's happening?

389
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,838
[man in English] Come with us.

390
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,809
[in Spanish] What's going on?

391
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,240
[Tata] Can you give
me back my passport?

392
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,470
[Steve] To be honest, I'd never
actually seen any cash in the bag.

393
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,391
[in Spanish] That money is ours.

394
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,352
[Steve] But I knew Pablo would
never let his wife go anywhere

395
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,854
without some serious
walking around money.

396
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,953
[Tata] Pablo, they're
not letting us in.

397
00:33:03,978 --> 00:33:05,549
No, no! They can't do that.

398
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,277
- That's what they're doing.
- They can't...

399
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,532
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

400
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,866
Don't worry, because...

401
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,954
Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

402
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,707
- [man speaks German]
- [in Spanish] Don't touch me!

403
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,001
- [in English] Please come now.
- [Tata in Spanish] Let go!

404
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,128
[grunts, hangs up]

405
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,731
[car alarm blaring]

406
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,754
[grunts, exhales]

407
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,174
- [door opens]
- No, no, no! No!

408
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,052
- Shh.
- [sharp breaths]

409
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,848
Fernando Duque.

410
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,350
Javier Peña.

411
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,271
[in Spanish] It took me
one day to find you.

412
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:29,108
If you don't want them to kill you, you
need to start doing things better.

413
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,823
[softly] Please... get me out of here.

414
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,827
Please get me out of Colombia. Do you
know who I work for? Who I worked for?

415
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,580
Well, our help isn't free.

416
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,335
We need full cooperation.

417
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,879
[Simon] Dad!

418
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,257
Hey, Simon, it's all right.

419
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,178
It's all right. Uh, go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

420
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:04,936
It's my son. He's... He's scared.

421
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,856
First, we'll get you to Holguín.
You'll be safe...

422
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,610
No, no, no! No. No, no.
No, we're staying here.

423
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,864
There are cops working for
Los Pepes everywhere.

424
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,453
It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

425
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,333
I'll cooperate with you.
[stammers] Anything you want.

426
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,044
I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

427
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,421
Is that a deal?

428
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,759
[silent]

429
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,679
Do as I say.

430
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,225
Start by hiding your fucking wife's car.

431
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,402
[Steve] While the authorities were using
all the political pressure they could

432
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,863
to keep Escobar's family in play,

433
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,741
Pablo was practicing his own
special form of diplomacy.

434
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,826
[dialing phone]

435
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,370
- [ringing]
- First, he called the German embassy

436
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,580
in Bogotá.

437
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,292
[in Spanish] Hello, German embassy.

438
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:14,797
First of all, I'll kill every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

439
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,010
Then I will bomb Frankfurt, Munich...

440
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,096
[Steve] Then he threatened to bomb
a couple of Lufthansa planes.

441
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,018
[Pablo] I'm going to shove bombs up
your asses, you bastard motherfuckers.

442
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:31,898
Nazi, racist gonorrheas. I'm going
to kill all of you. You hear?

443
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,858
I'm going to kill all of you!

444
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:34,775
[dialing]

445
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,445
[Steve] Then he dialed
up President Gaviria.

446
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,488
Who couldn't take the call.

447
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,992
Because he was already on the
phone with the German ambassador.

448
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:51,834
And then, Pablo did something he'd
never done before in his life.

449
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,671
He called a cop and he asked for help.

450
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,800
Not just any cop, but the
top cop in the country:

451
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,928
Attorney General De Greiff.

452
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:08,059
I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

453
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,772
I imagine that also applies
to my family, correct?

454
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,235
The government hasn't done
anything to stop Los Pepes,

455
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,989
those terrorists who have attacked my
family and murdered my associates.

456
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:27,286
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

457
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,874
The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany

458
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,501
and yet you do nothing about it.

459
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:38,965
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

460
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,760
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it.

461
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,641
[hangs up]

462
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,852
[chatter in Spanish]

463
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,655
- [static]
- There's a lot of interference.

464
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,367
Yes. Medellín has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

465
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,453
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

466
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,873
[sighs] To be honest, we
haven't located a signal yet.

467
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,709
Not one?

468
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,794
Not one.

469
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,382
[sighs]

470
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,012
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

471
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:31,767
Let's both start here: L9.329.

472
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,520
There it is.

473
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:48,576
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

474
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,581
None other than that son of a bitch,
Peña. What do you think about that?

475
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,834
Who's your contact?

476
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:01,672
Who he is isn't important. The
important thing is that I trust him.

477
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,884
And you know what the
worst part of this is?

478
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,053
We can no longer trust Peña.

479
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,014
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

480
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,267
No.

481
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,021
We can't kill DEA agents.

482
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,065
Oh, no? Why not?

483
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,737
If it were up to me, I'd
feed him to the crocodiles.

484
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,699
[Fidel] Berna, look...

485
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:40,544
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

486
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,381
We'll take care of the rest.

487
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,808

[engine revving]

490
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,486
[in English] Agent Peña.

491
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,613
[soft Latin music plays on radio]

492
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,950
I don't think Don Berna's
gonna make it tonight.

493
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,006
What is this?

494
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,716
Just a friendly chat.

495
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:15,181
You're making some very scary
people pretty nervous, Javier.

496
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,393
Which puts me in a spot because...

497
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,438
I'm the one who suggested they
approach you in the first place.

498
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:28,319
Now, I don't know what you
know about what it is I do,

499
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,321
but understand this:

500
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,866
I have our nation's long-term
interests in mind.

501
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,951
That's the beat I walk.

502
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,455
And sitting here tonight, that
means making sure the right folks

503
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,875
are left standing when
Escobar gets his bullet.

504
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,631
So do Uncle Sam a solid.

505
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,384
Don't complicate that.

506
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,021
These folks are prone to
emotional decision-making.

507
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:10,152
Which can lead to bush league nonsense
like... killing a federal agent.

508
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,823
By the way, they found the lawyer.

509
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,451
Even without your help, so...

we'll have a goalie in place.

513
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,877
Leonel Álvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along. Ooh-wee!

514
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,755
[in English] Trujillo! You
follow me to the fucking hotel?

515
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,881
Huh?

516
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,385
[whispers in Spanish] Did you follow
me to the hotel? You told Berna?

517
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,888
Let go.

518
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,765
Tell me, asshole.

519
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,351
- Let go! It's all right.
- [man] What's the problem?

520
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,145
[Trujillo] I'll catch up.
Everything's fine.

521
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,231
What's going on, Peña?

522
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,319
Playing the fucking American?

523
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,198
[softly] Did you see what
they did to his son?

524
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,912
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

525
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,084
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

526
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,296
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

527
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:06,912
[De Greiff] I understand that you're
trying to prevent Escobar's family

528
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,122
from entering Germany.

529
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,957
Let's make something clear:

530
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,628
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only...

531
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,463
No, Mr. President.

532
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:24,346
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

533
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,642
For me? How so?

534
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,896
I know that you want Escobar dead.

535
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,359
And while I don't agree
with that, I understand it.

536
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,614
But this... this I can't understand.

537
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,702
This isn't just wrong.

538
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:53,584
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

539
00:45:55,002 --> 00:46:01,216
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

540
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,191
[speaking in German]

541
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,531
[man in Spanish] I'm sorry to inform you,
your entry into Germany has been denied.

542
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,454
I know my rights, sir. But
you don't understand.

543
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,789
My children are in danger. Send
me any place other than Colombia.

[speaking in German]

545
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:40,130
[in Spanish] Tell him the children are
under age. We just want to live in peace.

546
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,507
We just want to live in...

547
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:47,304
No, no, no. Tell him
that's all we want to do.

548
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,556
To live in peace.

549
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,019
Get the children and your belongings.

550

Please.

[Hermilda in Spanish] I know. I'm going.

554
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,660
What is this? Why are we
being treated this way?

555
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,870
[Tata] You can't treat
us like criminals.

556

put you under protective custody.
