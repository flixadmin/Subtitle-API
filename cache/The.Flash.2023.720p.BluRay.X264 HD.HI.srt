If that briefcase
falls into the water,

168
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,434
it could wipe out half
of Gotham by lunchtime.

- [Batman] Damn it.
- Please don't drop me.

171
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:46,573
Oh, God, no. Please,
please don't.

172
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:47,617
No!

[Wonder Woman theme playing]

174
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,451
Sorry I'm late.

175
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:02,284
Watch your step.

176
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:04,808
- Hi.
- Hey.

177
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,638
Nice suit.

178
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:09,900
Looking good, Flash.

179
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:11,946
Oh, uh... Thank... Uh...

180
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,383
And you...

181
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:15,981
are welcome.

182
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:18,241
My ego's far too big to say
"thank you" to someone else.

183
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,267
Hmm.

184
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,192
I developed this...

185
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:25,903
all-powerful persona to compensate
for my childhood trauma...

186
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:27,538
I, too, have childhood trauma.

[Wonder Woman] never gets old.

190
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:36,251
I'd do a lot better just giving all my money away. Yes,
if I really wanted to end crime, I should end poverty.

191
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,130
I know sex exists.

192
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:40,287
I've just never experienced it.

193
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:42,538
Damn it.

194
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:43,775
Well...

195
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,324
I have to run.

00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:46,785
Yeah.

197
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,239
Always a pleasure.

198
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:53,064
The sex thing was a metaphor...

199
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:54,927
for gothic literature.

200
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,836
There was just no way
to recover from that.

201
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,599
Just let it go.

202

needs his breakfast.

00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:07,654
Yeah. Bye, Batman.

The road to destruction.

211
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,964
This was never about her.

212
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:24,508
This is about you.

213
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,341
You have to stop
living in the past.

214
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,560
Now, was that fast
enough for you?

Ah, look who's here.

[Barry] Shut up, Albert.

219
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,572
Every day. I don't know
how you do it, Barry.

220
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,260
What'd you, like,
crawl here, bro?

221
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:49,989
- Is he mad?
- Well, you're getting fired.

222
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,861
-[Albert] You're getting murdered.
-Oh, no, no, no.

223
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,235
Let me guess.

224
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,070
Your alarm clock didn't go off.

225
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,011
- No...
- Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

226
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,047
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

227
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:03,031
Your keys' grandmother died,
and they need a personal day.

228
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:05,382
- It was none of those things.
- What was it this time, Barry?

229
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,235
It was, um, something else

230
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,001
that was far less outlandish.

231
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:11,264
And I know I missed
the meeting...

232
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,223
but I'd still really like to present
these case files for potential review.

233
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:14,684
I think we rushed these cases.

234
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,624
- We need to reopen them.
- Oh! Rushed?

235
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,726
We got a backlog six months deep,
and you want us to move slower?

236
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,825
You need to focus your motion.

237
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,331
Do the work, close
the case, move on.

238

[sighs]

239
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,514
You have a lot of
potential, Barry.

240
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:31,368
You shouldn't still be getting
me coffee after all these years.

241
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:34,091
You're right.
That's... That's true.

242
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,169
Go get me a coffee.

You're gonna love this.

I'm very satisfied with the
ruling in the Johnson case.

248
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:00,646
The evidence our lab analyzed...

249
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:04,114
was more than sufficient
to be conclusive.

250
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,837
- I'm still working that evidence.
- Because of the diligence

251
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:08,951
and hard work and focus...

252
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:11,500
Barry was still working
on that evidence. [laughs]

253
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,106
Think if it were up to you

254
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,365
that we'd still be scraping
Ted Bundy's molars.

255
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,760
You know what? I'm so happy
you find this all so hilarious,

256
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:22,505
but we are dealing with real
people's lives, people's families.

257
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,706
And I don't think you can
grasp the gravity of that.

258
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:26,429
So, why don't you
leave me alone?

259
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,693
- [woman] Barry Allen?
- Iris West.

260
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:30,450
You...

261
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:32,756
know my full name also.

262
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:34,552
Yes, from school.

263
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,729
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us
you had a friend from school.

264
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,602
- We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend.
- Wow.

265
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,425
[Albert] Yeah, what
does that make it now?

266
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:41,493
- One?
- One.

267
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,933
[laughs] You guys are so...

268

Um, bye, you guys.

269
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,509
Okay. Oh, my God.
That was just...

270
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,106
Um...

271
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,394
They're not really my friends.
They're my work friends.

272
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,688
Do you work here?

273
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,215
Yes, I do.

274
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,067
God, it's been a long time, huh?

275
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,876
Hmm.

276
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:00,295
I feel like we saw each other...

277
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:02,307
like a few years ago, right?

278
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,830
No, because...

279
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:06,224
we haven't seen
each other since...

280

281
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:08,574
Ah.

282
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:12,012
Maybe I was just
thinking about you.

283
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:14,232
Well, I'm really
glad I ran into you.

284
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:15,798
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

285
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:18,018
Your father's appeal
is tomorrow, right?

286
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:20,673
Yeah. How...

287
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,327
Sorry, how do you
know about that?

288
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,329
I'm covering it for the paper.

289
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:25,286
Oh.

290
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,940
How is he holding up?

291
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,153
Um...

292
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,877
Are you asking for the paper?

293
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:33,269
- No, I'm asking as a friend.
- Oh.

294
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:36,123
Although I'm sure the public
would want to know as well.

295
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:39,982
Well...

296
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,887
my only official comment
is that my dad is innocent.

297
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:43,870
Right.

298
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,700
I mean, no one...

299
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:48,374
would want to believe that their
father killed their mother.

300
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:51,554
What do you mean, "believe"?
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

301
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,060
My mom should be alive. It's
not about what I believe.

302
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:57,250
- It's about what the truth is.
- Right. No, yes, that's...

303
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,754
Oh, my God. That's
what I meant.

304
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,700
Right.

305
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:03,310
Sorry, I have no official
comment at this time.

00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:33,700
- Do you wish to accept?
- Yes.

00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,567
- Hey, Dad.
- [Henry Allen] Hey, Barry.

312
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,551
- How ya doing?
- I'm fine.

- You getting out much?
- Yeah.

Well, no. Uh, no.

315
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:45,472
But I, um, I ran into
an old college friend...

316
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:47,281
Iris West, today.

317
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,351
Didn't you have a
monster crush on her?

318
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:50,942
Well, she have a boyfriend?

319
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:54,623
- Why don't you ask her out?
- Dad, I, um...

320
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:58,652
I had a friend run the old security
camera footage from the store...

321
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:01,245
through this new
program he's developed.

322
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,664
And it's crystal clear now.

323
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:04,820
It's just...

324
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,255
you never look up, Dad.

325
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,286
You can't see your face.

326
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:15,010
So, without new evidence
to support your alibi...

327
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:17,364
we're just gonna need to start
thinking about the next appeal.

328
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,505
No, uh-uh. You need to stop
worrying about your old man.

329
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,983
Do that, you might actually
have time for a girlfriend.

330
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:27,200
But Dad, I don't want...

331
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:28,618
We've done this before.

332
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:30,122
This was a last-ditch effort...

333
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:32,889
and we'll go through
the motions tomorrow.

334
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:35,075
I'm okay, really.

335
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,700
You know, sometimes I even think it's
probably easier for me to be in here

336
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:39,986
than out there...

337
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:42,661
without her.

338

343
00:19:57,183 --> 00:19:58,793
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

344
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:02,343
Hey, remember that sauce
she'd make on Sundays?

345
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,241
The whole house would
smell like basil, tomatoes.

346
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:08,903
And she'd put on my
sweats and start singing.

Yeah, what was that song?

349
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:14,697
I loved that song.

This question is stupid.

How many calculations can you
think of with an answer of 24?

355
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:31,805
There are a bajillion answers.

How am I supposed
to fit them all?

357
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:36,931
You are right. There are a
bajillion answers to this question.

358

Not every problem
has a solution.

You have a can of tomatoes.

I need another one.

You're getting gray, actually.

00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:56,851
And, um, I probably could've
been less sensitive.

491
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:59,685
I mean, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

492
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:02,722
It's like you lost both
parents in one day.

493
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:04,619
I did.

494
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:06,349
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

495
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:09,420
and I lost my dad to the
failures of the justice system.

496
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:12,590
Is that why you got
into criminal forensics?

497
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,130
To try and fix the system?

498
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:18,692
Yeah.

499
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,239
Yeah, to fix it.

500
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,746
There's gotta be a
way to fix it, right?

501
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:26,469
I mean, that's kinda why I
got into journalism, too.

502
00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:28,677
I could make it right if I
could just go back somehow

503
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:31,861
and warn them without them
knowing that I'd warned them.

504
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:34,149
I... thinking like that's
gonna... [chuckle softly]

505
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:35,871
drive you crazy.

506
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,647
"If I could just
go back in time...

507
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:38,888
and stop the guy
who did it." It's...

508
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:41,329
No, I can't do that, 'cause
that's way too much interaction.

509
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:42,280
[chuckles]

510
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:45,595
My dad wasn't even at home.

511
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,057
My mom sent him to go
get a can of tomatoes.

512
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:50,415
I think whoever broke into the
house thought it was empty.

513
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,618
And then my mom was in there
with the knife in her hand

514
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:55,133
and things went bad,
just this absurd

515
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:56,442
chain of events.

516
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:59,841
And it's like, this footage should've
finally supported my dad's alibi.

517
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,200
But instead...

518
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:04,239
three lives ruined
for a can of tomatoes.

519
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:11,807
Oh, my God.

520
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:13,283
What?

521
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,396
Well, that could be it.

522
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:18,138
If my mom doesn't forget the
tomatoes in the first place,

523
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:20,426
then he never leaves
and she never dies.

524
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:23,262
No one would even
have to see me.

525
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,873
Bruce said no interaction.
This is no interaction.

526
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:26,294
This is just quick
in, quick out,

527
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,961
back to the present, like
I was never even there.

528
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,770
That's how I fix it.
Oh, my God, Iris.

529
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,333
- Hmm?
- Thank you, so much.

530
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:32,707
- This has been great.
- Oh.

531
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:34,586
Um... I'm sorry.

532
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:37,255
I... I have to leave.

533
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,495
Okay. Right.

534
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,896
- Uh...
- [door closes]

535

the way. We should do this again.

Don't forget the tomatoes.

See you soon.

Barry? And he's early?

You've cut your hair.

Now you can see your eyes.

- You look terrible.
- Henry!

- You look old.
- You look beautiful, baby.

to you over there?

Come here.

I love you, too.

"Old," seriously?

00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,551
Well, no, I mean like mature.

587
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,534
He's at that age, he
wants to look old.

588
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:12,927
He, you know, gets
into bars that way.

589
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:14,685
How can I help?

590
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:22,971
Mm. Hey, Mom,
how was your day?

591
00:35:23,015 --> 00:35:25,017
How was your month,
or your last 18 years?

592
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,453
Or that's a weird question...

593
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:28,020
'cause I was here.

594
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,762
But obviously, we share
those memories together.

595
00:35:30,805 --> 00:35:32,609
Or I don't know, maybe we
could make some new memories.

596
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,473
Like we could go to the
aquarium, or the circus,

597
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:36,376
or to the park and you
could push me on a swing.

598
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,335
That's also weird
because I'm an adult now,

599
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:40,511
so I'd probably motivate
my own motion on a swing.

600
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,497
So, how was it this
week? How's school?

601
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:47,256
At school was... is good.

602
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,867
- Mm.
- School's been great.

603
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,652
I've just been working
really hard there on my...

604
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:52,880
studies.

605
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,534
Did you ask out
that girl from econ?

606
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:57,223
I know freshman year is about

607
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:59,804
going out, meeting people, okay?

608
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:00,917
Exploring things.

609
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:03,154

Oh, shit.

00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:11,607
I... have to shit.

Help!

00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:23,836
Shh! Why are you here?

619
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:24,785
What year is it?

620
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,080
- No, no, no.
- Help!

621
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:35,435
That's my face.

622
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:37,427
You stole my face.

00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:39,396

mushroom flashback?

Eighteen.

00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:54,234
Whoa.

627
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:56,674
This is mad trippy.

628
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,240
So, we're, like, in the future.

629
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:00,765
No, wait. This is
not trippy, dude.

630
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:04,943
This is catastrophic. And no, we're not in the
future. I was supposed to be back in the present,

631
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:06,107
but I'm still in the past.

632
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,146
And there's not supposed
to be two of me.

633
00:37:08,202 --> 00:37:10,397
You and I are not supposed to be
occupying the same reality at all,

634
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:12,115
let alone interacting.

635
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,536
I just can't believe I'm a
superhero who time travels...

636
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:17,583
No, no, no. You
are not anything.

637
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:20,438
Which is good. You don't want
to be a superhero. It's scary.

638
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:23,902
And I get bug splatter
in my teeth all the time.

Awesome.

640
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,487
Hey, do the thing again.

641
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:28,724
No, we don't have time.

642
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:32,753
- Mom!
- Shh!

643
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:34,517
What are you doing?
You're gonna tattle now?

- Fine.

- Yeah. Yeah.
- Happy?

647
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,157
Now undo it.

00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:07,286
[Nora] Barry, are
you okay up there?

652
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,914
[both] We're fine! I'm fine!

653
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:10,550
[Nora] Okay, Monkey.

654
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:13,230
So, do you have like a
plane that goes underwater?

655
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:15,867
Or like a boat that can fly?

656
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:17,067
How old are you, like 40?

657
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:19,137
Okay, you don't stop talking.

658
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:22,252
It's not charming. It's
abrasive and exhausting.

659
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:25,193
And, oh, my God. I am starting
to realize what people mean.

660
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:26,599
Just...

661
00:38:26,624 --> 00:38:28,068
do me a favor

662
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:31,701
and promise me that meeting me
isn't gonna screw up space-time.

663
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,292
Broski...

664
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,130
I got you.

665
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,505
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

666
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:37,699
What do you mean?

667
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:40,038
What do I do?

668
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,740
I could drug you.

669
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:44,071
Yeah, I could drug you,

670
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:45,509
and then you'd pass
out, you'd wake up

671
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:47,021
and you'd forget that
anything ever happened.

672
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:48,668
And it wouldn't be wrong,
right? Because you're me.

673
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,388
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

674
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,765
- Please don't... drug me.
- No.

675
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,594
No. Because here's the thing,
and I thought about it before.

676
00:38:54,618 --> 00:38:56,141
I don't want to be drugged.

677
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:59,231
But I'm sure we can
think of another way.

678
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:00,711
Let's put on our
Barry thinking caps

679
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:02,713
and think of a
different solution

680
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,192
for memory loss.

681
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:06,151
Also, I'm a green belt...

682
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,631
in the capoeira,

683
00:39:07,674 --> 00:39:09,720
and I have extensively
studied wrestler,

684
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:12,461
and I could just go
frickin' lunatic on you.

685
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:13,700
Besides, I have
a date tonight...

686
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:14,725
[speech stops]

687
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:18,729
Okay.

688
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,837
How hard do you have to hit
someone to make them forget stuff?

689
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,560
If I hit you in the past,
will it hurt me in the future?

690
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:25,387
Wait. You say you
have a date tonight?

691
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,085
Yeah. Wait, what
were you doing?

692
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:29,043
Uh, nothing. Who's
your date with?

693
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:32,090
This super babe
in my econ class.

694
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,328
- Iris West?
- Oh, my God!

695
00:39:34,353 --> 00:39:35,659
Do we marry her?

696
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:37,381
You're going on a
date with her tonight?

697
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:39,004
That's why I need
Mom to do my laundry.

698
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:40,901
You don't even do
your own laundry?

699
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:41,839
Do you?

700
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,076
Okay.

701
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,191
- I'm actually gonna go.
- What do you mean?

702
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:48,019
Enjoy your life. Do you.

703
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:50,195
Change literally nothing.

704
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:52,565
- Um, I'll see you again never.
- I have a few more questions, though.

705
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:54,503
We have so much to
learn from each other.

706
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:55,809
[thunder rumbles]

707
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:56,897
Oh, great.

708
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,377
Well, you're leaving me.

709
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,335
And now the storm's
gonna ruin my date.

710
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:02,511
What day is it today?

711
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:06,254
Uh... Uh...

712
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:08,300
Sunday?

713
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:09,301
No, the date.

714
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,037
It's September 29th.

715
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:14,828
Shit.

716
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:18,571
This storm, this is the day.

717
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:21,008
- What day?
- The day I got my powers.

718
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,228
The day you get your powers.

719
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:25,970
- Powers?
- Listen...

720
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:27,773
I can't tell you why I
traveled back in time,

721
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:30,409
and I can't tell
you what I changed.

722
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:33,020
But, essentially, in
my version of reality,

723
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,153
I ended up interning at
the Central City Crime Lab

724
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:37,851
in my freshman year, and
that's where it happened.

725
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,380
Well, happens.

726
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:42,421
Tonight, September 29, the
accident that gives me my powers.

727
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:44,075
And if you're not there...

728
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,077
in 30 minutes...

729
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:49,210
then you won't get the powers.

730
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:52,039
Which means I don't
get the powers, maybe?

731
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,086
And then, that would
mean that I lose my way

732
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:57,088
of getting back in time
in the first place,

733
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:59,177
and then I literally have
no idea what happens.

734
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,179
Powers?

735
00:41:01,222 --> 00:41:02,963
[thunder crashes]

736
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:05,009
[laughs gleefully]

737
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:06,706
Wait, but what about
our date tonight?

738
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,578
She might be our future wife.

739
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:12,451
There might not be a future...

740
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:14,279
if you don't come with me...

741
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:15,410
right now.

742
00:41:15,454 --> 00:41:17,064
[thunder cracks]

743
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,720
Eight minutes.

744
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:25,680
How are we gonna to get
inside? What are you doing?

745
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:27,031
Would you stop whining?

746
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:29,555
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

[shushing]

751
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:57,950
[softly] Yes, it's okay.
It's called phasing.

752
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:59,063
Come on.

753
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,197
I love phasing.

761
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:36,317
Well... this is it.

762
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:38,406
This is where I was sitting.

763
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,713
And actually, let me
take this for you.

764
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:42,062
Thank you.

765
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:44,521
Okay, I had just
opened those windows...

766
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:48,068
to clear out the fumes.

767
00:42:49,115 --> 00:42:50,331
Right around now.

768
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,290
And I was sitting in that chair,

769
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,133
and I was right under
this shelf of chemicals.

770
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:56,163
And that's when
the lightning hits.

771
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,469
Wait.

772
00:42:57,512 --> 00:42:59,012
- I get hit by lightning?
- No, no, no.

773
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:00,559
You don't get hit by lightning.

774
00:43:00,602 --> 00:43:01,928
Okay, 'cause for a second
I thought you said...

775
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:03,312
The lightning hits
the chemicals...

776
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:04,955
which then you get bathed in,

777
00:43:04,998 --> 00:43:06,913
- and that's what electrocutes you.
- Okay,

778
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,761
- but I don't want to be electrocuted, though.
- Sit down.

779
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:10,917
- No, you sit down.
- I already have the powers!

780
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,067
You already have the powers!

781
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,021
Exactly!

782
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:15,341
I am not getting
struck by lightning!

00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,990
[Barry] Why is your
place so much nicer

816
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:53,055
- than I expected it to be?
- [past Barry] You like it?

817
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,081
Mom had to help decorate.

818
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,300
You know Mom.

819
00:45:56,343 --> 00:45:58,824
Right, yeah. Classic Mom.

820
00:45:58,867 --> 00:45:59,896
Classic Mom.

821
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:01,435
[grunts]

822
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:03,742
Hmm.

823
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,965
- What a day.
- Barry,

824
00:46:09,008 --> 00:46:10,357
the accident gave you powers,

825
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,011
but took mine away.

826
00:46:12,055 --> 00:46:14,144
So, I don't know how I get back.

827
00:46:14,187 --> 00:46:15,580
Without access to
the Speed Force,

828
00:46:15,623 --> 00:46:18,235
I don't know how I ever leave.

829
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,411
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

830
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:22,543
- I might be stuck.
- Wait.

831
00:46:23,936 --> 00:46:25,232
I have powers now?

832
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:27,331
Yeah, but...

833
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:28,927
- you... No, no, no.
- [gasps]

Holy speedballs.

837
00:46:44,522 --> 00:46:46,741
Okay, I know this is
incredibly exciting,

838
00:46:46,785 --> 00:46:48,047
because I went through it.

839
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:49,353
Speedy Gonzales!

840
00:46:49,396 --> 00:46:51,529
Yes, I've done it
many times myself.

841
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:53,487
- You can't just start...
- [laughs, yells]

842
00:46:54,532 --> 00:46:56,055
Shit.

843

[muffled clattering]

866
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:38,592
What did you do?

867
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:40,507
Nothing. Why?

868
00:48:46,644 --> 00:48:47,669
Barry...

869
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:50,026
I could've told you about
the clothes. It's friction.

870
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:52,203
You run too fast, and regular
fabrics are gonna burn up.

871
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:55,316
It's the same reason why you can't
move people very far at hyperspeed.

872
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:57,151
That broccoli looks rotten.

873
00:48:57,176 --> 00:48:58,656
Look, some things you can move.

874
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,310
Like, you can move,

875
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:02,852
for instance, a microwave.

876
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:05,141
But you can't move
something like, say...

877
00:49:05,184 --> 00:49:06,437
- a baby.
- Barry,

878
00:49:06,462 --> 00:49:08,249
it's like I've never
eaten anything before.

879
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:11,973
Everything has this vivid
flavor. Try a little.

880
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:13,845
Just take a little bite.

881
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:14,924
That's bad, isn't it?

882
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:16,862
[laughs] Yeah, this is not
good. No, I was kidding.

883
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,825
- [gags]
- I'm amazing. We're amazing.

884
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,112
I'm so hungry.

885
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,594
Hey, wait.

886
00:49:23,637 --> 00:49:25,683
I wanna try that phasing
thing. How do I do that?

887
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:27,772
You don't. Not yet.

888
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:29,581
Okay? It's very complicated.

889
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:32,172
Takes a long time to train your
body to be able to speed up

890
00:49:32,197 --> 00:49:34,175
whilst your molecules slow
down enough to pass through

891
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,158
the molecular structure
of solid objects...

892
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:38,217
[muffled thud]

897
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,355
[door opens]

898
00:49:47,357 --> 00:49:49,794
You've gotta start letting
me finish my sentences.

899
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:52,797
Are we always this sleepy?

900
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,234
And hungry and naked?

901
00:49:55,278 --> 00:49:57,073
Well, the first two, yes.

902
00:49:57,098 --> 00:49:59,630
The third one, no. I've
figured that part out.

903
00:49:59,673 --> 00:50:01,327
And honestly, if
we're gonna do this

904
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:03,329
there's a lot I'm gonna
have to explain to you.

905
00:50:03,373 --> 00:50:05,810
So, a good place
to start, I guess,

906
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:08,595
is that, yeah, the original suit

907
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,799
- was actually made out of this polysynth...
- [snoring]

908
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:13,121
Or we'll

909
00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:15,036
pick this up tomorrow.

910
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,710
[past Barry] So, the
suit is inside the ring?

911
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:18,779
- Yeah.
- What?

912
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:21,073
And I can have this?

913
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:23,262
No, you can't have
it. You can borrow it

914
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:25,090
so you don't kill yourself
using your powers.

915
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:26,439
[whispering gibberish]

916
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:28,448
You're gonna push this button

917
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:30,202
and the silk molecules are gonna
uncoil, absorbing atmospheric gases

918
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:31,966
and expanding the
suit to full size.

919
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:33,185
Ready?

920
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:36,101
[clinks]

921
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:40,584
[dramatic music playing]

922
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:51,072
[laughing]

923
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,745
It was so tiny...

924
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,835
You're supposed to put it
on before it hits the floor.

925
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:56,904
What, like change...

926
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:58,558
right here in front of you?

927
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:00,406
There's no one even here
anyway, Barry. Come on...

928
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,651
- [exclaims] Whoo, man.
- Tight.

929
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:05,870
It hurts.

930
00:51:05,913 --> 00:51:07,393
You know where it hurts?

931
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:09,743
- In my dick.
- Okay. I know, I know,

932
00:51:09,787 --> 00:51:11,441
but I don't need to know.

933
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:13,573
- Sorry, can we move on?
- Mm-hmm.

934
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,271
Here's what I'm thinking.

935
00:51:15,314 --> 00:51:17,273
If I can train you
to move like I do,

936
00:51:17,316 --> 00:51:18,685
then we can re-create
the Chronobowl.

937
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:19,710
Chronobowl?

938
00:51:19,753 --> 00:51:20,711
In the Speed Force.

939
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:22,088
Speed Force?

940
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:26,170
-And then maybe we can find some way to get me back to the future.
-Back to the Future. Yes!

941
00:51:26,194 --> 00:51:27,631
Eric Stoltz

942
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:30,042
is chur boy in that movie.

943
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:32,132
What an embodied performance.

944
00:51:32,157 --> 00:51:33,985
You mean Michael J. Fox?

945
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:35,338
Back to the Future?

946
00:51:35,363 --> 00:51:38,403
-Yeah, in the movie Back to the Future?
-[woman] Oh, my God! [people clamoring]

947
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,831
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

948
00:51:50,044 --> 00:51:51,364
You need to take
the suit off now.

949
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:52,914
- Thank God.
- [distant sirens wailing]

950
00:51:58,444 --> 00:52:00,379
[man on TV] ...reported
seeing a mysterious object

951
00:52:00,403 --> 00:52:02,970
hovering above the
Australian seaboard.

952
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:05,190
- We've obtained footage from the sighting...
- Zod.

953
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:07,342
- and as you can see, the object...
- [past Barry] "Zod"?

954
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:10,456
- appears to be a flying ship of some sort.
- What's a zod?

955
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,763
[on TV] According to US
government officials,

956
00:52:12,806 --> 00:52:13,885
satellite data

957
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,413
has confirmed the
presence of a spacecraft.

958
00:52:16,438 --> 00:52:18,310
- We'll be sure...
- [past Barry yelps]

959
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,553
[static]

960
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:23,469
My name is General Zod.

961
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,951
I come from a world

962
00:52:26,994 --> 00:52:28,822
far from yours.

963
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:31,390
For some time, your world

964
00:52:31,434 --> 00:52:35,133
- has sheltered one of my citizens.
- No, no, no.

965
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:37,582
- This can't be happening.
- I request that you return this individual...

966
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:39,391
- [Barry] Not now.
- To my custody.

967
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,635
What's happening?

968
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,139
For reasons unknown...

969
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:44,838
Zod's looking for Superman.

970
00:52:44,882 --> 00:52:46,318
What's a superman?

971
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:48,316
[police siren chirps]

972
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:50,429
[Barry] Superman is an
alien who lives on Earth.

973
00:52:50,453 --> 00:52:52,455
I'm assuming still incognito.

974
00:52:52,498 --> 00:52:55,545
But, yeah, he's an alien,
and he's very powerful,

975
00:52:55,588 --> 00:52:57,329
and he's just the best.

976
00:52:57,373 --> 00:53:00,593
And then Zod is an alien
from the same planet,

977
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:02,035
also very powerful,

978
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,553
but he's just the worst.

979
00:53:03,596 --> 00:53:06,425
And Zod came here to find Clark.

980
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:09,385
- Wait, who's Clark?
- Clark is Superman.

981
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:11,474
- Oh. Okay.
- But then

982
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:14,912
Zod also tried to terraform the
planet with this World Engine thing,

983
00:53:14,955 --> 00:53:16,522
and Superman stopped
him eventually,

984
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:19,569
but not before Zod killed
thousands of people.

985
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:20,808
- Yeesh.
- And at the time,

986
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,676
there was nothing
I could do, I've...

987
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:28,752
Wait, you...

988
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:30,152
You were there?

989
00:53:31,232 --> 00:53:33,583
Yeah, I had just
gotten my powers.

990
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:36,194
[people screaming]

991
00:53:36,237 --> 00:53:38,588
And I was still putting some
finishing touches on my suit.

992
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:41,242
[people screaming]

993
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,121
This thing, Zod's World Engine,

994
00:53:44,146 --> 00:53:46,944
it started destroying
Metropolis, so I just went there

995
00:53:46,987 --> 00:53:49,599
and I started trying
to save people.

996
00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:51,427
[boy] Daddy?

997
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:53,951
[man] Listen to me!

998
00:53:53,994 --> 00:53:55,605
Run away!

999
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:56,519
Run away!

1000
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,092
[Barry] There was
this kid, and I...

1001
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:06,957
I got him, but then...

1002
00:54:06,982 --> 00:54:08,705
I couldn't get his dad.

1003
00:54:09,532 --> 00:54:11,447
Daddy!

1004
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,318
[solemn music playing]

1005
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:27,332
[metal groaning]

1006
00:54:28,551 --> 00:54:29,639
It was all I could do,

1007
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:30,901
save that one kid.

1008
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,774
Only Superman could stop Zod.

1009
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:38,822
But not in time to
save those people.

1010
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:40,519
And now it's about
to happen again.

1011
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:42,521
But...

1012
00:54:42,565 --> 00:54:44,784
if I can find the
entire Justice League,

1013
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:46,917
Superman and the
rest of the band...

1014
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,277
Right.

1015
00:54:48,302 --> 00:54:50,157
Then maybe I can
prevent the whole thing

1016
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:51,922
from ever even happening at all.

1017
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:57,536
- Um, give me your laptop.
- Okay.

1018
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,842
What is that smell?

1019
00:54:58,885 --> 00:55:00,644
Ugh. Could be anything.

1020
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:02,613
Honestly.

1021
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:04,902
Who's that?

1022
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,365
Oh. That's Gary. That's
the smell. It's...

1023
00:55:07,453 --> 00:55:09,472
- [snoring]
- Don't worry. He's breezy.

1024
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:12,543
[Barry] We can do this.

1025
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:15,324
Uh, let's see, Victor Stone,
Gotham City University.

1026
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:16,959
[woman screams, muttering]

1027
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:20,061
Oh, this is my roommate, Patty.

1028
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,022
Patty...

1029
00:55:21,047 --> 00:55:22,353
is your roommate?

1030
00:55:22,378 --> 00:55:24,990
And that's her
boyfriend, Albert.

1031
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:26,478
What's up?

1032
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:28,306
[in sing-song] Good morning.

1033
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:32,279
Oh, sorry. And, uh, guys...

1034
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:34,427
This is my cousin.

1035
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,096
Barry.

1036
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:39,273
[past Patty] Whoa.

1037
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:42,924
I'm starving.

1038
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:48,130
Okay.

1039
00:55:48,155 --> 00:55:49,781
Victor Stone, Gotham
City University.

1040
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:51,634
Yes. Here he is.

1041
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:53,748
Victor Stone, star
quarterback for the Knight...

1042
00:55:53,773 --> 00:55:55,122
Shit, okay.

1043
00:55:55,202 --> 00:55:56,595
He's not Cyborg yet.

1044
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:59,119
Wonder Woman.

1045
00:55:59,163 --> 00:56:00,468
Wonder Woman!

1046
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:03,036
Las Vegas residency.

1047
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,604
Illusions, juggling, and zebras.

1048
00:56:05,648 --> 00:56:08,041
No. That is not Diana.

1049
00:56:08,085 --> 00:56:09,956
- Aquaman.
- Aquaman?

1050
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,610
Is that like a super mermaid?

1051
00:56:11,654 --> 00:56:12,959
[Barry] No, Albert,

1052
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,570
he's not a super mermaid.

1053
00:56:14,613 --> 00:56:16,833
Okay? He's half
Atlantean, half human

1054
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:19,749
with superhuman strength who can
control marine life with his mind.

1055
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:20,987
So, like a super
mermaid? [plays keyboard]

1056
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,161
No, Albert!

1057
00:56:22,186 --> 00:56:24,101
[laughs] That is
what you described.

1058
00:56:24,144 --> 00:56:25,972
[Barry] We'll just
try Arthur Curry...

1059
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:27,321
Maine...

1060
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:30,150
lighthouse.

1061
00:56:30,194 --> 00:56:31,634
[whimsical music
playing on keyboard]

1062
00:56:31,674 --> 00:56:33,850
Here we are. Thomas
Curry. That's his dad.

1063
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:34,786
Uh, phone.

1064
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,810
- [phone rings]
- Hello.

1065
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:39,856
- [Barry] Hello, Thomas Curry?
- Yes.

1066
00:56:39,899 --> 00:56:41,466
Could I speak to Arthur?

1067
00:56:41,509 --> 00:56:42,859
Is Arthur around?

1068
00:56:42,902 --> 00:56:44,904
You wanna speak to my dog?

1069
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:48,168
What? No, no. Um, sorry. Uh...

1070
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:50,257
- Is this Thomas Curry?
- Yes.

1071
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:53,043
- And you work at a lighthouse?
- Yes.

1072
00:56:53,086 --> 00:56:55,262
Okay, and your wife is
the queen of Atlantis?

1073
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:57,587
-[man on TV] Will you accept this rose?
-[woman on TV] Yes.

1074
00:56:58,614 --> 00:57:00,137
Uh, no.

1075
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,921
Uh, right, but maybe, maybe...

1076
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:04,489
um, a fishlike woman

1077
00:57:04,532 --> 00:57:06,779
washed into your life

1078
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:08,972
- at some point or another?
- Very funny, asshole.

1079
00:57:09,015 --> 00:57:10,451
[line disconnects]

1080
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:14,194
Arthur Curry was never born.

1081
00:57:14,238 --> 00:57:16,022
- What?
- This is a disaster.

1082
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:17,720
I-I-I completely
destroyed history.

1083
00:57:17,763 --> 00:57:19,286
Like Eric Stoltz.

1084
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,873
Okay, why do you keep
saying, "Eric Stoltz"?

1085
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:22,333
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

1086
00:57:22,376 --> 00:57:23,726
- What?
- Time travel?

1087
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:26,076
Oh. We talking "BTTF"?

1088
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:27,251
Come on, who is this guy?

1089
00:57:27,294 --> 00:57:28,731
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

1090
00:57:28,774 --> 00:57:30,558
I've seen all of them

1091
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:33,126
and Eric Stoltz is
not Marty McFly.

1092
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:33,997
[Gary] Really?

1093
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:37,696
Then explain Marty McThigh here.

1094
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,219
I can't explain
that to you, Gary.

1095
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:41,004
That's not your thigh.

1096
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:43,560
It's the wrong actor,
and it's upside down.

1097
00:57:44,877 --> 00:57:46,444
[Gary] Is it?

1098
00:57:46,487 --> 00:57:48,327
[whimsical music continues
playing on keyboard]

1099
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:50,448
The point is that

1100
00:57:50,491 --> 00:57:52,102
in Back to the Future

1101
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:55,583
Marty McFly is very famously
played by Michael J. Fox.

1102
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:56,889
The guy from Footloose?

1103
00:57:56,933 --> 00:57:58,630
No, that's Kevin Bacon!

1104
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:00,458
-Bacon.
-[past Barry] Kevin Bacon's Maverick

1105
00:58:00,501 --> 00:58:02,131
with the volleyball, the
gay guys, and the planes?

1106
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:04,070
-Top Gun.

1107
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,072
- Top Gun, right?
- [Barry] No, no, no.

1108
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:08,161
I completely broke the universe.

1109
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:10,511
[whimsical music continues
playing on keyboard]

1110
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:12,383
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

1111
00:58:12,426 --> 00:58:14,472
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1112
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:17,954
I created a world
with no metahumans.

1113
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:20,304
And now there's no one to
defend us from Zod. Albert!

1114
00:58:20,347 --> 00:58:21,697
[stops playing keyboard]

1115
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:24,395
There's no Cyborg.

1116
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:26,310
There's no Aquaman.
There's no Wonder Woman.

1117
00:58:26,353 --> 00:58:28,181
There's no Superman.

1118
00:58:28,225 --> 00:58:29,443
There's no Batman.

1119
00:58:29,487 --> 00:58:30,575
[past Patty] I'm Batman.

1120
00:58:30,618 --> 00:58:32,751
[dramatic musical sting]

1121
00:58:32,795 --> 00:58:35,667
What, you... What
did you just say?

1122
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:37,756
I'm [burping] Batman.

1123
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,192
[all laughing]

1124
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,412
Batman exists?

1125
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:42,650
- Hundo p.
- [Gary] Yeah, dude.

1126
00:58:42,674 --> 00:58:44,415
Nobody knows who he really is,

1127
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:46,983
- but he exists.
- [Barry] Right.

1128
00:58:47,026 --> 00:58:48,680
Well, uh, we...

1129
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:50,377
my cousin Barry and I,

1130
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:53,076
have to go to that
cousin's dinner.

1131
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,817
Now.

1132
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,775
But it was a pleasure to meet

1133
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:58,646
- you all.
- [Albert resumes playing keyboard]

1134
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,127
- And Gary.
- [Gary] Barry.

1135
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:02,476
- Barry.
- Gary.

1136
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,521
Barry!

1137
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:08,178

kidding me with this place?

It's open.

["25 Or 6 To 4" by Chicago

1146
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:02,667
Hello?

1147
01:00:03,842 --> 01:00:05,365
Bruce?

1148
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:08,357
Bruce, are you there?

01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:11,545
Oh, boy.

[Barry] Hey, I didn't
know you painted.

They're good.

[song fades]

1156
01:00:44,883 --> 01:00:46,426
[past Barry] Hey, check
this out. There's, like,

1157
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,278
bells connected to every
room in this house.

1158

Hey, maybe we can
find this Bruce guy...

1159
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:52,282
if we just ring all
these bells, right?

1160
01:00:52,307 --> 01:00:55,183
[Barry] You don't understand how servant
bells work? Those are all the bells.

1161
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:57,645
- You ring them from all the other places.
- What?

They're like, it's like
cheaper Bananabee's.

Oh, you know what I'd
really go for right now?

I'm the guy who lives here.

01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:25,462
We're looking for Bruce Wayne.

You hungry?

1187
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:31,748
Following the broadcast
earlier from General Zod.

1188
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:33,141
The individual
they're searching for

1189
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:35,515
- is still at large.
- So...

1190
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:37,406
The president has yet to respond
to the broadcast from earlier,

1191
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,302
and other foreign
leaders are said to be...

1192
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:41,173
you're the same person as him...

1193
01:02:41,217 --> 01:02:43,959
- but from an alternate timeline.
- Yes.

1194
01:02:44,002 --> 01:02:44,960
In which...

1195
01:02:46,613 --> 01:02:48,006
you and I are friends?

1196
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:51,096
Yeah, you're like
probably my best friend.

1197
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,185
- Okay.
- [Barry] Well, but you're a bit...

1198
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:55,187
you're, uh...

1199
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,452
- chronologically different.
- Older.

1200
01:02:57,477 --> 01:02:59,887
That's what I can't understand.

1201
01:02:59,931 --> 01:03:02,890
I traveled back in
time from here to here.

1202
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:05,806
Yet somehow,
everything's all changed

1203
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,350
back here.

1204
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:09,741
- Or like when you were born, so...
- [older Bruce] Well...

1205
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,765
time isn't linear.

1206
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:13,075
Right?

1207
01:03:13,118 --> 01:03:14,076
Right.

1208
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,064
At some point

1209
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:21,353
you probably saw a
movie that told you

1210
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:23,563
that if you went back
and changed the past,

1211
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:26,958
you'd create a kind of a
branched timeline, right?

1212
01:03:27,002 --> 01:03:28,133
Like, look.

1213
01:03:31,484 --> 01:03:33,486
New present

1214
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,098
- and new future.
- [past Barry] Yeah.

1215
01:03:36,141 --> 01:03:37,969
Well, time doesn't
work like that.

1216
01:03:38,013 --> 01:03:39,275
That's not how time works.

1217
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:41,320
When you go back
and change the past

1218
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:43,409
you create a fulcrum.

1219
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,369
You put yourself on a whole
nother strand of spaghetti.

1220
01:03:47,631 --> 01:03:50,068
New future. New past.

1221
01:03:50,112 --> 01:03:51,591
[spaghetti snaps]

1222
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:53,028
It's retrocausal.

1223
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:54,333
It goes both ways.

1224
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:56,857
Actually, it goes many ways.

1225
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,816
Maybe some other time.

1226
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:02,254
Okay, but in an ontological
paradox model, there's not...

1227
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:05,083
What you did was you
changed the future

1228
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:06,452
and you changed the past.

1229
01:04:07,129 --> 01:04:08,130
If a person

1230
01:04:08,173 --> 01:04:10,393
is stupid enough

1231
01:04:10,436 --> 01:04:11,959
to mess with time...

1232
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:14,266
what you eventually
end up with is this.

1233
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:18,314
The multiverse.

1234
01:04:18,357 --> 01:04:20,098
Some strands run

1235
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:21,578
almost parallel.

1236
01:04:21,621 --> 01:04:24,276
There will be inevitable
intersections,

1237
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,235
and others that are just...

1238
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:28,106
wildly divergent.

1239
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,108
What it is...

1240
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,561
is a hot mess.

1241
01:04:33,242 --> 01:04:34,939
It's a crapshoot.

1242
01:04:34,982 --> 01:04:36,375
It's all just a crapshoot.

1243
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:37,717
What does the parmesan mean?

1244
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:39,614
The metaphor's over.
It's just a garnish.

1245
01:04:39,664 --> 01:04:41,579
And I'll tell ya something.

1246
01:04:41,772 --> 01:04:43,639
A person would have to be

1247
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:45,254
an idiot

1248
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:47,038
to play craps

1249
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:48,953
with the space-time continuum.

1250
01:04:48,996 --> 01:04:50,520
Yeah, an idiot.

1251
01:04:52,174 --> 01:04:53,044
Here.

1252
01:04:55,174 --> 01:04:57,220
[slurping] Mm.

1253
01:04:57,245 --> 01:04:59,790
Are you joking with the
chewing noises right now?

1254
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:01,959
So, uh, you're the reason

1255
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,412
this Zod character

1256
01:05:04,437 --> 01:05:06,787
is about to destroy the Earth?

1257
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:07,932
Maybe.

1258
01:05:07,957 --> 01:05:09,818
There's a guy called Superman

1259
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:11,062
who can stop Zod?

1260
01:05:11,106 --> 01:05:13,586
- Yeah, yeah.
- And flies?

1261
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,124
Shoots lasers out of his eyes?

1262
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:17,565
Yes, he flies, and he shoots
lasers out of his eyes. Yes.

1263
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,852
No one said "Superman"...

1264
01:05:20,376 --> 01:05:22,987
that might be a
little on the nose?

1265
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,163
- You call yourself Batman.
- Yeah.

1266
01:05:25,207 --> 01:05:27,034
I don't call myself
Super Batman.

1267
01:05:27,078 --> 01:05:28,906
[laughs]

1268
01:05:28,949 --> 01:05:31,430
Wait, he's Batman?

1269
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:33,432
What did you think
we were doing here?

1270
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:35,652
I thought this was
the cousin's dinner.

1271
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:38,263
He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1272
01:05:38,307 --> 01:05:40,004
Not really. Not
so much anymore.

1273
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,919
You know...

1274
01:05:41,962 --> 01:05:43,268
they don't really need me.

1275
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:47,465
Things have changed.
Gotham's now

1276
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:49,622
one of the safest
cities in the world.

1277
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,755
Well, I... I need
you. We need you.

1278
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:53,060
In my timeline,

1279
01:05:53,104 --> 01:05:55,280
Batman's our
strategist, our leader.

1280
01:05:55,324 --> 01:05:57,978
The world needs Superman. You're
the best detective in the world.

1281
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,218
You're probably the only person
who can help me find him.

1282
01:06:00,242 --> 01:06:01,721
So, will you help us?

1283
01:06:01,765 --> 01:06:03,201
[heroic music builds, stops]

1284
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:04,115
Pass.

1285
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:08,989
[Barry stutters]

1286
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:10,858
Like pass the salt?

1287
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,776
Bruce?

1288
01:06:12,819 --> 01:06:14,604
[crows cawing]

1289
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:16,693
[Barry] He doesn't
want to help us...

1290
01:06:16,736 --> 01:06:18,347
we're gonna use his bat shit.

1291
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,435
Bat shit?

1292
01:06:20,871 --> 01:06:23,221
Yeah, his bat stuff,
his bat things.

1293
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:24,222
Stand on that thing.

1294
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:29,401
Okay, remember when you
phased through the floor?

1295
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:30,924
- Yeah.
- So,

1296
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:32,926
- I need you to do that again.
- [vibrating]

1297
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,624
- [heavy thud]
- [past Barry] Ow.

1298
01:06:34,667 --> 01:06:36,408
- [sighs]

Has the gravity of this

I won't say it again.

Yeesh. Sorry, Mom.

Shut up. Shut up.

You have no idea

No idea!

1346
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:28,972
You take everything for granted.
You don't even appreciate...

1347
01:09:29,015 --> 01:09:31,583
You just walk around
thinking that you're so funny

1348
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:32,976
and so cool.

1349
01:09:33,019 --> 01:09:34,412
And it's embarrassing,

1350
01:09:34,456 --> 01:09:37,502
because you're not
any of those things!

Hey, screw you, man!

I've done nothing but
everything you've asked.

You made me get
struck by lightning!

I phased naked through the floor.
And I terrified Mrs. Johannson.

Now I'm probably
gonna have to move.

1356
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:51,168
You won't even tell
me why you're here.

1357
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:53,953
But will you at least tell me
why you're being so mean to me...

Wait, what?

1361

Forget it.

1362
01:10:03,963 --> 01:10:05,725
The monkey? Wait...

1363
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,093
So, you're mad at me
for playing with a toy?

1364
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:11,163
It's not a toy.

1365
01:10:11,188 --> 01:10:12,755
Mom bought us that monkey.

1366
01:10:12,798 --> 01:10:14,757
'Cause she calls us Monkey.

1367
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,586
She gives us monkey
stuff all the time.

1368
01:10:18,543 --> 01:10:19,457
Right.

1369
01:10:20,502 --> 01:10:21,372
Look...

1370
01:10:22,242 --> 01:10:23,461

You're... You're not that bad.

1377
01:10:33,645 --> 01:10:36,022
You can just be kind
of a dick sometimes.

1378
01:10:37,954 --> 01:10:40,478
But let's face it. I
am pretty obnoxious.

1379
01:10:40,522 --> 01:10:42,437
But I just get excited.

1380
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,048
Come on. This place
is pretty cool, right?

1381
01:10:45,962 --> 01:10:46,789
Yeah.

1382

All right, well, um...

That thing you said,
with the spaghetti.

1389
01:11:22,672 --> 01:11:25,584
You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.

1390
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:28,787
You had an Alfred.

But this is more than that.

Inevitable intersections

1401
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:56,791
are something none of the theories
could have anticipated 'cause,

1402
01:11:56,815 --> 01:11:59,426
well, how do you explain
that except for...

I didn't really think this through.

There are good Kryptonians...

[whispering] And I
was very confident

that we were just
gonna find Superman,

1594

then this would all
be super simple.

But we found you instead.

1601
01:26:45,355 --> 01:26:46,835
What do you want with Kal-El?

1602
01:26:46,878 --> 01:26:48,445
We were trying to rescue him.

1603
01:26:48,489 --> 01:26:50,273
Why?

1604
01:26:50,316 --> 01:26:53,102
Because he's my friend.

1605
01:26:53,145 --> 01:26:54,495
Do you... Do you know him?

1606
01:26:54,538 --> 01:26:56,671
[whispering] She
looks mad. Get ready.

1607
01:26:56,714 --> 01:26:59,084
She might do laser vision, or she
might do, like, a freezy breath...

1608
01:26:59,108 --> 01:27:01,632
- or she'll just start throwing crazy...
- My name is Kara.

Daughter of Zor-El.

1610

Kal-El was my cousin.

01:27:06,463 --> 01:27:08,770
- Right, and who's Kal-El again?
- It's Superman.

1612
01:27:08,813 --> 01:27:11,468
- No, 'cause you said that was Clark.
- Who's Clark?

1613
01:27:11,512 --> 01:27:14,689
Clark is his human name.

He was an infant when we left.

01:27:22,218 --> 01:27:23,828
The last son of Krypton... I...

1618
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:27,310
I was sent to protect him.

1619
01:27:27,353 --> 01:27:29,312
It looks like he
never made it to Earth

in this universe.

have separated.

Wait, so you thought a baby

1623
01:27:35,492 --> 01:27:37,929
was gonna protect us
from this Zod guy?

1624

General Zod is here.

1625
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,716
He must have tracked
my pod's signal.

1626
01:27:41,759 --> 01:27:44,066
- I have to go. [groans]
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1627
01:27:44,109 --> 01:27:47,722
Well, you need to recover your
strength. Actually, Barry...

1628
01:27:47,765 --> 01:27:49,288
take her to the roof

1629
01:27:49,332 --> 01:27:51,334
and put her in the sun.

1630
01:27:51,377 --> 01:27:52,640
Yeah.

1631
01:27:52,683 --> 01:27:54,642
- Yeah.
- Whatever, like if, I mean,

1632
01:27:54,685 --> 01:27:56,252
you're solar powered.

1633
01:27:56,295 --> 01:27:57,819
Good for you. I've
been trying to...

1634
01:27:57,862 --> 01:27:59,298
- [Kara panting]
- Oh, uh...

1635
01:28:00,474 --> 01:28:02,737
We'll take that with us.

1636

[enthralling music playing]

1637
01:28:11,702 --> 01:28:14,488
Um, am I cool to...

1638
01:28:14,531 --> 01:28:15,401
turn around?

1639
01:28:16,533 --> 01:28:17,839
Are you dressed

1640
01:28:17,882 --> 01:28:20,015
in a red cape?

1641
01:28:20,058 --> 01:28:22,147
[breathing heavily]

1642
01:28:26,587 --> 01:28:28,719
You're levitating?

01:28:36,205 --> 01:28:37,511
Is it always this loud?

1648
01:28:39,251 --> 01:28:40,514
[sighs]

1649
01:28:40,557 --> 01:28:42,428
Is it loud?

1650
01:28:42,472 --> 01:28:45,736
Are you, uh, good?
Do you feel, um...

1651
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:46,998
strong yet, or...

1652
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:49,740
[hawks, spits]

1653
01:28:49,784 --> 01:28:50,611
[past Barry gasps]

1654
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:54,397
Yep, that seems, uh,

1655
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,181
seems strong. You know...

1656
01:28:56,225 --> 01:28:58,836
old man Barry, down there,

1657
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,143
says if we don't
stop Captain Zode,

1658
01:29:01,186 --> 01:29:03,537
he'll kill thousands of people.

1659
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,060
Billions of people.

1660
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:06,191
Billions?

1661
01:29:07,802 --> 01:29:09,151
Of your people.

1662
01:29:09,194 --> 01:29:10,892
- They're good people.
- Good people?

1663
01:29:12,067 --> 01:29:13,721
We came to this planet

1664
01:29:13,764 --> 01:29:15,766
looking for a safe
place to live,

1665
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,029
and they put me in a cage.

1666
01:29:18,073 --> 01:29:20,728
Yeah. A lot of
humans are dicks.

1667
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:23,121
But then

1668
01:29:23,165 --> 01:29:25,515
there's babies and ballerinas.

1669
01:29:25,559 --> 01:29:27,343
And entertainment wrestlers.

1670
01:29:27,386 --> 01:29:28,823
A lot of humans
are worth saving.

1671
01:29:29,954 --> 01:29:31,173
Maybe to you.

1672
01:29:32,566 --> 01:29:33,871
But I'm not a human.

1673
01:29:35,351 --> 01:29:36,613
I'm a Kryptonian.

1674
01:29:40,356 --> 01:29:42,097
She's gone.

1675
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:43,838
I have to get my powers back.

1676
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:47,972
If I can re-create the accident

1677
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:49,539
that gave me my powers...

1678
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:51,038
maybe I can reconnect
to the Speed Force...

1679
01:29:51,062 --> 01:29:53,848
and maybe we'd stand
a chance against Zod.

1680
01:29:53,891 --> 01:29:56,328
Or kill yourself in the process.

1681
01:29:59,331 --> 01:30:00,158
Tell me something.

1682
01:30:02,073 --> 01:30:04,206
If you get your powers back,

1683
01:30:04,249 --> 01:30:05,555
you can go anywhere.

1684
01:30:05,599 --> 01:30:07,122
You can go to another timeline,

1685
01:30:07,165 --> 01:30:08,602
another universe.

1686
01:30:08,645 --> 01:30:10,778
Why do you wanna stay...

1687
01:30:10,821 --> 01:30:13,128
and fight to save this one?

1688
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:15,521
Because this is the
world where my mom lives.

1689
01:30:18,742 --> 01:30:21,484
I went back in time to save her.

1690
01:30:21,527 --> 01:30:23,660
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1691
01:30:23,704 --> 01:30:25,575
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1692
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:28,317
How do you tell someone
something like that?

1693
01:30:31,842 --> 01:30:33,844
I lost my parents...

1694
01:30:36,804 --> 01:30:38,457
but that pain...

1695
01:30:42,113 --> 01:30:43,724
made me who I am.

1696
01:30:43,767 --> 01:30:46,248
I'm not sure I know who I
am without it, actually.

1697

[wistful music playing]

1698
01:30:50,556 --> 01:30:53,298
I spent a lifetime...

1699
01:30:53,342 --> 01:30:56,171
trying to right the
wrongs of the past.

1700
01:30:57,563 --> 01:30:58,782
As if

1701
01:30:58,826 --> 01:31:01,698
putting on a cape
and fighting crime

1702
01:31:01,742 --> 01:31:03,569
would bring my parents back.

1703
01:31:09,488 --> 01:31:10,794
You actually did it.

1704
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,754
So...

1705
01:31:13,797 --> 01:31:15,190
I guess the plan is

1706
01:31:15,233 --> 01:31:17,583
to douse yourself in
industrial chemicals

1707
01:31:17,627 --> 01:31:19,455
while electrocuting yourself?

1708
01:31:19,498 --> 01:31:20,325
Yep.

1709
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:25,809
Want some help?

[rousing music plays]

1711
01:31:27,724 --> 01:31:30,074
[Barry] Hell yeah. That
would be incredibly useful.

1712
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:31,748
I've actually already
borrowed some chemicals

1713
01:31:31,772 --> 01:31:32,990
and your soldering iron,

1714
01:31:33,034 --> 01:31:35,210
and I'm sitting
in your bat-seat.

1715
01:31:35,253 --> 01:31:36,690
Is that like a faux pas?

I gave you a warning.

1724
01:32:29,525 --> 01:32:32,180
Your failure to deliver

Okay, when I throw the switch,

1737
01:33:14,918 --> 01:33:16,485
the current should
run up the wire

1738

and draw the lightning

It's heat and impact resistant.

1741

Should protect you a little.

1742

Right, but the point is
for me to not be protected.

Okay.

1744

You're gonna need to
be out of the way.

[laughs] That's the whole thing.

2117
01:56:58,210 --> 01:57:00,168
We can take as much
time as it takes.

2118
01:57:00,212 --> 01:57:02,301
No, that's not
what I mean. Hey!

- [grunts]

2123
01:57:23,713 --> 01:57:26,194
Okay, you good? Come on.

2124
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:28,022
I need you in there. Let's go.

2125
01:57:28,065 --> 01:57:29,806
Barry, please,
just listen to me!

2126
01:57:38,772 --> 01:57:39,990
[yells]

2127

[up-tempo music playing]

2129
01:57:47,911 --> 01:57:49,304
Where were you?

2130
01:57:49,348 --> 01:57:50,890
What, you just stand
here the whole time?

2131
01:57:50,914 --> 01:57:53,787
Barry, this is an
inevitable intersection.

2132
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:55,615
You have to stop. Barry!

2133
01:58:01,011 --> 01:58:02,012
[grunts]

2134

[vibrating]

2135
01:58:10,978 --> 01:58:12,240
No, Barry, wait!

2136
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:20,596
Barry, listen. [echoes]

2137
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,040
There's something
I should tell you.

2138
01:58:24,644 --> 01:58:27,124
I went back in time initially

2139
01:58:27,168 --> 01:58:29,649
- because...
- Yeah, because Mom died.

2140
01:58:29,692 --> 01:58:31,390
How do you know?

2141
01:58:31,433 --> 01:58:34,001
It doesn't matter. Does it?

2142
01:58:34,044 --> 01:58:35,655
You know that I have
to undo what I did.

2143
01:58:36,743 --> 01:58:37,613
No.

2144
01:58:37,657 --> 01:58:39,049
It's not a mistake.

2145
01:58:39,093 --> 01:58:40,137
We can save her.

2146
01:58:40,181 --> 01:58:41,400
And we can save them.

2147
01:58:41,443 --> 01:58:43,140
No, we can't.

2148
01:58:43,184 --> 01:58:45,882
This is what Bruce
was talking about.

2149
01:58:45,926 --> 01:58:48,102
Barry, this is inevitable.

2150
01:58:48,145 --> 01:58:50,785
We can try a million times, and
we're not gonna be able to fix this.

2151
01:58:51,453 --> 01:58:52,889
No matter what we do...

2152
01:58:53,542 --> 01:58:55,414
this world dies.

2153
01:58:56,415 --> 01:58:58,373
Today.

2154
01:58:58,417 --> 01:58:59,374
Look around.

2155

[distorted rumbling]

2156
01:59:03,552 --> 01:59:05,598
Look at the damage
we're causing.

2157
01:59:11,734 --> 01:59:12,996
Now we have to stop.

2158
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,389
Okay?

2159
01:59:14,433 --> 01:59:16,217
Look, I was just
doing my laundry.

2160
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,394
You're the one who came and
told me that I'm a superhero.

2161
01:59:19,438 --> 01:59:21,265
And now you're saying what?

2162
01:59:21,309 --> 01:59:23,180
[stutters] You
don't want me to be?

2163
01:59:23,224 --> 01:59:25,705
Well, guess what!
It's too late!

2164
01:59:25,748 --> 01:59:28,403
I am... [echoes]

the Flash.

2166
01:59:29,926 --> 01:59:31,798
And I can save everyone.

2167
01:59:31,841 --> 01:59:33,582
Nobody dies!

2168
01:59:33,626 --> 01:59:34,627

has a solution.

Sometimes we just
have to let go.

[Nora] Sometimes you
just have to let go.

2174
01:59:57,258 --> 01:59:59,869
Let go of Mom?

2175
01:59:59,913 --> 02:00:03,220
She'll always be alive,
somewhere in time.

2176
02:00:04,439 --> 02:00:05,397
Always.

2177
02:00:06,136 --> 02:00:07,268
Just not for us.

2178
02:00:08,487 --> 02:00:10,576
You're full of shit, dude.

2179
02:00:10,619 --> 02:00:12,012
I'm going back.

2180
02:00:12,055 --> 02:00:13,883
[shouts] You're going
back to kill Mom?

2181
02:00:13,927 --> 02:00:15,102
No!

2182
02:00:15,145 --> 02:00:16,886
You're staying!

2183
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:18,932
You stay, right here.

2184
02:00:20,455 --> 02:00:21,935
Just give me one more time.

2185
02:00:21,978 --> 02:00:23,719
Barry, stop!

2186
02:00:23,763 --> 02:00:26,243
You, stop!

I've lived...

you.

We are so close.

02:01:51,024 --> 02:01:52,982
I've got it almost figured out.

How long have you
been doing this?

You have to stop.

It stops once I've fixed it!

2243
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:15,124
It's not entirely
your fault, Barry.

2244
02:04:15,168 --> 02:04:18,780
I pushed you out of the
Chronobowl on that September 29

2245
02:04:18,824 --> 02:04:22,001
so you could start
me on this path. Hmm?

How do you like our
endless paradox?

2247
02:04:24,743 --> 02:04:26,875
I made you create me...

2248
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,748
and now you're the one...

2249

in my way.

02:04:32,533 --> 02:04:35,492
No matter how close I get
to winning this fight...

2251
02:04:35,536 --> 02:04:37,538
you go back

2252
02:04:37,581 --> 02:04:39,322
and let Mom die.

2253
02:04:39,366 --> 02:04:41,542
You're the inevitable

2254

And you do have to let go.

Hey, hey. Don't worry.
It's gonna heal.

Mm-hmm. Sure.

- Oh, don't say that.

Your mom must be grateful

you should ask me to dinner.

Okay? And I didn't listen.
