1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,926
My name is Barry Allen.
lam the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,329
When I was a 11, my mother was murdered.
I saw a ball of lightning.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,411
Inside the lightning was a man.
He killed my mom.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,841
- I swear to God, I didn't do this.
- Where's Mom?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,923
What happened that night
was impossible.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,441
Then an accident made me the impossible.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,610
- You were in a coma.
- How long?

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,161
- Nine months.
- Your muscles should be atrophied.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,209
But they're in a state
of cellular regeneration.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,488
I wasn't the only one affected, was I?

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,406
We've been searching
for other meta-humans like yourself.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,770
All my life I've wanted to do more, and
the first chance I get to help someone...

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,003
...I screw up.
- The good you do will far outweigh the bad.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,964
You're not gonna be in here much longer.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,045
Whoever killed Mom,
I think I finally have a way to find them.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,689
This is the part where I'm supposed
to do the whole intro thingy.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,770
Barry Allen, fastest man alive,
but you know all that already.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,850
All right, let's get to the good stuff.
You see that smoke?

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,526
That's a fire on Western and Third
in downtown Central City.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,008
And that blur? That's me on my way to it.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,204
I'm going 352 miles an hour.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,209
And it's a slow day.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,611
This is Ladder 52.
We're still at least two minutes out.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,808
- People are gonna die.
- I know.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,770
Barry.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,321
Barf)'-

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,970
What? Did I miss it?

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,891
You overshot by about six blocks.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,241
My bad.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,849
Paige. My daughter.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,884
Has anyone seen my daughter? Paige.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,244
You there yet?

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,569
What are you doing?

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,041
- Nothing.
- Who are you talking to?

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,004
- No one.
- Are you talking to Barry?

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,406
- Who?
- Barry Allen?

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,887
Struck by lightning,
in a coma for nine months...

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,725
...able to run faster than
the speed of sound? Ring a bell?

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,930
- Nope, haven't talked to him.
- Cisco, there's fire everywhere.

40
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,326
Cisco, are you still there?

41
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,643
Mom? Mommy?

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,730
Mommy.

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,246
Everybody's out.
What else you got for me, Cisco?

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,805
Barry, it's Caitlin.

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,162
Hey, Caitlin.

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,166
- How's your day?
- Get back to S. T.A.R. Labs.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,805
Now.

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,280
On my way.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,243
Have you both lost your minds?
Who do you think you are?

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,011
Well, I'm the eyes and ears,
and he's the feet.

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,010
This isn't funny.
You could have gotten yourself killed.

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,283
You can't be running around the city
like some supersonic fireman.

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,570
Why not? This is what we talked about.
Me using my speed to do good.

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,842
We talked about you
helping contain people...

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,044
...who have been affected
by the particle accelerator explosion.

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,285
Meta-humans. And aside from Clyde Mardon,
we haven't found any.

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,404
People in the city still need help.
And I can help them.

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,125
We can help them.

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,009
Will you please say something?

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,125
I think what Caitlin is saying,
in her own spectacularly angry way...

61
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,563
...is we're just beginning to understand
what your body is capable of.

62
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,201
Not to sound like a broken record,
Mr. Allen...

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,050
...I do caution restraint.

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,562
Dr. Wells, I doubt restraint
is how you got to be the man you are today.

65
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,888
In a wheelchair and a pariah.

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,647
Lack of restraint
is what made me these things.

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,886
Know your limits.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,723
Don't expect me to patch you up
every time you break something.

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,649
Hey, uh, anything happen out there today?

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,610
The sensors in the suit
were kicking back weird telemetry.

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,529
Your vitals spiked for a few seconds.

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,361
Never felt better.

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,687
- Hey, Joe, everything all right?
- Great.

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,283
I got a fresh crime scene, a dead body,
detectives interviewing witnesses.

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,370
Yellow tape stretched over everything.
I'm missing one thing.

76
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,002
- Can you guess what that is?
- I'll be right there.

77
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,291
My day job beckons.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,649
When do you think he'll realize
he didn't take his clothes?

79
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,207
Hmm.

80
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,242
Perp made off with a bunch of handguns.

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,126
At least six Glock-19s
fitted with extra ammunition magazines.

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,288
Somebody's looking to do a lot of bad.

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,200
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,964
Doing a little Fall shopping?

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,322
Oh, heh, I was going so fast this morning,
I didn't even notice.

86
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,927
Yeah.

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,806
I downloaded surveillance footage
off the video camera.

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,727
Looks like only one perp.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,801
Footage may only show one,
but it was six guys.

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,327
Look, the tracks.
They're all crossing each other.

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,962
Six sets of footprints. Six guns stolen.
We should be looking for a crew.

92
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,730
Huh.

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,804
Weird. The shoes.
Looks like they're all the same size.

94
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,284
Men's 10s, I'd guess.

95
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,370
Just like you, captain.
Not that you're a suspect, sir.

96
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,529
Your ability to multitask is remarkable.
The way you can embarrass me...

97
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,927
...the captain, and yourself,
at the same time.

98
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,845
- Joe, I'm sorry.
- I'm starting to think, "Joe, I'm sorry"...

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,810
...is my actual name
considering how often you say it to me.

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,930
- I'm dealing with a lot right now.
- Look, I know you are.

101
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,165
Believe me, I'm dealing with it too. I've
always had a very simple set of beliefs.

102
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,886
Gravity makes things fall.
Water makes things wet.

103
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,971
Until a few weeks ago, I believed the fastest
man could run a mile in four minutes.

104
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,288
- Not four seconds.
- I can do it in three.

105
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,962
- Not relevant.
- You haven't said anything to Iris, have you?

106
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,083
No, I made a promise. I keep my promises.

107
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,762
Keep on lying. You're liable
to get struck by lightning. Get to the lab.

108
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,247
Start processing the evidence
from the gun store.

109
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,522
- Hey, Iris.
- Did Barry run away again?

110
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,768
Unless that's one
of your homework questions...

111
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,042
...it's none of your business.
Go to your room.

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,927
- I want to see my dad.
- I already said no, Barry.

113
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,487
He didn't do those things.
He didn't hurt my mom.

114
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,041
I was there that night. I saw.
There was a man.

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,687
Yeah, I know.
We've gone through this already.

116
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,325
Then why can't I go see him?

117
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,444
Because I said so.

118
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,530
You're not my father.
You can't tell me what to do.

119
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,803
Right now I'm the only adult
that gives a damn what happens to you.

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,883
So, yes, I can tell you what to do.

121
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,969
- Now go to your room.
- I hate you.

122
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,331
This is your fault.
I could've taken European Folklore...

123
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,528
...to cover my sociology requirement,
but no.

124
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,002
You said, "Take Journalism, Iris.
Reporters have all of the fun."

125
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,521
Guess what, Barry?
Reporters have none of the fun.

126
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,610
Journalism is boring. I'm bored.
I blame you.

127
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,528
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

128
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,362
You look really nice.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,686
Thanks. Why don't you look nice?

130
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,365
This afternoon? Suit and tie?

131
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,126
- The university is giving Simon Stagg...
- Simon Stagg...

132
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,449
- Some award. You agreed...
- To explain the science in your article.

133
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,281
- It's all coming back to me now.
- How fast can you get home and change?

134
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,245
Uh, pretty fast.

135
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,764
Allen, Joe asked me to see where you're at
on the evidence from the gun store shooting.

136
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,201
- Oh, hey, Iris.
- Detective.

137
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,126
Please, guys, uh, just kiss already.
I already know, remember?

138
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,126
Ugh, thanks for being
so cool about this, Barry.

139
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,811
I know it's not easy keeping a big secret.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,968
I'm getting used to it.

141
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,604
I find it quite remarkable...

142
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,367
...having once been a timid freshman...

143
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,769
...to be standing before you
the Regents choice for Man of the Year.

144
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,611
While I very much appreciate the award...

145
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,327
...the real honor for me is knowing
that my work in organ transference...

146
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,970
...helps give people a second chance at
life. Thank you all very much for coming.

147
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,164
Okay, all right, first things first.

148
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,249
Simon Stagg's work in cellular cloning...

149
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,767
...has led to huge advancements
in organ replacement.

150
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,043
- Are journalists allowed to drink on the job?
- If you are bored...

151
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,289
...wait until we get to the science
behind cellular regeneration.

152
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,084
I have missed this, Barry.

153
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,329
We haven't spent time together
since you woke up from the coma.

154
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,166
Yeah, I've had a crazy few weeks. I know.

155
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,324
I thought maybe you'd been avoiding me
because of Eddie.

156
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,410
I know you think it's wrong,
me dating my dad's partner and...

157
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,887
No, that is not it. At all.

158
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,724
Oh. Oh. Mr. Stagg, I was wondering
if I could get a quote from you.

159
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,251
Not now, miss.

160
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,049
I'll just make something up.

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,323
So, what were you gonna tell me?
You were about to say something.

162
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,406
Quiet down, all of you.

163
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,884
Quiet.

164
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,160
How considerate.
You're all wearing your finest jewelry.

165
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,887
Almost like you knew
we were coming to rob you.

166
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,404
Now everybody line up.

167
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,490
Don't.

168
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,241
Freeze.

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,563
Drop your weapons.

170
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,081
Barry. Barry. Barry.

171
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,247
I turned around and you were gone.
What happened? Are you okay?

172
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,527
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

173
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,530
I went after them to try to get the plates.

174
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,530
And I fainted.

175
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,049
Iris.

176
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,083
- Where were you?
- Dad, go easy.

177
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,930
I found him outside. He fainted.

178
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,082
You want me to get you a paramedic,
Allen?

179
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,123
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Eddie.

180
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,603
I thought I was dead.
I saw the gun go off and then boom.

181
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,923
Suddenly, I'm outside.
I have no idea how I got there.

182
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,409
Let me talk to you for a second.

183
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,045
Yeah.

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,606
- You chased those gunmen?
- They must be the same guys...

185
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,929
...that knocked over the gun shop.
What were you going to do...

186
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,930
...when you caught them, huh?

187
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,084
Ask them nicely to pull over?
You're not bulletproof.

188
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,930
Wait, are you?

189
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,249
- No.
- Okay. No more heroics.

190
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,525
Chasing bad guys is not your job.
It's mine. You're not a cop.

191
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,604
- Promise me.
- Promise.

192
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,561
And you know Iris is not stupid. Start
making better excuses than "I fainted."

193
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,651
You lied to us.

194
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,320
How could you not tell us
you're experiencing dizzy spells?

195
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,646
We're your doctors.

196
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,882
God knows
what's going on inside your body.

197
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,122
Your cells are in a constant state of flux.

198
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,564
You could be experiencing cardiopulmonary
failure, or a transient ischemic attack.

199
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,802
Mini-stroke. Probably not.

200
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,681
You, of all people, should know
that in science, we share.

201
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,002
We do not keep secrets.

202
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,283
Wow, I haven't seen anyone
make her that angry since Ronnie.

203
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,530
Ronnie was Caitlin's fiancé?

204
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,882
The one that died
the night of the accelerator explosion?

205
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,727
Yeah, he is missed.

206
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,603
Now, let's figure out
why this is happening to you.

207
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,848
We're all set.

208
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,526
- A little padding. Just in case.
- Yeah.

209
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,969
You sure about this, Cisco?

210
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,726
Most home treadmills...

211
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,531
...have a maximum speed
of about 12 miles per hour.

212
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,169
This one has been Cisco'ed.
Trust me, it can handle your speed.

213
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,682
Okay.

214
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,005
Heart rate, blood pressure,
nerve conduction all normal.

215
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,361
For Barry.

216
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,642
Brainwave function within standard limits.

217
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,564
Heh. Told you the treadmill could take it.

218
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,445
Caitlin, look at the glucose levels.

219
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,565
- Oh, my God. Of course.
- Right?

220
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,171
- It was so obvious.
- Glucose.

221
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,129
Barry, we think we know why you keep...

222
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,405
Passing out.

223
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,210
Barf)'-

224
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,684
Where's Barry?

225
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,091
Taking a shower.

226
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,562
At 3:00 in the afternoon?

227
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,201
If I go up those stairs,
am I gonna see Barry...

228
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,761
...or are you gonna be grounded
for lying to me?

229
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,089
I'm sorry, Daddy.
But don't worry, I know where he went.

230
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,724
Me too.

231
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,687
- I passed out again?
- Total metabolic failure...

232
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,922
...brought on by acute hypoglycemia.

233
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,521
I'm not eating enough.
So an l.V. bag and I'm good to go.

234
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,806
Try 40. Guess you were thirsty.

235
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,322
We're gonna need to fashion you a diet
based on your metabolic changes.

236
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,965
I've done a few calculations.

237
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,647
You need to consume an amount equal
to roughly 850 tacos.

238
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,488
Unless we're talking cheese and guac, which
is like a whole other set of equations.

239
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,645
For Mexican, I recommend Tito's
on Bruckner Avenue.

240
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,366
Best burrito in the city.

241
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,126
Detective West, what brings you
to S.T.A.R. Labs?

242
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,290
When I couldn't find you at your lab,
I started doing a little research.

243
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,849
Turns out, there's been reports
of a red streak around the city.

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,810
Stopping muggers.
Rescuing people from burning buildings.

245
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,525
You...

246
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,882
...didn't tell him we
were working together.

247
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,367
Joe, I can explain.

248
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,246
You already have a job
in law enforcement, Barry.

249
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,482
- I suggest you get back to it.
- Mm-hm.

250
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,042
Don't look at me. I'm on your side.

251
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,641
Detective, we all want
what's best for Barry.

252
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,003
If you wanted what was best for Barry,
you'd talk him out of this...

253
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,204
...instead of encouraging him
going out there risking his life.

254
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,643
You saw a man control the weather.

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,480
What are the police gonna do
against someone like that?

256
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,487
Since the accelerator explosion,
we suspect there may more like him.

257
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,364
And you're gonna do what? Catch them?

258
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,050
Are you insane?

259
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,729
You think because you can run real fast
that you're invincible? You're not.

260
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,049
You're just a kid. My kid.

261
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,931
I'm not your kid, Joe.

262
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,888
And you're not my father.

263
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,129
My father is sitting in Iron Heights.
Wrongfully convicted.

264
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,124
You were wrong about him.

265
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,124
And you're wrong about this.

266
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,124
Now, I may not be able to help him...

267
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,806
...but if I can save someone
from a burning building...

268
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,964
...or stop some armed thieves,
I'm gonna do it.

269
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,929
And you can't stop me.

270
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,725
So don't try.

271
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,084
You think you're so smart.

272
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,602
All of you.

273
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,445
But you don't know what you don't know.

274
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,770
And I hope that you're clever enough to
figure it out before somebody gets killed.

275
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,249
Where's the rest of your crew?

276
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,641
Just me.

277
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,645
- What do you want?
- The only thing I still want in life.

278
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,086
Your boss dead.

279
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,362
It's not my fault your team moved too slow.

280
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,887
I told you were Stagg would be,
not how long.

281
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,641
I need his full itinerary
and security access to his office and home.

282
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,088
Screw you. I've got a reputation
in the security business.

283
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,405
It's one thing if my employer gets iced.
It's another if it happens in his bedroom.

284
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,604
You'll do what I ask, Mr. Java.

285
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,651
What the hell are you gonna do to me
without your army?

286
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,329
I am an army.

287
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,447
Come to yell at me again?

288
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,211
Simon Stagg's head of security
was murdered last night.

289
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,808
The coroner took some skin samples.
Hopefully they belong to the killer.

290
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,200
See if you can find a match.

291
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,920
Can't be a coincidence
Stagg's benefit was attacked.

292
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,441
- Going to interview Stagg now.
- I'll come with you.

293
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,722
Your job is in here.
Stay in here and do it.

294
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,045
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, baby.

295
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,044
Gotta go.

296
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,965
Why is my dad mad at you?

297
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,369
Work stuff.

298
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,045
Why are you mad at me?

299
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,049
You were supposed to meet me at Jitters...

300
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,402
...to give me scientific background
for my article.

301
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,564
- And I didn't show up.
- I have to come up with a new topic...

302
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,041
...in 24 hours or I fail the assignment.
lris-

303
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,090
Don't say that you're sorry.
Okay? I know that you are.

304
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,561
What I don't know
is what is going on with you.

305
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,768
We grew up one bedroom down
from each other.

306
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,730
Do you honestly think that I don't know
when you're happy...

307
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,247
...or sad, or depressed, or lost?

308
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,001
I'm gonna ask you one last time, Barry,
and you better be honest with me.

309
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,247
What the...

310
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,725
You want to know what's happening.
I'm fast now.

311
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,763
And, God, I just want to tell you.

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,561
How I feel. How you make me feel.

313
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,250
But I can't.

314
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,010
Hell is going on with you?

315
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,960
We are not done talking about this.

316
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,928
Impossible. There was a murder.

317
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,090
These skill cells belong to the murderer,
but these are naive.

318
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,568
Stem cells. They can replicate
and become any cell the body needs.

319
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,125
They only come from babies.

320
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,489
This means your killer is what, a newborn?

321
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,927
You honestly think
someone wants to kill me?

322
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,045
We're not sure, Mr. Stagg. But the event
you were being honored at was robbed.

323
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,005
And your head of security
was found murdered this morning.

324
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,091
I am a scientist and a philanthropist.
We're not often the targets of assassins.

325
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,045
What about lawsuits?
You've got about 20 of those pending.

326
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,121
Yeah, it is a sad fact of life, detective,
that when you earn a lot of money...

327
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,607
...people who haven't
think they can take yours.

328
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,926
People like this guy, for example?
Danton Black?

329
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,526
Danton Black.

330
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,482
You fired him. Now he's suing you.

331
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,405
Unfortunately, our working relationship
wasn't successful.

332
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,410
But I can assure you both of one thing.

333
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,570
Danton Black is not a killer.

334
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,326
He's a clinical researcher,
not a criminal mastermind.

335
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,121
Now, if I can help you in any way,
please let me know.

336
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,164
- I want these people caught as much as you.
- Then here we are.

337
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,243
Down.

338
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,321
Head down.

339
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,487
Additional units are on the way.

340
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,649
- Captain, what's going on?
- Not now.

341
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,003
An armed gunman's
shooting up Stagg Industries.

342
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,444
Joe's there.

343
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,088
Get him out of here. I'll cover you.
Ready? Go.

344
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,250
- Go.
- No.

345
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,481
- Whoever you are, give yourself up.
- Sorry.

346
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,085
We're not going anywhere.

347
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,242
Until Simon Stagg is dead.

348
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,282
Sorry. The abrasions
are already rapidly healing.

349
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,369
Yeah, I got my ass handed to me.

350
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,807
You got blood on my suit.

351
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,962
I think some of it belongs to him.

352
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,646
Another not-so-friendly meta-human.

353
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,201
Danton Black.

354
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,011
A bio-geneticist.
Specialized in therapeutic cloning.

355
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,405
- Growing new organs to replace failing ones.
- Stagg stole his research and then fired him.

356
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,211
I saw Black create duplicates
from his own body.

357
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,926
That's pretty ironic.
The guy specialized in cloning.

358
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,003
And now he can make Xeroxes of himself.

359
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,687
If he was experimenting on himself
when exposed to the dark matter wave...

360
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,842
...released by the accelerator explosion...

361
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,571
Meet Captain Clone.

362
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,842
Don't worry.
I'll come up with something cooler.

363
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,363
Where are you going?

364
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,284
Joe was right.

365
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,923
I'm in way over my head.
Yeah, I'm fast, but I am no warrior.

366
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,522
I could barely fight one meta-human,
let alone six.

367
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,285
Barry...

368
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,931
...I understand.

369
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,403
Today was a setback.
But any grand enterprise has them.

370
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,405
And we can never learn to fly
without crashing a few times.

371
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,243
This wasn't a grand enterprise, Dr. Wells.

372
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,162
This was a mistake.

373
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,929
Dad.

374
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,404
Sorry, no physical contact.

375
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,924
Five minutes, Allen.

376
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,922
Sit down, son.

377
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,930
Barry, how did you get here?

378
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,488
I ran here. Joe wouldn't bring me.
He wouldn't let me see you.

379
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,849
- I hate him.
- No. No. Don't say that.

380
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,608
It isn't Joe...

381
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,924
...that doesn't want you to come here.

382
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,762
I don't want you to come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

383
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,809
You have to let him go. My dad didn't
do these things. He didn't hurt my mom.

384
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,765
The man in the lightning.
The lightning man killed my mom.

385
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,605
- Barry, look at me. Look at me.
- Not my dad.

386
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,284
You can't help me.

387
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,604
Now Joe is gonna look after you
until I can get out of here.

388
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,046
You just...

389
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,284
...be the good boy
that your mom and I know you are.

390
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,964
Dad.

391
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,807
Dad.

392
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,649
Detective, was the gunman apprehended?

393
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,649
The shooter's whereabouts are unknown.

394
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,323
We consider him armed and dangerous.
Thank you. No more questions.

395
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,606
Nice work, Eddie.

396
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,808
Yeah. Right place. Right time.

397
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,525
No, you were a hero today.

398
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,446
C.C.P.D. still has a killer on the loose.
I should get back to the precinct.

399
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,886
Bye.

400
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,689
So did you come here for caffeine?

401
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,207
Or are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

402
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,605
Mr. Stagg, I wish you would reconsider
our offer for protective custody.

403
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,407
Danton Black has proven
he is willing to kill, and he's got...

404
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,524
...friends, and trust me,
they're all dangerous.

405
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,206
I've increased my security, detective.

406
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,961
I hope Black comes looking for trouble,
because he'll find plenty.

407
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,087
Spoken like a true philanthropist.
Or is it humanitarian?

408
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,922
Sorry, I can never remember
which one you're pretending to be, Simon.

409
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,891
Harrison.

410
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,730
- Don't get up.
- Ha, ha.

411
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,248
Another fan of yours, doctor?

412
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,090
Can we talk, detective?

413
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,969
So you were right.

414
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,083
Barry's not the only one who's special.

415
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,602
This guy that tried
to kill Simon Stagg today, he could...

416
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,882
Replicate spontaneously.

417
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,411
Yeah, we know.

418
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,647
Did you know about Barry?

419
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,081
When he was first in his coma...

420
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,125
...you came to the hospital...

421
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,931
...and you asked me
if you could take him to S.T.A.R. Labs.

422
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,328
Did you know what he could do?

423
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,842
- Heh.
- Heh.

424
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,129
I had my suspicions that he was...

425
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,207
...affected.

426
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,763
- Mm-hm.
- Hey, Joe.

427
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,285
I was never looking to become...

428
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,329
...a senior member
of a secret crime-fighting unit.

429
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,283
You and I both know, we are the only ones
equipped to protect Central City.

430
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,290
Maybe I'm more interested
in protecting Barry.

431
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,125
But he's set to fly into the fire
right along with you.

432
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,406
No, he's not.

433
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,928
Not anymore. He quit. He didn't tell you?

434
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,326
I haven't seen him.

435
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,891
I'm sure it's only temporary.

436
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,010
From what I know of Barry,
when he sets his mind to something...

437
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,682
...no one's gonna talk him out of it,
but the next time he suits up...

438
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,928
...runs headlong into danger, he will fail.

439
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,685
Why?

440
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,369
He doesn't think he's capable.

441
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,483
Doubt...

442
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,367
...is his real enemy, Joe.

443
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,329
Not whatever's lurking out there.

444
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,169
And as long as you continue to doubt him,
he'll keep doubting himself.

445
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,001
And for the record, I care about him too.

446
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,083
Guess you were hungry.

447
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,283
Stress eating.

448
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,201
I came to say I'm sorry.
And you're right, I have been distant.

449
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,603
- Correct.
- Kind of a jerk.

450
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,090
You should apologize more often.
You are sensational at it.

451
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,682
So, what were you gonna tell me
the other day?

452
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,043
I thought I had to do something.
Something I thought was important.

453
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,726
But it turns out that I'm
not very good at it.

454
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,122
But what I am good at is being your friend.

455
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,011
So if you need help
with a new topic for your article...

456
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,090
I found one.
Something that actually interests me.

457
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,728
I know this is gonna sound crazy.

458
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,127
It's been all over the internet this week.

459
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,926
At a building fire. At a bank heist.

460
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,805
When those robbers
shot at the security guard...

461
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,644
...he said he was whooshed outside.

462
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,486
- Something out there is saving people.
- I thought you were taking Journalism.

463
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,290
Not Science Fiction Writing.

464
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,284
Since I have known you,
you have believed in the impossible.

465
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,762
What if you were right
about the night that your mom died?

466
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,084
Look, I told you. I'm through.

467
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,604
I know, but you need
to get to S.T.A.R. Labs right now.

468
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,330
- Barry, it's okay.
- It is not okay. Black is here and he's...

469
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,763
...just standing there.
That's not him, is it?

470
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,810
It's one of his replicates.

471
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,805
- How did you get it?
- I grew him.

472
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,566
I isolated a sample
of Black's blood from your suit...

473
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,411
...to see if I could trigger
the in vitro cultivation process...

474
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,130
...and learn how Black multiplies.

475
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,286
So I exposed the target cells to a protein
gel and they began replicating into that.

476
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,450
Why doesn't he...? It doing anything?

477
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,440
We did a brain scan. Involuntary motor
functions are active. Little else.

478
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,810
- We think it's acting as a receiver.
- The clones are an empty shell without Black.

479
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,009
Shut down the real Black
and you might shut them all down.

480
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,170
How do we know which one's Black?

481
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,488
That occurred to me
given your passing out.

482
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,486
Black has limits, just like you. Controlling
all of those clones must require...

483
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,967
...a tremendous amount
of physical strength.

484
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,523
So look for the one showing signs
of weakness or fatigue. He's the prime.

485
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,169
Just a theory, but one you might
want to put to the test, Mr. Allen.

486
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,325
I whipped up these high calorie protein
bars for you to keep your metabolism up.

487
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,081
- Unh.
- Aah!

488
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,244
- Any more of them?
- Nope.

489
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,404
- Why did it start moving?
- The prime.

490
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,206
The prime is on the move.
This heard the summons.

491
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,165
And I know where he was summoned to.
Stagg Industries.

492
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,524
You should call it in.

493
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,160
Police can't fight this.

494
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,369
What Black's become, like Mardon...

495
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,369
...beyond me. Maybe way beyond them too.

496
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,201
The only person it's not beyond is you.

497
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,204
You gotta do this. I get it.

498
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,206
So for once in your life,
do what I tell you to do.

499
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,164
Go stop him.

500
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,968
Just get me those figures by morning, okay?

501
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,200
Freeze. Don't move!

502
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,721
- Hello, Danton.
- Goodbye, Simon.

503
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,446
Stay here.

504
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,964
I know Stagg stole your research, but that
doesn't give you the right to murder.

505
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,643
You think this is about my job?

506
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,451
This is about Elizabeth.

507
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,364
She was my wife.

508
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,766
She had a degenerative coronary disease.

509
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,841
She'd been on the transplant list for
years, but time was running out.

510
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,283
- So if I couldn't get her a new heart...
- You were gonna grow her one.

511
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,564
I was so close until Stagg stole my
research so he could reap the glory.

512
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,644
And I got to bury my best friend.

513
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,324
Now...

514
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,805
...I'm alone.

515
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,529
Remember, Barry. Find the prime.

516
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,325
There's too many of them to fight.

517
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,927
- Barry, you need to isolate the prime.
- I can't.

518
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,321
It's impossible.

519
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,525
Nothing's impossible, Barry.
You taught me that. You can do this.

520
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,884
Barry.

521
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,404
- Barry, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

522
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,249
I'm fine.

523
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,249
It's done.

524
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,490
Hang on.

525
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,605
No.

526
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,887
- Don't.
- Unh!

527
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,401
Central City police officials...

528
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,965
...are now confirming
former employee Danton Black...

529
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,324
- I tried to save him.
- Doesn't sound like he wanted to be saved.

530
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,086
Some people, when they break...

531
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,328
...they can't be put together again.

532
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,009
Some people heal even stronger.

533
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,649
I hope so.

534
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,603
Well, at least Multiplex
won't be able to hurt anyone else.

535
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,609
Told you I'd come up with a cool name.

536
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,923
I may be the one in the suit
doing all the running...

537
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,568
...but when I'm out there helping people,
making a difference...

538
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,290
...you're all out there with me.

539
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,044
Finally realized something.

540
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,048
We were all struck by that lightning.

541
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,969
Hungry?

542
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,083
Pepperoni. Olives.

543
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,164
And jalapenos. Just like you like it.

544
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,566
Thank you.

545
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,883
You were wrong.

546
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,528
I have been wrong a lot this week.
You're gonna have to be specific.

547
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,842
You said that one of the things
driving you...

548
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,209
...to run around out there
was that you couldn't help your dad.

549
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,127
You can help him.

550
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,521
We can.

551
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,410
We're gonna figure out who or what
killed your mother that night.

552
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,082
And then we're gonna
get your father out of prison.

553
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,210
Together.

554
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,006
Joe, what I said about you
not being my father...

555
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,522
Barry, I know. I know I'm not your father.

556
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,402
You're right, you're not.

557
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,244
You're just the man
who kept me fed and in clothes...

558
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,764
...who sat beside my bed at night until I fell
asleep because I was afraid of the dark...

559
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,767
...helped me with my homework.

560
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,328
You taught me how to drive and shave...

561
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,961
...and you dropped me off at college.

562
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,566
Sounds a lot like a dad to me.

563
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,842
Every kid dreams of being a superhero.

564
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,604
Having powers. Saving people.

565
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,362
But no kid thinks about what it's like when
you're a hero and you're not saving people.

566
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,605
Truth is, not much else changes.
You still hurt. You still love.

567
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,610
You still wish, and hope, and fear things.

568
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,881
You still need people to help you with all
of it. In some ways, that's the best part.

569
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,011
Barry, an armored car
was just hijacked on Griffen Avenue.

570
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,362
- Get your ass over there.
- I got it.

571
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,324
Actually, the best part, it's this:

572
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,482
Wells. Who the hell let you in here?

573
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,324
You been having a party out there?

574
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,883
Oh, I'm sure you saw on TV.
Former employee of mine tried to kill me.

575
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,202
Former employee
with the ability to replicate...

576
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,370
...faced off against a man
who could move at super speed.

577
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,009
You've seen him too, haven't you?

578
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,242
- Indeed, I have.
- Extraordinary.

579
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,531
The power he possesses.

580
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,850
It's like the... It's like the gods of old.
Like Mercury on Earth.

581
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,641
Can you imagine if you could control
his power, if you could harness it...

582
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,162
...you could change
what it means to be human.

583
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,208
The man in the red mask is the key.
And I'm gonna get him.

584
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,207
The man in the red mask...

585
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,762
...he's called the Flash.

586
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,929
Or at least...

587
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,368
...he will be, one day.

588
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,521
What the hell?

589
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,362
Forgive me, Simon.

590
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,566
I'm worried you'll think
this is personal. It's not.

591
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,487
It's just that the man in the red mask...

592
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,200
...the fastest man alive...

593
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,044
...he must be kept...

594
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,289
...safe.
