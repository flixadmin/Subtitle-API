1
00:00:01,307 --> 00:00:02,574
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:07,090
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:09,643
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:11,979
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:16,299
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:20,571
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:24,825
I must be something else.

8
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:26,388
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:27,907
Slade!

10
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,913
I need someone qualified
to fix this boat.

11
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:32,332
I sure hope a Mr. Hendrik
is there with you.

12
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:34,001
There's no way
in hell I'm going back there.

13
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:36,920
Please, put the gun down!

14
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:39,506
You cannot die
until you have known

15
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:41,925
complete despair.

16
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:44,761
And you will,
I promise.

17
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:47,631
Stay away from Thea.
No...I can't!

18
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:48,955
She's not safe when
she's around you.

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,634
You love her,

20
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:52,586
and that's why you're going to do
what I'm asking.

21
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:54,354
It's
a dangerous city.

22
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:56,807
Mr. Wilson?

23
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,059
Call me Slade.

24
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:06,283
Your mascara
is running.

25
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,871
Thank you.

26
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:13,023
Are you
all right?

27
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:16,693
I don't know.

28
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:18,545
It's my boyfriend.

29
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:21,164
Ex-boyfriend now.

30
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:25,302
He just completely out of nowhere
decides to end things.

31
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:29,372
Heartbreak is something
I know all too well.

32
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:32,926
It's not an easy thing
to recover from.

33
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,929
Sometimes you never do.

34
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,021
Um, we're not at--

35
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:46,239
this isn't my home.

36
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,458
You're not
going home, Thea.

37
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,664
Get out.

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,086
Get out!

39
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:11,682
Hello, Thea.

40
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:14,851
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

41

43

No time.

44
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:30,367
You letting
the bad guys

45
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:31,601
stay alive
this year

46
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:33,120
has filled the jails up
to capacity.

47
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:35,122
Yeah.

48
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:37,457
Ready?

49
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,576
Well, I've been
working with Sara,

50
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:40,827
but I'm not exactly
a natural.

51
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,496
Neither was I.

52
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,803
Ok. We have
some work to do.

53
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:52,536
Sorry, I'm just having
a hard time keeping

54
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,591
my head in the game today.

55
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:54,758
Thea?

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,126
I just can't
stop thinking

57
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,144
what's the worst
that can happen

58
00:02:57,146 --> 00:02:58,628
if I just told
her the truth?

59
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,963
Well, I told a guy
the truth and he got

60
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:01,932
struck by lightning.
To be fair,

61
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:05,852
probably won't happen again,
statistically.

62
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:09,106
Telling Thea the truth
won't make her safer.

63
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:11,908
Just the opposite.

64
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,311
What we're doing, Roy,
it's dangerous.

65
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:18,031
And anyone that is
even in our orbit

66
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:19,750
can get hurt.

67
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,787
Try again.

68
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,872
This time...

69
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,208
Aim.

70
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,193
What are those?

71
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:31,828
About a month's worth
of phone messages

72
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,847
from Queen Consolidated.
Toss them.

73
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,349
That's what I did with last month's
phone messages.

74
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,769
With Slade out there,
I don't have time for the company.

75
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,604
Well, you have to
make time, Oliver.

76
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:42,338
At least
three hours.

77
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,857
The annual board meeting.

78
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,559
There's absolutely
zero way that

79
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:47,510
the CEO can avoid
being there.

80
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:49,029
And I know
it's been a while,

81
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,114
so in case you've forgotten,
that's you.

82
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:56,069
Do you remember where
you put your business suit?

83
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:59,539
Or do you keep it
in a cool glass case, too?

84
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:09,833
I'm going to kill
all of you!

85
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:12,085
This is not personal.

86
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,704
Well, maybe a little.

87
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:16,039
It's not.

88
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,758
This is about
survival.

89
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,560
Survival.
What a noble word for murder.

90
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:23,430
Slade gave us no option.

91
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,217
Hendrik for Oliver.

92
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,902
And what gives any of us
the right to decide

93
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:31,271
one's life is more valuable
than another?

94
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:34,024
He is tied up.
We are not.

95
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:37,327
Once he gets the boat working,
Slade will have no more need for him.

96
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:40,230
So let's not kid
ourselves. Doing this

97
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:43,066
is effectively sentencing
Hendrik to death.

98
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:44,785
He would do the same
thing to any of us!

99
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:47,087
In heartbeat!

100
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:49,089
This is only option.

101
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:52,592
What if it's also
an opportunity?

102
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,594
To do what?

103
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:56,963
To kill Slade.

104
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,275
I know that I haven't been
here in a while,

105
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:10,110
but you don't look
like the entire Board of Directors.

106
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,312
The meeting doesn't start
for another half hour.

107
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,597
Really?

108
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:17,484
I routinely bump all
appointments 30 minutes

109
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:19,319
in anticipation
of you being late.

110
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,704
It's good policy.

111
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:22,205
But, thank you
for coming out

112
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,291
of hibernation for this.

113
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:27,294
Whether you recognize it
or not, it's your name on the building,

114
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,045
and no matter how many
meetings you miss,

115
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:31,164
you're still the public face
of this company.

116
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,083
Isabel, I realize
I have been distracted.

117
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:36,169
Thank you
for picking up the slack.

118
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,338
Ours is an unconventional
partnership,

119
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,890
but it's a partnership.

120
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,558
And it's working.

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,893
Indeed it is.

122
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,895
Oliver...

123
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,346
Your mother's here.

124
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,068
Family squabble?

125
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,474
And how is Ms. Rochev
these days?

126
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,861
Still angry that Dorothy
dropped a house on her sister?

127
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,645
Ahem. What are you
doing here?

128
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:05,615
Have you heard from Thea?
No.

129
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:08,168
You haven't returned
any of my phone calls,

130
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,986
so I'm left to resort
to checking in person

131
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,838
as to whether you're attending
the debate tonight.

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,091
I told you that I would publicly
support your campaign.

133
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:17,494
Anything else?

134
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:19,596
It would be
embarrassing for us both

135
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,332
if you couldn't at least
appear to be my son tonight.

136
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:26,603
I have gotten pretty good at
pretending to be someone I'm not.

137
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,472
I learned it from you.

138
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,067
Oh, excuse me,
have you seen Thea Queen?

139
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,954
Ok.

140
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:47,357
Speedy, it's Ollie,
and I'm at the debate,

141
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,525
where I thought
you would be.

142
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:51,962
Listen, I know that
you're upset about Roy,

143
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,546
but mom needs
both of us here.

144
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,548
So please,
just call me back.

145
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,534
You do not look happy.
Is everything all right?

146
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:01,638
Yes. My sister's
just a little late.

147
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,391
I'm afraid that's my fault.

148
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,381
SCPD insisted that I arrive
with a motorcade.

149
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:13,316
We tied up traffic
all over the city.

150
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:15,185
I'm sure Thea's
probably just fallen victim

151
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:17,437
to gridlock.

152
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,022
Well, I should
probably try her again.

153
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:21,024
Good luck tonight, Sebastian.

154
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:22,776
Thank you, sir.

155
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:30,116
I thought backstage was supposed
to be restricted access.

156
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:33,169
The benefits of having
a district attorney's badge, I guess.

157
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,071
You stop by to wish
Moira good luck?

158
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:38,008
I did. But I'm really glad
I ran into you.

159
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,427
I owe you an apology.

160
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:43,296
I accused you
of really terrible things.

161
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:46,383
You were going
through a very difficult time.

162
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:48,601
I'm just happy
you're on the mend.

163
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:50,804
Good luck tonight.

164
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:52,772
I'm not the one
who's going to need it.

165
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:56,443
Sebastian Blood is not
the man you think he is.

166
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:59,229
He's not going to revive the city
with social services.

167
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,681
He's going to bankrupt it
with unfunded mandates.

168
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:04,200
Mrs. Queen's problem
with my proposals

169
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:07,003
is that they will be paid
for by the one percent.

170
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:09,406
It's time that the wealthiest people
stop avoiding their responsibility.

171
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,958
But it will limit
their abilities to hire people.

172
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,661
All right, that's time,
and I will remind the candidates

173
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,579
to please refrain
from interrupting.

174
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,648
Now we have the next
in our series of video questions

175
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,000
submitted by
Starling City voters.

176
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:23,553
This one comes from...
Thea Queen.

177
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,755
Ok, there must be
some mistake.

178
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:31,561
Help!

179
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:35,432
Help! Somebody
help me, please!

180
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,467
He--sla--

181
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,021
Oh, my God!

182
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:55,664
We're going to find her, Roy.
We're going to get her back.

183
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,699
She's a tough girl.

184
00:08:57,701 --> 00:09:00,318
Is she going to be alive
when we find her?

185
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,854
You can't think like that.

186
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:06,675
I can't stop
thinking like that.

187
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,883
Mr. Diggle.

188
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:17,168
Mr. Diggle!

189
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,438
I think I might have found
something. I'm working on it.

190
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,108
I am suspending my campaign
and devoting its resources

191
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,027
to the safe return
of Thea Queen.

192
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:30,265
Well, the video referenced
a demand, but no ransom.

193
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:33,235
Which means this might not
be about money.

194
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,953
We're going to get her
back, Moira.

195
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,976
I promise you.
Thea's coming home.

196
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:37,694
Now, can you think of anyone

197
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,500
who might want to get
to you through Thea?

198
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:45,050
No one except
for the families

199
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,169
of the 503 people
that died last year.

200
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,938
This isn't about the quake.

201
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,506
Well, how can you
be so sure?

202
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,441
You just need
to find the man in the mask!

203
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:54,776
Look, we're working on it.

204
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,528
We're running down every lead.

205
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,029
What are those leads?

206
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,514
Oh, God!

207
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,384
Oh, God, how could I
have let this happen?

208
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,957
Excuse me for a minute.

209
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,542
If I hear
about one more

210
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,911
invasive press inquiry being
sent to Mr. Queen

211
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,696
or to any member
of the Queen family,

212
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,381
I will hold you
personally responsible.

213
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,867
You're very scary.
Thank you.

214
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,386
My job is to take things off your plate,
now more than ever.

215
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:24,256
To that end, you remember how
at today's meeting,

216
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,374
the board nominated
new officers?

217
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,260
Voting has to take place
within 24 hours.

218
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:29,978
It cannot be suspended.
It's an SEC thing.

219
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,730
I can't think
about this right now.

220
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,348
I know, and I'm sorry,
but you have to.

221
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,933
You're the CEO and you
have responsibilities--

222
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,935
Which you handle
for me all the time.

223
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,888
A board vote is several orders of
magnitude different

224
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,439
from covering
a missed meeting.

225
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:45,193
You could appoint
someone CEO pro tempore.

226
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:47,529
That's not a good idea.
I'm appointing you.

227
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:49,414
What?

228
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,686
Congratulations.

229
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,454
You are the temporary CEO.

230
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,373
I can't.

231
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,176
Please.

232
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,044
Thank you.

233
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,796
Have Thea thank me,

234
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,248
when she's back
safe at home.

235
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,501
Mr. Queen? I need to talk
to you, it's about Mr. Wilson.

236
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:12,041
Since the last place
Thea was seen was Verdant

237
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,723
I used credit card receipts,
compiled a list

238
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,857
of customers last night,
pinged all their cell phones

239
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,726
and hacked into their
photos. The NSA is right;

240
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:19,778
it's a lot easier when
you don't need a warrant.

241
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,930
I eyeballed every photo.
There must have been thousands.

242
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,549
It's Thea.
I found this.

243
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,401
Partial plate
three blocks from the club.

244
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:28,737
Car's registered
to a Slade Wilson,

245
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,038
and it has GPS.

246
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,606
Where is it
right now?

247
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,775
Parked outside
a defunct bar on Roosevelt.

248
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,494
Ok, this doesn't
seem easy to you?

249
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,105
Slade using a car
registered in his name?

250
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,548
The whole thing smells rotten.

251
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:42,000
Either Thea's there or he is.
Either way, we have to go.

252
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,470
Yeah, I figured you'd say that,
which is why I worked up these.

253
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,654
Tibetan pit viper venom.

254
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,679
The League of Assassins'
poison of choice.

255
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:51,259
And the most powerful sedative
that I've ever worked with.

256
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:54,062
That'll give us an advantage.
But you are going to give us another.

257
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,830
Are you sure
you want me to go?

258
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:58,733
Are you angry?
Use that rage.

259
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,402
Well, you're just
always telling me to hold back.

260
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,437
Not tonight.

261
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,409
Landmines?

262
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,411
What kind of island
is this?

263
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:11,413
Can you remove the explosive?

264
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,665
Certainly.

265
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,533
Without it going off, eh.

266
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,503
Less certain.

267
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:22,757
Ah, KGB.

268
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,293
You taught me
many, many things.

269
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:27,629
Russian bomb,

270
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:31,216
Japanese bomb;

271
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:35,437
they both go...boom.

272
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,342
Congratulations, we are not dead.
Now what?

273
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,345
Well, Slade takes Hendrik
as we agreed.

274
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,480
And then once
they're far enough away...

275
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:46,948
What--

276
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,367
you want to rig
Hendrik into bomb?

277
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,403
Well, Peter was right.
Handing Hendrik over to Slade

278
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:54,372
is the same thing as killing him.
And you're right, too.

279
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,908
We don't have a choice.
I mean, at least this way,

280
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,627
he can take out Slade,
and then we can take the ship.

281
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,381
What?

282
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,417
Just...wondering.

283
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,837
When did you
become so scary?

284
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,019
Where is she, Slade?

285
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,745
The man
asked you a question.

286
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:42,003
Where is she?

287
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,709
What are you going
to do, kid? Kill me?

288
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,214
But then who would tell you...

289
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:56,134
Where your beloved Thea is?

290
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,808
Call detective Lance.

291
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,527
Tell him
to come down here.

292
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,695
Wh--what? Why?

293
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:09,731
To arrest
Slade Wilson.

294
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,894
Any idea what this son of a bitch
wants with Thea Queen?

295
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:38,466
No. We just need to make sure that
Slade gives up where he's holding her.

296
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,211
Does Oliver know?

297
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,213
That you're working
with the Arrow on this?

298
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,115
Oliver doesn't know
anything about the Arrow.

299
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,018
Hey, are you ok?

300
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,387
Yeah. It's just
that look in Moira's eyes.

301
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,922
Terrified she's lost
her daughter.

302
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:56,676
I couldn't go
through that again, Sara.

303
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,398
Officer Lance?

304
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,217
The Queen
family's here.

305
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:07,570
Mr. Lance, did he tell
you where Thea is?

306
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,555
Mrs. Queen,
thank you for coming.

307
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:11,491
This doesn't
make any sense.

308
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,693
Slade Wilson
is a friend.

309
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:16,246
And he's been in Costa Rica
for the past 72 hours.

310
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,232
He can provide flight manifests,
phone records,

311
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:22,619
even some videos, so he couldn't have
taken your daughter.

312
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,454
If he didn't,
then why did you arrest him?

313
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,457
We didn't.
He was apprehended by the Vigilante.

314
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,509
Who then contacted
officer Lance.

315
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,344
Lieutenant,
I can explain--

316
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:33,013
No, I think I got
a pretty clear picture.

317
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,631
God, you're a special
kind of stupid.

318
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,017
The whole reason
you're wearing that uniform

319
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,252
instead of a detective's shield is 'cause
you were working with the Vigilante.

320
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,554
A young girl is missing,
and you just--

321
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:42,648
And now you arrest someone
on his say-so?

322
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:44,442
You'll be lucky if the next uniform

323
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,060
that puts you in
isn't prison gray.

324
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,272
They're calling you
Deathstroke.

325
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:01,708
It's a bit flamboyant.

326
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,094
I like it.

327
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,329
How did you
get off the island?

328
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,465
That is your first question?

329
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,300
Well, you've made it
pretty clear

330
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,285
that you're not going to tell me
where my sister is,

331
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,555
so, yeah. That's
my first question.

332
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,725
I swam.

333
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,994
But it wasn't
without its obstacles.

334
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,196
The rip current
dragged me under.

335
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,149
The rocks on the reef
cut up my flesh to the bone.

336
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,169
But the Mirakuru...

337
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:32,021
It regenerated everything.

338
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,993
Except this.

339
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,698
You know, it's
just the two of us in here,

340
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,668
so why don't we try
being honest?

341
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,371
Why are you
doing this?

342
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:51,458
You know why.

343
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:56,262
It was five years ago.

344
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,547
It was yesterday.

345
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,968
Oh, I tried to let go
of the island...

346
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,838
But it's still got
a hold on me.

347
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,841
And if that hood that you wear
every night is any indication,

348
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:12,228
it's still got
a hold of you, kid.

349
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,533
She never did anything to you.
I did.

350
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,202
Shado is dead because
of a choice that I made.

351
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,621
So punish me.
Blame me.

352
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,373
But...

353
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,291
Thea.

354
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,213
You want me to beg?

355
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,169
Is that what this all about?
Because I'm begging.

356
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,172
You win.

357
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:42,142
Just, please...

358
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,378
Please tell me
where she is.

359
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,182
Hmm, that must have been
hard for you to say.

360
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:54,237
Thea...

361
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:58,074
Well, Thea's--

362
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,892
Mr. Queen.

363
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:02,162
Who the hell
let you in here?

364
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,497
Mr. Wilson...

365
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:07,784
You are free to go,

366
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,953
with the department's
deepest apologies.

367
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,121
No need, Lieutenant.

368
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,073
An innocent girl's life
hangs in the balance.

369
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,309
You need to follow
every lead possible.

370
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,011
Well, still, you should
know that officer Lance

371
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,829
is facing some very
serious charges.

372
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,882
Well, don't pursue them
on my behalf.

373
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,051
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

374
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:33,776
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson, have
the police cleared you of all charges?

375
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:36,362
I was in Costa Rica,
but returned to Starling City

376
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:38,481
as soon as I heard
the terrible news.

377
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:39,899
What did you tell them about
Thea Queen's disappearance?

378
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,985
I'm offering every resource
at my disposal,

379
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,820
plus a $5 million reward

380
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,290
for any information that leads
to Thea Queen's captors.

381
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:05,141
This is Dig,
I've got the follow.

382
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:07,010
Tracker
on his car is active.

383
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,512
Roy, he's coming up
on your position.

384
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:12,232
Got him. He's
turning up Warner.

385
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,817
I see him. Heading north.

386
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,157
Damn it, I lost him!

387
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,975
It's all right.
I still have eyes on him.

388
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:26,029
- Sara, cut right onto Downey.
- Got 'em.

389
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:37,924
Negative.
Negative, it's not him!

390
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,042
What?!

391
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,993
Oh, my God.

392
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:42,762
He's cloned
the tracker's signal.

393
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,996
Roy, you've got to move!

394
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:46,182
Roy, you got
to pick him up on Fuller.

395
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:56,059
Roy, do you
still have eyes on him?

396
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,560
Roy?

397
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,195
Roy!

398
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,710
Leave us.

399
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:19,082
Sorry I was gone
for so long.

400
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,584
Screw you.

401
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,419
I saw Oliver
and your mother.

402
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,556
They're all quite
worried about you.

403
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,226
If you hurt them,
I swear I--

404
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,645
Please. Go on.

405
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,230
Finish that sentence.

406
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,948
I'm curious to know
what kind of threat

407
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,518
a 19-year-old girl
can make.

408
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,423
What do you want with me?

409
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:46,275
Well, that, Thea...

410
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:48,444
is a very long story.

411
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:51,447
Looks like I've got time.

412
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,949
Not at all.

413
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,336
You're free to go.

414
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,121
What?

415
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,274
I had to make a point,

416
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:03,126
and I made it.

417
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,011
The door
is unlocked,

418
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,630
so you can leave
any time you'd like.

419
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:12,635
But those guys
who work for you

420
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,520
will shoot me
the second I walk out.

421
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:16,606
No, they won't.

422
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,525
Their instructions were to keep
you here until I returned.

423
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:22,812
And I have. So...

424
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,947
You're free to go.

425
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:28,234
But, if you do,
you may never know about

426
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:30,119
your brother's secret.

427
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,537
What?

428
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:34,874
Your brother
has a secret, Thea.

429
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,960
Would you like
to know what it is?

430
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,293
So...

431
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,878
What now?

432
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,997
Wait for Oliver.

433
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:55,049
Figure out what our next
move will be.

434
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:57,167
Wait for him
to tell us, you mean.

435
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,670
We can't do anything
without King Queen's permission.

436
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:01,138
You're out of line, Roy.

437
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,507
All right, let's all
just calm down here.

438
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:05,009
Slade outplayed us.
It happens.

439
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:08,613
No, it only happened because
the police let Slade go--

440
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:11,532
after we turned him in,
because Oliver told us to.

441
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,284
What were we
supposed to do?

442
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:15,319
You're Special Forces.

443
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:17,154
She's an international
assassin. You would think

444
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:19,323
between the three
of us, we could have gotten answers

445
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:21,876
out of Slade ourselves
instead of turning him into the police.

446
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:24,194
Here's what's really sick;
Is we didn't even question him

447
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:26,196
because he said it was
the right thing to do.

448
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:27,906
Just like he said  that I needed to
break up with Thea.

449
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:30,586
One week after telling me that it wasn't
safe for me to leave her alone.

450
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:32,553
Wait!

451
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:35,039
You think it's Oliver's fault
that Slade took Thea?

452
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,441
I think it was his fault that
I wasn't there to stop Slade.

453
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:41,412
And I think you're just
blaming Oliver because you lost Slade.

454
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:43,655
Well, of course you'd take his side,
you're screwing him.

455
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:56,527
Can you guys give us
a minute, please?

456
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:07,088
Do you remember how
she loved to color?

457
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,208
Your father would buy
her boxes of crayons by the truckload.

458
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,011
She could never get enough.

459
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,482
She'd draw on the walls.

460
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:23,554
And I could never get angry,
because it was just so adorable.

461
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:30,361
You should try
to get some sleep.

462
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:33,397
Is my baby still alive?

463
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:34,782
What?

464
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:38,953
Is my baby
still alive?

465
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:46,444
Yes.

466
00:23:46,446 --> 00:23:49,797
I woke up every day
for five years

467
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,166
the mother
who lost her son.

468
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:54,051
I--

469
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:56,003
I can't...

470
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:01,642
I can't
endure it again.

471
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:05,513
And now you hate me,

472
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:07,465
and you have every
justification.

473
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,517
Now is not the time.
Yes, it is.

474
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,853
It is exactly
the time.

475
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,375
I've told you
that these lies

476
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:19,076
were to keep
our family safe;

477
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:20,861
to keep us all
together,

478
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:23,647
but that was
the biggest lie of all.

479
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:27,034
And I told it
to you, to Thea,

480
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:30,204
to myself.

481
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:33,323
Because I was too weak

482
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:36,577
to face
any kind of truth.

483
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,932
What's happening now
isn't your fault.

484
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,527
From the moment
your children are born,

485
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:58,149
you worry what the world
might do to them.

486
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:04,739
But you never stop to think what
you might do to them.

487
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:10,127
That we could be
our own worst enemy.

488
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:34,819
Ollie!

489
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:36,103
What did you do to him?

490
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:38,489
Not enough.

491
00:25:42,894 --> 00:25:44,912
And what did you
do to him?

492
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:47,081
We just knocked him.
It's better that way.

493
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,166
He wasn't exactly a fan
of the arrangement.

494
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:51,452
I would imagine.

495
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:52,753
Hendrik's all yours.

496
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:55,289
I know.

497
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:03,798
Wait.

498
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,267
It's an incredible thing,

499
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,936
this Mirakuru.

500
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,855
Not only does it
give you strength,

501
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:13,224
it also heightens
all of your senses.

502
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:19,230
TNT has
a particular smell.

503
00:26:23,318 --> 00:26:26,237
How long before
it goes off?

504
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,122
90 seconds?

505
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:30,291
60 seconds?

506
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:32,910
You're thinking that
the blast would kill me,

507
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:35,212
but I disagree.

508
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:39,467
Not that I could say
the same for you lot.

509
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:41,802
I am tempted

510
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:44,922
to see this
blow you to pieces.

511
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:50,227
But then again, maybe
I'll just shoot you

512
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:52,480
the same way
that he shot Shado.

513
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,234
No.

514
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:02,606
Slade...

515
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:08,412
Hey, where are you going?

516
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:10,480
Well, sitting around
here isn't helping Thea, now is it?

517
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:13,083
Neither is you running off
half-cocked, Roy.

518
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:15,419
I know
that you think

519
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:17,588
that this is the Mirakuru,
but it's not.

520
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,874
I'm right,
and you know that I am.

521
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:21,842
So you better get the hell
out of my way.

522
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:23,961
Roy, just calm down.

523
00:27:23,963 --> 00:27:25,763
It's what Thea
would want us to do.

524
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:28,665
She's right, Roy.
Come on, let's throttle back.

525
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:29,967
Aah!
Roy!

526
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:37,091
Next one goes
into your chest.

527
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:38,526
Let him go.

528
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:40,477
You would honestly kill me
because I dare

529
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:42,329
to criticize the almighty
Oliver Queen?

530
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:44,481
No, I'd kill you because you're
hurting my friend.

531
00:27:44,483 --> 00:27:46,283
Let him go.

532
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:51,121
Let him go!

533
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:55,910
What the hell's
going on down here?

534
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:57,294
I'm done.

535
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:59,029
That's what's
going on.

536
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,582
Thea, she's out there, hurt or worse,
because of one person.

537
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:03,834
And that is not
Slade Wilson.

538
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:06,220
Roy...

539
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:07,972
I believed in you.

540
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,509
There's nothing
left for me here.

541
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:16,814
Oh, my God. Oliver...
Now what?

542
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,550
Publicity has drafted

543
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:22,152
a rather compelling
statement,

544
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:23,988
and I will be doing
the talk show rounds

545
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,224
to control the spin.

546
00:28:27,226 --> 00:28:30,077
I'm sorry, Ms. Rochev,
but he was very...

547
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:32,663
Insistent.

548
00:28:32,665 --> 00:28:35,449
Can you give us
the room, please?

549
00:28:46,378 --> 00:28:48,596
Isabel, what have you done?

550
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:51,432
Me? Very little.

551
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:53,601
You're the one who
made this possible

552
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:56,420
when you made me CEO.

553
00:28:56,422 --> 00:28:58,138
I know it was
only temporary,

554
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,440
but it gave me
the authority I needed

555
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:01,025
to call an emergency
board meeting.

556
00:29:01,027 --> 00:29:03,527
As of 30 minutes ago,

557
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:05,696
your company
belongs to me.

558
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:06,981
The directors
unanimously made

559
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:08,649
my appointment
permanent.

560
00:29:08,651 --> 00:29:11,535
I'd say they lost faith
in your leadership,

561
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:14,238
but that would imply
there was any.

562
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,106
Maybe you should
have focused a little less on

563
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:19,743
your...evening
activities.

564
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:24,448
Slade...

565
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,216
You're working for him.

566
00:29:26,218 --> 00:29:28,636
With.

567
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:30,804
He knew planting me
in your family's business

568
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:32,756
would draw you back
to Starling City.

569
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:36,644
Truth be told, I was
skeptical, but...

570
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:39,763
Why are you doing this?!

571
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:42,633
I think it's sad
you don't know.

572
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:46,403
The sins of the father
are the sins of the son.

573
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,006
You are going to tell me
where my sister is,

574
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,792
or I am going to kill you.

575
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:14,406
Where is she?!

576
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:16,921
He's holding her
at a storage depot

577
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:19,974
just outside the city
limits. Tosca Cartage.

578
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:21,559
How do I know
you're not lying?!

579
00:30:23,763 --> 00:30:26,698
It's cute how you think
this isn't all playing out

580
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,867
exactly how he wants it to.

581
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,703
And he wants you
to come alone.

582
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,771
If he even smells
your partners,

583
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:37,041
he will gut sweet little
Thea like a trout.

584
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:43,447
It was a pleasure
doing business with you, Oliver.

585
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:46,084
At least let us
surround the perimeter.

586
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:48,619
No, Isabel was very clear.
I come alone or Thea dies.

587
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:50,922
Ollie, this is another one
of Slade's games, and unless--

588
00:30:50,924 --> 00:30:53,307
no, what I can't do,
Sara, is nothing!

589
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,310
What would you do if it were Laurel,
or your father, or your mother?

590
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,847
I will not get dragged into the
same debate over and over again!

591
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:01,899
Go.

592
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,018
Go get Thea.

593
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,270
Stop Slade.

594
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:08,689
Do whatever it takes.

595
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:12,410
End this once and for all.

596
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:44,001
Holy...Stop!

597
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,536
Stop, stop!

598
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:16,901
Halloween was six months
ago, ass hat.

599
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:21,122
Now get off the road
or get put down. You hear me?

600
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:46,264
I have
a proposal for you men.

601
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:53,637
Go!
Oliver, are you ok?

602
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,139
Yeah, I'm fine,
but Thea's not here.

603
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:57,825
You did it.
Did what?

604
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,193
Thea's fine. She's fine.

605
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:01,662
She walked into the precinct
five minutes ago.

606
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,664
Safe and sound.

607
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:06,601
What...

608
00:34:06,603 --> 00:34:09,203
Oliver, did you hear me?

609
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,601
Thea?
She's fine, no injuries.

610
00:34:19,602 --> 00:34:21,118
He didn't touch her.
He wasn't there.

611
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,653
He had a lot of men,
hired guns. He wasn't there.

612
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:24,121
Because he was
busy elsewhere.

613
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:27,292
Iron Heights reopened a wing
damaged in the quake.

614
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:30,327
There was a prisoner transfer.
Slade hijacked it.

615
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:31,712
Soldiers for his army.

616
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:33,881
Abducting Thea
was all a diversion.

617
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:35,716
Oliver!

618
00:34:38,553 --> 00:34:41,138
Oh, thank God.

619
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,756
Oh, my baby!

620
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:47,227
Ohh! My baby.

621
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:52,316
What?

622
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:55,035
He told me.

623
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:58,689
Mr. Wilson...

624
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:04,644
He told me your secret.

625
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:10,701
How you've been
lying to me

626
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:12,669
for years.

627
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:17,341
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?!

628
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:24,598
I believed in you.

629
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:28,368
We were trying
to keep you safe.

630
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:32,723
Do you have any idea
who you sound like?

631
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:35,759
You sound like her.

632
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:41,215
Slade...

633
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:43,951
Death's too good
for them.

634
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:46,570
This island should be their
punishment.

635
00:35:46,572 --> 00:35:48,372
Death is
too good for you.

636
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:51,742
This island should be
your punishment.

637
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:53,493
Their prison

638
00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:55,695
for the rest
of their days.

639
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:59,082
Your prison for the rest
of your days.

640
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:00,751
Get him out of here.

641
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:02,869
Slade...

642
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,054
Get back!

643
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:06,924
I can help you.

644
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:08,759
You can live,
or you can die.

645
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:10,811
You choose.

646
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:16,817
Would you like to send a message
to your family?

647
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:20,938
'Cause as soon as this boat is fixed,
I'm paying them a visit.

648
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:56,940
Hell of a night.

649
00:36:56,942 --> 00:36:59,926
Quentin Lance, master
of the understatement.

650
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,594
A word, officer?

651
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:02,863
Hold on, sweetheart.

652
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:04,865
Yeah?

653
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:08,485
I've spoken to DA Spencer
about your...situation.

654
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:10,621
She doesn't want
to press charges--

655
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:13,273
if you cooperate.

656
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,309
Tell us where
the vigilante is.

657
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:17,878
Well, I'd love
to, but I don't know.

658
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,831
Well, that's unfortunate.

659
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,215
Yeah, it looks like.

660
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:25,585
Quentin Larry Lance,
you're under arrest

661
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:28,338
for conspiracy and aiding
in multiple felonies.

662
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,457
What? Are you out
of your mind?!

663
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:32,342
What are you doing?
Wilson--Wilson did it!

664
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:34,645
I collared the right
guy. What are you--

665
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,763
You have the right
to remain silent.

666
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:38,265
What are you
doing?

667
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:41,251
You have the right to an attorney.
Dad!

668
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:43,770
Riding what pundits
are calling a sympathy bump,

669
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:46,490
Moira Queen pulled far ahead
of Sebastian Blood

670
00:37:46,492 --> 00:37:48,475
in the latest polls
conducted in

671
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,027
the last 24 hours
by channel--

672
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:52,996
The whole thing just
blew up in my face!

673
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:55,782
How the hell do I
get elected now?!

674
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:58,368
I think you intended
a different tone.

675
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,536
You said I'd be mayor!

676
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:01,038
And you just
delivered this election

677
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,823
for Moira Queen,
and for what?

678
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,977
What is this obsession you have
with the Queen family?

679
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:09,179
You haven't told him?

680
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:11,214
Shh.

681
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:13,100
You promised me.

682
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:14,851
I promised you this city.

683
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:18,672
I promised you an army
with which to take it.

684
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,944
What is our status?

685
00:38:23,946 --> 00:38:26,196
Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences division

686
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:27,570
is now fully dedicated

687
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:30,138
to replicating a serum
based on your blood sample.

688
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:35,372
You see...

689
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:39,459
Everything
is proceeding as planned.

690
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:41,912
Where are you going now?

691
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:45,799
To service my obsession.

692
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:50,470
Oliver Queen
needs one more distraction.

693
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,938
What are you two doing here?

694
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,525
We thought this is
where you would go.

695
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:13,226
You're predictable.
That, and you've been

696
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,278
sleeping on
the cot at night.

697
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:19,583
What are you doing here?

698
00:39:19,585 --> 00:39:21,501
Where else would we be?

699
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:31,878
Roy was right.

700
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,849
At every turn, I had made
the wrong decision.

701
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,751
With him,

702
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:40,270
with...the company,

703
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:42,439
and...

704
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:45,692
and with Thea.

705
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:51,431
I was so focused
on what Slade might do to me,

706
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,150
that it never...

707
00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:56,353
even occurred to me
what I could do to myself.

708
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:02,292
I am my own worst enemy.

709
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:04,661
That's Slade talking, Oliver.
Don't let him in your head.

710
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:06,779
I can't keep him out
of my head, Diggle!

711
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:10,116
I can't...I can't
stop him from doing anything.

712
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,002
Yes, you can.

713
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:15,005
What makes you so sure?

714
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:17,007
Because you're not alone, man.

715
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,382
Now what, boss?

716
00:40:37,862 --> 00:40:40,697
Now we fight back.

717
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,986
Police have issued a warrant
for Slade Wilson

718
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:48,768
after Thea Queen named him

719
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:51,028
as the mastermind of her
kidnapping yesterday.

720
00:40:51,793 --> 00:40:54,544
This in the wake of Wilson's
arrest and subsequent release

721
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:58,298
by the SCPD hours before
Ms. Queen was released.

722
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,018
In a statement to the press,
SCPD Lieutenant Franklin Pike

723
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,788
reiterated his support
for his department

724
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,641
despite what appears
to be a serious blunder.

725
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:09,860
He went on to say,
the SCPD is committed--

726
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,530
To making sure any arrest
they make is a legal one,

727
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:15,866
but without sufficient--

728
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,020
Don't worry.

729
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:22,572
I am not here
to harm you.

730
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:25,024
Go to hell!

731
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:28,194
All in good time,
I'm sure.

732
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:30,330
But before then,

733
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:32,749
I have come
to Starling City

734
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,468
to see Oliver Queen
suffer.

735
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,137
Oliver...What?

736
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:38,905
Why?

737
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:41,641
Because he's
not the man you think he is.

738
00:41:41,643 --> 00:41:43,260
And how would you know that?

739
00:41:43,262 --> 00:41:47,430
Because I know
Oliver Queen is...

740
00:41:47,432 --> 00:41:50,267
The Arrow.

741
