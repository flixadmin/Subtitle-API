1
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,368
Oh, yes! You got donuts.

2
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,605
I already ate
all the Boston Cream.

3
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,406
Kyle!

4
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,113
This place
gives me the creeps.

5
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:24,484
Relax. That Popsicle
hasn't moved in 50 years.

6
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:57,919
Is that normal?

7
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,286
No.

8
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:03,558
Someone's hacking the system.
What?

9
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,526
The containment tank
is destabilizing.

10
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,427
He's waking up.

11
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,293
We need more guys.

12
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,495
That is all the guys.

13
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,166
Wait a second.

14
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,135
I thought
we were going tubing.

15
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,369
Hold on, hold on.
Is this a race?

16
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,105
You're going down!

17
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,241
It is my destiny
to claim the throne

18
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,308
of Family Champion, hedgehog.

19
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,611
Cute.

20
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,179
Are you sure
you want to challenge

21
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,747
the fastest creature
in the universe?

22
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,282
I mean, that's kind of
my whole brand.

23
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,152
Okay, Tom and Maddie,

24
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,787
count us down.
Right!

25
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,022
Don't worry,
a little sibling rivalry
is healthy.

26
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:50,158
Me and my brothers used to
do this kind of thing
all the time.

27
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,860
Tom, your brothers are lunatics
and neither of them
were born with the power

28
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:55,462
to trigger a global
cataclysmic event.

29
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,231
That's a fair point.
Did you hear that, boys?

30
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,599
No cataclysmic events, okay?

31
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,268
Let's keep this
cataclysmic-less.

32
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,369
Ten-four!
Understood,
Lord of the Donuts.

33
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,506
Then on your marks, get set...

34
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:07,041
go!

35
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,376
And way out in front,

36
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,045
to the surprise
of absolutely no one,

37
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,346
it's the Blue Blur,
the Red-Shoed Rocket,

38
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,184
the one, the only--
Come on, Sonic!

39
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,753
Catch up! Yeah!

40
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,655
What in the what, now?

41
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,623
I am also defeating you,
hedgehog!

42
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,759
Seriously?
All right, you know what?

43
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,928
Time to light the afterburners.

44
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,198
Look! It's a bird! It's a plane!

45
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,667
It's Air Hedgehog!

46
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,116
Yes! I did it! I...

47
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,719
lost?

48
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,621
How is that even possible?
I do not lose.

49
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,723
I am also defeating you,
hedgehog.

50
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:58,526
Okay, okay, I get it, man.
No need to rub it in.

51
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:02,597
Come on, Sonic!
Catch up! Yeah!

52
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,999
Wait, what's going on?

53
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,835
Why are you guys acting like...

54
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,504
holograms!

55
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:11,973
Which means...

56
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:15,375
I remain the undefeated
speed champion of all time!

57
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,444
Yes!
And the crowd goes wild!

58
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,580
But also, what's going on?

59
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,087
Surprise!

60
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,023
But wait a sec, you guys...
...what is all this?

61
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,491
"Happy Bea Arthur Day"?

62
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,295
Oh, it's
"Happy B-Earth-Day."

63
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,764
Today's the anniversary of
the day you came to Earth, bud.

64
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,733
It's your "Earth Day Birthday."

65
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,635
So the race
was just a distraction,

66
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,370
which I totally didn't fall for,
by the way--

67
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,537
Good try, though--

68
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,640
so you could throw a party
for me?

69
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,909
Today, we honor you, hedgehog.

70
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:51,279
If it wasn't for you, none of us
would be here right now.

71
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,813
The boys are right, bud.

72
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,414
You know, the day you came
to this planet

73
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,217
is the day all our lives
changed forever.

74
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,450
And we became a family.

75
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,723
You guys, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

76
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:06,426
Except... let's party!

77
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,262
- All right!
- Yeah!

78
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:11,799
It's now on
till the break of dawn!
Toga! Toga!

79
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,538
Thanks for the surprise party.
It really means a lot to me.

80
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:19,740
Ah, you deserve it, pal.

81
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,210
No way. Is that...

82
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,780
What? Dude...

83
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,215
Could you just for once
walk at my speed?

84
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:34,555
Whoa.

85
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,357
Sonic!

86
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,993
This is your--
Yep. My old cave.

87
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,563
Oh, man.
I can't believe this is where
you lived all those years.

88
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:46,233
Hey! My state-of-the-art
security system!

89
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:50,004
Still works.

90
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,806
Hey, bud.

91
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,241
What's this?

92
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:00,781
Wow. You know, I drew that
on my first night on Earth.

93
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:03,150
I wanted to remember
where I came from.

94
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:06,821
I still miss her.

95
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:10,591
You think Longclaw
would be proud of me?

96
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,893
I know she would, pal.

97
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:16,063
Because even though you lost her
at such a young age,

98
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:19,767
you didn't let your pain
change who you are...

99
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,669
in here.

100
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:25,272
Yeah. In my lungs.

101
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,509
Or your heart.
Heart, right.

102
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,111
Yeah, makes more sense.
Not lungs, heart.

103
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:31,746
That's the thing
about life, Sonic,

104
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,648
it's all about the choices
we make.

105
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,150
You're gonna
make some good ones and,

106
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,086
knowing you,
you're gonna make some bad ones.

107
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,221
But...

108
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,025
as long as you remember
to listen to your heart,

109
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,794
you're gonna
make the right choice
when it matters the most.

110
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,129
Thanks.

111
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,031
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

112
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:53,768
<i>I'd probably be</i>
<i>a totally different hedgehog.</i>

113
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,680
2024?

114
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:10,551
I've been trapped for 50 years?

115
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,323
Move, move!
Take positions!

116
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,261
Get on the ground now!

117
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,230
We've got you surrounded!

118
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,335
Why won't you leave me alone?

119
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:29,570
Take him down!

120
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,777
I have dishonored
my marshmallow.

121
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:40,581
It's really just a question
of temperature and distance.

122
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,750
It's not a competition.

123
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,453
This is so nice.

124
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,155
Peace.
Quiet.

125
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,623
Finally.

126
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,325
Finally!

127
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:05,339
Hey! We're trying to have
a family moment down here!

128
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,454
What did we do?
Or what did they do?

129
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:21,689
What did you do?

130
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,691
I don't know.
I do a lot of stuff.

131
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,332
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

132
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,367
Aliens.

133
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,269
"Aliens"? Excuse me?

134
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,904
It's not like we're
from different planet--

135
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,240
Oh, yeah, we are.
I guess we are aliens.

136
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,407
Please continue.

137
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:41,610
I'm Director Rockwell.

138
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,043
There is a very
dangerous situation

139
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,346
unfolding right now
in Tokyo.

140
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,717
Commander Walters
is requesting Team Sonic's
immediate assistance.

141
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,453
"Team Sonic"?
Who picked that name?

142
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,722
Love it!
Ten out of ten, no notes.

143
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,091
Tom and Maddie,
put the s'mores on ice

144
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:01,262
because Team Sonic
is off to save the day!

145
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,436
Remember,

146
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,239
make good choices!

147
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:28,422
Good evening and welcome
to Tails Air flight 1012.

148
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,392
We're looking at
an on-time arrival into Tokyo.

149
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,827
Okay, Captain, we got
a rogue alien on the loose.

150
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,829
How do we find him?

151
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,800
Uh, start with
the giant fireball?

152
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:42,469
I love it! Let's start
with the giant fireball.

153
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,775
Finally, some action!

154
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,810
Okay, time to gear up.

155
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:53,682
Titanium handcuffs,
completely indestructible.

156
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,816
I don't need
your silly gizmos, fox.

157
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,885
And you know why?
Because I am...

158
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,853
...one million
percent muscle.

159
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,056
Yes, good.
You've been listening.

160
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,458
We're over the drop zone.

161
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:07,194
All right, here we go.
Showtime!

162
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,498
Now, look, we don't know
if it's Godzilla

163
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:12,667
or Hello Kitty down there,

164
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,268
but as long
as we stick together,

165
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,370
there is nothing
we can't handle.

166
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:18,272
"Team Sonic" on three.

167
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,774
One, two, three.

168
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,309
Team...

169
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:23,645
Sonic!
Knuckles!

170
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:29,416
Talk about low-budget flights.
No food or movies?

171
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,218
We're out of here!

172
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,210
What happened here?

173
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,279
Looks like GUN
got their butts kicked.

174
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,881
Keep your eyes open.
Tails, anything?

175
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,652
Whoa! These energy readings
are off the charts!

176
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,955
Look out!

177
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,493
One... million...
percent.

178
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:28,042
Whoa! Are you guys seeing this?

179
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,844
He looks just like you.
Impossible!

180
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,714
You're a colorful bunch.

181
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:36,150
Um, excuse me.
Why do you look like me?

182
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,818
I don't look like you.

183
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,588
You look like me!
Why do you look like me?

184
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:44,726
Hey, you know what?
I'll ask the questions,
new hedgehog!

185
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,860
Who are you?
Why do you look like me?

186
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,862
This is a waste of time.

187
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,700
Walk away,
before you get hurt.

188
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,535
Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy.

189
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,337
We don't want to fight you.

190
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,239
Actually, Sonic,
I would like to fight.

191
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:00,941
Not now.

192
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:02,876
Why don't you stop throwing cars
at us for a second

193
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,345
and come down here to talk?

194
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,147
You jumped
out of a GUN helicopter.

195
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,483
There's nothing
to talk about.

196
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,519
All right, then. Enough!

197
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:12,821
Knuckles, no!

198
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,856
Let us talk with our fists!

199
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:31,405
Knuckles!

200
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,907
Knuckles!
Knuckles, are you okay?

201
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,442
No, not really. Ow!

202
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,514
Who is this guy?

203
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:40,782
He is much more impressive

204
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,784
than the hedgehog
I fought previously.

205
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,985
Dude,
I'm standing right here.

206
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:48,656
Now, come on!
He can't take us all at once.

207
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,625
Ow!

208
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,301
Okay,
he took us all at once.

209
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:02,403
Weakling.

210
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,842
Don't try to follow me.

211
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,782
Sonic, I know that look.

212
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,784
Going after him
is a bad idea.

213
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,352
When has that ever stopped me?

214
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,024
I got to ask,
one hedgehog to another,

215
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:25,426
who does your highlights?

216
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:37,605
Hey! Dangerously weaving
through traffic is my thing!

217
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,613
Coming through!

218
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:52,019
Why are you running away?
We were just getting started.

219
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,389
The more you talk,

220
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:57,592
the harder
I want to hit you.

221
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,664
Watch out!

222
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,200
Ugh, I'm gonna throw up!

223
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,538
Yeah, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

224
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:14,208
Yah!

225
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:54,949
1.21 gigawatts.

226
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,755
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

227
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:01,689
Sonic!

228
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:02,957
Are you okay?

229
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,025
I'm fine, guys.
And before you ask,

230
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,060
I handcuffed myself
for tactical reasons

231
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,997
that I do not have time
to explain.

232
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,031
You shouldn't have gone off
on your own.

233
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,700
We're supposed to be a team.

234
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,469
Sorry, buddy.
I'm still working
on this teamwork thing.

235
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:16,771
So now what?

236
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:19,273
Well, I'm not jumping
out of any more helicopters

237
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,408
until we get some answers
from GUN.

238
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,443
We need somewhere to regroup.

239
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:26,480
I know just the place.

240
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:38,927
<i>Hai, chiizu.</i>

241
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,260
It's an ambush!

242
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,396
You'll never take us alive,
foul beasts!

243
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,799
Calm down, Knuckles.
This is a Chao Garden.

244
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,235
One of the top ten must-see
spots in all of Tokyo!

245
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,304
It's a perfect place
for us to blend in.

246
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,172
Are you Detective Pikachu?

247
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,641
Yes, he is!

248
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:56,978
He does
look like a Pokémon.

249
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,078
"Pika, pika!"

250
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,048
Commander Walters!

251
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,783
Sonic.

252
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,719
Thank God you're all okay.
I'm sure you have questions.

253
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:07,855
Just a big ticked-off
red and black one.

254
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,289
Who was that guy?

255
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,192
Shadow's story
began a lot like yours, Sonic.

256
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:15,162
But where you found family
and friends on this planet,

257
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,933
Shadow found only pain and loss.

258
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,769
<i>It begins over 50 years ago,</i>

259
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:25,238
<i>with a meteor crash</i>
<i>in a quiet corner of Oklahoma.</i>

260
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:29,309
<i>The meteorite contained</i>
<i>a life-form.</i>

261
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,715
<i>The ultimate life-form.</i>

262
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,086
<i>Shadow's power--</i>
<i>his "chaos energy"--</i>

263
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:41,455
<i>went far beyond</i>
<i>any living creature.</i>

264
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:46,360
<i>The scientist</i>
<i>who discovered him</i>
<i>believed this power</i>

265
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,863
<i>would usher in a new era</i>
<i>for humanity.</i>

266
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:53,601
<i>But Shadow's power</i>
<i>proved too dangerous.</i>

267
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,305
<i>A terrible accident</i>
<i>destroyed the lab,</i>

268
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,407
<i>taking human lives with it.</i>

269
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:05,212
<i>The project leader</i>
<i>was blamed for the incident</i>
<i>and imprisoned.</i>

270
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,848
<i>With the program canceled...</i>

271
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:10,417
<i>...Shadow was a loose end</i>
<i>no one knew how to deal with.</i>

272
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,353
<i>Too dangerous</i>
<i>to be walking free,</i>

273
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,957
<i>too valuable to destroy.</i>

274
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,393
<i>So I had him placed</i>
<i>into stasis...</i>

275
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:24,164
<i>indefinitely.</i>

276
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,770
Wait a second. If Shadow's
been on ice for 50 years,

277
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:31,338
someone had to help him escape.
True.

278
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,206
But there's only a few people
in the world

279
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,475
who even know
of Shadow's existence.

280
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,895
A live show? Yeah!

281
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:04,371
Get down!

282
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,121
Egg drones?

283
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,256
But Robotnik
is supposed to be dead!

284
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:36,303
Konnichi-what?

285
00:20:56,557 --> 00:21:01,328
I'm sorry, we already had
our big motorcycle chase
for the evening.

286
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,801
Commander Walters!

287
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,538
Commander Walters,
are you okay?

288
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,673
Sonic...

289
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,244
...take this.

290
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,646
- What is it?
- A key...

291
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,016
to the most powerful weapon
GUN has ever built.

292
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,019
You're the only one I trust
to keep it safe.

293
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:28,288
Commander Walters...

294
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,766
Alpha team, fan out!

295
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,602
Do we have eyes?

296
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,336
Secure the perimeter!

297
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,608
Medevac is en route.

298
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,313
His launch key is missing.

299
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:02,657
I knew they couldn't be trusted.

300
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,029
Why are we
running from GUN?

301
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,530
Aren't we on the same team?

302
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,098
Until we get
more information,

303
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:13,000
we're not trusting anyone.

304
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:14,902
Follow me.
Get it... off!

305
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,689
Hold it right there,
Tokyo Drift!

306
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:36,356
Who are you?

307
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:41,062
It's the Goat Milker!

308
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:43,631
"It's the Goat Milker!"

309
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,800
Relax.
I'm not here to fight.

310
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:49,203
Then why are you here?
And why did you free Shadow?

311
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:51,038
Are you kidding?

312
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:54,876
The last thing we want
is more super-powered
hedgehogs running around.

313
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:57,444
The doctor had nothing
to do with it.

314
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:00,848
And I can prove it.

315
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:17,865
Please,

316
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,033
join me in the crab.

317
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:23,604
<i>And now back to...</i>
<i>"La Última Pasión."</i>

318
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:25,740
I have fallen in love
with another.

319
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:31,045
But who, Gabriella?
Tell me who!

320
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,016
My twin brother, Pablo?

321
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:37,752
<i>Pablo!</i>

322
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,788
¡Bastardo!

323
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:43,423
Buenos días, ¡hermano!

324
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:44,892
<i>No!</i>

325
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,496
Let that be a lesson
to you, Juan.

326
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,299
Family

327
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,602
is a field
of emotional claymores

328
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:57,138
that leave you abandoned,
betrayed

329
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,642
and weeping
while you eat cake,

330
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:04,078
which creates copious amounts
of adipose tissue,

331
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:07,447
and what some calloused
individuals refer to as...

332
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:10,284
...man boobs.

333
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:11,786
Ha.

334
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:31,672
Doctor,
we have visitors.

335
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,809
Really?

336
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:37,712
I thought I was having
an anthropomorphic nightmare.

337
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:39,447
Where the only person
I could trust in the world

338
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,215
showed up with
all my worst enemies,

339
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,883
while I was in a bathrobe,

340
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:45,453
playing congas
on my big, fat belly!

341
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:46,821
Sorry, sir.

342
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:49,256
I don't believe it.
Eggman's alive?

343
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,659
And he's never
looked worse.

344
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,028
Well, maybe,

345
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:58,065
this is what not giving a damn
what you think
I look like looks like.

346
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:01,836
Sir, right now we have
an even bigger problem.

347
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,270
Oh, come on.

348
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,608
There's an imposter out there
using your technology.

349
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:11,212
Imposter.
That's impossi-- What?

350
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:12,713
No.

351
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:16,884
My sweet mechanized spawn!

352
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:20,755
Whomever this party-pooping
posse is looking for

353
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:23,090
has stolen my persona

354
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:26,961
and the precious babies
from my egg sac.

355
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:28,863
Well...

356
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:33,534
I'll soon egg-xact
my revenge.

357
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,169
You see what I did there?

358
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:38,706
It's time for the dramatic
soap-opera twist,

359
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,943
where this Pablo
reveals his Juan!

360
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:46,981
By cross-referencing
the precise coordinates

361
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:50,151
of each drone's
energy spikes,

362
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,820
I can track my babies

363
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:55,656
to the imposter's
base of operations,

364
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,324
right about...

365
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,325
there!

366
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,027
Sonic, I hate to say it,

367
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:02,296
but I think we're both
after the same person.

368
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,999
Hold on, hold on.
You're not suggesting
we team up

369
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:07,601
with Doctor Ro-Butt-Stink,
are you?

370
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:09,070
Perhaps the fox is right.

371
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:12,339
It could be our only chance
to find this mysterious,

372
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:14,008
more impressive hedgehog.

373
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:17,445
All right, Egghead.
I hate to say it,

374
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:19,246
but it looks like
we're partners.

375
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,283
On one condition.

376
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:26,320
Dude, you have serious issues.

377
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:27,755
Ow!

378
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:32,760
Let's...

379
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,462
do this!

380
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:01,922
Suck it in!

381
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,060
Tinker-tailor?

382
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:07,529
I need room.

383
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:10,164
Think Elvis, circa 1976.

384
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,967
But sir, I don't have
the proper materials.

385
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,269
Found some.

386
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,039
Resourceful.

387
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,282
Hey! This is a restricted area.

388
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,851
Oh, it's okay.
She's the professor's
granddaughter.

389
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,086
He takes her everywhere.

390
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,524
Welcome to the lab, Maria.
I'm Captain Walters.

391
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:10,958
Oh, do you know
where my room is?

392
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:12,760
Yeah, down the hall
and to the right.

393
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,529
Make yourself at home.

394
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:15,796
But, um,

395
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,998
let's lose the skates,
okay, kiddo?

396
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:19,700
Okay.

397
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,041
Look out!

398
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:26,120
Wow.

399
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:28,222
Look at all those stars.

400
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:31,959
They're like diamonds.

401
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,062
My grandfather says

402
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:36,930
it can take hundreds of years

403
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,299
for the light of a star
to reach Earth.

404
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:41,770
And by the time you see it,

405
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,371
the star might not even
exist anymore.

406
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:47,374
Isn't that crazy?

407
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,645
A light shines,

408
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,980
even though the star is gone.

409
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:56,283
Yeah, it does.

410
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,687
I wonder which one
you came from, Shadow.

411
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:00,722
I don't know.

412
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:04,191
I don't know anything
about my home.

413
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:07,094
This is your home, Shadow.

414
00:32:07,662 --> 00:32:08,996
Earth.

415
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:17,171
Maria,

416
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,440
do you think I'm...

417
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:21,609
dangerous?

418
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:24,445
What are you talking about?

419
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:27,247
The way the scientists
look at me,

420
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:28,917
I can tell they're afraid.

421
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:33,187
Like I'm the horrible thing
from that movie we watched.

422
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:35,590
I don't know...

423
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:37,725
what I am.

424
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:44,599
You're my friend.

425
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,603
And you can do or be
anything you want.

426
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,205
Not because of your powers,

427
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:55,142
but because of who you are...
in here.

428
00:32:57,545 --> 00:33:00,147
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

429
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,390
Professor?

430
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:46,794
It's good to see you,
Shadow.

431
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:48,997
I knew you'd come home.

432
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:51,799
I can't get her out of my head.

433
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,568
The pain...

434
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:54,969
It's too much.

435
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:58,706
And that is why
we have to punish them.

436
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:04,579
Okay, I don't like you
and you don't like me.

437
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,814
Let's get this
over with quickly.

438
00:34:06,948 --> 00:34:08,816
Out of my way, dorkupine.

439
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,251
"Dorkupine"?
Really clever.

440
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,694
This door is six-inch-thick
solid steel

441
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:21,428
on a pressurized latch.

442
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:23,932
I'll need a moment to calculate
the molecular density

443
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,767
and invert
the venting mechanics.

444
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,470
I unlocked it.

445
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:33,841
Subtle as always,
fist-for-brains.

446
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:36,611
Easy, Shadow.

447
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:39,346
Those are the guests
I've been expecting.

448
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:42,449
Let's give them
a warm welcome.

449
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,589
Whoa.

450
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:48,723
What is this place?

451
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:51,025
It looks like
a military base,

452
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:53,027
but nobody's been here
for years.

453
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,461
I wonder if it's haunted.

454
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:57,532
Haunted? Nobody said anything
about being haunted.

455
00:34:57,665 --> 00:35:00,635
What's the matter?
You afraid of g-g-g-ghosts?

456
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:02,837
Nothing scares
an Echidna warrior.

457
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:05,740
Uh, yeah. Do you remember
what happened last movie night?

458
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:10,377
Let go, let go, let go!

459
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:13,514
There is no such thing
as a friendly ghost.

460
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:16,350
So which way do we go?

461
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:20,021
I know! We should split up.

462
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:23,791
Everyone with hideous,
brightly-colored fur
take the left and the middle.

463
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:25,392
Stone and I will go right.

464
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:27,327
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

465
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:29,296
Tails, you and Stone go left.

466
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,734
Knuckles, you take the middle.
Eggman, you and me go right.

467
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,569
By all means.

468
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:36,303
We could use some
time together.

469
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:37,905
To work on
your trust issues.

470
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,908
You know what? You're right.
I should be more trusting.

471
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:44,344
I mean, you've only tried
to kill me twice!

472
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,315
Just a dark, creepy hallway.

473
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:50,450
Nothing to be afraid of.

474
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,788
You hear that, ghost?

475
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,355
You don't frighten me!

476
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:02,462
Get... a... grip.

477
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,198
Boo.

478
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:10,270
I'm just gonna
come right out and say this:

479
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:13,007
You're adorable.
Oh, um, thanks.

480
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:16,711
So, what's it like
being Sonic's assistant?

481
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:20,081
You have a daily routine?
Paid time off? Benefits?

482
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:23,584
Oh, I'm not Sonic's assistant.
We're teammates.

483
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:25,953
He's the leader,
Knuckles is the muscle,

484
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:27,522
and I'm the gadget guy.

485
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,157
We all have a role to play.

486
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,858
That's what makes the team
so special!

487
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:33,260
That and the fact
we're best friends.

488
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:34,829
You are?

489
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:37,297
Well, yeah.
Just like you and Eggman, right?

490
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:40,968
Uh... Yeah, eh...

491
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:43,104
Of course! Yes.

492
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:46,373
Me and the doctor,
best of friends.

493
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,177
That's definitely
what we are.

494
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:55,616
Hmm.

495
00:37:14,468 --> 00:37:17,905
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

496
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:21,609
This was more than
just a military base or a lab.

497
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,376
It was a home.

498
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,412
People lived here.

499
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,481
He had a family.

500
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:29,684
Is that what I smell?

501
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:32,887
The stench
of domestic harmony?

502
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,891
You ever wonder what
your life would have been like
if you had a family?

503
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:38,358
Hmm... No!

504
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,494
Maybe you wouldn't have gone
full supervillain.

505
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:43,497
I have no parents,
no aunts, no uncles.

506
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:46,500
And something about my attitude
renders me...

507
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:51,572
undesirable
to all possible genders.

508
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:55,610
My future is a cul-de-sac!

509
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:58,613
The Robotnik name ends...

510
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:01,849
<i>avec moi.</i>

511
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:04,018
Yes, I know French.

512
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,489
Whoa.

513
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:12,627
Is this where you grew up,
Shadow?

514
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,595
No wonder you're so mad.

515
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:17,865
This place could really use
a beanbag chair

516
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,466
and some comic books.

517
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,036
What happened here?

518
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:26,406
I'm tired
of giving you warnings!

519
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:31,378
Where'd you go, hedgehog?

520
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:33,648
I wasn't finished
trauma dumping.

521
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:38,119
My darlings!

522
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:42,590
My eggy weggies!

523

I...

531
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,791
don't believe it.
Don't you?

532
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:18,358
It's impossible.
Is it?

533
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:19,426
It couldn't be.
Couldn't it?

534
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,393
I'm--
Are you?

535
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:21,896
Imposter!

536
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,232
You stole my babies!

537
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:27,500
But they know
who their real daddy is...

538
00:39:27,635 --> 00:39:28,936
drone-napper!

539
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:33,674
Magnificent creations,
my boy.

540
00:39:33,808 --> 00:39:36,476
I borrowed them
to lure you here

541
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,846
and reunite our family.

542
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:42,149
You see, Ivo...

543
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:47,255
I'm your grandfather:

544
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,957
Gerald Robotnik.

545
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:56,764
My... grandfather?

546
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:01,235
But how? And why?

547
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:03,871
And who did what with whom?

548
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:09,176
You hail from an ancestry
of excellence...

549
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,979
tied directly <i>à moi.</i>

550
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:15,049
Yes, I know French.

551
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,086
You do look like me.

552
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:22,023
But fatter. And older.

553
00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:24,892
And there's that funny smell.

554
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:29,530
But the resemblance
is uncanny.

555
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:31,666
It's as if...

556
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:33,868
...we're two characters
in a movie

557
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,671
being played
by the same actor.

558
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:39,373
But I need real proof!
Ivo!

559
00:40:39,507 --> 00:40:40,975
We have very little time.

560
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:44,477
But I could field
a couple of queries.

561
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:47,715
Name the most elegant formula
in mathematics.

562
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:49,350
Euler's Identity.

563
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:51,719
E to the I times pi plus one
equals zilch.

564
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:53,955
European capitals
arranged alphabetically

565
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:55,289
by the fourth letter.

566
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:56,991
Riga, Monaco, Sarajevo, Tirana.

567
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,960
The speed of light
divided by
the speed of sound,

568
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:01,362
divided by
the speed of the bus
in the movie <i>Speed.</i>

569
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,566
17,893.33333...

570
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,270
Rounding up?
17,894 MPH.

571
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:12,006
And, for all the marbles...

572
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,275
Good. I lost mine.

573
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:16,444
A rare lung disease,

574
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:19,880
and the longest word
in the English dictionary.

575
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:21,749
Um...

576
00:41:21,882 --> 00:41:25,353
Pneumonoultramicroscopic-
silicovolcanoconiosis!

577
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,757
Pap-pap!
In the saggy flesh.

578
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,193
But looking pretty good
for a hundred and ten.

579
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:37,231
Oh, Grampy-poo!

580
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:44,372
Where have you been
my entire life?

581
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:48,075
Wait.

582
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:50,378
Where have you been...
my entire life?

583
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:56,751
Locked in
a top-secret prison
for the last 50 years.

584
00:41:56,884 --> 00:42:00,321
Made it kind of hard
to send Christmas cards.

585
00:42:00,454 --> 00:42:01,822
Now...

586
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:05,626
you're probably wondering
why I brought you here.

587
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,061
You didn't bring me here!

588
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,431
I used my unparalleled intellect
to track you down.

589
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:14,969
Per the plan
I concocted with
my unparalleled intellect.

590
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:16,704
You'll see.

591
00:42:16,837 --> 00:42:19,740
I have the answer
to everything.

592
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,943
Come on, kiddo.

593
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:38,527
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

594
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,529
Someone tell me
this is some kind of

595
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:42,763
concussion-induced nightmare.

596
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:44,999
There's two Eggmen now?

597
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:47,134
Double your villains,
double your fun!

598
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:50,337
Two Robotniks
are way worse than one.

599
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:51,472
Chest bump?

600
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:52,706
No.

601
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,609
Stone,
why are you tied up?

602
00:42:55,743 --> 00:42:58,412
Do that on your own time.
You sicken me.

603
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:00,848
You must be
the long-lost grandson.

604
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:03,884
And you must be
another stinking hedgehog.

605
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:06,053
So you're the one
behind all this.

606
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:08,622
The Shadow breakout.
The attack on Walters.

607
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:10,091
That musty
old-man smell.

608
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:11,959
How dare you insult me

609
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:14,061
with your unsolicited
exposition!

610
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:16,263
Shadow, get the key.

611
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:17,398
Where is it?

612
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:19,600
Ha! Good one, Hot Topic.

613
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:21,802
Do you really think
we'd be that stupid

614
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:23,971
to bring the key
right to you?

615
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:25,673
Yep, we're that stupid.

616
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:27,942
GUN took everything from us.

617
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:31,245
And now we are going
to take everything from them.

618
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:32,581
With this.

619
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:36,450
My masterpiece
of malevolence...

620
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:38,986
The Eclipse Cannon.

621
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,189
<i>In exchange</i>
<i>for my freedom,</i>

622
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:44,658
<i>I gave GUN</i>
<i>the most powerful weapon</i>

623
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:47,194
<i>mankind has ever seen,</i>

624
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:50,231
<i>capable of delivering</i>
<i>a precision strike</i>

625
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:51,899
<i>anywhere on Earth.</i>

626
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,401
<i>Our first target:</i>

627
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:56,770
<i>GUN Headquarters.</i>

628
00:43:56,904 --> 00:43:59,006
But firing a weapon
that powerful

629
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,108
could threaten millions
of innocent lives!

630
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:03,444
Yeah, tera-bite me.

631
00:44:03,578 --> 00:44:08,716
This is one of two keys required
to launch the Eclipse Cannon.

632
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:11,318
The other is locked
inside GUN headquarters.

633
00:44:11,452 --> 00:44:13,120
Once we have both,

634
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:16,357
I will take rightful control
of my weapon.

635
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,325
I'm in.

636
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:26,667
Holy crab!

637
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,736
Spacious and crustaceous.

638
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:30,572
Thank you so much

639
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:32,439
for inspiring
this little adventure.

640
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:34,708
It really worked out
for me.

641
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:38,045
And you wonder why
I have trust issues!

642
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,550
Shadow, wait! Don't do this.

643
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:42,983
I know you're hurting,

644
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:45,520
but don't let that change
who you are inside.

645
00:44:45,654 --> 00:44:50,324
I've spent 50 years
reliving what they did to her.

646
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:53,394
This is who I am inside.

647
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:03,437
Uh, nice magic marble.
Real scary.

648
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:08,842
That actually
is real scary!

649
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:12,046
It's a mini black hole!

650
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,915
It's going to suck in
all the matter in this base!

651
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:22,056
Fear not, friends.

652
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:24,491
Even my teeth are muscles!

653
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,534
Sonic, try to reach
one of my rings!

654
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:33,834
Got one.

655
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:36,370
Check this out. Trick shot!

656
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,509
Come on.

657
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:44,144
Come on.

658
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:46,247
Come on.

659
00:45:47,716 --> 00:45:49,483
Come on!

660
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:01,428
Yeah! Yes!

661
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:06,200
Yikes.

662
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,270
Somebody better call
Google Maps.

663
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:17,077
I've spent years
trying to cleanse
the cosmos

664
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:20,948
of that spiny,
blue speed freak.

665
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:23,050
And you did it...

666
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,086
in one afternoon.

667
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,190
There's nothing
we can't destroy
together, my boy.

668
00:46:30,324 --> 00:46:33,427
Charting route to GUN
Headquarters in London, sirs.

669
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,630
ETA four hours.

670
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:36,997
As the crab flies.

671
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:39,867
By all accounts,
we're ahead of schedule.

672
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:42,537
We should take this time

673
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:44,673
to get to know
each other better.

674
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,840
Wow. What?

675
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:48,242
You mean...

676
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:51,812
spend some
qua-qua-quality time?

677
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:56,518
You've waited for this
your whole life.

678
00:46:56,651 --> 00:47:03,357
How would you choose
to spend one perfect day
with your new grand pal?

679
00:47:57,044 --> 00:48:00,280
Ooh!

680
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:40,722
And done!

681
00:48:40,855 --> 00:48:43,457
Masterpiece.
Look at that.
Yay!

682
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:47,127
It's really been great
having time to ourselves.

683
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,831
Right. Absolutely.
I just feel so...

684
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:51,265
relaxed, you know?
Clearheaded.

685
00:48:51,398 --> 00:48:53,868
Mmm, look at all these
new interests we found.

686
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,770
I know, so many hobbies.
So many!

687
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:59,006
After the action and adventure
of the last few years,

688
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,543
well, I could get used to this.
Same.

689
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:09,383
Tom! Maddie!
We need your help on a super--

690
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:12,620
Knuckles, do you mind?
Oh! Excuse me.

691
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:14,087
Tom! Maddie! We need your help

692
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:15,857
on a super-dangerous
top-secret mission!

693
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:17,257
Hmm.

694
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:20,327
Thank God. Yeah, we're in.
Let's go.

695
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:22,630
Really? You're in?
Just like that?

696
00:49:22,764 --> 00:49:25,800
Yes. It was getting so boring
without you guys here.
Yeah. So...

697
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:27,434
No offense.
...boring. No, none taken.

698
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:29,169
I mean, whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up,

699
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:30,538
the answer's yes.
Yes.

700
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:33,875
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

701
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:35,375
Oh! This is...

702
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,077
...Li'l Tom!

703
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:38,813
Isn't he great?

704
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:42,416
I told you
to get rid of that.
It's very creepy.

705
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,918
I told him to get rid of you.

706
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,352
Okay, that's, mmm...

707
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:48,121
crossing a line there.
You are in so much trouble.

708
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:52,760
Okay, this is it.
The belly of the beast.

709
00:49:52,894 --> 00:49:54,863
GUN Headquarters in London.

710
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:58,198
Tom, we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

711
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:00,300
Hey, I told you we'd
get there someday, baby.

712
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:02,202
Okay. So here's the plan.

713
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:04,371
<i>I run in superfast,</i>

714
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:06,708
<i>fly over that water,</i>
<i>no problem,</i>

715
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:08,308
<i>and right when I get to the--</i>

716
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:11,111
What just happened?

717
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:12,514
Congratulations.

718
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,649
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

719
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:18,485
We'll need to shut it down
by planting a USB drive
in their server room

720
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,021
<i>that will give me full control</i>
<i>over it.</i>

721
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,624
That's what we need you two for.

722
00:50:22,757 --> 00:50:24,759
Couple of badass spies,
that's what we are.

723
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:26,293
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

724
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:28,161
<i>Once we</i>
<i>disable the shield,</i>

725
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,397
<i>you'll face the laser hall.</i>

726
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,570
<i>These high-density bad boys</i>
<i>will cut you into tiny pieces.</i>

727
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:39,339
<i>And cut those pieces</i>
<i>into even tinier pieces!</i>

728
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:41,543
Once again...

729
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:43,845
- Can't we just get Tom Cruise to do this?
-  Nope.

730
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:47,916
<i>Because not even he</i>
<i>could break into... the vault.</i>

731
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,383
<i>Why is it empty in there?</i>

732
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:50,852
<i>Because we have no idea</i>

733
00:50:50,985 --> 00:50:52,587
<i>what's on the other side</i>
<i>of that door.</i>

734
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,088
<i>To prevent the vault from ever</i>
<i>being accessed by a ring,</i>

735
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:58,425
<i>all images and schematics have</i>
<i>been wiped from GUN's database.</i>

736
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,828
So for the last leg
of this heist...

737
00:51:01,796 --> 00:51:04,231
...we're going in blind.

738
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,704
Sorry.

739
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:11,471
Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

740
00:51:11,606 --> 00:51:13,908
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

741
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:17,912
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode

742
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,446
to get the key.

743
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,683
No way, Maddie.

744
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:23,785
The Master Emerald
is too powerful
to ever use again.

745
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:26,386
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

746
00:51:26,521 --> 00:51:28,856
In a location
only Knuckles knows.

747
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,925
As guardian
of the Master Emerald,

748
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:34,161
anyone who tries
to take it away
for any reason...

749
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:36,764
will become a sworn enemy.

750
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:38,465
Okay, okay! Sheesh!

751
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,300
No need to get
all growly on me, buddy.

752
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:43,538
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

753
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:45,707
Well, this is the right choice.

754
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,274
Okay.

755
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:49,644
I guess
we're going to...

756
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:07,427
London, baby!

757
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:12,800
GUN Headquarters
is right there.

758
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:17,137
Let me go in, get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

759
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,940
I want revenge.

760
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,340
Patience, Shadow.

761
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,910
Just let us handle this...

762
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:27,147
and I promise
you'll have revenge

763
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,085
on a scale you couldn't
possibly imagine.

764
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:34,221
Come on, Granddaddy-O,
we've got...

765
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:35,623
dirt to do!

766
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:37,592
Suits.

767
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:38,726
Right here, sir.

768
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:41,428
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

769
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:44,364
Keep the crab on a low boil.

770
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:47,735
It's time
for more family bonding.

771
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,708
Come on, Shadow.

772
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:58,245
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

773
00:52:59,814 --> 00:53:01,683
Revenge guac!

774
00:53:09,157 --> 00:53:13,661
Guys, are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

775
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:19,133
Sonic,
we literally just started.

776
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:21,435
Tom, Maddie,
are you in position and ready?

777
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:23,671
We were born ready.
Let's do this.

778
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:25,205
<i>Knuckles, how about you?</i>

779
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:27,441
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

780
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:30,310
Now, where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

781
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:31,813
Actually, Knucks, your job

782
00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:34,649
is to "Break Glass
in Case of Emergency."

783
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:35,950
Understood.

784
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:39,486
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

785
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,556
In case of emergency.

786
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:44,458
<i>I will pulverize it like</i>
<i>the skull of a loathsome rival!</i>

787
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:47,895
Just to be clear,
the "emergency"
is the important part.

788
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:49,530
The glass will beg for mercy

789
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:52,133
under the shadow
of my mighty fist!

790
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:53,835
Guys, remember,
we're a team.

791
00:53:53,968 --> 00:53:55,235
Let's focus.
Please.

792
00:53:55,368 --> 00:53:56,504
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>Let's move on.</i>

793
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:58,506
All right,
everyone knows what to do.

794
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,708
Tom and Maddie,
you guys plant the USB drive.

795
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:03,477
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

796
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:05,412
And Knuckles, you stand by to--

797
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:08,049
Break glass in case
of emergency.

798
00:54:08,182 --> 00:54:09,349
See? He gets it.

799
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:10,985
Then we're all set.

800
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,787
Hologram time.

801
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:15,388
You go first.

802
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,793
Tom, it's me, Rachel!

803
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,795
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

804
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:22,997
Have you met your sister?
Try again.

805
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:24,165
Unless...

806
00:54:24,297 --> 00:54:25,900
you're not
up for this mission.

807
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,435
Yeah, maybe you want
to be back in Green Hills,
baking sourdough.

808
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,303
Thomas Michael Wachowski!
Gah!

809
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:31,773
You brought aliens
to my wedding,

810
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:33,775
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

811
00:54:33,908 --> 00:54:36,077
Your day of reckoning
is at hand!

812
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,211
Yeah, that's perfect.

813
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:39,914
Okay, now for
her better half.

814
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:46,353
Ho-ho, my name is Randall,
and I am too much to handle!

815
00:54:46,486 --> 00:54:47,989
Welcome to the gun show!

816
00:54:48,122 --> 00:54:51,391
Baby, would you describe me
as jacked, juiced,

817
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,694
or shredded?

818
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:55,563
I would describe your head
as swollen.

819
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:57,297
Let's get to work.

820
00:55:00,568 --> 00:55:02,069
Agent Randall Handel.

821
00:55:02,203 --> 00:55:04,939
I'm here to have lunch
with my lovely wife, Rachel.

822
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:06,541
I'm sorry, Agent Handel,

823
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:09,110
this facility's
currently locked down.

824
00:55:09,243 --> 00:55:10,945
Command-level
clearance only.

825
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:13,080
One minute.

826
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:16,017
Tails... we have a problem here.

827
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,287
Wow, they must have
tightened security
after Shadow's escape.

828
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,022
I got this.

829
00:55:22,056 --> 00:55:23,490
You must be new here.

830
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:26,326
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Rachel.

831
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:27,995
Rachel Gonnagetyoufired.

832
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,698
Do you know what GUN
stands for?

833
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:33,366
Well, 'course. Guardian Units--

834
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,170
Getting. Ultra. Nasty.

835
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:38,906
Do you want me...

836
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,975
to get ultra nasty?

837
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,077
Nasty nasty?

838
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:44,645
No, ma'am.
Okay, then.

839
00:55:44,779 --> 00:55:46,514
Then go ahead and take
those little sad fingers

840
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:48,216
and start tippity
type-type-typing!

841
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:51,185
Mm-hmm.
That's right, go on.

842
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,888
Sorry for the inconvenience,
ma'am.

843
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,156
Mm-hmm.

844
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:57,925
That's what I thought!

845
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:03,664
My God,
I love being Rachel!

846
00:56:13,608 --> 00:56:15,977
Did it work?
Oh, yeah.

847
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:18,246
Oh! Ouch!

848
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,749
Director Rockwell seeking
access to the server room.

849
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:23,284
<i>Just one moment, ma'am.</i>

850
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:27,188
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
It's her. It's the real her!

851
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:29,056
The incident in Colorado?
We're still assessing.

852
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,625
What do you mean,
we're still assessing?

853
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:32,860
What do we do?
Quick, change faces!

854
00:56:32,994 --> 00:56:34,095
Okay. Did it work?

855
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:35,997
Who am I? What's going on?

856
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,900
Why are you looking
at me like that?
What am I doing wrong?

857
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:40,835
Ow!

858
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:42,670
Aye-aye, Captain!

859
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:48,809
"Aye-aye, Captain"?
Who are you, Popeye?

860
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:50,978
I panicked! I was panicking!
Jeez!

861
00:56:51,112 --> 00:56:52,479
Get it together!

862
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:57,251
Okay, Tails,
what are we looking for?

863
00:56:57,385 --> 00:57:00,888
<i>The security server is</i>
<i>in the 7th row, 23rd cabinet.</i>

864
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:05,693
Are you guys finished yet?
This is taking forever.

865
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:07,929
Uh-oh.

866
00:57:08,062 --> 00:57:10,331
Has the time come
to break the glass?

867
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:12,133
Or at least break something?

868
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:14,568
All right, hang tight, guys.
Maddie's about
to insert the drive.

869
00:57:15,169 --> 00:57:16,170
Ready?

870
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:17,437
<i>Three...</i>

871
00:57:17,571 --> 00:57:18,906
<i>two...</i>

872
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,473
<i>one...</i>

873
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:23,110
Go.

874
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,281
It didn't work.

875
00:57:27,415 --> 00:57:28,549
Did you put it in
the right way?

876
00:57:28,683 --> 00:57:31,285
Try punching it.
Do not try punching it.

877
00:57:31,419 --> 00:57:32,485
Oh!

878
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,454
Take it out
and blow on it.
Yes!

879
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:36,257
Oh, come on, Tom.

880
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,160
<i>There's absolutely</i>
<i>no scientific evidence</i>
<i>to support--</i>

881
00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:43,496
Never mind. It worked!

882
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:44,732
Little trick
from the '90s.

883
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:47,168
I mean, best decade ever.
Right?

884
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:49,370
I'm shutting down
the outside sensors now.

885
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:51,005
Yes! Uh...

886
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:53,140
Hold on. Is...

887
00:57:53,274 --> 00:57:54,976
there supposed to be
another USB drive here?

888
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:57,511
One with a giant
mustache on it?

889
00:57:57,645 --> 00:58:01,315
Oh, no.
I've got two heat signatures
en route to the vault.

890
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:02,950
Which can only mean...

891
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:12,660
The Robotniks
have entered the chat.

892
00:58:13,427 --> 00:58:14,795
Wait.

893
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:16,063
Poppyseed?

894
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:19,166
Grand-geezer?

895
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,634
<i>¿Dónde está?</i>

896
00:58:20,768 --> 00:58:22,570
I'm right here.

897
00:58:22,703 --> 00:58:24,372
If you weren't family,

898
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:26,374
I could have gut you
like a pheasant.

899
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:29,744
I mean, try to keep up.

900
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:36,350
<i>And now back to</i>
<i>"La Última Pasión."</i>

901
00:58:36,484 --> 00:58:38,019
<i>Última Pasión...</i>

902
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:41,022
can only belong to one.

903
00:58:41,155 --> 00:58:42,189
No.

904
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:46,527
It can only belong...
to Juan!

905
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,196
Gabriella should kill them both.

906
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,699
She's not a prize to be won.

907
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:53,901
"Kill this. Murder that."

908
00:58:54,035 --> 00:58:57,571
You need to lighten up, Shadow.
We're about to rule the world.

909
00:58:57,705 --> 00:58:59,807
When we're done...

910
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,743
there won't be
anything left to rule.

911
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:05,813
That is dark. Even for you.

912
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:08,215
What are you
and the professor up to?

913
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:10,251
Hello! What's this?

914
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:13,054
I knew I saw
an outside signal!

915
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:14,855
<i>Cheerio!</i>

916
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:17,191
<i>I guess someone</i>
<i>forgot to flush.</i>

917
00:59:37,945 --> 00:59:40,848
What now, my cunning cohort?

918
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,616
Just a little teamwork!

919
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,926
Hey...

920
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:53,961
The lasers...

921
00:59:54,795 --> 00:59:57,498
don't seem to be
penetrating my suit.

922
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:02,036
They're conforming
to the shape
of my bodacious bod.

923
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:03,737
Of course.

924
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:07,141
I designed these suits
to create a field

925
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:09,578
of laser-bending
thermal distortion.

926
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,645
Wasn't sure it would work
till now.

927
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:13,347
You're heartless, son.

928
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:15,382
Hmm!
Rotten to the core.

929
01:00:15,517 --> 01:00:17,284
Mm-hmm.
I'm...

930
01:00:17,418 --> 01:00:18,587
so proud.

931
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:21,222
So now we can just dance
right through.

932
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:25,993
That sounds like a challenge.

933
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:14,475
♪ <i>My finger is on the button</i> ♪

934
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:15,976
♪ <i>Push the button</i> ♪

935
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:34,629
The Robotniks are almost
at the vault!

936
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:37,064
We're out of time. I'm going.

937
01:01:37,198 --> 01:01:38,065
No, Sonic!

938
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:39,800
I haven't disabled
the traps yet!

939
01:01:41,636 --> 01:01:43,070
Too late!

940
01:01:43,204 --> 01:01:46,407
Look at me! I'm running
on the wrong side of the road!

941
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,045
Well, I got to take in
the sights.

942
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:53,447
Paul, John, George,
the other one!

943
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:55,349
Loud American coming through!

944
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:56,817
Excuse me. Pardon me.

945
01:01:56,951 --> 01:01:58,520
'Ello, guv'nor!
Which way to Hogwarts?

946
01:01:58,653 --> 01:01:59,987
Hear ye, hear ye!

947
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,489
Sonic the Hedgehog
wants a cuppa tea!

948
01:02:02,624 --> 01:02:04,358
Hold this for me, please.

949
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,827
You're not gonna make it!

950
01:02:06,961 --> 01:02:08,195
I can make it.

951
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,900
You're not gonna make it!

952
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,401
I'm gonna make it.

953
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,338
I'm not gonna make it.

954
01:02:17,471 --> 01:02:20,040
I'm not gonna make it!

955
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:26,380
Made it!
Whoo!

956
01:02:27,682 --> 01:02:29,917
Excuse me. Coming through.
No time for autographs.

957
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,318
Got to go, bye!

958
01:02:38,526 --> 01:02:41,228
Our destiny awaits.

959
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:43,931
Stop right there, Roboscum!

960
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:46,467
Let's do this!
Copy!

961
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,142
Too slow, Eggmen.

962
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:58,713
Now if you don't mind,
I've got to get that key.

963
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:00,114
Whoa!

964
01:03:00,247 --> 01:03:02,249
My feet. Why can't I
use my beautiful feet?

965
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:03,984
- Heh-heh!
- Because...

966
01:03:04,118 --> 01:03:07,388
this vault is armed
with variable gravity.

967
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:09,691
No kidding.

968
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,660
Green goes up...

969
01:03:11,825 --> 01:03:13,927
and red takes you down... hard.

970
01:03:14,061 --> 01:03:15,195
Rockwell, listen to me.

971
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:17,164
The Robotniks are planning to--

972
01:03:17,298 --> 01:03:19,466
Oh, they're planning on stealing
a second key, just like you are?

973
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:21,135
Yes, I'm aware.

974
01:03:22,303 --> 01:03:25,172
I called it
the second Commander Walters
was attacked.

975
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:26,675
So...

976
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:29,243
thank you
for taking the bait

977
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:30,978
and falling
right into my trap.

978
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:33,213
I don't believe this.

979
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:35,049
I know, grandson.

980
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:37,418
A woman in the military!

981
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:40,921
Let's go.

982
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:42,923
Go, positions!

983
01:03:43,057 --> 01:03:44,358
Full perimeter.

984
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,027
Robotnik.

985
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:49,363
Going full spandex, huh?
Who's the fossil?

986
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:53,834
That's my grandfather,
you dough-eating dimbecile.

987
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:57,037
Who are they?
A couple of bleeding hearts,

988
01:03:57,171 --> 01:04:00,040
here to rescue
their emotional-support animals.

989
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:02,009
Enough! It's over.

990
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:05,814
The only way
you're leaving here
is in handcuffs.

991
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:07,481
There is no other way out.

992
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:10,685
You know, there might be
one other way out.

993
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:12,119
And what is that
supposed to mean?

994
01:04:12,252 --> 01:04:14,421
Hey, big guy,
I think it's time to...

995
01:04:15,322 --> 01:04:19,026
Break glass
in case of emergency!

996
01:04:25,899 --> 01:04:28,936
Ha! Nothing can stop
Team Knuckles!

997
01:04:29,069 --> 01:04:30,371
Open fire!

998
01:04:31,138 --> 01:04:33,040
Knuckles,
turn this stuff off!

999
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:34,875
Hurry!
On it.

1000
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:37,177
Uh-oh.

1001
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:47,388
Ha! See how you like it--

1002
01:04:54,796 --> 01:04:56,831
Can you move?
No, not at all.

1003
01:04:56,964 --> 01:04:59,534
Tails, can you?
No, I'm stuck.

1004
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:00,968
We might be here a while.

1005
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:05,906
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1006
01:05:06,674 --> 01:05:08,242
Where's the key?

1007
01:05:13,947 --> 01:05:15,115
Whoa!

1008
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:18,218
What was that?
We might have a problem.

1009
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:21,689
No, no, no, no!

1010
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:44,546
I'm moving.

1011
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:47,080
I'm moving!

1012
01:05:49,983 --> 01:05:52,554
You go get it, grandson!

1013
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:54,154
Hey!

1014
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:56,390
Oh, whoa, whoa...

1015
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,695
No. No, no!

1016
01:06:01,161 --> 01:06:03,163
I'm almost there!

1017
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,634
Whoa!

1018
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:13,440
Sonic!

1019
01:06:26,253 --> 01:06:28,989
That was so not worth it!

1020
01:06:29,757 --> 01:06:31,091
Ooh!

1021
01:06:33,962 --> 01:06:35,763
You okay?
Yeah. You good?

1022
01:06:35,897 --> 01:06:36,698
Sonic!

1023
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:38,465
Hey.

1024
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,002
Sonic, one,
concrete boulder, zero.

1025
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:44,471
Thanks for the save.

1026
01:06:44,606 --> 01:06:46,473
Cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

1027
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:49,309
Secure the room!

1028
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,479
She's got the key.

1029
01:06:55,048 --> 01:06:56,350
I got an idea.

1030
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:06,861
Commander Walters.

1031
01:07:06,995 --> 01:07:08,061
Sir.

1032
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:09,664
You're...
Still alive?

1033
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:13,100
I'll die before I let that key
fall into the wrong hands.

1034
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:15,068
Thanks for keeping it safe.

1035
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:16,804
I'll take it from here.

1036
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:21,441
That's an order,
Director Rockwell.

1037
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:27,715
Now, organize
the reinforcements.

1038
01:07:28,983 --> 01:07:30,284
Yes, sir.

1039
01:07:35,623 --> 01:07:38,026
Guys, guys, I got the key.
I repeat, I got the key.

1040
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:40,093
Now let's get out of here.

1041
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:46,233
Commander Walters.

1042
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:48,368
No, no. No. Wait!

1043
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:03,685
What?

1044
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:06,688
Tom! Everyone's clear!
Come on, let's go!

1045
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:08,723
You. What are you--

1046
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:11,526
Tom!

1047
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,662
Tom. Tom, what happened?

1048
01:08:14,796 --> 01:08:16,196
Speak to me. Come on.

1049
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,465
Come on,
it's gonna be okay.

1050
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,869
Please, please, please get up.
Hey, come on, please wake up.

1051
01:08:22,003 --> 01:08:23,705
Wake up, wake up, come on.

1052
01:08:24,237 --> 01:08:25,773
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

1053
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:28,108
Maria.

1054
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:33,681
What did you do?

1055
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,885
What I had to.

1056
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:42,389
Oh, my God. Tom!

1057
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,095
Help me up, kid.

1058
01:08:49,964 --> 01:08:51,198
Freeze! Don't move!

1059
01:08:51,331 --> 01:08:56,236
Any tricks up your sleeve,
Captain Grandtastic?

1060
01:09:03,044 --> 01:09:05,312
We got what we came for.

1061
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,783
Great job, Shadow.

1062
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:12,252
We have both keys.

1063
01:09:12,386 --> 01:09:15,455
So where's your little
science project?

1064
01:09:16,524 --> 01:09:20,728
It's closer than you think,
my boy.

1065
01:09:22,864 --> 01:09:24,264
Welcome...

1066
01:09:24,398 --> 01:09:27,902
...to my masterpiece!

1067
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:32,406
I must hand it to GUN.

1068
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,110
They built her
to my exact specifications.

1069
01:09:36,243 --> 01:09:37,612
It's...

1070
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,782
remarkable!

1071
01:09:40,915 --> 01:09:42,083
Mm-hmm.

1072
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:45,318
Astounding!
Yes.

1073
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,288
That's my genius grand-genome!

1074
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:52,359
And I have one more surprise.

1075
01:09:54,494 --> 01:09:58,733
It's a new suit!

1076
01:10:08,176 --> 01:10:09,043
Gee.

1077
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:30,765
♪ <i>I'm a chip</i>
<i>Off the old block</i> ♪

1078
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:32,967
♪ <i>I'm a chip</i>
<i>Off the old block</i> ♪

1079
01:10:33,101 --> 01:10:36,170
♪ <i>I'm a chip off</i>
<i>The old block!</i> ♪

1080
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:39,607
What do you want, Stone?
I'm busy.

1081
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:42,744
Doctor, I have a bad feeling
about this.

1082
01:10:42,877 --> 01:10:46,080
I don't think your grandfather's
been completely honest with us.

1083
01:10:46,214 --> 01:10:47,982
It was something Shadow said.

1084
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:49,984
<i>There's more to their plan.</i>

1085
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:54,354
How dare you!

1086
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:57,324
You have been jealous
of my long-lost grand-Pop-Tart

1087
01:10:57,457 --> 01:10:59,594
since the very beginning!

1088
01:10:59,727 --> 01:11:02,429
I no longer require
your obsequious groveling.

1089
01:11:02,563 --> 01:11:04,932
<i>Consider this your notice</i>
<i>of termination.</i>

1090
01:11:05,066 --> 01:11:08,603
Your letter of reference
will be L for Loser.

1091
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:10,605
Of course,
I'll expect you to stay on

1092
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:12,339
until you've been
successfully cloned.

1093
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:16,077
But you and I are done!

1094
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,311
Like a blackened
catfish dinner!

1095
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:22,116
Sir, it's too dangerous and
I'm not there to protect you.

1096
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,350
I already lost you once! I--

1097
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:25,820
Unsubscribe.
Blocked and reported.

1098
01:11:26,754 --> 01:11:28,923
I can't lose you again.

1099
01:11:35,263 --> 01:11:36,931
Do the honors...

1100
01:11:37,497 --> 01:11:38,866
grandson.

1101
01:11:40,802 --> 01:11:42,036
Here we go.

1102
01:13:16,264 --> 01:13:18,065
It'll be okay, Sonic.

1103
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:19,700
It'll be okay?

1104
01:13:19,834 --> 01:13:22,469
Tom is fighting for his life
and you think it'll be okay?

1105
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:25,773
The fox is simply trying
to comfort you.

1106
01:13:25,907 --> 01:13:27,808
Comfort's not
what I need right now.

1107
01:13:27,942 --> 01:13:31,279
I need to stop them.
By any means necessary.

1108
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:32,546
Wait, you don't mean--

1109
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,749
The Master Emerald.

1110
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:38,252
The Emerald must never be
wielded for vengeance.

1111
01:13:38,386 --> 01:13:39,419
Not ever!

1112
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:41,055
We swore a sacred oath.

1113
01:13:41,188 --> 01:13:43,391
Don't talk to me about oaths.
Not now!

1114
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:45,425
But you told Tom
using the Emerald

1115
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:46,928
wasn't the right choice.

1116
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:49,096
Well, now it's the only choice.

1117
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,299
And if neither of you
have the guts to help me,

1118
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,767
then I'll do it alone.

1119
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,969
But I thought
the three of us
were a team.

1120
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,338
I thought that's what
made us special.

1121
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:59,540
I'm not asking you twice,
Knuckles.

1122
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:03,077
Where is the Master Emerald?

1123
01:14:04,645 --> 01:14:07,915
Your heart is being consumed
by anger, hedgehog.

1124
01:14:08,049 --> 01:14:11,085
You are in no condition
to make decisions right now.

1125
01:14:11,218 --> 01:14:14,121
I know you're upset about Tom.
We all are.

1126
01:14:14,255 --> 01:14:16,023
Last chance.

1127
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:18,859
Where... is it?

1128
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:20,928
Don't do this.

1129
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:30,404
Part of our oath
is to trust each other.

1130
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:32,707
And I must abide
by that promise,

1131
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,309
even if you have chosen
to break it.

1132
01:14:35,443 --> 01:14:37,011
But heed this warning:

1133
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:40,648
The Master Emerald is guarded
by a fearsome warrior.

1134
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:43,150
And to seize
this ultimate power,

1135
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:45,219
you will have to go...

1136
01:14:45,353 --> 01:14:47,388
through him.

1137
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:51,692
Okay, Wade...
all comes down to this.

1138
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:53,761
Last few seconds.

1139
01:14:53,894 --> 01:14:55,229
Whipple down the ice.

1140
01:14:55,363 --> 01:14:58,766
He shoots... he scores!

1141
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:02,169
Wade Whipple
is a champion again!

1142
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:11,245
Oh, hey, Sonic. See my goal?
Pretty sick, right?

1143
01:15:11,379 --> 01:15:13,247
I'm here for the Emerald.

1144
01:15:13,381 --> 01:15:14,782
Look, Sonic, I'm sorry.

1145
01:15:14,915 --> 01:15:17,284
I promised to guard this emerald
with my life.

1146
01:15:17,418 --> 01:15:19,286
I will do whatever it takes--

1147
01:15:20,388 --> 01:15:21,689
Well, I tried.

1148
01:15:26,827 --> 01:15:28,029
Sonic!

1149
01:15:31,732 --> 01:15:32,967
Too bright!

1150
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:39,240
<i>This is an urgent</i>
<i>national emergency broadcast.</i>

1151
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:41,942
<i>A spacecraft designed</i>
<i>by the agency GUN</i>

1152
01:15:42,076 --> 01:15:45,246
<i>has been hijacked and launched</i>
<i>out of the River Thames.</i>

1153
01:15:50,618 --> 01:15:54,121
<i>All residents are urged</i>
<i>to seek immediate shelter.</i>

1154
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:18,612
It's time, Shadow.

1155
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:24,185
Professor, is this really
what Maria would have wanted?

1156
01:16:26,555 --> 01:16:30,291
The question isn't
what Maria would have wanted.

1157
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:33,627
It's what do they deserve.

1158
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:36,997
Remember what she meant to us.

1159
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:41,836
Remember what they took from us.

1160
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:53,214
Kids!

1161
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:55,282
We have to go, now!

1162
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:03,023
They want to take
Shadow away from us, Maria!

1163
01:17:11,265 --> 01:17:14,034
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Those are children.

1164
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:16,237
We've got our orders, Walters!
Stand down!

1165
01:17:40,127 --> 01:17:41,295
Huh?

1166
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,031
Maria!

1167
01:18:31,178 --> 01:18:34,181
Excuse me,
Grand Paso Doble.

1168
01:18:34,315 --> 01:18:37,519
What is that thermonuclear
gerbil doing?

1169
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:39,920
Infusing the core...

1170
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:41,656
with chaos energy.

1171
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:44,258
That's my little secret.

1172
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:47,127
The Eclipse Cannon
is about to turn this planet

1173
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:50,064
into a flaming pile
of rubble,

1174
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:55,302
wiping out everything
in a 25,000-mile radius.

1175
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:00,808
Including us.

1176
01:19:04,512 --> 01:19:05,714
What?

1177
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:09,483
We can't annihilate
the Earth!

1178
01:19:09,618 --> 01:19:14,421
Hmm?
By combining our genius,
we can rule humanity.

1179
01:19:14,556 --> 01:19:15,489
Together!

1180
01:19:15,624 --> 01:19:18,693
Humanity is a failed experiment.

1181
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:21,228
If anyone should know that,
it's you.

1182
01:19:22,564 --> 01:19:25,966
All your life, you've been
rejected by this world.

1183
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:28,369
You have nothing down there.

1184
01:19:29,837 --> 01:19:32,106
No one who cares about you.

1185
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:35,376
But I have you now.

1186
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:39,446
We're family.

1187
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:42,082
We have each other.

1188
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,885
Oh, Ivo...

1189
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:48,289
you're no Maria.

1190
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:55,530
The moment I lost her,
my family was gone forever!

1191
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:58,832
The only way
to give Maria's life
meaning

1192
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:01,402
is to destroy the world
that took her from me.

1193
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:04,405
So I'm burning it all down!

1194
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,309
It's done.

1195
01:20:08,442 --> 01:20:10,679
Good work, Shadow.

1196
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:12,479
I'm prepping
the firing sequence.

1197
01:20:12,614 --> 01:20:16,984
The weapon will be fully charged
in ten minutes.

1198
01:20:20,722 --> 01:20:23,023
It's almost finished, Maria.

1199
01:20:23,725 --> 01:20:25,993
You will have justice.

1200
01:20:30,532 --> 01:20:31,999
What is that?

1201
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:35,670
Is GUN launching
missiles at us?

1202
01:20:35,804 --> 01:20:39,073
Impossible.
It's moving too fast.

1203
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:43,877
It's him.

1204
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:56,490
You hurt my family.
This ends now!

1205
01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:58,158
Now you know my anger.

1206
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:01,195
The pain I've felt
for 50 years.

1207
01:21:01,328 --> 01:21:04,766
And you've made
the same choice I did.

1208
01:21:04,898 --> 01:21:06,568
I'm nothing like you!

1209
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:07,769
We'll see.

1210
01:21:15,643 --> 01:21:17,344
Show yourself, coward!

1211
01:21:48,976 --> 01:21:50,712
You were right about one thing.

1212
01:21:52,614 --> 01:21:55,115
This ends now.

1213
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:22,610
What's happening?

1214
01:22:22,744 --> 01:22:24,077
Where are they?

1215
01:22:24,879 --> 01:22:26,079
Up there.
Where?

1216
01:22:26,213 --> 01:22:27,147
Higher.
Hmm?

1217
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:30,150
Left yourself open.

1218
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:32,119
Ivo! What are you doing?

1219
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:34,021
Thwarting your evil plan!

1220
01:22:44,498 --> 01:22:46,701
Not the mustache!
Agreed.

1221
01:22:46,835 --> 01:22:49,604
Let go on three.
One, two, three!

1222
01:22:54,509 --> 01:22:57,712
Oh... a nano-fist.

1223
01:22:57,846 --> 01:23:01,850
I haven't seen that
since I hate-watched
<i>Green Lantern</i> in 2011.

1224
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:03,952
I was saving it for Comic-Con.

1225
01:23:04,084 --> 01:23:06,353
But now there won't
be a Comic-Con!

1226
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:31,880
Why are you alone?
Where are your friends?

1227
01:23:33,548 --> 01:23:36,083
They tried to stop you,
didn't they?

1228
01:23:36,216 --> 01:23:37,819
But you came anyway.

1229
01:23:37,952 --> 01:23:40,287
Your anger was too much.

1230
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,223
What kind of hero
abandons his friends

1231
01:23:43,357 --> 01:23:45,627
to pursue revenge?

1232
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,996
Abandons his family!

1233
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:50,598
Don't you dare talk
about my family.

1234
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:53,535
And here I thought
you cared for them.

1235
01:23:53,668 --> 01:23:57,005
Especially the one...
What's his name?

1236
01:23:57,137 --> 01:23:58,540
Tom?

1237
01:24:24,832 --> 01:24:27,367
Go ahead. Finish it!

1238
01:24:28,903 --> 01:24:31,171
What are you waiting for? Do it!

1239
01:24:31,305 --> 01:24:33,975
I'm right here!

1240
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:37,444
You didn't let your pain
change who you are...

1241
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:39,814
in here.

1242
01:24:48,155 --> 01:24:50,357
This is not who I am.

1243
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:52,392
What are you doing?

1244
01:24:52,527 --> 01:24:55,663
You won. Take your revenge.

1245
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:59,667
There are no winners
with revenge.

1246
01:25:12,914 --> 01:25:14,481
<i>Wow.</i>

1247
01:25:14,616 --> 01:25:16,416
Look at all those stars.

1248
01:25:17,552 --> 01:25:19,486
<i>They're like diamonds.</i>

1249
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:25,192
The last time I sat
beneath stars like this...

1250
01:25:26,961 --> 01:25:28,630
I was with her.

1251
01:25:30,064 --> 01:25:32,700
I've felt this pain for so long.

1252
01:25:34,234 --> 01:25:36,004
It's all I know.

1253
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:38,305
When I lost Longclaw...

1254
01:25:38,438 --> 01:25:40,440
I felt the same way.

1255
01:25:42,043 --> 01:25:44,612
Did your pain eventually
go away?

1256
01:25:44,746 --> 01:25:46,480
No.

1257
01:25:46,614 --> 01:25:48,549
But in time,
I learned there's something

1258
01:25:48,683 --> 01:25:51,151
even more powerful than pain.

1259
01:25:51,284 --> 01:25:53,588
The love we felt for each other.

1260
01:25:54,522 --> 01:25:56,624
That's what you need
to hold on to, Shadow.

1261
01:25:56,758 --> 01:25:58,693
Maria might be gone,

1262
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:01,294
but your love
will always remain.

1263
01:26:15,576 --> 01:26:19,814
"The light shines
even though the star is gone."

1264
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:33,393
This whole mess
is my fault.

1265
01:26:33,528 --> 01:26:36,631
I've been so blinded by rage,
I thought...

1266
01:26:37,165 --> 01:26:39,232
I had no choice.

1267
01:26:42,402 --> 01:26:44,939
You always have a choice.

1268
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:52,479
But making the right one
is never easy.

1269
01:26:52,613 --> 01:26:54,381
One more thing I learned

1270
01:26:54,515 --> 01:26:57,350
is that when you
really screw something up,

1271
01:26:57,484 --> 01:26:59,087
you can't fix it
on your own.

1272
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:15,737
Gotta go fast.

1273
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:18,371
Don't tell me you've
got a catchphrase.

1274
01:27:18,506 --> 01:27:22,242
That's right, new hedgehog.
And everyone loves it.

1275
01:27:37,592 --> 01:27:40,728
I... will... not... try...

1276
01:27:40,862 --> 01:27:44,065
...to stop... my...
elders... from...

1277
01:27:44,198 --> 01:27:46,734
destroying... the... world!

1278
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,407
Playtime is over.

1279
01:28:02,717 --> 01:28:05,119
There's no going back now.

1280
01:28:09,257 --> 01:28:11,759
Set up defense.

1281
01:28:13,493 --> 01:28:14,962
Damn you, autocorrect!

1282
01:28:20,868 --> 01:28:21,903
Mantis!

1283
01:28:23,871 --> 01:28:25,072
Oh!

1284
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:29,677
Whee!

1285
01:28:31,512 --> 01:28:34,447
I'm right here,
arach-nerd.

1286
01:28:44,592 --> 01:28:47,427
That's what I call
mantis-scaping.

1287
01:28:47,562 --> 01:28:50,330
That's elder abuse!

1288
01:28:55,937 --> 01:28:59,339
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

1289
01:28:59,472 --> 01:29:00,775
Shadow...

1290
01:29:00,908 --> 01:29:03,845
I see you've chosen betrayal.

1291
01:29:04,745 --> 01:29:07,715
And you were once
so useful to me.

1292
01:29:23,264 --> 01:29:25,398
Ready to recycle
some tin cans?

1293
01:29:25,533 --> 01:29:27,467
Just try to keep up.

1294
01:29:58,465 --> 01:30:00,001
Please, Grampsy,

1295
01:30:00,134 --> 01:30:01,936
don't do this!

1296
01:30:02,069 --> 01:30:03,905
Sorry, kiddo.

1297
01:30:04,038 --> 01:30:07,440
Bring Your Grandkid to Work Day
is over.

1298
01:30:13,581 --> 01:30:15,415
Any last words?

1299
01:30:15,549 --> 01:30:18,552
Just one thing...

1300
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,389
that I never thought I'd say.

1301
01:30:21,522 --> 01:30:23,124
What is it?

1302
01:30:23,257 --> 01:30:25,860
"I love you"?

1303
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:27,595
No.

1304
01:30:27,728 --> 01:30:29,462
It was something even better.

1305
01:30:29,597 --> 01:30:32,099
But I'm not gonna say it
if that's the way
you're gonna be.

1306
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:34,201
Okay. Bye.

1307
01:30:47,114 --> 01:30:48,783
Grandchildren.

1308
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:52,853
All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

1309
01:30:54,722 --> 01:30:57,792
Who said life was pointless?

1310
01:30:58,392 --> 01:31:01,329
Huh?
Oh, right. You did.

1311
01:31:06,968 --> 01:31:08,602
Victory!

1312
01:31:08,736 --> 01:31:11,238
Say what you want
about my granddad,

1313
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:13,473
he made one
hell of a bug zapper.

1314
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:17,044
We got to stop that laser!

1315
01:31:17,178 --> 01:31:19,814
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

1316
01:31:30,024 --> 01:31:33,394
We're out of time.
The cannon is about to fire!

1317
01:31:33,527 --> 01:31:34,729
Where are you?

1318
01:31:34,862 --> 01:31:37,465
Oh, you know,
just making friends.

1319
01:31:37,598 --> 01:31:39,600
They're all yours.

1320
01:31:48,142 --> 01:31:49,777
Follow me!

1321
01:31:55,616 --> 01:31:58,285
Now, this might hurt a little!

1322
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:14,769
So this was your plan?

1323
01:32:14,902 --> 01:32:16,303
Yeah...

1324
01:32:16,437 --> 01:32:20,274
Would someone mind
shutting down
the giant death ray?

1325
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:24,478
We can't stop the cannon
from firing...

1326
01:32:24,612 --> 01:32:26,680
But we can steer it away
from the Earth.

1327
01:32:26,814 --> 01:32:29,550
Coming around to starboard.
Aye-aye, Doc.

1328
01:32:33,287 --> 01:32:35,322
Here we go.

1329
01:32:36,257 --> 01:32:38,359
It's a little tight.

1330
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:41,595
Definitely not power steering.

1331
01:32:47,068 --> 01:32:50,237
Keep... turning.

1332
01:32:52,706 --> 01:32:54,575
Jump in anytime here, guys!

1333
01:33:00,081 --> 01:33:04,185
Can't... hold... much... longer.

1334
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:22,770
Yes!

1335
01:33:22,903 --> 01:33:25,339
I did it! I did it!

1336
01:33:28,577 --> 01:33:30,344
Oh!
Ooh!

1337
01:33:30,845 --> 01:33:31,946
Look what you did!

1338
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:35,015
Hey, look down there!
Sonic!

1339
01:33:40,855 --> 01:33:43,157
Oh, Knuckles,
please tell me you have a--

1340
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,825
Last one.

1341
01:33:44,959 --> 01:33:46,727
Let's make it count.

1342
01:33:48,963 --> 01:33:51,198
Ready for a little base of ball?

1343
01:33:52,233 --> 01:33:53,701
Deep breath.

1344
01:33:53,834 --> 01:33:56,837
One... two... three!

1345
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:20,595
Really!
What's happening?

1346
01:34:20,728 --> 01:34:23,097
The reactor core is overloading.

1347
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:25,733
It's only a matter of time
before it blows.

1348
01:34:25,866 --> 01:34:27,668
So what does that mean
for Earth?

1349
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:30,304
A radioactive atmosphere.

1350
01:34:30,437 --> 01:34:33,274
Rain that kills the crops
and melts your flesh.

1351
01:34:33,407 --> 01:34:34,609
Other than that...

1352
01:34:34,742 --> 01:34:36,477
We're not done here!

1353
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:38,547
You try to stabilize
the reactor.

1354
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:39,847
Buy me some time.

1355
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:42,249
I'll push the station
away from Earth

1356
01:34:42,383 --> 01:34:43,717
before it explodes.

1357
01:34:43,851 --> 01:34:48,088
This is our last chance
to do the right thing.

1358
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:58,265
<i>Core integrity failing.</i>

1359
01:35:07,408 --> 01:35:09,143
I've got you, Sonic!

1360
01:35:42,176 --> 01:35:45,946
<i>Initializing</i>
<i>reactor core stabilizers.</i>

1361
01:36:04,265 --> 01:36:07,034
This is Doctor Ivo Robotnik,

1362
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:09,970
dedicating my final livestream

1363
01:36:10,104 --> 01:36:13,140
to one very special henchman:

1364
01:36:13,608 --> 01:36:14,908
<i>Agent Stone.</i>

1365
01:36:15,042 --> 01:36:17,211
No, no. Doctor, wait!

1366
01:36:17,344 --> 01:36:20,114
<i>If I can't</i>
<i>rule the world...</i>

1367
01:36:20,881 --> 01:36:22,517
I might as well save it...

1368
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:25,986
for the one and only person
who ever cared about me.

1369
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,055
Don't do this, Doctor, please!

1370
01:36:28,188 --> 01:36:32,126
Stone, you were more
than a sycophant to me.

1371
01:36:34,795 --> 01:36:36,230
You were...

1372
01:36:37,599 --> 01:36:39,233
a syco-friend.

1373
01:36:44,438 --> 01:36:48,309
I'll miss your lattes
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1374
01:36:50,044 --> 01:36:52,179
I love the way you make 'em!

1375
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:39,126
So... I guess there's
only one thing left to say.

1376
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:45,332
It's been a real drag.

1377
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:47,468
Thanks for nothing.

1378
01:38:05,919 --> 01:38:07,287
Sonic, look.

1379
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:19,133
Shadow and Robotnik.

1380
01:38:19,266 --> 01:38:21,669
They sacrificed
themselves...

1381
01:38:21,803 --> 01:38:24,037
to save everyone.

1382
01:38:24,606 --> 01:38:26,641
You always have a choice.

1383
01:38:27,609 --> 01:38:30,411
Guys, I'm really sorry
for running off like that.

1384
01:38:30,545 --> 01:38:32,479
I shouldn't have
left you behind.

1385
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:35,550
The truth is...

1386
01:38:35,683 --> 01:38:38,653
you're the best teammates
a hedgehog could ever ask for.

1387
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:42,089
And the best friends.

1388
01:38:42,222 --> 01:38:44,358
Can you ever forgive me?

1389
01:38:48,429 --> 01:38:50,264
Team Sonic?

1390
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:57,037
How about just "team"?

1391
01:39:05,045 --> 01:39:06,980
Goodbye, Doctor.

1392
01:39:23,163 --> 01:39:25,633
- Big finish.
- Mmm!

1393
01:39:27,034 --> 01:39:29,604
Now that's
what I call teamwork.

1394
01:39:29,737 --> 01:39:31,573
Okay! It's ready!

1395
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:36,210
Knuckles,
how could you?

1396
01:39:36,343 --> 01:39:38,445
Gotta be faster than that!

1397
01:39:39,146 --> 01:39:40,214
Give me a break.

1398
01:39:40,347 --> 01:39:41,816
Still moving a little slow
over here.

1399
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:43,785
Donut Lord!
Yay!

1400
01:39:45,452 --> 01:39:48,388
Okay, Knuckles, that's...
I am having the love.

1401
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:52,493
Aww...
Get in here, Ozzy.

1402
01:39:52,627 --> 01:39:54,629
It's great
to be back together.

1403
01:39:54,762 --> 01:39:56,430
We're stronger than ever.

1404
01:39:56,564 --> 01:39:59,333
And nothing is gonna
stand in our way.

1405
01:40:00,367 --> 01:40:04,471
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

1406
01:40:13,046 --> 01:40:16,283
And way out in front, to the
surprise of absolutely no one,

1407
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:17,785
it's the Blue Blur!

1408
01:40:17,919 --> 01:40:19,721
Often imitated,
never duplicated,

1409
01:40:19,854 --> 01:40:21,021
the one, the only...

1410
01:40:22,089 --> 01:40:23,691
Let's do this!

1411
01:40:23,825 --> 01:40:25,960
Yeah!

1412
01:40:26,093 --> 01:40:29,396
All right, boys,
try and keep up.

1413
01:42:25,513 --> 01:42:29,383
Sonic the Hedgehog
is Family Champion once again!

1414
01:42:29,884 --> 01:42:31,151
Tails?

1415
01:42:31,586 --> 01:42:33,220
Knuckles?

1416
01:42:34,488 --> 01:42:37,692
Okay. Yeah, I overshot
the finish line.

1417
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,637
Okay,
so how do I get back?

1418
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:02,016
Pro tip:

1419
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:03,316
If you're gonna take a shot

1420
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:05,787
at the fastest creature
in the universe...

1421
01:43:08,056 --> 01:43:09,757
you'd better not miss.

1422
01:43:13,393 --> 01:43:16,097
Um... I'm flattered
by the cosplay,

1423
01:43:16,263 --> 01:43:17,765
but you got
a few details wrong.

1424
01:43:17,899 --> 01:43:21,268
I can't blame you, though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

1425
01:43:31,112 --> 01:43:33,346
That's a neat trick.

1426
01:43:45,059 --> 01:43:46,994
What? Who are you?
