1
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,968
We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

2
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,304
To our fathers and mothers.

3
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,224
To our friends.

4
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:32,313
Our fellow men and women,
who set aside their differences

5
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,191
to fight together…

6
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,820
and die together

7
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,448
so that others might live.

8
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,785
Everyone in this world

9
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,456
owes them a debt that can never be repaid.

10
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:56,171
It is our duty and our honor
to keep them alive in memory…

11
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,799
for those who come after us…

12
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,969
and those who come after them…

13
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,223
for as long as men draw breath.

14
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,937
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

15
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,108
And we shall never see their like again.

16
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,998
Have you seen Arya?

17
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,712
You can still smell the burning bodies,
and that's where your head is at.

18
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,965
-I just want to thank her for--
-I'm sure you do.

19
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,176
-Look, It's not about that.
-Of course it's about that, you twat.

20
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,678
Why shouldn't it be?

21
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,972
The dead are dead. You're not.

22
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,028
Gendry.

23
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,199
That's right, isn't it?

24
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,040
Yes, Your Grace.

25
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,293
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

26
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,344
You are aware he took my family's throne
and tried to have me murdered?

27
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,056
I didn't even know he was my father
until after he was dead.

28
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,101
Yes, he's dead.

29
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,353
His brothers are too.

30
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,316
So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

31
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,694
I don't know, Your Grace.

32
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,779
Does anyone?

33
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,542
I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.

34
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,674
I… I can't be. I'm a bastard.

35
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,595
No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End,

36
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,473
the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.

37
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,684
Because that is what I have made you.

38
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,572
To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.

39
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,910
-To Gendry!
-Lord Gendry!

40
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,912
Gendry!

41
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,538
-Gendry!
-Gendry!

42
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,460
Lord Gendry!

43
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,004
Gendry!

44
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,717
That's easy, isn't it?

45
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,932
-A fitting reward for a hero.
-Hold on.

46
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,935
And a Lord of Storm's End
who will be forever loyal to you.

47
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,645
-Come, my Lord.
-See?

48
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,106
You're not the only one who's clever.

49
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,576
I have to go down and get another barrel.

50
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,458
We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

51
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,712
If this isn't the time to drink, when is?

52
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,807
The last time I saw her,

53
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,685
I told her I'd kill her
if I ever saw her again.

54
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,563
-I'm sure you had your reasons.
-I did.

55
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,357
-I do.
-So did you?

56
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,861
Never got the chance.

57
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,238
She did it to herself.

58
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,284
Or her god did it to her.

59
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,204
The Lord of Light.

60
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,250
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

61
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,670
and then he fucks off.

62
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,549
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

63
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,886
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

64
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,013
will leave you any happier than before.

65
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,723
And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

66
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,518
Then you're in luck.

67
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,772
We may have defeated them,

68
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,984
but we still have us to contend with.

69
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,408
Thank you. I feel much better.

70
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,173
More ale!

71
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,885
This is clever.

72
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,889
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

73
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,851
It's the same
as the one Daeron Targaryen built

74
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,479
for his crippled nephew, 120 years ago.

75
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,606
I liked that one.

76
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,400
You know our history better than anyone.

77
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,112
That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.

78
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,448
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

79
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,660
You're the only surviving trueborn son
of Ned Stark.

80
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:11,999
You don't want it.

81
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,752
I don't really want anymore.

82
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,172
I envy you.

83
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,843
You shouldn't envy me.

84
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,347
Mostly, I live in the past.

85
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,813
All of it. Come on.

86
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,607
-No, not in one go.
-Go on. I believe in you.

87
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,403
-We have to celebrate our victory.
-Vomiting is not celebrating.

88
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,779
Yes, it is.

89
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,283
To the Dragon Queen!

90
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,955
To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

91
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,711
Drink!

92
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,725
I'm fine!

93
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,698
Your turn.

94
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,037
You are an only child.

95
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,290
-I told you I was.
-You didn't.

96
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,709
-I did.
-I surmised it.

97
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,252
Drink.

98
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,546
Go again.

99
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,091
-Why does he get to go again?
-Because it's my game.

100
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,678
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

101
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,183
Drink.

102
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:57,355
-The other way around!
-I saw him riding that thing.

103
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,024
-We all did.
-No. No.

104
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,944
I saw him riding that thing.

105
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,905
-That's right, you did.
-I did.

106
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,075
That's why we all agreed to follow him.

107
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,619
That's the kind of man he is.

108
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,041
He's little, but he's strong.

109
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,254
Strong enough to befriend an enemy
and get murdered for it!

110
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,550
Most people get bloody murdered,
they stay that way.

111
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,260
Not this one.

112
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,639
Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

113
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,101
He comes back and keeps fighting.

114
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,021
Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

115
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,982
He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.

116
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,902
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

117
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,863
What kind of person climbs
on a fucking dragon?

118
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,449
A madman or a king!

119
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,675
-Drink.
-Drink.

120
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,635
Drink.

121
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,502
Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

122
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,092
You were married. Before Sansa.

123
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,886
Drink.

124
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,895
-You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale!
-No!

125
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,701
You're a virgin.

126
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,542
That's a statement about the present.

127
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,045
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

128
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,546
have you slept with a man.

129
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,633
Or a woman.

130
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,432
I have to piss.

131
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,561
We did it! We faced those icy fucks.

132
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,857
Looked right into their blue eyes,
and here we are.

133
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,153
Now, which one of you cowards shit
in my pants?

134
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,827
Please pardon me for a moment.

135
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,662
And after all that,

136
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,374
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

137
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,835
Just takes her, like that.

138
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,007
I mean it, Clegane. My heart is broken.

139
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,968
-Don't touch me.
-You can touch me.

140
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,140
-I'm not afraid of wildlings.
-Maybe you should be.

141
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,770
Well, Clegane…

142
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,982
it's time to drown our sorrows.

143
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,151
I'm not done with my drink.

144
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,447
-You saved the day.
-You owe me one.

145
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,159
-Don't forget that.
-For the rest of my days.

146
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,788
-Are you ready now?
-This is my drink.

147
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,890
She could have made you happy,
for a little while.

148
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,145
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

149
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,274
-And what's that?
-That's my fucking business.

150
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,531
Used to be you couldn't look at me.

151
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,159
That was a long time ago.

152
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,037
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

153
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,039
Yes, I've heard.

154
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,458
Heard you were broken in.

155
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,002
Heard you were broken in rough.

156
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,966
And he got what he deserved.
I gave it to him.

157
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,468
How?

158
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,929
Hounds.

159
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,351
You've changed, Little Bird.

160
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,069
None of it would have happened
if you'd left King's Landing with me.

161
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,406
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay…

162
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,658
none of it.

163
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,919
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

164
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,422
I would have stayed
a Little Bird all my life.

165
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,779
-Hey!
-Pour another one.

166
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,585
Don't shoot.

167
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,758
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

168
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,384
You should be celebrating with them.

169
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,595
I am celebrating.

170
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,057
Yeah, I am too.

171
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,939
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.
I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End.

172
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,233
By order of the Queen.

173
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,445
Congratulations.

174
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,535
I don't know how to be lord of anything.
I hardly know how to use a fork.

175
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,955
All I know is that you're beautiful,
and I love you,

176
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,583
and none of it will be worth anything
if you're not with me.

177
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,461
So be with me.

178
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,094
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

179
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,951
You'll be a wonderful lord,

180
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,246
and any lady would be lucky to have you.

181
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,624
But I'm not a lady.

182
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,377
I never have been.

183
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,089
That's not me.

184
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,408
You didn't drink.

185
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,079
-I didn't drink?
-In the game.

186
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,417
-I drank.
-In the game. This is Dornish.

187
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,840
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

188
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,259
Suit yourself.

189
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,771
You keep it warm enough in here.

190
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,403
It's the first thing I learned
when I came to the North.

191
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,071
Keep your fire going.

192
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,908
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

193
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,745
-That's very diligent. Very responsible.
-Piss off.

194
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,663
You know the first thing
I learned in the North?

195
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,208
I hate the fucking North.

196
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,793
It grows on you.

197
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,923
I don't want things growing on me.

198
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,885
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

199
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,304
Has he grown on you?

200
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,682
He was very sad when you left.

201
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,144
You sound quite jealous.

202
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,398
I do, don't I?

203
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,239
It's bloody hot in here.

204
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,625
Oh, move aside.

205
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,423
What are you doing?

206
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,717
Taking your shirt off.

207
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,766
I've never slept with a knight before.

208
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,562
I've never slept with anyone before.

209
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,525
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

210
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,861
I told you--

211
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,836
Are you drunk?

212
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,675
No.

213
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,848
Only a little.

214
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,902
I didn't know Ser Jorah well,

215
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,529
but I know this.

216
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,035
If he could have chosen a way to die,
it would have been protecting you.

217
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,371
He loved me.

218
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,000
And I couldn't love him back.

219
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,962
Not the way he wanted.

220
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,259
Not the way I love you.

221
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,555
Is that all right?

222
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,805
I wish you'd never told me.

223
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,767
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

224
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,062
I try to forget.

225
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,818
Tonight I did for a while,
and then I saw them gathered around you.

226
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,113
I saw the way they looked at you.

227
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,949
I know that look.

228
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,787
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

229
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,998
Never on this side of the sea.

230
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,586
-I told you I don't want it.
-It doesn't matter what you want.

231
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,797
You didn't want to be King in the North.

232
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,384
What happens when they demand you
press your claim, and take what is mine?

233
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,222
I'll refuse.

234
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,809
You are my Queen.
I don't know what else I can say.

235
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:53,440
You can say nothing. To anyone, ever.
Never tell them who you really are.

236
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:57,110
Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly
to secrecy, and tell no one else.

237
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,614
Or it will take on a life of its own
and you won't be able to control it

238
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,032
or what it does to people.

239
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,493
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

240
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,411
no matter what you swear.

241
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,461
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

242
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,681
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

243
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:32,270
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

244
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,980
She won't.

245
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,691
She's not the girl you grew up with.

246
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,194
Not after what she's seen,

247
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,072
not after what they've done to her.

248
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,369
I owe them the truth.

249
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,247
Even if the truth destroys us?

250
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,666
-It won't.
-It will.

251
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,003
I've never begged for anything,

252
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,589
but I'm begging you.

253
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,343
Don't do this. Please.

254
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,518
You are my Queen.

255
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,896
Nothing will change that.

256
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,109
And they are my family.

257
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,946
We can live together.

258
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,078
We can.

259
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,999
I've just told you how.

260
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,328
Half are gone.

261
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,250
The Northmen as well.

262
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,177
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

263
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,223
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.
The balance has grown distressingly even.

264
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,310
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

265
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,228
that we saved them--

266
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,105
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

267
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,236
We will hit her hard.
We will rip her out root and stem.

268
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:51,326
The objective here is to remove Cersei
without destroying King's Landing.

269
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,583
Thankfully, she is losing allies
by the day.

270
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,254
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands in her Queen's name.

271
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,132
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

272
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,595
No matter how many lords turn against her,
as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,

273
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,764
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

274
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,476
We need the capital.

275
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,229
I watched the people of King's Landing

276
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,523
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

277
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,108
and that was before winter began.

278
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,820
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

279
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,323
We'll surround the city.

280
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,660
If the Iron Fleet tries
to ferry in more food,

281
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,245
the dragons will destroy them.

282
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,581
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

283
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,958
we'll defeat them in the field.

284
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,877
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

285
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,380
her reign is over.

286
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,928
All right.

287
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,639
The men we have left are exhausted.

288
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,142
Many of them are wounded.

289
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,395
They'll fight better if they have time
to rest and recuperate.

290
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,022
How long do you suggest?

291
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,402
I can't say for certain,
not without talking to the officers.

292
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:16,578
I came north to fight alongside you
at great cost to my armies and myself.

293
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,041
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate, you want to postpone.

294
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,836
It's not just our people. It's yours.

295
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,840
You want to throw them into a war
they're not ready to fight?

296
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,885
The longer I leave my enemies alone,
the stronger they become.

297
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,516
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

298
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,146
and their allegiance
to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

299
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,487
What you command, we will obey.

300
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,995
So, if all are in agreement…

301
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,250
Jon and Ser Davos will ride down
the Kingsroad with the Northern troops

302
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,961
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

303
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,464
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

304
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,424
and sail from there to Dragonstone

305
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,803
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

306
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,849
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,
as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

307
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,938
We have won the Great War.

308
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,690
Now we will win the Last War.

309
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,905
In all Seven Kingdoms,
men will live without fear and cruelty

310
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,449
under their rightful queen.

311
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,964
We need a word.

312
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,929
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

313
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,890
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

314
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,600
Arya's the one that killed the Night King.

315
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,352
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell--

316
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,687
And we will never forget them.

317
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,022
That doesn't mean
that I want to kneel to someone who--

318
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,692
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

319
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,693
I respect that.

320
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:15,905
You respect it?

321
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,241
We needed her.

322
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,871
We needed her army, her dragons.

323
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,124
You did the right thing.

324
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,753
And we're doing the right thing
telling you we don't trust your queen.

325
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,133
-You don't know her yet.
-I'll never know her.

326
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,217
She's not one of us.

327
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,595
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

328
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,888
you won't make many allies.

329
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,891
That's all right.
I don't need many allies.

330
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,810
-Arya…
-We're family.

331
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,271
The four of us.

332
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,940
The last of the Starks.

333
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,738
I've never been a Stark.

334
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,823
You are.

335
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,076
You're just as much Ned Stark's child
as any of us.

336
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,995
You're my brother.

337
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,831
Not my half-brother or my bastard brother.

338
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,125
My brother.

339
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,176
It's your choice.

340
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,644
I need to tell you something.

341
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:33,024
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

342
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,320
What is it?

343
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,240
You have to swear it, before I tell you.

344
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,411
How can I promise to keep a secret
if I don't even know what it is?

345
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,579
Because we're family.

346
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,127
Swear it.

347
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,463
I swear it.

348
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,511
I swear it.

349
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,561
Tell them.

350
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,449
So she's going to stay here with you?

351
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,122
She's sworn to protect the Stark girls,
so…

352
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,252
Say something snide.

353
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,464
I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy.

354
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,929
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

355
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,268
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

356
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,770
To climbing mountains.

357
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,064
To climbing mountains.

358
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,736
-What's she like down there?
-What?

359
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,655
That's not your concern.

360
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,575
I haven't been with a woman
for years.

361
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,118
-Give me a morsel.
-You're a dog.

362
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,663
-I am the Imp, and I demand to know.
-I knew you were fucking her.

363
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,586
A pair of tall, blond toffs.
Must be like looking in the mirror.

364
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,296
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

365
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,132
Where's your drink?

366
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,135
What are you…
What are you doing up north?

367
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:28,264
-What are you doing with that?
-Oh, this? This is for you.

368
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,769
-For both of you.
-You're supposed to be south.

369
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,605
You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts.

370
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,106
-Do you know that?
-That's a bit rude.

371
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,108
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

372
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:42,111
-and what do I have to show?
-You're a knight, thanks to me.

373
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,072
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

374
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,865
as a blond hair
from your brother's ball sack.

375
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,868
-Power resides where men believe--
-Shut your mouth.

376
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,788
-I'm just trying--
-I've never hit a dwarf before,

377
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,207
but say another word
and I will belt you.

378
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,583
See, I don't believe you'd do that.

379
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,087
You couldn't do it on your best day,
you one-handed fuck.

380
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,797
And your best days are long gone.

381
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,007
You broke my nose!

382
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,717
-I did not break your nose.
-How do you know?

383
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,053
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

384
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,138
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

385
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,435
Your sister offered me Riverrun.
Nice big castle, good lands,

386
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,354
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

387
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,647
And you trust Cersei--

388
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,650
I knew your sister was dead
the second I saw those dragons.

389
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,152
Now, your army may be torn to shit,

390
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,238
but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen
to win.

391
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,365
And it just so happens, I'm a betting man.

392
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,494
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

393
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,334
That's good. Of course, the odds change
if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead.

394
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,379
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

395
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,840
-All of a sudden…
-May I speak?

396
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,050
Why not? Only death will shut you up.

397
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,889
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

398
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,226
If anyone offered me money
to kill you, you'd pay me double.

399
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,145
What's double Riverrun?

400
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,230
Highgarden.

401
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,192
You could be Lord of the Reach.

402
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,279
-Highgarden? Are you mad?
-It's better than being dead.

403
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,489
He's not going to kill us.
He wouldn't be talking to us if--

404
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,119
The way I see it,

405
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,830
I only need
one of the Lannister brothers alive.

406
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,207
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

407
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,628
No? Who were your ancestors,
the ones who made your family rich?

408
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,840
Fancy lads in silk?
They were fucking cutthroats.

409
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,551
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

410
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,179
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

411
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,306
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

412
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,349
Kill a few thousand, they make you king.

413
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,146
And then all your cock-sucking
grandsons can ruin the family

414
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,856
with their cock-sucking ways.

415
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,444
Highgarden.

416
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,447
Give me your word.

417
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,075
You have my word.

418
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,080
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

419
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,209
We ride south in the morning.

420
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,463
We could use an officer
with knowledge of the city's defenses.

421
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,547
Oh, no.

422
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,841
No, my fighting days are done.

423
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,470
But I still got a few killing days left,
you hear me?

424
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,350
I'll come find you when the war is done.
Till then, don't die.

425
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,252
For fuck's sake.

426
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,213
On your own?

427
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,840
Not anymore.

428
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:52,843
I don't like crowds.

429
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,721
Me neither.

430
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,058
Why not? They all love you now.

431
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,768
You're the big hero.

432
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,271
Don't like heroes.

433
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,818
It must have felt good
sticking a knife in that horned fucker.

434
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,654
Felt better than dying.

435
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,076
You're heading to King's Landing?

436
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,204
I have some unfinished business.

437
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,082
Me too.

438
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,424
I don't plan on coming back.

439
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,261
Neither do I.

440
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,640
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

441
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,227
Probably.

442
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,439
My lady.

443
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,820
"My lord" is the standard response.

444
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,658
Why her?

445
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,914
You know she loves your brother.

446
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,458
That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.

447
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,961
You seem determined to dislike her.

448
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,591
A good relationship
between the Iron Throne and the North

449
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,969
has been the core of every peaceful,
prosperous reign we've ever known.

450
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,681
Jon will be Warden of the North,
so a good relationship seems likely.

451
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,561
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

452
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,146
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

453
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,027
Sansa, look at me.

454
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:25,204
With Jon in the capital,
you'll be the true power in the North.

455
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,166
I'd feel much better about the future
if I left here today

456
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,127
believing that you and Daenerys
were allies.

457
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,711
What are you worried about?

458
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,964
Jon's taking our army with him.

459
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,550
-Your queen still has her dragons--
-She's your queen too.

460
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,974
What did I tell you.

461
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,267
You don't have to be her friend.

462
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,477
But why provoke her?

463
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,439
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

464
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,982
-or the North, or--?
-You're afraid of her.

465
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,989
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

466
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,161
I don't want Jon to go down there.

467
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,497
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

468
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:13,169
No, but as your brother once told me,
he's not a Stark.

469
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,301
Are you all right?

470
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,268
Her people love her, you've seen that.

471
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,604
You've seen how they fight for her.

472
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,024
She wants to make the world
a better place.

473
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,819
I believe in her.

474
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,377
Tyrion.

475
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,174
What if there's someone else?

476
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,635
Someone better?

477
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,354
You're not gonna ride the dragon south?

478
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,234
Just a horse.

479
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,488
Rhaegal needs to heal.
He doesn't need me weighing him down.

480
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,866
You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.

481
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,994
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

482
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,539
We've had enough of the south.

483
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,792
The women down here don't like me.

484
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,379
This is the North, you know.

485
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,258
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

486
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,261
It isn't home.

487
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,471
We need room to wander.

488
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,433
I'll take them back through Castle Black
as soon as the winter storms pass.

489
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,602
Back where we belong.

490
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,316
It's where he belongs too.

491
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,152
A dire wolf has no place in the south.

492
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,698
Will you take him with you?

493
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,285
He'll be happier up there.

494
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,912
So would you.

495
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,874
I wish I was going with you.

496
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,214
This is farewell, then.

497
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,092
You never know.

498
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,601
You've got the North in you.

499
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:36,770
The real North.

500
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,681
Yes, well, the nights
have been getting longer

501
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,559
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

502
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,437
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we--

503
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,147
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

504
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,695
If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.

505
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,200
I hope it's a girl.

506
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,096
You're the best friend I ever had.

507
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,933
You too, Sam.

508
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,705
Think of the past 20 years.

509
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,041
The war, the murder, the misery.

510
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,796
All of it because Robert Baratheon
loved someone who didn't love him back.

511
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,467
How many others know?

512
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,929
Including us? Eight.

513
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,973
Then it's not a secret anymore.

514
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:19,600
It's information.

515
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,854
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

516
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,315
-Then what happens?
-She loses the North.

517
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,276
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

518
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,738
No, it's worse than that.
He has the better claim to the throne.

519
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,115
He doesn't want the throne.

520
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,868
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

521
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,498
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

522
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,000
Wildlings, Northmen.

523
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,961
He's a war hero.

524
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,842
He loves our queen.

525
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,513
And she loves him.

526
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,934
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

527
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,603
She's his aunt.

528
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,063
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

529
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,942
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.
Is marrying your aunt common in the North?

530
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,321
You know our queen better than I do.

531
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,906
Do you think she wants
to share the throne?

532
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,827
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

533
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,412
Something she has in common
with every monarch who ever lived.

534
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,666
I worry about her state of mind.

535
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,043
We are advisors to the queen.

536
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,838
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

537
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,931
We still have to take King's Landing.

538
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,351
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

539
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,603
That would solve our problems.

540
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,853
Get to the skiff.

541
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,064
Now!

542
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,276
-Spears!
-They're coming round again!

543
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,412
Go!

544
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,247
Spear!

545
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,729
-Go!
-Clear!

546
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,391
Missandei?

547
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,269
Missandei!

548
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,818
Missandei!

549
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,617
Our message was well-received, then?

550
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,244
Your people have heard
the Usurper is coming.

551
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,333
They are grateful for your protection
within the walls of the Red Keep.

552
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,462
You're certain about the dragon?

553
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:45,509
-I saw it sink beneath the waves.
-That must have been glorious.

554
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,971
The glory is yours, my Queen.

555
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,267
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

556
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,560
the Kraken shall rule the sea…

557
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,981
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

558
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,625
She's coming for you.

559
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,044
Of course she is.

560
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,799
Keep the gates open.

561
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,510
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

562
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,428
thousands of innocent people first.

563
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:38,979
So much for "the Breaker of Chains."

564
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,412
We will storm the city, my Queen.

565
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,415
We will kill your enemies. All of them.

566
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,167
Your Grace.

567
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,630
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

568
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:08,133
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

569
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,805
This is a mistake.

570
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,186
You saw my child fall from the sky.

571
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,022
They took Missandei.

572
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,025
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

573
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:29,196
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

574
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,241
and the Dothraki, tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

575
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:36,203
That is why Cersei
is bringing them into the Red Keep.

576
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,832
These are the people
you came here to protect.

577
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:46,129
I beg you, Your Grace.
Do not destroy the city you came to save.

578
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:50,425
Do not become
what you have always struggled to defeat.

579
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,891
Do you believe we're here for a reason,
Lord Varys?

580
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,773
I'm here to free the world from tyrants.

581
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,651
That is my destiny…

582
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,446
and I will serve it, no matter the cost.

583
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,957
It could be a fortnight
before Jon and the allied armies

584
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,333
make it to King's Landing.

585
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,753
In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender.

586
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,714
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

587
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,761
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

588
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:35,929
we should make the effort.

589
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,224
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

590
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,937
But perhaps, it's good the people see

591
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,190
that Daenerys Stormborn
made every effort to avoid bloodshed,

592
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,776
and Cersei Lannister refused.

593
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,906
They should know whom to blame
when the sky falls down upon them.

594
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,048
I've served tyrants most of my life.

595
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,468
They all talk about destiny.

596
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,015
She's a girl who walked into a fire
with three stones

597
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,017
and walked out with three dragons.

598
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,894
How could she not believe in destiny?

599
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,105
Perhaps, that's the problem.

600
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,734
Her life has convinced her
that she was sent here to save us all.

601
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,319
And how do you know she wasn't?

602
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,865
Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

603
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,582
Perhaps, it's actually a solution.

604
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,169
You know them both.

605
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,671
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

606
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:01,556
He doesn't want the throne.
That's why he bent the knee.

607
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:06,061
Have you considered the best ruler
might be someone who doesn't want to rule?

608
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,480
We're discussing treason.

609
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,816
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

610
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,319
Of course, I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

611
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,449
He's temperate and measured.

612
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:24,120
He's a man, which makes him
more appealing to the Lords of Westeros,

613
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,538
whose support we are going to need.

614
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:27,832
Joffrey was a man.

615
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,126
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

616
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,336
as I'm sure you'd agree.

617
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,797
And he's the heir to the throne.

618
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,841
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

619
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,347
What about my earlier proposal?

620
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,850
They could rule together
as king and queen.

621
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,978
She's too strong for him.

622
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,108
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

623
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,485
He could temper her worst impulses.

624
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,570
As you have?

625
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,909
You're drinking quite a lot.

626
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,998
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

627
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,918
Jon's the one man alive

628
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,088
who might actually be able to keep
the North in the Seven Kingdoms.

629
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,966
How many kings and queens have you served?
Five? Six? I've lost count.

630
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,260
-You've always known my reasons.
-At a certain point,

631
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,054
you choose a person you believe in,
and you fight for that person.

632
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,098
Even if you know it's a mistake?

633
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,351
I believe in our queen.

634
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,522
She'll make the right choice.

635
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,735
With the help of her loyal advisors.

636
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,616
You know where my loyalty stands.

637
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,704
-You know I will never betray the realm.
-What is the realm?

638
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,248
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

639
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,417
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

640
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,421
Millions of people, many of whom will die
if the wrong person sits on that throne.

641
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,133
We don't know their names,
but they're just as real as you and I.

642
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,301
They deserve to live.

643
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,511
They deserve food for their children.

644
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:10,852
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

645
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,482
So what happens to her?

646
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,325
Please.

647
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,786
Don't.

648
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,335
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

649
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,214
Each of us has a choice to make.

650
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,967
I pray we choose wisely.

651
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,530
-All right, I'll put another one on it.
-He's headed down to the cellar.

652
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:06,282
-I'll need a cart over here.
-That's it, thanks.

653
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,117
Thank you.

654
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,296
…as are the rest of her advisors.

655
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,092
What happened?

656
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,059
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

657
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,480
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

658
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:38,731
Missandei captured.

659
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,571
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

660
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,240
Seems like I won't get the chance.

661
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,809
They're going to destroy that city.

662
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:59,812
You know they will.

663
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,315
Have you ever run away from a fight?

664
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,944
You're not like your sister. You're not.

665
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:08,905
You're better than she is.

666
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,326
You're a good man and you can't save her.
You don't need to die with her.

667
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,244
Stay here.

668
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,665
Stay with me.

669
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,334
Please.

670
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,212
Stay.

671
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,512
You think I'm a good man?

672
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:43,564
I pushed a boy out a tower window,
crippled him for life. For Cersei.

673
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:52,156
I strangled my cousin with my own hands
just to get back to Cersei.

674
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,036
I would have murdered

675
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,456
every man, woman and child
in Riverrun

676
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,583
for Cersei.

677
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,677
She's hateful.

678
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:16,264
And so am I.

679
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,336
My lord.

680
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:58,676
Queen Daenerys demands
Cersei's unconditional surrender

681
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,304
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

682
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:07,518
Queen Cersei demands
Daenerys' unconditional surrender.

683
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:11,272
If she refuses, Missandei of Naath
will die here and now.

684
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:14,400
Qyburn…

685
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,403
you're a rational man.

686
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,197
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

687
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,116
We have a chance here,

688
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,329
perhaps, our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

689
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:27,997
Yes.

690
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:30,750
Help me.

691
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,045
I don't want to see this city burn.

692
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,257
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

693
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,970
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

694
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,600
I… I don't want to hear it.

695
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,061
Help me save this city.

696
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,482
My Lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

697
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:55,983
Your Queen.

698
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,694
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

699
01:09:58,778 --> 01:09:59,820
You are her subject.

700
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,614
Her reign is over.

701
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,659
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

702
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,078
We understand nothing of the sort.

703
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,998
Your Queen's last dragon is vulnerable.

704
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,751
Your armies are battle-weary and depleted,

705
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:17,546
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan--

706
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:37,066
Ready!

707
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:38,693
Nock!

708
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:42,697
Draw!

709
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,766
I know you don't care about your people.

710
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,019
Why should you?

711
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,982
They hate you and you hate them.

712
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:07,990
But you're not a monster.

713
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:11,952
I know this.

714
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,123
I know this because I've seen it.

715
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,880
You've always loved your children.

716
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:26,592
More than yourself,

717
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,969
more than Jaime…

718
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,224
more than anything.

719
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,603
I beg you.

720
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:43,109
If not for yourself, then for your child.

721
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,614
Your reign is over,

722
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,284
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

723
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,165
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

724
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,425
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

725
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,160
Dracarys.
