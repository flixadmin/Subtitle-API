<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,440
- I plan on asking Nora to marry me.
- Yes.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,240
You don't understand
how dangerous that Loom is, John-o.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,320
Come on, Charlie.
We use the Loom to help Astra,

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
and then I will help you
destroy it forever. Deal?

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,040
Someone's trashing
Rebecca Silver online.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
Cute. You have a troll.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,840
- This your kid?
- She's your kid, too.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,320
Nora belongs in the real world...

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,440
I need you to support her.

11
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,000
And she can't do it
on that ship of yours.

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,360
Do the right thing, son.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Morning, babe.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Hey.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,440
You okay?

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
Actually, I was thinking
about your dad.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,000
That's romantic.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,600
Thinking about something
he said to me.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,640
When I committed my life to you,

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,040
I meant it.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
So I've been thinking...

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,600
maybe our life together
isn't on this ship.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,000
Maybe it's time for us
to move on, and move out.

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Together.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,800
Oh, hey.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,680
Listen, I wanna build a life
with you wherever we are.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,040
I know, but...

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,480
you can't really do your job
on a Timeship.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,080
What about the Legends?

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,520
They've become my family.

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,320
But we can't begin our life together

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,480
when I literally have
one foot in the past.

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,360
So I think I'll do one last mission
with the team.

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Say goodbye.

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
Are we doing this?

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Yeah.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,800
Yeah, but maybe
after we brush our teeth?

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Okay.

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,600
Come on! Is she still in there?

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,760
Zari, there's a line.

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm doing my hair.

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,360
You can't stop
the glam routine mid-process.

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,400
Come on, we talked about this!

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Let me guess. Zari?

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,640
Hey, what happened
to the sign-up sheet I made?

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh, Mick burned it in frustration

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,400
after Zari's last Korean
Sheet Mask day.

50
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,840
Well, I guess now is as good a time
as any to tell you two that...

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,280
Nora and I have some big news.

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,880
We're talking big news?
Because, guys, I got a whopper.

53
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,400
I told John we'll help him
find the Loom of Fate.

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,720
Nuh-uh. You know the rules.

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,960
No MacGuffin talk until after
I've finished my coffee.

56
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,240
Yeah, and besides, you guys were

57
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,200
- about to make a big announcement?
- Yes.

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,440
Is it time for morning announcements?

59
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,320
'Cause I need you all to know,
I have to go so badly.

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,920
If my sister ever leaves
the bathroom!

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
- B!
- Come on.

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,600
Hey, bro, let's not pretend like

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
you don't take this long
with your hair.

64
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Get in line.

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,640
Bathrooms are also for other things.

66
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,520
And in other announcements...

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,760
She still in there?

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
I would be too
if I had all that damn hair.

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,840
Okay, well, this is the perfect time,
now that we're all here,

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,960
to let you know that Nora and I...

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
You're moving out.

72
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,920
- How'd you know that?
- Well, you got married.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,720
Next logical step in a relationship.

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,960
And by the way,

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,920
I heard you two going at it
like jackrabbits last night.

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,600
- At least someone's getting it.
- Oh, my God.

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,440
Look, after one final mission...

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,440
Nora and I will be leaving.

79
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
- I'm gonna miss you, man.
- Wait. For real?

80
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,840
- Seriously?
- Congrats.

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,640
I mean, we always knew
this day would come,

82
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,680
but I never thought it
would be so soon.

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,000
How are you gonna tell Nate?

84
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,280
- Tell Nate what?
- What?

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
The wait for the bathroom
is upwards of 30 minutes.

86
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,720
- Can you believe it?
- Hey, take it easy.

87
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,160
At least I get to wait in line
with the happy new couple.

88
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,720
Nora, welcome to your
new morning routine.

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,880
Uptown!

90
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,520
- Thank God.
- Good morning. Good morning.

91
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,800
Damn, she looks good.

92
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Glam complete.

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,800
You guys could really
work on your hygiene.

94
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
It's 7:15.

95
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,080
Mick! There you are.

96
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,840
Mona.

97
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,280
Consent to hug you?

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,920
I'll take that as a no.

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,800
So what's new?

100
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,320
{\an5}Any torrid affairs, flourishing
romances, lovers left behind?

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,680
{\an5}Rebecca Silver could always
use fresh inspiration.

102
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
No.

103
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,440
{\an5}Anyway, had to be here
for Nora's first book club

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,840
as a married woman.

105
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,680
{\an5}And speaking of books,
I could use your advice.

106
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,080
Rebecca Silver has been
besieged by a troll.

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
{\an5}Forget about her.
I mean "him." Whoever.

108
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,560
{\an5}Well, I tried that,
and it didn't stop.

109
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,000
I was thinking of reaching out.

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Don't. It's just gonna
make you feel worse.

111
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,560
Well, I think it's a cry for help.

112
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,520
{\an5}Maybe someone just needs
to show them love.

113
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
It's got nothing to do with love!

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,880
{\an5}Hey, I was packing up my stuff
in the lab,

115
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,560
and I noticed
that Marie Antoinette is gone,

116
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,240
and the jars of Rasputin are empty.

117
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,400
{\an5}Astra must have recalled
their souls to hell.

118
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,720
{\an5}Damien said something
about "eternal torture."

119
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,960
So, packing, huh?

120
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
You talk to Nate yet?

121
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,800
{\an5}When I saw his face back there,
I just couldn't.

122
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,480
He was so excited
about us living together.

123
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,680
{\an5}I just have to wait
for the perfect moment, you know?

124
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,880
Look, I say just get it over with.

125
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,520
{\an5}And then you guys can enjoy
your last "hoorah" together.

126
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,920
Yeah. Saying goodbye to Nate,
it's my biggest mission yet.

127
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,080
{\an5}I did go to the moon once,
so second biggest.

128
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,920
The Loom of Fate.

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,720
Eons ago, I tossed it
through space and time

130
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,560
because it was too dangerous.

131
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,920
But now, for all my sins,

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,360
we're gonna piece it
back together again.

133
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,760
And finally put an end
to our Encore problem.

134
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,560
{\an5}By rewriting Astra's life
and setting her on the right path.

135
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,840
Yeah, speaking of life changes...

136
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,040
{\an5}Must be a life-changing experience
for you, Charlie,

137
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,240
to know that the Loom
is back on our Earth.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
- Charlie?
- Yeah, it is.

139
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,960
{\an5}But there's only one piece
whose spot I'm sure of.

140
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,880
{\an5}I gave it to a close mate
of mine for safekeeping.

141
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,560
{\an5}All right, so we'll go back
to right after you dropped it off.

142
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
That's our move.

143
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,960
And speaking of moves...

144
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,240
Let's get a move on it.

145
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,720
Where are we headed, Charlie?

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,280
{\an5}Well, the last place I left it
was in London, 1594.

147
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,480
Gideon, set a course.

148
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
<i>Affirmative, Captain.</i>

149
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,080
<i>And speaking of setting
a new course...</i>

150
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,560
Of course, she means...

151
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,440
{\an5}Sara, please give us one of those
terrific period-specific send-offs.

152
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Fine.

153
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,360
{\an5}Enjoy the jolly old London,
you blokes!

154
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,280
That was, that was bad.

155
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,760
And, frankly, offensive.

156
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,720
{\an5}Oh, it warms my cockles to know
that Londoners haven't changed a bit.

157
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Let's find this bloody Loom piece,
shall we?

158
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Well, I've disguised
the pieces as rings.

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
And this one,
I gave to a close mate of mine.

160
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,360
And if I know him, he'll be here.

161
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,000
Wasn't a day
he didn't stop by for a pint.

162
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
Why stop at one pint?

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,640
Well, found our guy.

164
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Will the Quill.

165
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,840
{\an5}You didn't tell me you were friends
with the real William Shakespeare.

166
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,960
I didn't wanna name-drop.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,880
Pardon the intrusion, squire.

168
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,160
{\an5}We have the knowledge
that you came into possession

169
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,240
of a particular ring
some several days past.

170
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,440
{\an5}I know not of what you speak,
good constables.

171
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
And why should anyone hand me a ring?

172
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
Do I appear as a jeweler
to thine eyes?

173
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,040
It's a pity!

174
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,760
Because that ring
was stolen from the...

175
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,760
- Duke...
- And, and he wants it back!

176
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
And if it were to be discovered

177
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,520
that someone had lied
about its whereabouts...

178
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,960
let's just say, heads would roll.

179
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,600
Yes! Yes, the ring.

180
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,920
The ring, now, I remember it well.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
Would that I could yield it for you,

182
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
{\an5}but I just sold that very ring
of which you speak.

183
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
What? You sold it already,
you lousy git?

184
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
It was by necessity.

185
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,280
See, a stubborn case
of writer's block

186
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,320
{\an5}is preventing me from finding
the ending to my new play,

187
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,720
Romeo and Juliet.

188
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,680
Sounds like an instant classic.

189
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,200
{\an5}My producer, Philip Henslowe,
has threatened to remove me of hands

190
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
by way of sword if I can't finish.

191
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,680
Thus, I gave him the ring
in exchange for more time.

192
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,960
If I can't bring my story to a close,
my career is over.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,760
So much for quick and easy.

194
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,080
Discussing Romeo and Juliet
in Elizabethan England.

195
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,280
Ava, you needed me?

196
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
Sorry, is this an intervention?

197
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,720
No, no, no, no, no.

198
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,400
So, since you're a member
of the team,

199
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,120
we wanted to invite you to book club!

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
That is very sweet, but I actually
have a lot on my plate right now,

201
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
so I don't really have time
to talk about books.

202
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,160
The thing about book club is,
we don't really talk about books.

203
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,920
Because book club is magic.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,720
What she means is,
book club is a place

205
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,240
where you can hang out with your
friends and talk about your problems.

206
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,480
- And eat tiny crackers!
- And drink.

207
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,400
Well, according to the ironmonger
at the bar, for 20 shillings,

208
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
I can get a bottle
of wine and a strumpet.

209
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,040
Also, Henslowe and his goons
just arrived,

210
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
and they're right over there.

211
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,760
Yeah, I can see the ring on his hand.

212
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,240
I doubt he's gonna give it up
so easily.

213
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,360
That's simple.

214
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,480
You distract the goons,

215
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,520
and I'll punch the producer
in the face.

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,040
Anyone got 20 shillings?

217
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
This mission has to be epic. Okay?

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,400
By which I mean, extremely well
and elaborately coordinated.

219
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Ray's right.

220
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,840
And I have the perfect plan.

221
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,120
<i>We have the element
of surprise on our side,</i>

222
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,280
<i>so I say, aerial attack.</i>

223
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,560
<i>I'll rappel down
while he's totally distracted.</i>

224
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,080
<i>Love it.
And then I'll rappel next to Nate.</i>

225
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,320
And then we'll high-five mid-air,
and it will be epic.

226
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
And then...

227
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,160
Wait. Ray, are you crying?

228
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,520
It's just that I love this plan.

229
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
No. Yeah, man, I get it.

230
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,360
I'm a little choked up.
It's a great plan.

231
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,080
And then we'll land behind
Henslowe to his total surprise.

232
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,040
You'll subdue him,
and I'll grab the ring.

233
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Got it.

234
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,760
Then Behrad will air-blast Henslowe's
thugs with a killer gust of wind.

235
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,600
Dude, I don't dance like that.

236
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,040
And then Constantine will emerge
from the shadows, per uje.

237
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,640
Spout some nonsense and cast a spell
on any troublemakers

238
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,320
to make them think
that they're animals.

239
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
And then we go to Star City.

240
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,960
- We pick up Wild Dog and we...
- Oi.

241
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,080
Story time's over. I got it.

242
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,480
How the hell did you do that?

243
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,720
What, I just nicked it off his hand
while you lot were prattling on.

244
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
Does that mean the mission is over?

245
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,200
Which is why we should get moving,
find that next Loom piece, yeah?

246
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,560
And it's time for you to go, Haircut.

247
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Ray, where are you going?

248
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,160
On, on my honeymoon.

249
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,960
Nora and I are going
to Bermuda, Bahamas.

250
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Shut up!

251
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,720
You're doing
the whole "Kokomo" package?

252
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,040
Bro, you're gonna be gone for weeks.

253
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,480
I didn't even throw you
a proper bachelor party.

254
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,640
The mission isn't officially over

255
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,080
until we bring the ring back
to the ship, right?

256
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,400
Which is where
we should be going right now.

257
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,800
- Come on, let's go.
- Ray! You're not going anywhere.

258
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,840
Grab your doublet and your ruff,

259
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,080
because this bachelor party is gonna
be an Elizabethan extravaganza!

260
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,360
You know, the other thing
about book club is,

261
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,920
it can help you figure out what your
true path is supposed to be.

262
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,400
Oh, so this is a cult.

263
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
No, no, no.

264
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,240
We don't, we don't use certain
"C" words. "Cult," "clone."

265
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,920
I would know
because book club helped me

266
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,120
move forward after my time
in a real cult.

267
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
Look, I get your reservations.

268
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,000
The last "club" I joined programmed
me to be an assassin.

269
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,400
But book club,
it's helping me be a real person.

270
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,600
And I'd killed a federal agent.

271
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,440
I meant to lead with, I'm a Kaupe.

272
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,800
It's like a Hawaiian Werewolf.

273
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,400
Book club helped me cope with that.

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,040
That's also a lot to... okay.

275
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,520
So what do you think, Zari?

276
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,800
Can book club help you?

277
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,720
You know what? Enough about me.

278
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,560
This is Nora's last book club.

279
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,520
Shouldn't we be throwing her
a belated bachelorette bash?

280
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,280
- Yes!
- That's what I'm saying, right?

281
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,280
<i>Captain, I have
an incoming transmission.</i>

282
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
- The boys.
- Let's get a fireman.

283
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
What?

284
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,600
<i>Hey, Sara. Sorry that the mission
is taking so long.</i>

285
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,280
It's just that a dog took the ring,
and it turned out to be the...

286
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,680
You know, the Queen's dog.

287
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,040
But we got it covered. We're good.

288
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,760
Well, great then.

289
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,040
Keep us posted, and be safe.

290
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Copy that.

291
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,000
Fill them up! She bought it.

292
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
All right, the boys
are gonna be a while.

293
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,600
So pop that champagne
and fill her up!

294
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,240
I noticed John Constantine
is walking topside.

295
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,440
Plans changed.

296
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,280
I needed leverage.

297
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
John is working for me now.

298
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,680
He promised me something.

299
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,920
What exactly is John Constantine
doing for you, Astra?

300
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,480
He said something
about some powerful artifact.

301
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,320
Whatever it is,
that can bring my mom back.

302
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
I'd have a family again.

303
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
So...

304
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,720
John makes this grand promise
to bring your family back,

305
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,360
and you quickly forget

306
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,000
that I'm the one who found you
roaming the streets as a child.

307
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm the one who pulled you
from the gutter.

308
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,240
- I raised you...
- No! No, I haven't forgotten.

309
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
Then did it occur to you,
if John brings your mother back,

310
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,840
I will no longer be in your life.

311
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
You know I don't want that.

312
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,960
You are my family.

313
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,480
If there's a way to discover
what he's after,

314
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
maybe you could get it for yourself.

315
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,440
I know a way we can find out.

316
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,160
This is an exspiravit ritual.

317
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,280
It will allow you to see
the other side.

318
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,040
You'll be among those on Earth,
able to spy on John like a ghost.

319
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,000
You sure you're ready?

320
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Fill it up.

321
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,760
Go on, Ray.

322
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,200
Say a few words.

323
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,720
- Speech! Speech!
- Speech! Speech!

324
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,480
I just wanna say thank you
for this bachelor party.

325
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,240
You're the best friend a guy
could have.

326
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,040
No, no.

327
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,280
- Because you are!
- You are!

328
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,560
Is there anything else
you'd like to say, Ray?

329
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,160
Anyone have any big life changes
that they wanna reveal?

330
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,080
I got a kid.

331
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,360
You what?

332
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,200
I've been trying to ignore her,
but I...

333
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,800
can't stop thinking about her.

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,240
It's a good thing, Mick.

335
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
It's called love.

336
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,560
Let's keep this share-fest going.

337
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,160
All right, who's next?

338
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,200
Hey, we're a regular old,
Fellowship of the Ring.

339
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,840
Here's to getting to the first piece
of the Loom of Destiny...

340
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,040
Yeah, the Spear of Fate.

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
Do you remember the totems?

342
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,280
The totems.

343
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,880
- I met Elvis.
- I mean, it's the "Loom of Fate."

344
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,520
Once we piece it all together,
we rewrite Astra's life

345
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
and I'm telling you,
all this is gonna be worth it.

346
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Who's there?

347
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,920
Charge thee, speak!

348
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,360
Oi!

349
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,760
Watch it, you pigeon-livered worm!

350
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Piss off.

351
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
You want some?

352
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,800
Hey! Leave him alone.

353
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,840
What the devil?

354
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,520
Yes, B! That was it!

355
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,720
Speak to me!

356
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,040
What plane of hell did you surface?

357
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,320
Well, whoever you are,

358
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,360
I'm afraid I must do my duty
and send you back.

359
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Fuge.

360
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,400
Astra!

361
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Astra?

362
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,360
Astra.

363
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Oh, no.

364
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,680
Yeah, buddy.

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,840
Time for the Atometh
to saveth the dayeth.

366
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Deactivate suit.

367
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,120
Deactivate suit!

368
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,400
Sorry.

369
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Watch out!

370
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,280
Code X-94.

371
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
X-94!

372
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,280
<i>Dr. Palmer voice authenticated.</i>

373
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Party's over.

374
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,520
Yeah, Jock-o's right about that one.

375
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
Zounds!

376
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,120
Yeah, we'd better mind-wipe
that dude.

377
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I got it.

378
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,680
Wait, no!
It's pointing the wrong way.

379
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
I got it.

380
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,040
Well, another Legends' mission
perfect.

381
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,040
Let's head back to the ship.

382
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Sorry.

383
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,360
Hey!

384
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,800
Turn off the music!

385
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,280
Look at this.

386
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,520
Take a look at that. What is that?

387
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,160
Did something go wrong
with the mission?

388
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,160
- Is that Mick?
- What's <i>"Romeo v. Juliet"?</i>

389
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,120
Shakespeare is writing
superhero plays?

390
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,520
Oh, that's gonna be a problem.

391
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,920
I cannot believe you guys!

392
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,280
I put you in charge of the mission,
and you lied to me.

393
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,560
You, you lied to me!

394
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,960
So, why? So why, you could just...

395
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,880
You could go party?

396
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
That's what we should have done.

397
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,120
We should have waited

398
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,760
for Ray and Nora to come back
from their honeymoon

399
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,720
and throw one big party.

400
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,760
- My bad, buddy.
- Yeah, and guess what?

401
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,040
We're well on our way
to assembling the Loom.

402
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,920
But you're right, Sara.
I really should have insisted

403
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,840
that we come back to the ship sooner.

404
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,680
- Yeah.
- "Tybalt draws his sword

405
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,720
on Mercutio,
but Mercutio turns to steel!"

406
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,520
- What?
- Well, thanks to you guys

407
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,440
and your stupid party,
this mission is not over.

408
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,080
"With another swing,
Tybalt stabs Mercutio."

409
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
I am hurt.

410
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,200
Why didn't he just steel up again?
Stupid Mercutio.

411
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,240
This is the least of our worries.

412
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,840
We need to get out there
and fix hissory.

413
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,560
- What's that?
- Histrory. History.

414
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,280
Time! We gotta fix time.

415
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,920
- What?
- Are you sloshed?

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,200
Follow-up question.
Why is there glitter on your face?

417
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,840
Looks like your tachyon scrubber
needs to be replaced.

418
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Whatever that means.

419
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,120
Could someone just see this
fine gentleman out?

420
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,920
- Thank you.
- With pleasure.

421
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,640
Let's go, sexy firefighter.

422
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,920
Go on, get!

423
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,080
Ray, can I talk to you, please?

424
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah.

425
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,640
All right, Ray. What's up?

426
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,400
Why haven't you told Nate
that you're leaving?

427
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,200
Because he's my best friend.

428
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,040
And the moment I tell him,
then this all becomes real.

429
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,040
And I know it's my choice,
my decision.

430
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,640
But I don't, I don't know
if I'm really ready for it.

431
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,880
You remember
when we first moved on the ship?

432
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,960
We left our entire lives behind us.

433
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
We had no idea what to expect.

434
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,440
But because we embraced the change...

435
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,160
We made history.

436
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Sure did.

437
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,880
Who would have thought
that we would still be here...

438
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,040
and that we'd be saying
goodbye already?

439
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,280
I'm gonna miss you, Captain Lance.

440
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,080
Don't make me cry.

441
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,480
I'm gonna miss you too, Ray.

442
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
A lot.

443
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Come here.

444
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,360
Let's hope the actors
aren't off-book yet.

445
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,600
<i>You have to talk Shakespeare
out of his superhero play.</i>

446
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
<i>And make sure you get those scripts.</i>

447
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,920
Back, foul villain! Whoosh!

448
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Take to the skies, brethren!

449
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,200
For tonight, there will be justice.

450
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,360
Behold! What worthy hero faces me?

451
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,520
My face is silver.

452
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,520
Fists like thunder strikes.

453
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,320
We must collect the gems
to save the world,

454
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,000
while learning how to work more
as a team.

455
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
- Yes.
- Come hither.

456
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,000
We have much to discuss.

457
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,200
Wow. And it's still
in iambic pentameter.

458
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,160
Okay, you guys take care of the cast
and get the scripts.

459
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,640
- I'll talk to Shakespeare.
- Copy.

460
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,600
Take to the skies, brethren.

461
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,240
I can't believe
we have to destroy these.

462
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,480
This show has potential.

463
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,560
Hear ye! Hear ye!

464
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,000
So there's been a change of plans.

465
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,720
You guys have been replaced
by Riverdale.

466
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,320
- William Shakespeare?
- Bother me not.

467
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm making amendments to my script.

468
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,440
I must elucidate more clearly

469
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,080
what the Steel Man's takeaway lesson
is from the story.

470
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,800
Oh, well, I'm actually here to speak
to you about your new play.

471
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,200
I know you.

472
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,160
You're one of the constables
that asked for the ring,

473
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,680
and who caused such a glorious row
with Henslowe and his men.

474
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,840
Yes, and now I'm here to say
that you cannot put on the show.

475
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,640
But I finally struck inspiration.

476
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,840
Look, I have a plan.

477
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,360
Romeo and Juliet will form a team,

478
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,400
and I will henceforth
introduce the allies,

479
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,680
Hamlet, Viola, and Puck,

480
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,560
who will join forces
to face Richard III.

481
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,240
Now I understand why you've written
this new version of the play.

482
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
You don't want
Romeo and Juliet's story to end.

483
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Exactly.

484
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,040
I love the characters,
so why say goodbye?

485
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,280
But if you truly love the characters,
don't they deserve a great ending?

486
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,560
I've always known
how to finish their story.

487
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,480
If I let them go,
I'm unsure what happens next.

488
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,200
I understand, but...

489
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,000
endings are necessary for growth.

490
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,560
No matter how painful they may be.

491
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,280
You speak quite wisely.

492
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,760
I'm speaking from experience.

493
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,560
I find myself in a similar situation.

494
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,560
When I'm done here, I am leaving
my team for a new adventure,

495
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,680
and ending our journey
has proven more heartbreaking...

496
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
than I can bear.

497
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
And while I can't imagine
saying goodbye,

498
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
I know that I must.

499
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Very well.

500
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,960
I shall do what is needed
for my beloved characters,

501
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,560
give Romeo and Juliet an ending
no one will forget.

502
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,040
All righty.

503
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,560
If we did our job right,

504
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,480
this cover should change back
to Romeo and Juliet any second.

505
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,720
I know you're leaving, Ray.

506
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,200
Yeah, to my honeymoon.

507
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,120
Would you just knock it off?

508
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,280
I know you're leaving the team.

509
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,040
Nate, I'm, I'm sorry.

510
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,640
I was gonna tell you sooner.

511
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,600
I swear, but I just,
I didn't know how to do it.

512
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,400
Maybe if you had the balls
to say it sooner,

513
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,720
maybe I could have done something
like make us a last-mission playlist

514
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,480
or get us matching T-shirts.

515
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
That would have been amazing.

516
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,320
But I was waiting
for some perfect moment,

517
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,600
which doesn't exist,
because I didn't want to upset you.

518
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,320
Of course, I'm upset!
Today could have been awesome.

519
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,040
It could have been amazing,
but now it's just...

520
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,200
It's just over.

521
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,760
Eventually, everything has to change.

522
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,320
Yeah, I know everything
changes eventually.

523
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,440
I didn't think it'd be so soon,

524
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,000
and I didn't think
I'd be the last one to know.

525
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,200
<i>Attention, Legends.</i>

526
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,680
<i>There is no record of the play
Romeo and Juliet</i>

527
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,600
<i>in the timeline, which means...</i>

528
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,160
Shakespeare didn't put
on the play yet.

529
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,880
The final mission isn't completed.

530
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,560
We can still go back
and fix history together.

531
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,240
The team has it, Ray.

532
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,160
You should go. You're right.

533
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,000
Things change eventually,
so why not start now?

534
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Nate.

535
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Nate!

536
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,880
Willy Shakes, what's happening?

537
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,480
Spare me your whimsical turns
of phrase.

538
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,760
Barkeep, my draught has gone hollow.

539
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
I'll have another.

540
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,640
Will, what happened to the play?

541
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,800
Henslowe withdrew the moneys
and shut us down.

542
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,640
In his mind's eye, he thinks
I stole back his ring.

543
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,240
Now, I have no theater,
no actors, and so no career.

544
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,560
Tell us where Henslowe is.
We'll help you.

545
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,200
Just leave me be.

546
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,520
I've seen your help in action,
and it is anything but.

547
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,080
So you're just gonna give up?

548
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,440
It's like the tall one said.

549
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,920
All things must cease.

550
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,680
And this is the end
of William Shakespeare.

551
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,320
- He is so dramatic.
- Yeah.

552
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,720
- Packed already?
- Yeah.

553
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,840
Figured why wait.

554
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,680
Well, there's no rush,
you know, we can stick around

555
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
until they get back.

556
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,880
I think we've stuck around
too long already.

557
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,760
What is going on?

558
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,800
Well, we ruined
the Western literary canon,

559
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,320
and Shakespeare hates us,
so here's to Legends of Tomorrow,

560
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,240
who single-handedly destroyed
storytelling as we know it.

561
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,920
Sorry, so that's it?

562
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,920
First, you pick a fight with Ray,
and now you admit defeat!

563
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,160
Are you just trying to prove

564
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,920
that everything is as miserable
as how you feel?

565
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,480
I don't wanna talk about Ray.

566
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Look, Nate, I get it.

567
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,120
I'm afraid of losing Ray, too.

568
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,080
Honestly, I don't know
what we're gonna do

569
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,560
without his stupid optimism
and blind faith

570
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,600
and ridiculous plans
that somehow always work.

571
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,680
I know what we need to do.

572
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,480
Gideon, tell the team it's all hands
on deck here at the tavern,

573
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,720
and fabricate some codpieces.

574
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,040
The show must go on.

575
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,440
All right, it's almost showtime.

576
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,600
Remember, Gideon is going to be
feeding you your lines.

577
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Yeah, no pressure.

578
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,160
It's not like we're rebooting
Shakespeare's career or anything.

579
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,280
It really is book club's
greatest mission yet.

580
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,440
I can't believe I let you guys
rope me into this one.

581
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,080
Look, if you want to find the Loom,
you gotta do things our way.

582
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,440
You think this is gonna work,
Captain?

583
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,960
Honestly, no.

584
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,760
But Ray would.

585
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,240
"My bounty is as boundless
as the sea."

586
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,040
- That's crap.
- Just say the words,

587
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,000
because you are on!

588
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,640
Listen up, you uncultured jerks.

589
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,720
Two households, both alike
in dignity, in fair Verona,

590
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,360
- where we lay our scene.
- What?

591
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,000
From ancient grudge breaks
to new mutiny.

592
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,480
- What?
- Where civil blood...

593
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,480
What? What? Stop.
Those are my words!

594
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,560
a pair of starstruck lovers
take their life.

595
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Just enjoy the show, all right?

596
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,040
Whose misadventured piteous
overthrows...

597
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,560
- Looks like the audience is.
- done to their death.

598
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,920
Clubs, bills, and partisans.

599
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
Strike!

600
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,360
Beat them down.

601
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,040
Down with the Capulets.

602
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,560
Down with the Montagues!

603
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
What noise is this?

604
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,080
Give me my long sword, ho!

605
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,360
A sword? A crutch!

606
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,400
Why call you for a sword?

607
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,440
My sword, I say!

608
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,160
Old Montague has come,

609
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,840
and flourishes his blade
in spite of me.

610
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,200
Thou villain Capulet.

611
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,800
Hold me not! Let me go.

612
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,520
Thou shalt not stir one foot
to seek a foe.

613
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Fight.

614
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Exciting.

615
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,360
What shall I swear by?

616
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,600
If my heart's dear love...

617
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,080
Do not swear.

618
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,800
Although I take joy in thee,

619
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,760
I take no joy
in this contract tonight.

620
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,080
It is too rash,
too unadvised, too sudden.

621
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,560
Too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.

622
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,600
Too like the lightning,
which doth cease to be.

623
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,120
One can say, it lightens.

624
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Sweet, good night.

625
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,200
Wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

626
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,680
What's wrong?

627
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,560
I mean, other than the fact this role
clearly should have gone to a woman.

628
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,760
I just need a second, okay?

629
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,440
Acting is hard.

630
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,120
I know it can be hard to face

631
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,560
that your time with someone
is coming to an end.

632
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,040
Sometimes, it's easier to just
send them away before it hits you.

633
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,200
Like Juliet's doing here.

634
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,480
She got all that?

635
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,360
She was meant for book club.

636
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,120
Change is hard,
but it can also be beautiful.

637
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,360
It can be both.

638
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,960
You know, it's not too late
to say goodbye to your friend.

639
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,960
- What about Juliet?
- I have it handled.

640
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,640
Among my many talents,
I'm a classically trained actor.

641
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,960
Gidget, I'm off-book.

642
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,800
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath,

643
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,680
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

644
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,880
Is that a man?

645
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,720
- Good night.
- Does it matter?

646
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,840
Good night.

647
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,800
As sweet repose
and rest come to thy heart

648
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,160
- as that within my breast.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

649
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,280
Oh, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

650
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
All right, Gideon.

651
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,040
It's time for me to go.

652
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,080
<i>Will I ever see you again?</i>

653
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
I hope so.

654
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,280
Thank you for everything.

655
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,400
And take care of the Legends for me.

656
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,200
<i>Safe travels, Dr. Palmer.</i>

657
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,880
Ray, are you there?

658
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Can you hear me?

659
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Ray.

660
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,960
You again.

661
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Get over here.

662
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,360
Help.

663
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
Ray!

664
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,440
What satisfaction canst thou
have tonight?

665
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,960
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vows for mine.

666
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,600
I gave thee mine
before thou didst request it,

667
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,160
and yet I would it
were to give again.

668
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,560
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?

669
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,720
But to be frank,
and give it thee again.

670
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,600
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have...

671
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,480
my bounty is as boundless as the sea.

672
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,800
My love as deep.

673
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,480
The more I give to thee,

674
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,360
the more I have,
for both are infinite.

675
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,000
I hear some noise within.

676
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,640
Dear love, adieu.

677
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,560
Ray! Ray! Ray!

678
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
I missed him.

679
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
He's gone.

680
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,240
Nate. Nate!

681
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,360
I'm still here, buddy.

682
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,680
Romeo. Romeo.

683
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,200
Ray, I am so sorry
I lashed out at you.

684
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,920
It was just a lot to process,
and I didn't know how to say it.

685
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,840
The thing is, I'm just really sad...

686
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,600
but I'm really happy for you guys.

687
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,680
I'm sorry that you found out
the way you did...

688
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,800
and that just, I wish
there was some way that everything

689
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,200
and nothing could change all at once.

690
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
This sucks.

691
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
But I love you.

692
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,520
This totally sucks.

693
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
But I love you, too.

694
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,080
Good night.

695
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Good night.

696
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,520
Parting is such sweet sorrow

697
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,440
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

698
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,200
Zari was pretty good at Juliet.

699
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,680
I mean, not as good as you, but...

700
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
You okay?

701
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,360
It's a weird thing with friendship.

702
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,040
It starts
because you need each other.

703
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,640
And then, if you do it right
and help each other grow,

704
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,960
you need each other less.

705
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,840
I guess change is the whole point.

706
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,160
Well, if you,
you ever need a bro hug...

707
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
I'm your gal.

708
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
Bring it in.

709
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,560
Sorry.

710
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,760
It's okay. Ray was terrible
at bro hugs at first too.

711
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,240
- Yeah.
- But you're really terrible.

712
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,200
You're such a dick.

713
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,240
Why are you so strong?

714
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,880
On a Shakespeare kick?

715
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,680
Didn't care much
for those Italian kids,

716
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,240
but this guy...

717
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,640
This guy is a hero.

718
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,360
You know King Lear is a tragic figure

719
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,520
whose stubbornness
and fear of the future

720
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,080
leads to his own misery?

721
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,360
Sounds like someone I can get behind.

722
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,760
You should talk to your daughter.

723
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,560
There's no secrets in book club.

724
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,040
I'm not hiding from her.

725
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,360
- I'm protecting her.
- From what?

726
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,680
Nurturing fathers
don't run in my family.

727
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,640
But I'm better off
because I had you in my life.

728
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,880
She will be, too.

729
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,680
It's good to see you.

730
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,280
Consent to hug you?

731
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,680
Gonna take that as a yes.

732
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,840
So this is part of the Loom of Fate?

733
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,040
Well, I had to disguise the bit
so that mere mortals like you

734
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
wouldn't burst into flames
when you looked at it.

735
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,240
Well, that is certainly
very thoughtful of you, Charlie.

736
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,480
Not so fast.

737
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
This is too powerful, John.

738
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,920
And, honestly,
you're too close to it.

739
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,160
You know, this is my mission, Sara.

740
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,960
And this is my ship.

741
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,600
- So what's the plan?
- This is just the beginning.

742
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,600
But with that,
we can find the other pieces.

743
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
I was so worried.

744
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,320
I wasn't sure when you'd wake up.

745
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,560
What did you see?

746
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,840
I, I was in a bar and people were...

747
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,600
laughing and...

748
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,520
And John was there with his friends.

749
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,080
Did he say what he was looking for?

750
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,800
He's looking for the Loom of Fate.

751
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
The Loom?

752
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
- So you've heard of it?
- Of course.

753
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,000
The Loom of Fate is one of the most
powerful tools in existence.

754
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,760
It could completely
rewrite your life.

755
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,240
Are you sure you want to trust
that power in someone else's hands?

756
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,400
Especially John Constantine's?

757
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,960
- Can't sleep either, huh?
- Yeah.

758
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,400
You know,
we all spend time off the ship,

759
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,600
but people usually don't feel this...

760
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,760
- Gone.
- gone.

761
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,480
How early does a guy have to get up
to get some alone time?

762
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,760
Ray's green juice.

763
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,800
You feeling sentimental too, huh,
Mick?

764
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,440
The juice was taking up
all the room in the fridge.

765
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,080
Now shut up, pretty.

766
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,760
Missing someone after they're gone
almost makes them more present.

767
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Heard you get up, babe.

768
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,640
- I was awake anyway.
- Hi, babe.

769
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,040
I had a feeling other people
would be up.

770
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,760
Oh, gross! Is that Ray's green juice?

771
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,360
- Yep.
- Give me some.

772
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
To Ray...

773
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,400
who taught me
how to be a better friend

774
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,120
by being a better friend
than I deserved.

775
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,560
Who told me that if you're dumb
enough to expect good from the world,

776
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,440
well, it might just live up
to your expectations.

777
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,640
And who showed us
that there's never a problem so big

778
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,360
it can't be solved with a smile.

779
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
To the big guy.

780
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
- To Ray.
- To Ray.

781
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
To Ray.

782
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,280
I'm really gonna miss him.

783
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,320
Tastes like death.

784
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,520
It's delicious.

785
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,040
You think Ray left
that bathroom sign-up sheet?

786
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,200
No, no, no!
