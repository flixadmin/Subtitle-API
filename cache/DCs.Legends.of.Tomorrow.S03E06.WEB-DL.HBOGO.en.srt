1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,120
<i>How will we be remembered?</i>

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,320
<i>Will it be for saving
the world twice?</i>

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,480
<i>Nope. We're the team who broke time.
That's right.</i>

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,520
<i>History has been torn to shreds
which means it's up to us</i>

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,400
<i>to put it back together again
piece by piece</i>

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,320
<i>fixing these so-called Anachronisms
before we get torn to shreds.</i>

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>So please, don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,960
<i>We're Legends.</i>

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,480
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,480
I would kill you
but I'd just be killing myself.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,200
I want to break up Firestorm
so that you can you go home.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
When do we start?

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,640
Please allow me to introduce
Madame Eleanor.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,000
We have to stop Damien Darhk
from coming back to life.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,560
Stop this abomination.

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,480
You're too late.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,840
- I remember everything.
- Let's go.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,280
You. You there.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,920
Yeah, you don't belong here.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,320
You're supposed to be on Stage 12.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,680
We're about to roll and Mr. Coleson's
already in a real mood.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,120
We already have one actress
gumming the works.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,160
I can't have extras
wandering off too.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,960
We should've been rolling
half an hour ago.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Where the hell's my star?

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,360
- Ms. LaMarr is still in makeup.
- You got to be kidding me.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,240
How long does it take a tomato
like that to put her face on?

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,200
She's playing Helen of Troy,
not Marie Antoinette.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,160
Holy cannoli, who is that?

30
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,120
That's it.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,440
That look right there.

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,840
Can you do that on cue?

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Forget Hedy.

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,840
This is our star.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,360
What's your name, sweetheart?

36
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm Helen.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,080
Helen of Troy.

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,440
You are now, toots.

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,680
"The face that sold
a million tickets."

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,800
All right, people, let's roll!

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,320
Oh, hey, Sara.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,280
{\an5}Sara, I've been searching
for more outliers

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,280
{\an5}in the hopes of finding Darhk
and his witchy friend.

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,800
{\an5}You think having a supercomputer
would helpful.

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,440
<i>Watch yourself, Mr. Heywood.</i>

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,440
{\an5}Anyways, there's no sign
of them in the timeline.

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,880
What is that smell?

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,960
{\an5}Okay, full disclosure, I haven't left
the library in seven days, I think.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,440
Is it Tuesday? I'm not really sure.

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,160
{\an5}It's hard for me to keep track
of time in a temporal zone.

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,600
Shower. Now.

52
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,680
Okay. I'll shower after I find Darhk.

53
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,120
{\an5}I know how much it means
to you to find him.

54
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,240
{\an5}Look, we're gonna put Darhk
back in the ground where he belongs,

55
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,360
but not like this.

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,160
- Not like what?
- Not like Rip.

57
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
He lost perspective
and he got his team killed.

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,920
I'm not going to be
that kind of captain.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
{\an5}But I am the kind of captain
that tells you to clean yourself up.

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,920
Okay?

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
Aye, aye.

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,680
Thanks to your research, Marty

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,920
{\an5}the nanites I injected
into your bloodstreams

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,840
{\an5}should be locking onto
your respective halves

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,200
of the Firestorm Matrix.

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,240
{\an5}I'm only hoping that the polymer
I constructed is strong enough

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,400
{\an5}to transfer your half
from you to him.

68
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,920
{\an5}Well, a little too much "should"
and "hoping" for my comfort

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,480
but then...

70
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,920
{\an5}What is science if not
the exploration of the unknown?

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,960
Ray, I'm telling you right now,
if you kill me

72
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm gonna haunt you forever.

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,920
{\an5}Well, just remember,
this was your idea.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,040
{\an5}If you guys are getting cold feet,
we can call the whole thing off.

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Absolutely not.

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,640
We proceed with courage
and confidence.

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,880
It's time for Jefferson to claim
the power of Firestorm for himself.

78
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,360
I appreciate that, man.

79
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,880
{\an5}But come on, admit it,
you're gonna miss this a little.

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,800
{\an5}I mean, being a superhero,
saving time.

81
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,040
Not at all.

82
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
Were it not for this affliction

83
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,280
{\an5}my adventuring days would be
long behind me by now.

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,480
Time travel is a young man's game.

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,080
{\an5}I'm eager to close this chapter
and embrace the next.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,040
Well, let's set this old man free.

87
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,760
Ray, let's do it.

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,680
All right.

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,240
Here goes.

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
Hey, what's... what's going on?

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
The system seems to be overheating.

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,960
- There's too much power.
- Shut... shut it down quickly.

93
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,320
Marty. Marty, you okay?

94
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
A little bruised,
Doctor Palmer but I'll live.

95
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,080
{\an5}- Wait, what?
- Everything hurts.

96
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,160
Look at my hands.

97
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,160
They're white.

98
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,840
{\an5}And mine appear to be
African-American.

99
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,880
You can just say "black," Grey.

100
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,000
- You're me and I'm you?
- You're me and I'm you?

101
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,560
Oh, pancakes.

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,760
<i>Attention, Legends.</i>

103
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,640
{\an5}<i>Captain Lance requests
that all personnel</i>

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,280
<i>report to the bridge immediately.</i>

105
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,040
{\an5}I guess we know
where the explosion came from.

106
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,520
- What happened?
- Yes.

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,760
Pray tell, Dr. Palmer.
What exactly happened to us?

108
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,800
Because it seems we are in
a particularly precarious situation

109
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,960
{\an5}that I, for one, have no idea
how to remedy.

110
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
Why don't we just merge?

111
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,600
Out of the question.

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,960
Absolutely not.
We have switched bodies.

113
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
Who knows what else
may have shifted?

114
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,760
{\an5}Merging now could cause a meltdown
of insurmountable proportions.

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
{\an5}We just... we just
can't afford the risk.

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,600
You're the Professor and you're Jax.

117
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,080
Switched.

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
Must be Tuesday.

119
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,960
What's going on?

120
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,920
{\an5}Well, we seem to have a bit
of a "Freaky Friday" situation.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
- I'm Jax.
- And I'm Martin.

122
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Cool.

123
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,920
- So this is why we've been summoned?
- No, actually.

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,760
- Okay.
- Tell them.

125
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,200
1937, Hollywood, California.

126
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
A beautiful woman
mysteriously appeared

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,240
and threw the entire
film industry into chaos.

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,720
She apparently was so beautiful
that both Warner Brothers

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,160
and K and G Pictures went to war
over her and it got ugly, fast.

130
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,640
Literal backs were stabbed.
People died.

131
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,520
Those Hollywood idiots
probably had it coming.

132
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,720
Maybe but this wasn't
supposed to happen,

133
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,520
so we are going to fix it.

134
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,680
It will be a nice, easy mission
and we'll get our mojo back.

135
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,720
Awesome, maybe now I might actually
get to meet some celebrities.

136
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,960
And how would you even know?

137
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,480
The oldest movie you've ever
watched is some ridiculous farce

138
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,640
called Police Academy."

139
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,200
Don't knock the "Academy," Grey.

140
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,760
Doesn't matter because you two
are a liability like this

141
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,120
and you are staying on the ship.

142
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,480
- Wait, what?
- Oh, fantastic.

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,960
Gideon, plot a course for Tinseltown.

144
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,200
<i>You're sad.</i>

145
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,280
<i>Paris has gone off to fight Menelaus.</i>

146
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,120
<i>He may die.</i>

147
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,880
<i>How could you live with yourself
if you lost him?</i>

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Cut!

149
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
That was aces!

150
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,360
Check the gate. Moving on.

151
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,840
All right, everybody.
You heard the man.

152
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,040
Got a movie to make.

153
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,200
- Let's go, people!
- I got eyes on her.

154
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,680
All right, remember,
We're doing recon only.

155
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,080
Nobody moves on her.

156
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
Let's see what we're dealing with.

157
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,040
<i>What can you tell us?</i>

158
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,960
She's really, really pretty.

159
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,640
She looks familiar,
like I've seen her somewhere.

160
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm sure she's never heard
that one before.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
The gossip I'm hearing is that
this woman is seriously method.

162
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,960
She hasn't broken character
since she got here.

163
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm going in.

164
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,440
- Maybe I can talk to her.
- Negative. Recon only.

165
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,560
I don't want to spook her.
She's out of her time.

166
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,240
I am so sorry, miss.

167
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,600
- Are you all right?
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

168
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,840
Hey, watch what you're doing.
You almost took her head off.

169
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,760
- Are you okay?
- Yes, it's really nothing.

170
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,200
- Hey!
- Get lost, you twit.

171
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,600
- I asked the lady a question.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.

172
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,200
Oh, try stopping me, tough guy.

173
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,040
That escalated quickly.

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,480
What... what's going on?

175
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,960
There's only one woman in history
who has this effect on men.

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
She really is Helen of Troy.

177
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,120
- She's on the move.
- Follow her.

178
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
What's she doing now?

179
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,080
She's alone now. She looks upset.

180
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,640
What are we waiting for?
Let's grab her.

181
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
A kidnapping in broad daylight?

182
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,960
Even we shouldn't be so careless.

183
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,320
Jack, I mean Martin is right.
We have to wait.

184
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,960
What the hell is going on here?

185
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,400
Where's Helen? Well, find her! Now!

186
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,600
Z, you got incoming.

187
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,240
Studio boss is looking
for his new face.

188
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,040
Yeah, so is someone else.

189
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,320
My, oh, my.

190
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,920
Now, the rumors I've been hearing
could not do you justice.

191
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,480
You really are something special.
The name's Eddie.

192
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,360
- Eddie Rothberg, K and G Pictures.
- I'm Helen.

193
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,360
That's right, honey. Don't do it.

194
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,040
Someone taught you not to get
into cars with strangers, right?

195
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,160
Hop in.

196
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,880
Or not.

197
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,520
Rothberg. Helen! Wait! Stop!
Rothberg, you son of bitch!

198
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,120
I'll kill you myself,
you rat bastard!

199
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
Did that just happen?

200
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
"Paris stole Helen from Menelaus.

201
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,880
And the war began."

202
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,680
I thought the Helen of Troy story
was just a myth.

203
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, we've found that myths tend
to have some truth about them

204
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,560
this one more than most.

205
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Helen and her lover, Paris,
set off a ten-year war

206
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,280
that launched thousands of ships

207
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,240
and sent tens of thousands
of men off to their death

208
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,520
all in the name of her beauty.

209
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,760
You make it sound like
it's her fault.

210
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,480
Men always find a reason to fight.
That's not on her.

211
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,840
Depends. How hot is she?

212
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,120
I mean, she's all right.
She's really hot.

213
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,720
Seems kind of little league, right?

214
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,560
I mean, what's the big deal if this
chick gets to make a bunch of movies?

215
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,200
What's the big deal?

216
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
Helen is taking over the classics
like an infestation.

217
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,960
What's... what's "Casablanca"
without Ingrid Bergman?

218
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,320
The "Philadelphia Story"
without Katherine Hepburn?

219
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,920
It's... it's inconceivable.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,600
And now this upstart steals
the career-making role of Hedy LaMarr

221
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,080
my boyhood crush.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,720
- Sorry, I'm still adjusting.
- Look.

223
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,080
I've seen the chaos that she causes
with my own eyes.

224
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,040
We need to get Helen
out of the movie business

225
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,480
before anybody else gets hurt.

226
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,720
Gideon, where's Helen now?

227
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
<i>I checked the tabloid archives
and it so happens</i>

228
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,760
<i>Edward Rothberg of K and G Pictures
is throwing a gala this afternoon</i>

229
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,480
<i>to show off his latest star.</i>

230
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,160
Which would be the one
and only Helen of Troy.

231
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, everybody go
put your best digs on

232
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,200
because we are going
to save Hollywood.

233
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,440
Yeah, until the Kardashians
destroy it.

234
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,880
Finally, a positive side effect
to our predicament.

235
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm absolutely giddy at the notion
of attending a 1930s Hollywood gala.

236
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,080
Maybe I'll rub elbows
with Clark Gable

237
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,080
or dance with Ginger Rogers.

238
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,960
You have a little extra
fun for me, Grey.

239
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,560
I'm sitting this one out.

240
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,520
- Why? What's... what's wrong?
- I'm wasted, man.

241
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,360
My joints ache. I feel like
I'm walking under water

242
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,320
and I have to use the bathroom,
like, all the time.

243
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,840
I assure you,

244
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
the moment we get Helen
back to her proper time,

245
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
we will fix this.

246
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,800
Damn, I look good.

247
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,280
What's wrong? Are you all right?

248
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,440
Can we please go back in time

249
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,920
and murder whoever
invented stockings?

250
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,280
<i>- Any sign of Helen?</i>
- No.

251
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,760
But Ray's becoming friends
with Cecil B DeMille.

252
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,200
That is one remarkable mug,
young man.

253
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,800
And you've never been in a picture?

254
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
No, not that I recall.

255
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,720
Well, I'm shooting one next month.

256
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,960
Cary Grant backed out
but this profile of yours

257
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,400
might just have him outdone.

258
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,120
Stick with me and they'll be saying
"Cary who?"

259
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,720
Ray is ready for his close-up,
Mr. DeMille.

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
- There she is.
<i>- You found Helen?</i>

261
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,560
No. Hedy LaMarr.

262
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,400
The most beautiful woman
in the world.

263
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,200
Not only is she a talented actress

264
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,680
but she is a genius.

265
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,440
Brilliant and beautiful.

266
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,240
- I'd do her.
- Trust you, Mr. Rory,

267
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,440
to take something precious
and debase it.

268
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,040
She's also an inventor.

269
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,560
Her patent on frequency hopping alone

270
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,320
revolutionized the world.

271
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,640
Tuck in your shirt.

272
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Ms. LaMarr.

273
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,840
I just wanted to say I am
one of your biggest admirers.

274
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,160
You are a remarkable actress.

275
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,400
How would you know?

276
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,120
I haven't acted
in any American films.

277
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,280
Now I probably never will.

278
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,640
I came here today
to take one last shot

279
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,320
at making my dreams come true
and meet Mr. DeMille.

280
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,520
But the closest
I'll get to Mr. DeMille

281
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,080
is transferring his calls
at Warner Brothers.

282
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,880
"Operator,
how may I direct your call?"

283
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,240
But surely someone with your talent

284
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,920
will find work as an actress.

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,040
Tough luck finding work
when she's in the room.

286
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,240
Who?

287
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Any girl can look glamorous.

288
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,240
She just has to stand still
and look stupid.

289
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,680
Is everyone in position?

290
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,240
Yes.

291
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,240
Thank you.

292
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,800
- Sandwich?
- No.

293
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,600
<i>Ray? Nate?</i>

294
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,240
Rory?

295
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Holy Helen of Troy.

296
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah. That spells hot.

297
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,760
<i>Guys, snap out of it.
We got a job to do.</i>

298
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,160
Hey, check out her security detail.

299
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,320
- The woman's a prisoner.
- Not for long.

300
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,840
We just need to get her alone.

301
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,200
Z?

302
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,400
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my gosh.

303
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,680
- Please excuse me.
- Of course.

304
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,080
Nice.

305
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,200
Ray, suit up and meet us
at the balcony for extraction.

306
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,480
Helen, you have to come with us.

307
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,120
You don't belong here
and you know it.

308
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,520
You must be from Warner Brothers.

309
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,960
Tell Arnold that I'm sorry,

310
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,920
but I left him for a better
opportunity.

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,960
Oh, you actually are a good actress.

312
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah, I hear they have a decent
theater scene in Troy.

313
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,840
We should go check it out.

314
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,240
No.

315
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,560
No, the Gods have answered
my prayers by bringing me here.

316
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,280
This place is strange

317
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,160
but I'm learning its rules.

318
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,800
And the first rule of Hollywood is

319
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
never discuss business
without your agent present.

320
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,240
I guess she's not just a pretty face.

321
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,920
Everybody get ready to move.
We got to go fast.

322
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,960
Helen, darling,
why don't you run along

323
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,320
and find Mr. Rothberg?

324
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Gladly.

325
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,360
What the hell are you doing here?

326
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,680
Aside from collecting my 15 percent?

327
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,120
You're her agent.

328
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,640
You know that I have
the killer instinct

329
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,480
that this job requires.

330
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,920
I didn't come here to fight.

331
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,200
I came to talk.

332
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,200
And I didn't come alone.

333
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,000
If you don't take me up
on my offer for parlay,

334
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
things could get ugly for you

335
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,160
your team and Hollywood's elite.

336
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,360
All right.

337
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,200
Everybody stand down.

338
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,320
Darhk and I have some
catching up to do.

339
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,040
Thank you.

340
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,160
Don't worry.

341
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,080
Poison is a coward's weapon.

342
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
And our conflict is
at a brief standstill.

343
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,400
You're from Zambesi?

344
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,200
And your powers-here
do they come from?

345
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,320
I would have thought
you would have been able

346
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,080
to sense one of your own.

347
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,360
You're a totem bearer.

348
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,480
You wanted to talk, so talk.

349
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,120
You know for someone who died

350
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,080
you don't appreciate
the simple things in life.

351
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,440
Me? I'm a changed man

352
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,120
which is why I'm trying to do
this the civilized way.

353
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,280
- Do what?
- Convince you and your friends

354
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
to pack up and ship out.

355
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,920
You want Helen to stay.

356
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What can I say?

357
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,880
Anachronisms are good for business.

358
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,840
- You wield the Water Totem.
- In a matter of speaking.

359
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,360
The totem is now part of me.

360
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,720
And you've perverted it.

361
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Totem bearers must
protect the innocent

362
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,480
not use it for selfish gain.

363
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,160
You dare lecture me on selfishness?

364
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,320
You're the one who's turned
her back on her own people

365
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,120
in favor of these bungling idiots.

366
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,160
You know nothing about me.

367
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,720
You really do look lovely.

368
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,560
That color always suited you.

369
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,800
- So are you an actor?
- Yes

370
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,000
well, maybe. My name's Ray.

371
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,560
- And...
- Haircut!

372
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,680
It's time to leave.

373
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,160
Didn't you hear us on the comms?

374
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,280
No, my... my comms aren't working.

375
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,680
Just ignore them. They're being rude.

376
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,720
Let's get back to our private
conversation.

377
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,560
What are you doing?

378
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,720
Get your mitts off me!

379
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,160
Unhand the lady!

380
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,120
Are you all right?

381
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,960
I am now.

382
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
How convenient.

383
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,560
Here I was, thinking I was going
to have to convince you

384
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,120
what a mess your team makes of things

385
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,320
and that you'd all be better off

386
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
if you just went back
to your old lives

387
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,200
which brings me to my offer.

388
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,720
I will let you all walk...

389
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,760
Unharmed, if you all leave now
and go back to 2017.

390
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,040
Or what?

391
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,360
Or I will kill your merry
band of idiots one-by-one,

392
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,800
saving you for last.

393
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,080
And then you will die knowing
you could have saved them all

394
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,800
if you'd only made the right choice.

395
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,000
- What were you guys thinking?
- They weren't.

396
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,040
Like every man in the room,
they were just captivated by Helen.

397
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,680
Okay, in our defense,
she was very, very, very...

398
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,840
very attractive.

399
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,760
Yeah, I was just admiring
her personality.

400
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,640
So you jackasses decided
to impress her by having a fight?

401
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,760
- Mick started it.
- All right, enough finger pointing.

402
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,880
We need to focus
on the real issue here.

403
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,080
Damien Darhk.

404
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,320
Wait, Darhk was there
and you're still alive?

405
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,040
He didn't want to fight.
He wanted to talk.

406
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,040
And he made us an "offer."

407
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,760
We stop doing what we're doing.

408
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,080
No more Waverider.
No more fixing Anachronisms.

409
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,800
Wait, what does Darhk care
if we fix Anachronisms or not?

410
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,040
I don't know. We didn't have time
to get into his evil agenda.

411
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,640
Well, we've seen what Darhk can do.
Can we even fight him?

412
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Yeah, especially now
that he's walking

413
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,680
with the time caddy
and the water witch.

414
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,040
She's not a witch.

415
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,720
Her name is Kuasa.

416
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,520
And she possesses one
of the lost totems of Zambesi.

417
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Kuasa.

418
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,120
Darhk massacred
those Time Bureau agents

419
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,280
in Victorian London
without even batting an eyelid.

420
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,880
What if we can't take them?

421
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,880
This might be our best offer.

422
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,240
You don't offer a deal unless
you want something in return.

423
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
Besides, if he lets us walk,

424
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,160
he's just going to take us
out one by one.

425
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,800
That's right.
We're stronger together.

426
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,200
We know that. Darhk knows that.

427
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,840
All right.
Let's get Helen on the ship.

428
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,280
Nope.

429
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,200
After that party,
you three are grounded.

430
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
And I need you and the professor

431
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,640
to figure out why our comms
aren't working.

432
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
- You mean me and the professor?
- Whatever.

433
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
Amaya.

434
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,360
What's up?

435
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,200
I just wanted to wish you guys,
good luck out there.

436
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,560
Thank you.

437
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,080
Not too shabby. As far as prisons go.

438
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,760
It's the same security
detail from the party.

439
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,440
I guess Helen's still inside.

440
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,120
You really think they'll fall
for this stunt?

441
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,040
Have men gotten smarter
in the past few thousand years?

442
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,960
Nope.

443
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,480
Dude, this is impossible.

444
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,160
I can barely get my hands
inside this console

445
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,640
let alone handle the wiring.

446
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,280
How am I supposed to fix something
if my fingers don't work?

447
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,760
It's called arthritis.

448
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,920
And just so you know,
I don't enjoy being inside you

449
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,360
any more than you enjoy
being inside me.

450
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,320
What did I. Don't be so puerile.

451
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Come on, Grey!

452
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,560
Don't pretend like you weren't having
the time of your life at that party.

453
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,120
I don't catch your meaning.

454
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,800
Telepathic link.

455
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,400
Let's just say I can tell
if you weren't married,

456
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,120
you and Ms. LaMarr

457
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,000
would be doing the nasty
in the past-y.

458
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,120
Nasty in the, I'll have you know

459
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,760
that Ms. LaMarr is my hall pass.

460
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,640
- Clarissa gave you a freebie?
- It was her idea.

461
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
Something to spice up our marriage.

462
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,160
She picked Jean-Claude Van Damme,

463
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
and thinking the whole
exercise ridiculous,

464
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,720
I chose Hedy LaMarr

465
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,240
never thinking I'd actually
get the chance.

466
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,760
Why, because she's dead?

467
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,200
She's not dead here, you dog.

468
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,920
No deliveries tonight.

469
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,960
Really?

470
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,480
Because I got Mr. Rothberg's
prized horse back there.

471
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,240
Nothing here about no horse.

472
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,680
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

473
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,160
Fine.

474
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,760
Just gonna need to check the back.

475
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,800
Oh, you mean his prize whores.

476
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,000
- Did he just call us...
- Yeah.

477
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,960
Please don't scream.

478
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,280
She said "please." You gonna behave?

479
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,040
Please don't take me away.

480
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry but this isn't your home,
Helen.

481
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,560
Do you have any idea what it's like
on the plains of Troy?

482
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,680
This land of Hollywood
is far from perfect

483
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,840
but at least men aren't killing
one another in my name.

484
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,200
Not yet anyway. We got incoming.

485
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,280
Rothberg! You think
you can poach my talent

486
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,640
you no good son of a bitch!

487
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,800
I dare you to come at me,
you dumb bastard!

488
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,200
Why does this always happen?

489
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,320
I truly am cursed.

490
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,080
Hey, this isn't your fault
but you can make it stop.

491
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,560
Come with us.

492
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,800
We can't let those idiots
kill each other.

493
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,800
Protect them.
I'll get Helen out of here.

494
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Hey!

495
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,680
What do you think you're doing
with Rothberg's girl?

496
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Just renegotiating her deal.

497
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
Great Zeus.

498
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,040
They're warriors.

499
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,320
Sorry, fellas.

500
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,080
Your new starlet decided
she's better off a free agent.

501
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,120
This vessel-t's remarkable.

502
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,280
Wait till you see her fly.

503
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,320
Gideon, show her what you can do.

504
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,200
Gideon?

505
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
What's going on?

506
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,840
Gideon?

507
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,040
Have you figured it out yet?

508
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,800
Socket wrench, Grey.

509
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,000
Does this look like a socket
wrench to you?

510
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,280
I specialize in subatomic particles,
not hand tools.

511
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,400
That's obvious.

512
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,680
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

513
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,240
Comms weren't the only
thing affected.

514
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,640
Half the ship's systems are down...

515
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,600
Crap.

516
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,760
Please tell me we're not
stuck in 1937.

517
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,240
Gideon and other
vital systems are offline.

518
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
How is that even possible?

519
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,160
Could be Damien Darhk.

520
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,920
What better way to catch us
than to shut down the Waverider?

521
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,640
It's like parts of the ship
are straight-up vanishing.

522
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,160
Of course they are, Jefferson,

523
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,280
because in this version of history,
those technologies no longer exist.

524
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,880
Wait, what are you talking about Jax?

525
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,560
I mean, Marty.

526
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,840
Can't you see?
This is all because of Hedy LaMarr.

527
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,160
As you know, Dr. Palmer,

528
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,360
technological advances
are cumulative.

529
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,360
They build over time
and it seems her patent...

530
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,040
Is the backbone for half
the Waverider's systems.

531
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,360
And without it,
we're essentially, well...

532
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
Screwed.

533
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,480
Where's Hedy now?

534
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,200
She said she was starting a new job
as an operator for Warner Brothers.

535
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Shouldn't be hard to get her
re-signed with Mr. Coleson

536
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,680
now that his "It girl" is gone.

537
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Where are you going?

538
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
To get Ms. LaMarr's career
back on track.

539
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,480
You better not just be calling in
your hall pass, Grey.

540
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,920
I don't want to overstep
but may I ask...

541
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,240
what Gods gave you such
incredible powers?

542
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,800
The Gods didn't give us powers.

543
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,080
Well, maybe they kind of
did for Amaya and me,

544
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,480
but the captain's a self-made woman.

545
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,040
Sara trains every day.
She's a total badass.

546
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,440
- She's a captain too?
- Yeah.

547
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,360
It gives me hope knowing
that you come from a time

548
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,880
where women have
the same opportunities as men.

549
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,920
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

550
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Anywhere must be better
than where I came from.

551
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,680
I spent the last five years alone,
locked up in a tower.

552
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,760
My only view was a distant
battle waging below

553
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,640
men killing each other.

554
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
For what?

555
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,760
Me?

556
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,320
And now you want to send me
back to that hellish place.

557
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,480
Warner Brothers,
how may I direct your call?

558
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,640
Warner Brothers, please hold.

559
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,080
How may I help you?
One moment, please.

560
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,200
Ms. LaMarr.

561
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Coleson is in the commissary.

562
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,000
You have to talk to him
and get your contract back.

563
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,600
Why do you care so much?

564
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,640
Warner Brothers,
how may I direct your call?

565
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,680
Warner Brothers,
how may I direct your call?

566
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,560
There must be a better way
of switching signals.

567
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
There is.
You're meant for better things.

568
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,840
You have no idea the adventures
you'll miss out on

569
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,760
if you don't follow me out that door.

570
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,960
You're crazy.

571
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,640
Sometimes you have to be
if you want to burn bright.

572
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,480
Oh, no.

573
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,040
This is our lucky day.

574
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,840
Wait, you're that talent agent
from the party.

575
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
Ms. LaMarr...

576
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,160
Oh, I assure you

577
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,800
I am something far more ruthless
than a Hollywood agent..

578
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,440
If that's possible.

579
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,680
Okay, I didn't actually think
you'd take me up on my offer,

580
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
but after my warning,
I thought you people

581
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,200
would at least use the buddy system.

582
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,240
But here you are, all alone,
without your better half

583
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,840
to give you at least
a fighting chance.

584
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,400
You and your insufferable
pontificating...

585
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,520
Wait, wait, wait, excuse me.

586
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Either someone got themselves
a thesaurus, or...

587
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,840
He isn't who he appears to be.

588
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,640
- He's the old one.
- No, no.

589
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,720
You guys switched bodies.

590
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,720
Oh, that is rich.

591
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,520
- You need a minute?
- No, I'm good. I'm good.

592
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,360
Let's kill them.

593
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,000
Grey's scared to death.
I can feel it.

594
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,560
Darhk must have found him.

595
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,160
- We're going in.
- I'm coming with you.

596
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,640
You sure you're up for this, Jax?

597
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,000
- Save Grey? Damn right I am.
- You may want to pee first.

598
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,840
We're not gonna stop to help
you find a bathroom.

599
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,560
Good point.

600
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,000
Me too.

601
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,160
Just don't make it a deuce, Mick.

602
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,360
Yeah, and if you do, flush.

603
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,120
What did he mean
about your other half?

604
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,680
Are you married?

605
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,960
Oh, you mean Jefferson.

606
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,360
Yes, I suppose in a way
we are married too.

607
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,680
- It's hard to explain.
- You're a homosexual.

608
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,040
No, I'm one half of a nuclear-powered
superhero

609
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,560
except the two of us
accidentally switched bodies.

610
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,760
They're here.

611
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,720
- I can feel them.
- Hide, hide.

612
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,400
What is going on?

613
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,080
The captain asked us to keep you safe
until the ship's fixed.

614
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,520
And the only way we can do
that is by saving Hedy LaMarr.

615
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,080
I don't understand any of this.

616
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,280
That's okay. Time travel is...

617
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,480
It's very, very confusing.

618
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,720
With the power out,
we're going to have

619
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,600
to lock the outside doors manually.

620
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Right.

621
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,440
You're leaving me on my own?

622
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,760
Defenseless?

623
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,280
Here.

624
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,240
Now you're not defenseless.

625
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,120
It appears they have us boxed in.

626
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,960
On my signal, run.

627
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,440
What about you?

628
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,560
Look, just focus on getting
yourself to safety

629
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,720
and don't give up on your dream.

630
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,040
Oh, goodie.

631
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,280
The cavalry has arrived.

632
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,480
Oh, how I missed those
whimsical outfits of yours.

633
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,480
Your beef is with me, Damien.

634
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,560
So let's fight.

635
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,400
You and me, League style.

636
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,480
Two swords,

637
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
zero magic.

638
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,960
A duel. How quaint.

639
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,120
- Grey!
- But you do realize

640
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
I don't need magic to kill you.

641
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,280
Funny...

642
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,680
that's what Oliver Queen said
right before he killed you.

643
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,040
Foolish girl.

644
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,800
I extended my hand to you
in kindness.

645
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,920
Now you've left me no choice.

646
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,400
Let her go.

647
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,640
If it isn't the great protectress.

648
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,200
Whatever you're doing, don't.

649
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,480
Bring it.

650
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,000
What the...

651
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,960
- Grey, Grey, you all right?
- I'll live.

652
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,440
It seems your body's youthful
resilience has its advantages.

653
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,520
- Hedy, I told you to run.
- And I didn't listen.

654
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,880
You must be his other half.

655
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,440
You two need to use your powers.

656
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,360
We can't. It could cause
a catastrophic nuclear reaction.

657
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,840
Everybody could die.

658
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,360
I got this.

659
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,880
You have to become the Nuclear Man.

660
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,440
It's Firestorm, not Nuclear Man,

661
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,160
and we'd have to be crazy to attempt
a "Freaky Friday" merge.

662
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,600
Yes, but yours could be the case
of quantum entanglement,

663
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,360
which means the particles
in your body are mirrored

664
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,040
by those of your atomic companion,
which also means...

665
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,200
That if we merge, we could still
maintain a stable nuclear reaction.

666
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,640
Sometimes you have to be crazy
if you wish to burn bright.

667
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,800
What do you say, Jefferson?

668
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,160
Not bad.

669
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,200
You want those to be your last words?

670
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,320
We agreed no magic.

671
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,040
Oh, no, I agreed
that I wouldn't use my magic.

672
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,480
I couldn't make that same
promise for her.

673
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,640
That's the thing about daughters.

674
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,880
When they see you die at the hands
of one self-righteous hero

675
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,920
they really don't want
to see it happen again.

676
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,320
Your daughter?

677
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,720
The apple of my eye.

678
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,760
This is the famous White Canary?

679
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,760
Bye-bye, birdie.

680
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,400
That's what I'm talking about, Grey!

681
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,400
Come on, drive her back, Grey!

682
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,960
Jefferson,
I don't think I can do this.

683
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,680
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm an old man.

684
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,200
Yeah, true but you got this, Grey.

685
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,840
Come on, Grey! Let's get them, baby!

686
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,560
Nora, darling, I think it's time
we take our leave.

687
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,640
Please tell me Firestein's a thing.

688
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,360
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

689
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,400
I have to pee.

690
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,080
And I do not.

691
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,680
You did it.

692
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,040
You're a genius.

693
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,880
Forming Firestorm has restored us
to our rightful bodies.

694
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,640
Guys!

695
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,440
Guys, we've got to get her
back to the ship.

696
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,200
You're a disgrace
to every totem bearer

697
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,600
who's come before you.

698
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,800
You have no right to wield its power.

699
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,560
I have every right

700
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,120
to this totem and yours.

701
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
This totem is my family's.

702
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,840
- Only my blood may bear it.
- And they do.

703
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,640
You gave it to your daughter,

704
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,320
and she was supposed
to give it to me.

705
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,000
But instead, it rests on
my little sister's throat.

706
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,520
That's impossible.

707
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,680
That I am your granddaughter?

708
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,200
What do you know of the future?

709
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,800
I told you I couldn't kill you
without killing myself.

710
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,960
But how?

711
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,320
Kuasa, wait.

712
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,120
I see great things for you,
Ms. LaMarr

713
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,640
and Warner Brothers.

714
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,680
It appears that went well.

715
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,240
Arnold wants me to star
in his next film.

716
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,120
The man was so desperate
after the Greek disaster

717
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,880
I was able to negotiate a pay
bump out of the whole thing.

718
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,000
- Brilliant and beautiful.
- Thank you.

719
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,920
I couldn't have done that
or survived without you.

720
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,040
Oh, it was nothing, really.
Just doing our job

721
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,040
setting history back on course.

722
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,880
- Can you guys hear me?
<i>- Loud and clear.</i>

723
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,640
<i>And the ship's purring like a kitten.</i>

724
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,680
Okay, time to go.

725
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,960
Yes. Yes, we... we must be off.

726
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,000
Well, good-bye.

727
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,560
I actually prefer older men.

728
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,080
Well, I'll be...

729
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,520
You old fox.

730
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,520
Come on, man.

731
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,600
Hey.

732
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,240
How's Sara?

733
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,120
Gideon has placed her in a coma
so that she can heal fully.

734
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,080
We'll be without a captain
for a few days but

735
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,880
thankfully she'll make it.

736
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,760
There's something I need to tell you.

737
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,320
It's something I shouldn't tell you

738
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,520
but it's something you should know.

739
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,160
That Kuasa is Mari's sister
and my granddaughter.

740
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,720
- How'd you know?
- She told me.

741
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,600
I never knew that she even existed.

742
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
I don't blame you
for not saying anything.

743
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,040
You were just protecting
the timeline.

744
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,360
I would have done the same thing.

745
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,800
Thank you for understanding.

746
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,360
I can tell you everything I know

747
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,960
but it... it is more complicated
than you think.

748
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,920
No.

749
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,320
We are the protectors of history,

750
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,880
not its editors.

751
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,160
So the less I know, the better.

752
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,400
There, killer.

753
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,840
Oh, my gods. I'm terribly sorry.
I got a bit carried away.

754
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,680
You're pretty good with that thing.
You should keep it.

755
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,120
But this belongs to your comrade.

756
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,720
Yeah, I think she'd be cool
with you having it.

757
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,760
Any of those Trojans get handsy
with you back home

758
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,040
you show them what's what.

759
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,920
Troy is hardly a home.

760
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,560
I don't want to return there.

761
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,320
How can you claim to be heroes,
claim to do good in the world

762
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,800
and yet force somebody back
into a horrible existence?

763
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,120
Okay.

764
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,160
According to the historical record

765
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,480
you disappeared halfway
through the war

766
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,880
but that didn't affect
the war itself.

767
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
So I found you a loophole.

768
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,800
Same time that you're from,
just a different place.

769
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,880
I hacked history.

770
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,520
This isn't Troy.

771
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,280
Nope, it's an island
full of warrior women.

772
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,640
It's cool, right?

773
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,440
Won't your comrades be mad at you?

774
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,440
Yeah, yeah, they would be.

775
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,880
But they knew what they were getting
when they brought me on.

776
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,560
Oh, thank you.

777
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,760
You've changed my destiny.

778
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Best thing about this place

779
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,840
no boys allowed.

780
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,680
You'll finally have some
peace and quiet.
