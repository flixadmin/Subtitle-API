Your shapeshifting days are over,

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,837
You decided to exploit her

[Mona] So what's a Time Bureau?

00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,600
That was supposed to be top secret.

If magic has him on death's door,
then maybe magic can save him.

Nora Darhk is the answer?

That is the problem.
She has a time stone.

She could literally be anywhere,

Not a block from the police precinct.

Okay, back to work.

In the summer of 1951,
a film crew shot footage

70

of a monster in Tokyo Bay.

71

Two days later, the city was destroyed.

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,757
We need to get that footage
before any panic sets in

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,117
and to capture that monster
before it can do any real damage.

And because we're short-handed,
you're up.

All right, fine.

82
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,955
But it's only to stop you blinkered lot

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,635
from giving a harmless monster
a one-way ticket to Hell.

is secure enough
to hold these creatures?

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,599
It's a temporary arrangement

105
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,456
until our containment facility
is up and running, sir.

106

And they are heavily sedated,
right, Gary?

Yeah, double doses
of elephant tranquilizer all around.

things under control here.

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,154
Yes, sir, we sure do.

112
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,152
I'll be seeing you tomorrow
for Thanksgiving.

113
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,120
Your mother's really
looking forward to it

114

for the world.

What are you doing
for the holiday, Director Sharpe?

117
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,040
Me? Oh, well, I was planning
on spending it with my girlfriend,

118
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,474
but she's working overtime,

119
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,069
so I'll probably just
be sticking around here, I guess.

122
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,840
Absolutely.

123
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,034

- Bye, sir.

124
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,476
Yeah, that is if you don't mind
starving all day

125
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,075
while your family slowly
gets loaded and starts fighting

126
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,760
and then your dad gets called
for a "work emergency."

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,198
Well, at least your family
are real people.

[speaking Japanese]

130
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,920
According to historical record,
the director we're looking for,

131
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,157
Ishiro Honda, should be in this stage.

132

Well, I'm feeling a little conspicuous.

133

Just act like you belong.

I beg your pardon,

144

but this is a closed set.

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,071
Are you Ishiro Honda the film director?

146
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,079
- Huh.
- Honda-san, pleasure to meet you.

147
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,271
We're producers from K&G Pictures,

148
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,194
we got word of an unusual
animal sighting out in the bay.

149
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,856
We were told you might
have some footage suitable

150
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,916
for our news reel?

151
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,271
- How do you know about that?
- We're from Hollywood,

152
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,794

<i>Gracias.</i>

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,719
[Ishiro] You must have misheard.

155
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,193
We were out on location by the sea, yes.

156
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,354
And we saw a whale.

157
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,712
And that was it.

158
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,076
You're sure it wasn't something else?

159
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,640
Something strange?

160
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,030
Perhaps we could take a look
and see for ourselves.

161
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,230
Uh, I'm afraid the footage
was ruined during transport.

162
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,429
No, the bloke's lying.

165
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,830
Mm. Finally, something we agree on.

166
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,070
- Stay here.
- What?

167
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,277
- Where are you going?
- To find that film.

168
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,795
Oh, not if I find it first.

169
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,515
I have to go now.

170
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,115
Mr. Honda. Mr. Honda.

171
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,391
Could we trouble you for a tour?

172
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,955
Of course.

173
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,156
Please.

174
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,472
When we are on a mission,
I give the orders.

175
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,909
Whose rubbish idea was that?

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
You are lucky
I am a reformed assassin.

177
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,313
It's quite a remarkable effect.

178
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,635
If we shoot at low angles
with a wide lens,

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,756
it feels as though
we are ants in this enormous city.

180
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,990
[distant clang]

181
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,433
That is fascinating.

182
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,599
It's gotta be in his office somewhere.

183
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,550
If I was hiding something, I would
put it where no one else would look.

184
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,073
[grunts]

185
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,436
Like under a bloody bomb.

186
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,115
Genius.

187
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,920
[Mick] It'd look amazing on fire.

188
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,235
Thank you so much for the tour,
if you are ever in Burbank,

189
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,549
be sure to look us up.

190
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,296
[Gideon] I've successfully digitized
the film and it's ready for viewing.

191
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,515
Roll it, Ms. G.

192
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,190
[exhales]

193
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,478
[Sara] What is that under the water?

194
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,120
[monster screeching]

195
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,157
- Whoa.
- [chuckles]

196
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,996
Guys, I think we're gonna
need a bigger Timeship.

197
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,719
[Sara] Okay, what is it?

198
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,757
You're supposed to be
the fugitive expert.

199
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,479
Oh, well, that's no fugitive.

200
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,756
So what? It's just some
other magical monster

201
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,080
that's not supposed to be here?

202
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,993
Maybe you just haven't met this one.

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,760
Or maybe if you weren't so quick
to blame us fugitives

204
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
for everything, you'd see
the more likely scenario.

205
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,560
That creature is man-made.

206
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,632
It's probably a mutant or something

207
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,393
created by one of the countless nukes

208
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,280
you humans dropped
on the Pacific in this era.

209
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,040
Or didn't you think of that?

210
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,793
Nice try, genius, but if that were true,

211
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
we wouldn't have gotten a magic alert,

212
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,954
so why are we here?

213
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,431
Ooh, you're the time traveler,
when don't you figure it out?

214
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,597
[Sara] Okay, Gideon,

215
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,077
scan Tokyo Bay
for any unusual marine activity.

216
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,555
[Gideon] Right away, Captain.

217
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,677
[Sara] Hopefully,
Ray's having better luck.

218
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,954
- [whimsical music playing]
- Huh.

219
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,233
I had a dream like this once.

220
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,194
Maybe more than once.

221
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,871
More mead, wench.

222
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,996
As you wish.

223
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,713
[pouring drink]

224
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,110
Oh, a thousand pardons.

225
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,993
[chuckling mischievously]

226
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
- [man] Hmm.
- [sighs]

227
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,536
- Oh. [chuckles]
- [camera shutter clicking]

228
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,119
- [man] Ah.
- [sighs in frustration]

229
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,070
Palmer Tech phone? Huh, great software.

230
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,636
Terrible hardware.

231
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,350
My phone.

232
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,237
Get ye out of my sight, scoundrel.

233
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,552
[laughing]

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,229
- What are...
- Oh.

235
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,840
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

236
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,635
I need your help.

237
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,474
[both yelling]

238
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,153
Chris and Tyson, you two
get back here right now.

239
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Hi, Nate. [chuckles]

240
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,679
- Hey, Patty, this is...
- Hi, uh...

241
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,516
Ava Sharpe. [clears throat] Um...

242
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,716
Hi, Grandma.

243
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,111
That's my grandma, Violet,
do not let her rope you

244
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,669
into playing cards,
it's a lose-lose situation.

245
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,636
And there's my Uncle Rich.

246
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,634
Don't mention Obama.

247
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
[Hank] There he is.

248
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,833
- [Nate] Hey.
- Good to see you, son.

249
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,416
Glad you could make it, Director Sharpe.

250
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,238
- Thanks.
- You must be Ava.

251
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,312
- Hi. [laughing]
- Oh, hi.

252
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,757
Thank you so much
for letting me join you.

253
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,436
Oh, of course, we wouldn't want you
all alone on such a special day.

254
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,960
He's into the good stuff.

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,913
[sighs] Nate, show her around,
make her feel at home.

256
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,198
- [laughing] Wow.
- Wow.

257
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,317
[both sigh]

258
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,119
Your family seems nice.

259
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,157
Oh, it's still very early.

260
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,197
[Dorothy] Okay, everyone.

261
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,909
- The turkey is almost done.
- Wait for it.

262
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,631
Brining. [chuckling] Yeah. It just has
to sit for another hour and a half

263
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,320
and then I'm gonna pop it into the oven.

264
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,233
So that means dinner is when?

265
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,193
Mm, give or take, six hours.

266
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,960
What?

267
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,878
- [boys yelling]
- [Agent Sharpe] Oh, my God.

268
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,231
- [Patty] Tyson.
- Buckle up, Ava Sharpe.

269
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,016
- [Chris] I'm gonna tell on you.
- [sighs] It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

270
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,076
[Tyson] No!

271
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,520
[elevator bell dings]

272
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,193
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Green.

273
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,794
Hi, Mona.

274
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,998
Thanks for bringing me food
on a holiday.

275
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,753
It's literally my job.

276
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,519
Why are you working on Thanksgiving?

277
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,437
What does the Time Bureau do anyway?

278
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,117
[sighs] Oh, it's like Groundhog Day.

279
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,112
Uh, we regulate time zones.

280
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,352
So you got any plans for the big meal?

281
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,715
Heck yeah, I do.

282
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,793
My family's in LA,
so it's just me, instant ramen,

283
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,360
and Bestflix bingeing.

284
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,236
Oh, well, if you want, you could...

285
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,917
Uh, have Thanksgiving with me.

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,798
That's really sweet, Mr. Green.

287
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,599
But I don't wanna eat all your food.

288
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,754
Oh, I happen to have
ordered enough for two.

289
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,353
You're vegetarian, right?

290
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
[laughs]

291
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,989
[snoring]

292
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,154
[sniffing]

293
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,039
[growling]

294
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,719
[groaning]

295
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,872
Nora Darhk, what the bloomin' hell
are you doing here, eh?

296
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,874
I owed this guy a favor.

297
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,795
She shouldn't be here, mate,
I thought I warned you.

298
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,795
Can you help him?

299
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,878
Gideon's showing strange
marine activity in this area.

300
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,919
Fish disappearing en masse,
seismic tremors.

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,336
You need all that just to end up
back where the film was shot?

302
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Just being thorough.

303
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,151
Hm, using fancy toys
instead of your noggins, more like.

304
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,416
You know, I think I liked you
better when you were in a cage.

305
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
[Sara] All right, enough.

306
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,957
All we gotta do is draw this thing out.

307
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,157
We shrink it down and we're good to go.

308
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,913
How do you expect us to do that?

309
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,920
What, just summon it
with a friendly call?

310
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,590
"Oi, monster, come up here.
Promise it's not a trap."

311
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,519
Or feed it like that guy.

312
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,830
[grunts]

313
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,391
Isn't that our friend,
the film director?

314
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,832
- Feeding the whales, Mr. Honda?
- [gasps]

315
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,277
You, what are you doing here?

316
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,430
[Sara] You first.

317
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,795
Start talking.

318
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,758
[water gurgling]

319
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,389
[gasps]

320
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
[gasps]

321
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,789
What the hell is that?

322
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,914
It's evil.

323
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,434
Truly evil.

324
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,918
I think we found our fugitive
and it's not a monster.

325
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,395
No.

326
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,557
This is something much, much worse.

327
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,914
This, chaps, is no ordinary diary.

328
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,634
It's an agent of Brigid.

329
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,355
Brigid.

330
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,035
The Celtic goddess
of art, creation and healing.

331
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,273
This book has the power
to make the imagination

332
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,159
a reality.

333
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,870
You're not film producers, are you?

334
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,158
No, we are not, but we saw
what was on that film, Ishiro,

335
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,714
and we're here to stop it.

336
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,160
Tell us how you found the journal.

337
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,317
I was out scouting for my film.

338
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,116
- And I found this book.
- You didn't find the book,

339
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,270
it found you.

340
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,279
It's drawn to creative types.

341
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,755
[Ishiro] Once I opened it,

342
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,711
I was flooded with inspiration.

343
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,518
An image that has haunted my nightmares

344
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,316
suddenly came to life on those pages.

345
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
And then,

346
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,114
to my horror,

347
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,640
in real life.

348
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,280
I told you,

349
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,230
- this book is evil.
- Whoa, hold on a tick.

350
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,520
Brigid created this book
as a gift to you humans,

351
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,798
to bring your dreams to life,
you turned it into a weapon.

352
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,760
She's right.

353
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,076
I did create something horrible.

354
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,920
- What is this thing?
- [Ishiro] I call it Tagumo.

355
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,472
A giant land octopus.

356
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,999
Capable of destroying entire cities.

357
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,271
When I realized Tagumo had come to life,

358
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,511
I tried to destroy the journal.

359
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,558
But it always comes back.

360
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,439
Of course it does,
the power links you and this book.

361
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,232
It won't be released
until the story of your creation

362
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,879
is played out in full.

363
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,310
[Mick] How did you end it?

364
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,198
You pushed the octopus in a volcano?

365
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,475
Nope.

366
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,152
Tagumo wins.

367
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,717
Tokyo is destroyed.

368
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,029
[sighs]

369
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
[Hank] Oh, brother.

370
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
[gasps] Richard.

371
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,079
You break it, you bought it, Rich.

372
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,230
[Richard groaning]

373
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,312
Well, this is a disaster.

374
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,357
Hey, no one has killed each other, yet.

375
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,717
Chris, Tyson.

376
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,151
- Dad, have you seen the boys?
- Oh, last I saw 'em,

377
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,515
they were down in the basement.

378
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,598
Playing with Nate's old air rifle.

379
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,830
- [shot fired]
- [both gasp]

380
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,274
- [boy screaming]
- [Dorothy] Ooh!

381
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
[Chris] Mom!

382
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,080
Guess they know how to load it.

383
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,714
[Sara] Okay, if we can't stop Tagumo,

384
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,155
then draw a new ending.

385
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,074
Preferably one where no one dies.

386
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,794
[sighs] It's not working.

387
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,634
Like I said, Brigid created that book
to help artists express themselves.

388
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,816
You can't expect him to write
a happy ending

389
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,240
if he ain't had a happy life.

390
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,359
Ain't that right, Ishiro?

391
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,635
You're right.

392
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,029
Every night,

393
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,477
before this journal came to me,

394
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,153
I'd close my eyes,

395
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,560
and be back

396
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,277
in the ruins of Hiroshima.

397
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,595
Choking on ash,
wondering where all the people went.

398
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,237
Not realizing they were all around me,

399
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,640
in my hair,

400
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,120
on my clothes,

401
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,035
in my lungs.

402
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,833
They turned to dust.

403
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,272
Drawing Tagumo

404
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,510
helped me

405
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,672
turn the nightmares
into something I could understand.

406
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,120
A monster.

407
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,355
But now,

408
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,000
I am the monster.

409
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,873
Ishiro, you went through
something truly unimaginable.

410
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,879
We all deal with our pain
in different ways

411
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,155
and you chose art.

412
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,434
And that's beautiful.

413
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,794
Don't blame yourself.

414
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,914
This is not your fault.

415
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,836
[sighs]

416
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,919
So, can you save him?

417
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,439
Life force is the most potent
form of energy in the universe.

418
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,194
And you're like a battery
about to run out of charge.

419
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,399
But you already knew that, didn't you?

420
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,914
Oh, aye.

421
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,719
Then why didn't you say anything?

422
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
What?

423
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,078
And help push you off the wagon?

424
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,194
You're clean, Nora,
it's best we keep you that way.

425
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,949
You can recharge him, right?

426
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,554
You don't want me to do that, Ray.

427
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,240
Yes, I do.

428
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,277
- Otherwise, he's gonna die.
- Ray!

429
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,638
My power comes from my father.

430
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,080
It's in my blood,

431
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,216
it's always going to be calling me,
wanting me to give in

432
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,072
and be consumed, but I can't give in.

433
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
I won't.

434
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,030
[Gary] Now, this is where
we monitor timezone infractions.

435
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,430
Isn't that a little overkill?

436
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,150
Now here at the Time Bureau,
there's no such thing as overkill.

437
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,520
[creature snarling]

438
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,511
You need to come with me.
Come, come, come.

439
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,752
There's something else
amazing to see right in here.

440
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,994
- Um, why are you...
- Yeah.

441
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,390
- [Mona] Oh! Uh, Mr. Green?
- [knocking on door]

442
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,076
Hello? I think you forgot
to unlock the door.

443
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,074
I'm so fired.

444
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,115
[creatures snarling and growling]

445
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,481
Sorry to bother you but we have
a bit of a situation here.

446
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,757
<i>The prisoners are loose.</i>

447
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,036
- What? How the hell did that happen?
- [groans] Oh.

448
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,320
The tranqs must have worn off.

449
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,392
- Okay, we need to go.
- No, if we leave,

450
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,616
Hank will know something's wrong.

451
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
Something is wrong, Nate.

452
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,236
So you want our liaison to the DOD
knowing that we messed up?

453
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,357
- No, I don't.
- What do I do?

454
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,954
- Shut up, Gary.
- Shut up, Gary.

455
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,031
I got a plan. I'll be back.

456
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,998
No, your family's gonna notice
if you're gone.

457
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,560
Not if I courier back ASAP.

458
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,438
- No.
- Just stall.

459
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,473
- Stall.
- No, I don't even know...

460
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,715
[screams]

461
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,634
Hey, buddy, you okay?

462
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,136
[whispering] This is
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

463
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,799
Yeah, it's scary stuff.

464
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,673
- Yeah.
- But like I said, I have a plan,

465
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,831
so let's go get our hands
on some tranq guns.

466
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,317
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

467
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,078
- Is that a Kaupe?
- No.

468
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
[Kaupe roars]

469
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,510
[Mona screaming]

470
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,216
What the hell is she doing here?

471
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,016
She was supposed to stay
locked in the closet,

472
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,096
I was gonna flash her later.

473
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,032
- Do what?
- That didn't sound right.

474
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,190
Oh, for the love of...

475
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,676
[sighs]

476
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,919
Excellent hiding spot.

477
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,719
Yeah, well, I'm not hiding.

478
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,716
My father sacrificed himself
to give me a second chance.

479
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,756
I don't wanna ruin it
by backsliding into dark magic.

480
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,879
Who says it has to be dark?

481
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,391
John needs a magical transfusion.

482
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,511
Normally, I'd have to drain
someone's life to save his.

483
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,396
Life force is essentially energy.

484
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,433
- Right?
- Yeah.

485
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,160
Well, then I have an idea.

486
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,319
[all cheering]

487
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
[Patty] Yes.

488
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,879
Oh, Dot, you have outdone yourself.

489
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,395
I hope you all built up an appetite.

490
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,630
- [Dorothy chuckles]
- Uh...

491
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,117
Care to do the honors
this year, Nathaniel?

492
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,234
- Nathaniel?
- Oh, he's probably just in the restroom.

493
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,795
We should wait for him.

494
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,151
Mom, I'm hungry.

495
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,709
- Me, too.
- Just a little bit longer, boys.

496
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,920
Yeah, I'll go check on him.

497
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,031
Oh, wait, uh, sorry, sir.

498
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,656
You know what we would do?
[chuckles nervously] In my family,

499
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,416
we'd actually go around
and list all the things

500
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
that we're thankful for.

501
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,318
What a lovely idea.

502
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,551
I'm thankful I'm still breathing.

503
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
Well, I'll go first then.

504
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,399
Uh, I am thankful for so many things.

505
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,678
So many, many things.

506
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,514
[creatures snarling and growling]

507
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,195
I can't believe you guys
have magical creatures here,

508
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,033
this is like the coolest place ever.

509
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,790
[roaring]

510
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,910
Wait.

511
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,720
[both grunting and growling]

512
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,074
I've seen this before.

513
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,994
They're hangry. Those poor creatures
are starving to death.

514
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,710
What does a Kaupe, chupacabra
and a Baba-Yaga eat?

515
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,235
That'd be Hawaiian barbecue,
birria, and veal.

516
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,516
Babies more precisely,
but veal will do in a pinch.

517
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Really?

518
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,796
- I read a lot.
- Wow.

519
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,696
Where are we going to get
all those things on Thanksgiving?

520
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,816
- Everything's closed.
- I'm on it.

521
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,069
No, get back here.

522
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
[grunts]

523
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,040
[growling continues]

524
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,472
[sighs] Ishiro can't change the story.

525
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,195
Plan C, it is.

526
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,511
What if we got the book
to bond with another artist?

527
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,080
We could change the story altogether.

528
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,600
Do you see another artist around?

529
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,149
It's not like we can just find
some rando with a paintbrush.

530
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,754
Who knows what they could unleash?

531
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,760
And we're sure there's not
a single artist amongst us?

532
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,832
Why don't we just burn the damn thing?

533
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,080
Hey, why don't you tell
Sara you're a writer?

534
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,276
Because I'm not.

535
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,073
Rory, I read your novel,
as much as it pains me to say it,

536
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,553
you are very, very talented.

537
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,196
Well, it doesn't matter,
I can't write anymore.

538
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,109
Nothing comes out.

539
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,470
You have writer's block.

540
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,029
No, I dropped a deuce this morning.

541
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,793
- Ugh.
- [gadget beeps]

542
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Um, guys...

543
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,360
- [distant rumbling]
- [electricity buzzes]

544
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,549
What is happening?

545
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,911
The Tagumo, it's headed straight for us.

546
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,712
It's moving fast. It's getting closer.

547
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,553
- By land?
- [Zari] It's in the sewers.

548
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,756
[Ishiro] Like an octopus.

549
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,355
Tagumo can squeeze through
the tiniest opening.

550
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,550
It's coming for me.

551
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,633
We're not gonna let that happen.
Rory, Z, keep him safe.

552
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,949
Charlie, with me.

553
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,956
[rumbling]

554
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,235
[siren wailing]

555
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,551
[all screaming]

556
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,916
Well, what's the plan?

557
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,376
You distract it, I'll shrink it down.

558
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,393
What? You want me as bait?
Not bloody likely.

559
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,039
Charlie! Damn it.

560
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,315
[gadget powering up]

561
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,760
[Tagumo roaring]

00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,235

[growling]

567
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,636
Oh.

568
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,550
[grunting]

569
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,032
[screaming]

570
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,679
Get your slimy mitts off of her,
you wanker!

571
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
[growls]

572
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,510
[grunts]

573
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,076
Yeah!

574
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,595
Come on over here, you muppet,
come and get me.

575
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,439
- [growls]
- [screams]

576
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,875
[screeching]

577
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,915
Yeah! [laughs jubilantly]
Bloody brilliant!

578
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,192
Aren't you glad that I came back?
[whoops]

579
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,076
Where'd it go?

580
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,480
Sara, how's it going out there?

581
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,313
[Sara] <i>Good news, we shrank Tagumo.</i>

582
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,710
Bad news, we have no idea where it went.

583
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,596
Des...

584
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,476
Nora, don't.

585
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,016
- Don't talk, save your strength.
- No, listen to me, listen to me.

586
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,556
As smart as Ray is, he doesn't
understand what you're about to do.

587
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,152
Choosing a life of magic,
you're either all in

588
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,776
or you're not, there's no half measures.

589
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,476
And you and I both know,
it never leads to a happy ending.

590
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,513
So if you're gonna do this,

591
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,399
you don't do it for Ray,
you don't do it for me,

592
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,199
you do it for yourself, all right?

593
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,999
It's your choice.

594
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,158
It's your choice. It's your choice.

595
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,317
[Agent Sharpe] And I am thankful for
the Whole Paycheck Grocer by my work.

596
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,834
Did you know they have a full bar?

597
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,596
And I think you mentioned everything
the rest of us are thankful for.

598
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,478
So everyone please grab a plate.

599
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
[Agent Sharpe] Oh!

600
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,192
- We should say grace, right?
- [all] Grace!

601
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,798
- I'll check on Nathaniel.
- That... Just...

602
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,552
Why couldn't I just tell sober,
grounded stories

603
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,997
instead of indulging in silly monsters.

604
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,633
Sober and grounded is boring.

605
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,536
You had a story to tell and you told it,

606
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,279
you brought that monster to life.

607
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,036
Don't pretend for a second
you're not a little bit proud.

608
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,354
I was so afraid of what people
would think of my creation.

609
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,315
And now that it's here in the flesh...

610
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,394
Story complete.

611
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,277
And I no longer have to fear

612
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,310
what was locked inside my head.

613
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,436
No.

614
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,269
No, you don't.

615
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Pen.

616
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,155
[Ishiro] The ink. It's not disappearing.

617
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,435
Are you ready?

618
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,476
Yes.

619
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,114
I wanna do this.

620
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,997

Oh, what a rush.

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,719

[Agent Sharpe stammers]

633
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Come on out, son, time to eat.

634
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,856
You know, maybe we should
start without him,

635
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,280
I'm sure he'll be out soon enough.

636
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,720
Ha, look at that, maybe he went
to the store to grab some Pepto

637
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,836
for, you know...

638
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,350
I'm going to ask you this once,
Director Sharpe,

639
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,954
what are you hiding from me?

640
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,200
The prisoners have escaped, sir.

641
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,870
My son is alone with those
creatures on the loose?

642
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,917
- You take me there now.
- Sir, it's not safe.

643
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,231
My son is not safe, Director Sharpe.

644
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,471
We're going, end of discussion.

645
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,833
[creatures eating]

[creatures grunting]

647
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,393
