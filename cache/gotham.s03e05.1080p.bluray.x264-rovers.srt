1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,088
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:04,471
Who are those people
you were speaking with?

3
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:05,819
You keep your nose out of my business.

4
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,233
Now, now, Butch, play nice.

5
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:08,855
If a person comes into
contact with my blood,

6
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:10,120
it changes them.

7
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:11,555
My brother... he gets

8
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,589
in your mind, you're doomed.

9
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,591
Good-bye, Mr. Gordon.

10
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:17,585
- Ivy's missing.
- She'll turn up somewhere.

11
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,783
This time she fell.

12
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,852
It was a long way down into water.

13
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,287
Maybe she survived.

14
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,822
- What's your name?
- My name's Ivy.

15
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,256
Barnes asked me to put you on

16
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,459
a 48-hour suicide watch. I've
already signed off on it.

17
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,494
- He just cost you the election!
- Give me one reason

18
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,796
why I shouldn't let Butch
kill you where you stand.

19
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:32,864
- Oswald Cobblepot
- There's that.

20
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,299
Has won the mayor's office.

21
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,034
I believe in you, Oswald.

22
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,702
You never believed

23
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,004
I could win this election on my own.

24
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,293
Maybe you're not cut
out for this, after all.

25
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:41,340
What?!

26
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:43,441
- Jervis. Let her go now.
- No!

27
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,442
I'll never go with you!

28
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,878
No!

29
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,981
You killed her!

30
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:00,859
I would like to introduce you

31
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,527
to my chief of staff,

32
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,529
Mr. Edward Nygma.

33
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,736
Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.

34
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,072
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

35
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,840
He'll make Gotham safe again.

36
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,743
Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.

37
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,546
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

38
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,014
He'll make Gotham safe again.

39
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:27,619
Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.

40
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,021
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

41
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:45,807
Thank you so much, thank you.

42
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,393
There's something I've
been wanting to ask you.

43
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,429
Am I a good boy?

44
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,364
Have I made you proud?

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,171
I hope I'm not interrupting.

46
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,975
Oh, Ed, you never met my mother.

47
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,077
Wasn't she beautiful?

48
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,326
A fine figure of a woman.

49
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,219
She was my whole world.

50
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,689
The only one that was
always there for me.

51
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,458
Well, I believe the answer is yes.

52
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,057
She would be proud.

53
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,297
Do you really think so?

54
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,067
Oswald, look at everything
you've achieved.

55
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,302
The people love you.

56
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,071
Gangs fear you.

57
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,540
And tomorrow night, the crÃ¨me of Gotham

58
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,910
will be gathering to celebrate you.

59
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,248
What more could someone ask for?

60
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,923
Someone to share it with.

61
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,265
My mother was the
daughter of immigrants.

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,733
A humble cook.

63
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,168
We did not have much,

64
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,137
but when she was by
my side, I felt loved.

65
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,805
Protected.

66
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:31,142
As promised, I have rid Gotham
of its villainous monsters.

67
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,579
With my mother as my witness,

68
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,048
I vow to you from this day forward,

69
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,583
every man, woman,

70
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,919
and child in our great city

71
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,787
will be safe!

72
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,830
No one is safe. Not from us.

73
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,699
Drop it.

74
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,800
Put it down.

75
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,122
You will pay for this!

76
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,390
Dearly!

77
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,292
Now, now, Mr. Mayor.

78
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,794
Don't go losing your head.

79
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,330
Have a nice day.

80
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,877
I can't come over tonight.

81
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,646
Okay.

82
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,915
I mean, that'd be three nights in a row.

83
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,916
That'd almost make it a thing.

84
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,085
The neighbors might talk.

85
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,665
Exactly. And I have a dinner.

86
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,023
It's not a date.

87
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,659
None of my business.

88
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,195
Uh-huh.

89
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,866
So... whatever happened with Tetch?

90
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,534
I told you.

91
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,870
He broke his sister out of the GCPD.

92
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,038
Bullock and I chased him down.

93
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,573
She died. He escaped.

94
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,841
'Cause I heard a rumor

95
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,012
there's something
strange about her blood.

96
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,516
Do you like this?

97
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,318
I think I made that pretty clear.

98
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,219
Then why are you pressing?

99
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,520
Because I want to know.

100
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,489
Are you asking as a
reporter or as yourself?

101
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,523
Is there a difference?

102
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,425
There should be. When you were a cop,

103
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,610
did you stop being one
when you came home?

104
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,332
Maybe that was my problem.

105
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,934
Hmm.

106
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,003
The guy I'm having dinner
with is the hematologist

107
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
in charge of analyzing
Alice Tetch's blood.

108
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,343
I'm free after 10:00
if you want to call.

109
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,979
Thanks for the coffee.

110
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,258
We found the truck.

111
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,962
They ditched it in the Narrows.

112
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,364
We got forensics going over it

113
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,866
and teams doing a ten-block sweep.

114
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,802
We already found this.

115
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,036
The Red Hood Gang.

116
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,504
I thought those idiots were dead.

117
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,906
My guess is they're copying the look.

118
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,675
The original Red Hood
Gang were bank robbers.

119
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,777
Whoever they are, they
got a beef with Penguin.

120
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,113
Expand the search to 15 blocks.

121
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,348
Everything goes through you.

122
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,549
You mean through me.

123
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,589
Wow.

124
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,230
It is good to be back.

125
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,567
I have missed all of you.

126
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,670
Harvey.

127
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,495
Still a stranger to a
haircut and a shave, I see.

128
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,241
What are you doing here, Nygma?

129
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,076
As Mayor Cobblepot's chief of staff,

130
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,845
I'm gonna be your liaison on
the Red Hood investigation.

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,147
I want to see all reports.

132
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,049
I'm gonna need access
to your forensic lab.

133
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,718
You think I'm gonna just let
you waltz into my precinct?

134
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,154
You're a cop killer who should be

135
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,155
in the loony bin.

136
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,158
- I'll be damned...
- You'll be fired.

137
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,694
The mayor can't fire me.

138
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,029
No, but he can appoint

139
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,798
a police commissioner who will.

140
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,968
So... you will carry out

141
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,003
the mayor's orders without question

142
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,605
or the GCPD has a new captain.

143
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,739
How does that sound?

144
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,319
Every dog has his day, Nygma.

145
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,880
Enjoy yours.

146
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,086
And where is our lord mayor?

147
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,888
Hiding under his desk?

148
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,358
He's meeting with constituents.

149
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,664
"Anything for you, my
little Cobble Pot."

150
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,301
"You can count on me."

151
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,540
Those were the words my
mother used to whisper to me

152
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,875
every night before I fell asleep.

153
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,444
She was a saint.

154
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,179
Yes.

155
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,481
A saint whose only desire was

156
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,783
to love me.

157
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,852
And what was her thanks?

158
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,422
Not only did she take
a knife in the back...

159
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,660
but even in her death, her
memory is being desecrated.

160
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,695
Seriously?

161
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,397
This is the reason we're here?

162
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,932
A little glue.

163
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,033
Some paint.

164
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,134
Mama will be good as new, eh?

165
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,070
No!

166
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,368
That is not the reason you are here.

167
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,443
The Red Hoods have
challenged my authority.

168
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,678
They will be made an example of.

169
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,413
Tonight,

170
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,348
I am celebrating my historic victory...

171
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,250
At the Sirens.

172
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,052
It's gonna be fabulous.

173
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,787
None of you are invited.

174
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,858
I want them found and
their leader's head

175
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,527
brought to me on a
spike before nightfall.

176
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,997
What are you waiting for?!

177
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,699
Find them!

178
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,638
All right, five-card draw, gentlemen.

179
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,007
All right, someone didn't ante up.

180
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,476
Come on, you cheap bastards.

181
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,548
How long are we supposed to wait?

182
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,717
Long as it takes the
boss man to get here.

183
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,718
You need a lookout.

184
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,556
Uh, relax, fellas.

185
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,625
Hey, uh, you want us
to deal you in, boss?

186
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,195
We don't have time for games, boys.

187
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,230
We got work to do.

188
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:38,919
Hello, Jim.

189
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,055
Is it a bad time? I should've called.

190
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,857
No.

191
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,560
Please, come in.

192
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,935
Can I get you something to drink?

193
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,005
- A... glass of water?
- I'm fine.

194
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,306
I heard you were back.

195
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:01,809
I've been meaning to come see you.

196
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:04,044
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

197
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,312
Alfred and I are both well.

198
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,883
I hear you're a private
investigator now.

199
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,352
I'd like to hire you.

200
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:13,454
Uh, Bruce, if this is about corruption

201
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,189
at Wayne Enterprises... It's not.

202
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:18,518
I've put my investigation into
my father's company aside.

203
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:20,194
It's time I moved on.

204
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:21,628
Why the sudden change of heart?

205
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:22,996
It's far from sudden.

206
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:25,132
I've given it a great deal of thought.

207
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,935
I can't live my life
if I keep looking back.

208
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,605
For what it's worth,
I think that's wise.

209
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,940
So, what can I do for you?

210
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,875
Ivy Pepper's gone missing.

211
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,177
I didn't realize you two were close.

212
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:39,713
We're not, she's a friend of Selina's.

213
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:42,118
And does Selina know you're doing this?

214
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:43,150
No.

215
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,519
I don't want to get her hopes
up if we don't find anything.

216
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:50,657
Well, we'll start with the GCPD.

217
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,459
See where we go from there.

218
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:55,829
I think it's chivalrous,
you doing this for Selina.

219
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,264
How long have you two been a thing?

220
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,199
Oh, no, no, no.

221
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,668
- Selina's a friend, that's all.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

222
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:02,903
No, really, she's just a friend.

223
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:05,906
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:08,208
Mr. Fox,

225
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:09,510
just the man I've been wanting to see.

226
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,212
Oh, joy. Mr. Nygma.

227
00:11:12,248 --> 00:11:13,580
Heard you were stopping by.

228
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:16,016
I have questions.

229
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,218
- Hopefully, you have answers.
- Or what?

230
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,586
You'll poison me with gas?

231
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,756
That gas was a sleeping agent.

232
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:26,026
And to be fair, I was not in
the best place in my life.

233
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,963
To be fair,

234
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,231
if you ever threaten my life

235
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,534
or the life of Bruce Wayne again,

236
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,102
I will find a way to end you.

237
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,504
Mr. Fox, we both know you're
not a man of violence.

238
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,772
No, I am not.

239
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:42,009
If I was, I would've laced
some piece of lab equipment,

240
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:45,112
one which you were sure
to touch, with a toxin.

241
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:46,413
Ricin, maybe.

242
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:48,782
I'd use Saxitoxin. Harder to trace.

243
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:50,617
But I like your style.

244
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:51,919
You are insane.

245
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:53,287
Was insane.

246
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:54,920
I have a certificate.

247
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:58,425
- So, the Red Hoods?
- See for yourself.

248
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,970
The gang's getaway vehicle
was abandoned in the Narrows.

249
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:11,104
As you'll notice,

250
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,075
its carpet fibers has
elements of dirt, oil,

251
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,511
and, oddly, potassium chloride.

252
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,747
A halide salt.

253
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:24,751
Fascinating.

254
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,019
So nothing on Ivy Pepper,

255
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:29,022
but an odd report came
in a few weeks ago, okay?

256
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:30,991
A construction worker claimed

257
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:34,228
that a redhead knocked
him out, robbed him,

258
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:35,829
and she left this.

259
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:37,831
That's Ivy's sweater.

260
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,333
How do we find this man?

261
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:41,235
I already called, all
right? The guy's down south

262
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,170
on a job, but he swore up and down

263
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,304
that the redhead who rolled him...

264
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,974
- was in her 20s.
- So?

265
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:49,009
He's probably covering for
being with a young girl.

266
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:52,045
Doubtful he would come
forward in the first place.

267
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:54,147
Yeah, most pervs don't want to
call attention to themselves.

268
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:56,383
So it wasn't Ivy.

269
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:58,252
It seems unlikely, but why
would she have Ivy's sweater?

270
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,020
Dr. Thompkins.

271
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,189
Bruce, it's good to see you again.

272
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:03,323
You got taller.

273
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,893
Like I said, right? The
kid's growing like a weed.

274
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:07,361
Nice to see you, too.

275
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:10,097
Uh, Jim, could I have a word?

276
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:14,434
Wanted you to hear it from me, um,

277
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,203
my engagement announcement is coming out

278
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:17,337
in The Gazette tomorrow.

279
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,274
And it will feature Mario's name.

280
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:23,410
I think that's customary.

281
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:25,546
His family name.

282
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:26,613
You mean Falcone.

283
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,448
You knew?

284
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,450
You knew and you didn't say anything?

285
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:31,451
Sure I did.

286
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:32,753
I said congratulations.

287
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:34,788
- Don't be cute.
- Lee.

288
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:36,890
People talk.

289
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:39,560
Was I surprised? Sure.

290
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,961
But it's also none of my business.

291
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:42,896
Your life is your life.

292
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:44,731
And I meant what I said.

293
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,300
Very happy for you.

294
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,369
So, that's it?

295
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:51,972
That's it.

296
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:58,779
Okay, um, well, I just...
wanted to tell you.

297
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,358
Dr. Thompkins.

298
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:16,129
I had heard that you were back.

299
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:17,744
I'm so glad...

300
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:22,803
That's for Kristen.

301
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:24,838
You shouldn't have done that. Or what?

302
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:27,140
I'm supposed to be scared of you
because you work for Penguin?

303
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:30,611
My fiancé's father is Carmine Falcone.

304
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:32,479
I so much as whisper to him,

305
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:34,982
and you disappear.

306
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:39,453
Tell the mayor, whatever I can
do as M.E., I'm happy to help.

307
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,996
It's bad enough we're
throwing Penguin's party.

308
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:50,163
It's good for the club.

309
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,832
Now we're his errand girls?

310
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:54,901
Sweetie, we find the
Red Hoods, he'll owe us.

311
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,337
We can ask for a favor,
say him not killing you?

312
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,172
Well, it would be nice not
to have to watch my ass

313
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,208
all the time.

314
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:05,379
Well, well.

315
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:07,047
Who do we have here?

316
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:09,149
Guy calls himself the Ballistic Bomber.

317
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:11,518
My contact at the Merc saw him buying

318
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:13,086
- smoke grenades last week.
- Ooh.

319
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:15,455
Just like the ones the
Red Hoods used on Penguin.

320
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,090
Groovy.

321
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,125
Reckon he'll talk?

322
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,394
Of course.

323
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:22,496
No!

324
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,264
Maybe give him a moment.

325
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,499
Now remember, kids,

326
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:28,168
you tell the press this
is all Penguin's fault.

327
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,506
- Good.
- Yes, sir.

328
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,807
Light it up.

329
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,543
- Oh, mercy.
- Please. No, no.

330
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:38,378
Better run, Sister,

331
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:39,379
'fore the Padre goes boom.

332
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,381
Lord Jesus!

333
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,150
Don't!

334
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:45,719
Wait, wait! The grenade is slipping!

335
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:50,490
Seriously, a priest?

336
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:52,125
You should've seen it.

337
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,427
Ka-boom!

338
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:55,395
But you told 'em what to say?

339
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:58,065
- This is all because of Penguin?
- Yeah, boss, but I don't get it.

340
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,600
You want to take out
Penguin, let's take him out.

341
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:02,069
This Red Hood stuff is fun,

342
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,270
but it's a lot of work.

343
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:04,571
How about you just do what I tell you?

344
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:10,377
Now, I got you these

345
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:13,413
so you'll blend in at the party tonight.

346
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:14,481
Huh? Huh?

347
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,850
Nice suit.

348
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:19,419
And that's when we kill him?

349
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,554
No!

350
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:22,556
No one kills Penguin.

351
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,557
You should.

352
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:25,759
'Cause he's going to murder you.

353
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:32,132
Time to have a heart-to-heart, Butch.

354
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,501
Alone.

355
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,416
You don't have to buy lunch.

356
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:49,419
I know you're a billionaire,
but I can buy you a sandwich.

357
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:52,556
Do you miss it?

358
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,057
Being a cop?

359
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:55,659
Sometimes, yeah.

360
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:58,328
Gave a sense of mission.

361
00:16:58,364 --> 00:16:59,496
True.

362
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,849
There's more to life
than having a mission.

363
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:08,205
Look, I'll keep asking
around about Ivy, but, uh...

364
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,741
you want my advice,

365
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,276
talk to Selina.

366
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,512
Tell her how you feel.

367
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:20,584
Does that actually work?

368
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,785
Sometimes.

369
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,954
It's definitely better
than being silent.

370
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:26,189
Before you know it, the moment passes.

371
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:29,726
And are you taking your own advice?

372
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:31,295
Afraid that ship has sailed.

373
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,562
I'm not talking about Dr. Thompkins,

374
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:34,031
I'm talking about the
woman you're seeing now.

375
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,365
Excuse me?

376
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,868
There was lipstick on a
coffee mug on your table.

377
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:40,570
You've become quite the detective.

378
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:43,407
So, are you?

379
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:46,276
It's complicated.

380
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:49,646
- So is Selina.
- That I believe.

381
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:55,519
I just wish sometimes...

382
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:57,621
I had a sign.

383
00:17:57,656 --> 00:17:59,589
Unfortunately, life doesn't
usually work that way.

384
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,757
We're hours away

385
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:03,927
from Mayor Cobblepot's
victory celebration.

386
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:05,996
But people are asking,
will the Red Hood Gang

387
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,664
put a damper on the festivities?

388
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,167
Sounds like Penguin's having a bad day.

389
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:12,569
I'm supposed to go to his party tonight.

390
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:14,438
Part of my re-engagement
with being a Wayne.

391
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:15,906
Mm.

392
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:17,817
Well, give the mayor my best.

393
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:21,244
Witnesses say the Red Hoods
blamed Cobblepot for their ac...

394
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,518
Someone is testing me, Ed.

395
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,387
They're thinking, "Oh, he's mayor now.

396
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,988
He has to play by different rules."

397
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:34,191
No, they'll see,

398
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:36,326
when I'm roasting their
entrails over a fire.

399
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:38,795
Perhaps I'm thinking
about this all wrong.

400
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,430
Perhaps this is not about you at all.

401
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,632
What if this is about the statue?

402
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,000
Of course it's about me!

403
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,335
Yes, you're probably right. Oh, dear.

404
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:48,338
- Wonderful.
- Oswald.

405
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:49,406
Take a breath.

406
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:53,877
What are you doing?

407
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:55,712
It's an old trick I learned in the lab.

408
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,835
Most solvents have as their base...

409
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:02,018
I am the son of water,

410
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:03,487
but if water touches me, I die.

411
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:05,122
- What am I?
- Again with the riddles.

412
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,990
Salt. Most people think
of it as a food additive,

413
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:09,559
but potassium salt is
found in detergents,

414
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,496
- soaps...
- What is your point, Ed?

415
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:15,365
I know where the Red Hoods are.

416
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,968
I say we give him to Penguin.

417
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:20,170
Knowing Penguin will
gut him like a fish.

418
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:21,805
Ladies, come on.

419
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,641
- After all we've been through...
- It's his life for yours.

420
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:25,876
Simple.

421
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:28,145
I don't get it.

422
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,646
Why'd you turn on him now?

423
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:31,047
I wasn't gonna hurt Penguin.

424
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,083
Honest.

425
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,051
I was gonna take down
the Red Hoods myself.

426
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:37,384
Tonight. At the party.

427
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,222
All this so you could play the hero?

428
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:42,692
Ever since Nygma got out of Arkham,

429
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:44,694
Penguin treats me like I'm nothing.

430
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,497
That pencil-neck's
trying to push me out.

431
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,266
Let me ask you, we
figured out you're the man

432
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:51,067
behind the Red Hoods, how
long do you think it'll take

433
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:52,103
Penguin and his lap dog?

434
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,806
It's your life, baby.

435
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:58,642
You make the call.

436
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:03,580
Let me see this through.

437
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,916
I get my place beside Penguin back,

438
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:07,784
I'll protect you.

439
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:11,955
Oh, you'll do more than that.

440
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,400
You'll owe me.

441
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,860
And one day, I'm gonna collect.

442
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:20,430
Gilzean.

443
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:21,932
Butch, where are you?

444
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,400
The Red Hood Gang is
at a detergent factory

445
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:26,136
in the Narrows. We're on our way.

446
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:27,504
I got to go.

447
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:31,741
Get your things.

448
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,743
We're done. I'm breaking up the band.

449
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:37,214
I'm serious, go! Get out of Dodge.

450
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,806
Yeah, well, not for nothing,
but you promised us a payday.

451
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,552
We're not leaving till we get it.

452
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:59,002
Well, I guess it was gonna
happen sooner or later.

453
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:00,707
What?

454
00:21:03,141 --> 00:21:04,841
Sorry, boys.

455
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,291
I did it, boss.

456
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:23,560
I got 'em for you.

457
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,979
Peace and order have
once again been restored

458
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,571
to Gotham.

459
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:41,460
The Red Hood Gang is no more.

460
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:46,371
My very own man, Butch Gilzean,

461
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:49,865
risked life and limb to
face down the bandits.

462
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,136
Was your life ever in danger, Butch?

463
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:56,939
I can honestly say that
if I'd have hesitated,

464
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:58,740
I'd have been a goner.

465
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,284
All right, people, listen up!

466
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,453
It's happy hour...
Finish up those reports

467
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:13,369
and let's call it a day!

468
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:22,597
Hey, uh... Ed.

469
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,566
Even before you went crazy,

470
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:25,634
I never liked you.

471
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:26,702
Your zipper's down.

472
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:30,939
Listen, Butch did us all a favor.

473
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,208
Red Hoods go bye-bye, case closed.

474
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:35,010
Look at the way the bodies fell.

475
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:37,279
It's as if they were just standing
there, waiting to be killed.

476
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,780
Butch comes all the way in the room,

477
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,749
but only one man pulled out a gun.

478
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:42,150
I guess they weren't threatened.

479
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,686
By a 300-pound gorilla?

480
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:47,289
Whose side are you on, anyway, hmm?

481
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,292
No one's losing sleep over
a bunch of dead crooks,

482
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,828
least of all me.

483
00:22:52,863 --> 00:22:54,529
I said wrap it up!

484
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:03,238
What have we here?

485
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:18,186
Burning the midnight oil?

486
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:20,989
I was just finishing up.

487
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,291
I'm guessing you're
here to reprimand me.

488
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:26,461
Reprimand you? For what?

489
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:28,397
Punching Nygma in the jaw.

490
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,499
I just couldn't help myself.

491
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,067
First I'm hearing of it.

492
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,237
Well done, Doctor.

493
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:40,142
Actually, I'm here to ask about, uh...

494
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:42,477
Alice Tetch's blood, if
you've heard anything.

495
00:23:42,513 --> 00:23:44,346
As it happens, I just received

496
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,515
the preliminary results
back from the lab.

497
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,351
- Fascinating.
- What is?

498
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,887
They injected samples
into a group of rats.

499
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:53,522
After three days, two of the rats

500
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,324
were showing marked increases
in strength and stamina.

501
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,326
Oh? That doesn't sound so bad.

502
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,929
But the study ended after one of
the rats killed all the others.

503
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:03,432
I'm guessing that's not normal.

504
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,667
It chewed through a dozen wire cages

505
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:07,936
to get at them... no.

506
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:13,341
Well, why would one
of the rats go psycho

507
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:14,709
and not the others?

508
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,178
Perhaps the others hadn't had a chance

509
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:18,747
to show any symptoms,
or they were immune.

510
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:21,016
Some people live with
a disease for years

511
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:23,218
without having any adverse effects.

512
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,454
The lab is starting a new study now.

513
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:28,890
Well, keep me informed.

514
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:33,862
Oh, and, uh... don't stay too late.

515
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:35,430
I'm sure that fiancé of yours

516
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:37,299
would like to see you once in a while.

517
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:39,468
And was the captain of the GCPD invited

518
00:24:39,503 --> 00:24:41,903
to our new mayor's victory party?

519
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,439
You know, I lost my invitation.

520
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:52,426
I can feel it.

521
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:07,896
Heard you took down the Red Hood Gang

522
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:09,998
single-handed.

523
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,433
So to speak.

524
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,135
- Very funny.
- Don't forget,

525
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,003
you owe me.

526
00:25:20,944 --> 00:25:22,144
I know.

527
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:26,848
How long do we have to stay?

528
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:28,250
As long as it takes for you to be seen

529
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:30,252
in the world, Master Bruce...

530
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:32,320
being Bruce Wayne.

531
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,189
And smiling.

532
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:37,492
So this is our life now?

533
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:40,162
Fake smiles and mingling.

534
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:42,030
I miss the old days.

535
00:25:48,972 --> 00:25:50,605
- So nice.
- Oh, excuse me.

536
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:51,806
Yes.

537
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,775
Bruce, Mr. Pennyworth,

538
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,477
I'm so pleased you made it.

539
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,478
Yeah, well, you know, we're trying to

540
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,146
get out a bit more, Mr. Mayor.

541
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,182
Oswald, please.

542
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:02,217
We never got the chance to thank you

543
00:26:02,252 --> 00:26:04,219
for saving our lives from the ex-mayor.

544
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:06,988
Not at all.

545
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,790
I find it very fortuitous
you turned up when you did

546
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:10,425
with that bazooka.

547
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:13,995
I just felt a bit sorry
for Stan, the gardener,

548
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,295
'cause he was picking up
bits of Galavan for weeks.

549
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,471
And now here you are, the new mayor.

550
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,507
Sometimes life has a way of working out.

551
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,742
Yes, that's true.

552
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,081
What is it, Master Bruce?

553
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:36,218
A sign.

554
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:37,686
Please excuse me.

555
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:42,190
Right, well, I'll just
go and wet my beak.

556
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:45,093
Congratulations again, Mr. Mayor.

557
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,866
- Hey!
- Hey yourself.

558
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,007
Funny, I never realized
how short you were.

559
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:01,517
Who the hell are you?

560
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:05,347
Not yet. This is too fun.

561
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:06,848
Run along, little kitty.

562
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:10,151
Go steal some more wallets.

563
00:27:10,187 --> 00:27:11,386
Hey.

564
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,091
So sweet.

565
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:18,293
There he is, the man of the hour.

566
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:19,594
I have a surprise for you, Butch.

567
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,229
Not in the mood.

568
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:26,101
What's in the box?

569
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:28,003
Open it.

570
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,310
Thanks.

571
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:38,046
- I already got one.
- Oh, of course you do.

572
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:39,381
And you certainly
wouldn't need this one,

573
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,883
as it's so similar to your
very own pocket square.

574
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:43,385
This is from the Red Hood crime scene.

575
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,754
It turns out that your suit

576
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,788
and the Red Hood suits were all made

577
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:48,590
by the same tailor, Mr. Fuji.

578
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,092
That's some coincidence.

579
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,427
I thought so myself.

580
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,562
Which is why I called
Mr. Fuji, and he said

581
00:27:54,598 --> 00:27:55,997
that a large man with a metal hand...

582
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,065
Not many of those running around...

583
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,566
Bought all six of the suits,

584
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:01,369
which means, ta-da, you're
the architect of the Red...

585
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,741
I should snap your neck right now.

586
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,945
You haven't heard my offer.

587
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:17,752
We kill Penguin together.

588
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:21,022
What are you talking about?

589
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:23,692
- You're his guy.
- Oh, please. You fell for that act?

590
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:24,993
Yes, he broke me out of Arkham...

591
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:26,461
Very appreciative...

592
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,296
But I was not cut out to be number two.

593
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,798
I've simply been waiting for my moment,

594
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,367
which you have graciously provided.

595
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:37,238
How would you like to
run Gotham with me?

596
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:43,678
The two of us... working together?

597
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:45,880
You have proven yourself far
more cunning than I imagined.

598
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,649
Now, I assume this little drama of yours

599
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,117
was meant to climax tonight.

600
00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:53,988
So put on the hood, kill Penguin...

601
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,957
I'll help you escape.

602
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:58,026
Tomorrow we divide up the city.

603
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:02,364
You'd really turn on him,

604
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,499
after all he did for you?

605
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,336
In a heartbeat.

606
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:14,976
No.

607
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:17,412
Okay.

608
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:20,281
Then I guess it's time
for surprise number two.

609
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:27,756
- You got to Zsasz?
- I got to Zsasz.

610
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,193
And he got to Tabitha.

611
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,928
Penguin's history.

612
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:37,632
The question is, are you?

613
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:53,477
Can I see your invitation?

614
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:55,804
What are you doing here?

615
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,073
- I was invited.
- Of course you were.

616
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,010
You recognize her?

617
00:30:03,224 --> 00:30:04,790
Should I?

618
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:07,082
I don't know.

619
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:11,086
Hey, are you, you...

620
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:13,908
- I'm me.
- Uh-huh.

621
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:16,392
Well, I'm working, so...

622
00:30:16,427 --> 00:30:19,172
Actually, there was something
I wanted to tell you.

623
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:21,297
Could we go somewhere more private?

624
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:26,502
Fine, but make it quick.

625
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:35,611
I can't believe you'd
turn on Oswald, too.

626
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:38,781
Uh, hello. Pot, kettle, black.

627
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:41,817
No, it's not the same thing. You...

628
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:43,819
Never mind.

629
00:30:43,854 --> 00:30:45,454
I swear, your goons hurt Tabitha,

630
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:46,655
so help me...

631
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:49,725
Just do your job.

632
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,527
Oh...

633
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:53,963
showtime.

634
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:55,497
Put on in the mayor

635
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:57,600
before I put one in Tabitha.

636
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:02,738
Ladies, gentlemen,

637
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:04,707
welcome to The Sirens.

638
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:07,076
Tonight we're here to celebrate

639
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:10,045
the Honorable Mayor Cobblepot.

640
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:11,947
Our savior from the monsters,

641
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:14,683
and the captain of our fair city.

642
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:17,653
And now, the mayor would
like to say a few words.

643
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:20,623
Ed, where've you been?

644
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:21,824
I've been looking for you all evening.

645
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:23,025
Oh, just tying up loose ends.

646
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,327
I just wanted to say...

647
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:26,762
good luck.

648
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,864
Okay. Thank you.

649
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,405
Thank you.

650
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:43,212
Hmm.

651
00:31:43,247 --> 00:31:47,783
Tonight is a celebration,
not of my victory,

652
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:49,652
but of Gotham's.

653
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:50,719
This is a new day!

654
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,295
I wouldn't celebrate yet, Mr. Mayor.

655
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:01,797
Red Hoods ain't finished yet.

656
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:03,032
Ed!

657
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,366
- What are you doing?!
- Wait!

658
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:05,734
Sorry, boss.

659
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,870
Butch?!

660
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:14,576
- Huh?
- Oops.

661
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:22,384
The mayor...

662
00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:26,088
our mayor... vowed that all

663
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:28,057
of the Red Hoods would be destroyed.

664
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:29,925
And now we have the
real leader caught...

665
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,034
red... handed.

666
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:39,168
You really thought I'd
give you real bullets?

667
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:41,470
You are an idiot!

668
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:46,398
I will kill you for this!

669
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,080
Sounds like we're missing all the fun.

670
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:52,681
Got plenty of fun left for you.

671
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:56,018
You know, if you're gonna take
a girl hostage in her own place,

672
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:57,419
you might want to search it first.

673
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,931
After all that I've done for you!

674
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:12,401
- I gave you a job!
- I gave you everything!

675
00:33:12,436 --> 00:33:15,404
I used to be somebody in this town,

676
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,706
then you and that sniveling
little son of a...

677
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:22,177
Shut up!

678
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:29,885
I am shocked...

679
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,653
and grieved...

680
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:35,924
that one of my dearest
friends has betrayed me.

681
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:40,763
But let it be known
that Oswald Cobblepot

682
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:43,966
will prosecute anyone
who threatens Gotham!

683
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:45,267
Hear, hear!

684
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:47,303
Yeah!

685
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:50,339
Upsy-daisy.

686
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,643
Oh, my God.

687
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:57,813
Showtime.

688
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:04,353
Oswald, move.

689
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:08,323
I am gonna enjoy this.

690
00:34:11,195 --> 00:34:13,595
Best... party... ever.

691
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,598
Wait.

692
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,000
- Not now.
- Ed!

693
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:21,503
Ed!

694
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
Ed!

695
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:25,974
Ed!

696
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,310
Oh!

697
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:41,279
So, what's up?

698
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:44,382
I hired Jim Gordon to
help me locate Ivy.

699
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,951
And?

700
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:48,820
There was a redhead
that had her sweater,

701
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:50,622
but it wasn't Ivy.

702
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:55,393
Saying it out loud, I realize,
doesn't sound that impressive.

703
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,661
No, it doesn't.

704
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:58,863
That's really why you
brought me up here?

705
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:04,169
You are the real Bruce...

706
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:06,427
'cause nobody else would be this boring.

707
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,866
- Great work, detective.
- That's not all.

708
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:17,382
We've been friends a long time, Selina.

709
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,416
And ever since you've known me,

710
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:19,951
I've been dedicated to one thing,

711
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:21,719
but that's done.

712
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,254
I don't know what's next, but I know...

713
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,990
Would you, please...
just say what you mean?

714
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:27,158
I like you...

715
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:30,929
as more than a friend.

716
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:38,036
It would be nice if you
said something back.

717
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:42,583
How many girls have you dated?

718
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:44,518
What do you mean?

719
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:46,320
It's not a trick question.

720
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,821
How many girls have you dated?

721
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:50,190
- None.
- None. Hmm.

722
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:52,192
Have you ever thought that maybe

723
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:53,560
you only like me because

724
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:55,195
I'm literally the only girl you know?

725
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,030
That's not true. I feel something.

726
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:59,066
And I know you do, too. We're the same.

727
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:00,901
In what universe are we the same?

728
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:02,703
- The money doesn't matter.
- Try not having it.

729
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:04,872
It matters.

730
00:36:10,012 --> 00:36:12,367
There's something between us.

731
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:14,715
I know there is.

732
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,117
You have to see that.

733
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:21,021
Rule one.

734
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:23,757
Don't ever tell me

735
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,392
what I have to do.

736
00:36:34,537 --> 00:36:37,137
So, you do have feelings for me?

737
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:40,332
- I'm confused.
- Good.

738
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,652
Come on, just tell me.

739
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:54,888
I got all dressed up.
I even put on lipstick.

740
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:56,223
I could lose my job.

741
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,758
What are you offering?

742
00:36:57,793 --> 00:37:00,160
Fine, then I'll say something.

743
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:02,963
If I'm right, you just nod.

744
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:06,400
You ran tests on Alice Tetch's blood.

745
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,935
You found something in her blood.

746
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,572
A virus, or infection or something.

747
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,469
Do I have to go over the rules again?

748
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:16,310
Let's have new rules, sweetie.

749
00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:19,580
I'll tell you what we're
doing with Alice Tetch's blood

750
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,181
and in return...

751
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:22,349
you...

752
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:23,851
O...kay.

753
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:27,054
Excuse me?

754
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:29,189
What are you doing?

755
00:37:30,492 --> 00:37:33,427
Two whiskeys and a pineapple
juice for this guy.

756
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:34,828
What's going on?

757
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:37,331
- To go.
- What's going on?

758
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:40,701
I think you were just leaving.

759
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:45,439
Forget this.

760
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,174
Trust me. I'm gonna try.

761
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:54,047
What are you doing here?

762
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,749
Just walking by.

763
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:57,017
Saw you through the window.

764
00:37:57,052 --> 00:37:59,286
- Took it as a sign.
- Like hell.

765
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,121
You tracked me here.

766
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:03,056
And for the record,

767
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:04,591
I could've gotten what I wanted

768
00:38:04,627 --> 00:38:06,893
from that creep without
compromising my honor.

769
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:08,762
I know...

770
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:09,997
but you don't have to.

771
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:12,966
I'll tell you what you want to know.

772
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:17,545
I thought you wanted to keep the
woman and the reporter separate.

773
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,066
- Is that an option?
- No.

774
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:21,980
Well, then.

775
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:28,229
You are gonna have to
buy me dinner, though.

776
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,331
What's good here?

777
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:42,977
It's ginger tea with honey.

778
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:45,815
It's my mother's remedy
for a sore throat.

779
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:49,717
You sure you don't need a doctor?

780
00:38:49,753 --> 00:38:51,686
No, I'm fine.

781
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:54,522
I still don't understand

782
00:38:54,558 --> 00:38:56,493
why you didn't tell me
what you were doing.

783
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:02,003
Your shock when seeing
Butch had to be genuine.

784
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,200
The people had to believe it...

785
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:06,267
and they did.

786
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,236
And once again, you're the city's hero.

787
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:12,574
But you were almost killed.

788
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:15,543
And you saved me... again.

789
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,335
I hope you know, Oswald...

790
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:25,186
I would do anything for you.

791
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:29,791
You can always count on me.

792
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,200
Thank you.

793
00:39:55,118 --> 00:39:56,484
Need a hand, kitten?

794
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,087
I got it.

795
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,670
Hold on, Butch.

796
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:27,682
Sir, the ambulance carrying
Butch Gilzean was just hijacked.

797
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,083
Damn it!

798
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,418
Put out a BOLO.

799
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:32,086
I'll call the mayor.

800
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,770
Oh, yes.

801
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:54,842
M-M-Mister, please.

802
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:56,444
Shh.

803
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,649
My dear, sweet sister.

804
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:03,451
Just look...

805
00:41:03,486 --> 00:41:06,120
at what he did to you.

806
00:41:06,156 --> 00:41:08,556
He took you from me!

807
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:12,961
We belonged... together!

808
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,030
And he killed you.

809
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:19,567
But, mister, I-I'm not dead.

810
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:25,707
If only that were true.

811
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:44,425
Those who hurt you...

812
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:47,495
will feel my pain...

813
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:53,325
when my sweet and terrible vengeance

814
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,937
upon them rains.
