162
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,507
Uh, victim's name is Daniel Burge.

163
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,509
Not exactly a boy scout,

164
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,470
but managed to
buy this garage two years ago.

165
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,182
It looks like he was dipped in a volcano.

Oh, yeah.

167
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,563
Actually, the depth and uniformity
of the burn pattern

168
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,481
is something you would see if the body was

169
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,860
covered in something like lava
but with a lower burn temp.

170
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
And an added chemical characteristic.

171
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,949
The fire investigator didn't find
a secondary accelerant.

172
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,117
Yeah, he probably wouldn't, with a meta.

After his head went through

He wrapped his car around a tree
at a 110 miles per hour.

220
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,092
They were all street racers, Dad,
and Wally could be the next one.

00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,554
What do you want me to do, Iris,
lock him up?

Or stop the races.

I confronted him about the races,

it didn't go so well, remember?

Stanley, as it turns out,
is a suspected hitman

313
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,470
that the C.C.P.D.
has been trying to track for a while.

314
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,222
But they haven't been able to
make anything stick.

315
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,557
-(GIGGLES)
-No pun intended.

316
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,476
Do we know why he was attacked?

317
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,646
(SIGHS) Stanley wouldn't answer any of my
questions. He was pretty scared.

318
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,814
When a hitman is scared,
you know something's wrong.

319
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,566
Hey, did you get an ID on our meta-human?

320
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,901
Yeah, I'm running it through

321
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,237
five different facial-recognition systems
right now.

322
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,488
So, it should take a minute.

{\an8}And there it is. Who's the best hacker
in the world, people?

324
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,411
-Felicity Smoak.
-Felicity Smoak.

325
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,704
What is wrong with you two?
That's not friendship.

Oh, he looks friendly.

328
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,171
Monteleone was reported missing...

329
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,549
Surprise, surprise, the night of the
particle accelerator explosion.

330
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,593
And what's the connection between
Monteleone and the two victims?

331
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,805
I'll call Joe, have him run
background checks on all three guys.

332
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,682
Okay, I'm gonna run some tests
on the tar sample,

333
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,434

Hey. You feeling okay?

336
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,776
Yeah. Why?

337
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,944
You're going slower than normal.

338
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,030
You clocked in at 1415 miles an hour.

339
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,698
I'm sorry. How fast do I usually run?

340
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,575
1500. Are you getting enough to eat?

341
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:16,702
Yes! Yeah, dude. I'm fine. Seriously.

342
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,204
The difference seems negligible.

343
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,913
Fast is fast, right?

344
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,375
-See ya.
-Yeah.

who was hanging around Tail Lights.

me another way to make five grand a night,

355
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,081
it ain't gonna happen.

356
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,420
Here's a preview of the expose
that I am writing.

357
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,046
You are the star of the piece.

358
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,300
I had a little chat with
some of your previous associates

359
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,594
and dug up some revealing details
about you.

360
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,805
Like the gambling rings you run
or the thefts you've been involved with.

361
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,226
I'm sure the C.C.P.D.
will be interested in this one.

362
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,978
You're forgetting something in here.

363
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,274
Aggravated assault.

364

You think you're the only one
that can play this game?

365
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,238
I can find out where you live,

366
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,907
what you eat, when you sleep...

367
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:39,451
Every little detail about your life.

Mmm.

00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,466
This entire conversation is being recorded
and sent to CCPN.

lay a hand on me,

to the cops immediately.

Get out of my office.

375
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,986
You got a death wish?

376
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,739
You are not the first person to
accuse me of that, so maybe.

377
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,659
Going down there? Threatening them?

378
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,619
These people, Iris, they live in the dark.

379
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,954
They're cockroaches.

380
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,831
Except they don't scatter
when someone turns on the lights.

381
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,040
They're looking to bite.

382
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,001
If they are so dangerous, Wally,
then why are you in so deep with them?

383
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,712
I'm not.

384
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,046
I can stop when I want.

385
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,798
So why don't you?

386
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,508
You said that you were only street racing

387
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,010
to earn money
for Francine's medical bills.

388
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,512
Well, there are no medical bills anymore.

389
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,264
So why are you still doing it?

390
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,267
Look, I am not gonna pretend

391
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,686
that Francine meant to me
what she did to you.

392
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,355
But in the short time
that I got to spend with her,

393
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,523
I saw what kind of person she had become.

394
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,485
She was smart and kind and loving.

395
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,363
So I can't even imagine
how much you miss her.

396
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,365
You don't know what I'm feeling.

397
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,326
Well, let me tell you how I feel.

398
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,037
I know that you are trying really hard to
convince everyone that you are a badass,

399
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,415
but I know that you're a good kid, Wally.

400
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,376
And you didn't get that way
raising yourself.

401
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,294
You had a single mother who cared for you.

402
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,921
So my dad and I care
whether you wrap yourself around a tree

403
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,882
or get shot by one of these gangsters.

404
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:22,095
Having someone care about your well-being
cannot be a new sensation for you.

405
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,978
Show up there again
and I won't be able to protect you.

to be part of your team,

between you and my daughter,

427
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,881
and every time,
unblinkingly, unflinchingly,

428
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,051
I would choose my daughter.
I will betray you.

close the breaches for good.

You won't kill me.

Yeah, all right...

631
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,291
It's just... Look, I mean,
Iris could've died tonight.

632
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,833
She's gonna be okay, Barry.

633
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,671
You know, this time. But the fact is,
she is hurt right now because of me.

634
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:30,841
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris
just from some meta-human tonight.

635
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,805
When Zoom attacks again,
I need all of my speed, and then some.

636
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,434
I can't lose anyone else.

637
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,521
You won't.

638
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:47,608
-I did it.
-What?

639
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that?

640
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,956
I stole your speed.

641
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,667
I gave it to Zoom.

642
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,588
No. This isn't...
What, are... You're working with Zoom?

643
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:10,131
No. Not at first.

644
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,051
We trusted you. I trusted you!

645
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:16,971
Joe, stop!

646
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,230
Why'd you put him in there?

647
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,564
Because if I didn't,
I would've killed him.

648
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,441
Now, let's go find this tar freak.

649
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,205
-Yo! What the hell, man!
-Shut up.

650
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,790
-I thought I was being transferred.
-(CHUCKLES)

651
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,169
You're not being transferred.
You're the bait.

652
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:50,130
What?

653
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,599
This is for two years ago, Clay!

654
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,528
(GRUNTS)

655
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,287
Stay.

656
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,501
(GRUNTS)

657
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,470
You know, it's ironic.

658
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,848
I was just saying how much you remind me
of the old Wells.

659
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,976
And now, here we are,
just like I did with him,

660
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:50,356
standing on either side of this glass
with me asking you why.

661
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,983
I'm doing what I have to do
to save my daughter.

662
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,485
Yeah, at any cost, right?

663
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,820
At the cost of Joe's daughter?

664
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:58,573
I told you I would betray you.

665
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:01,409
I told you I would have to choose.

666
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,785
You chose wrong.

667
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:06,497
Really, Detective?
Because I just sacrificed my daughter.

668
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,750
Because I just sentenced my daughter
to death to save your son.

669
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,169
You want a pat on the back?

670
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,837
I want you to send me home.

671
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,715
Send me back to Earth-2.

672
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,342
Think about it.

673
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,010
Zoom wants you to get faster,

674
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,681
he wants you to have more Speed Force
in you for when he finally takes it.

675
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,642
Send me back, use the Implosion Reactor
to shut down the breach.

676
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,686
Shut down all the breaches.

677
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,271
Close them all.

678
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,401
And Zoom will never be
able to cross over, ever again.

679
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,737
And that'll be the end of it.

680
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,447
What about your daughter?

681
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,618
Jesse's my battle to fight. Not yours.

682
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,969
(GROANS)

683
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,807
Hey. How are you feeling?

684
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,895
Mmm, like I could
use some pizza right now.

685
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:12,187
(BOTH LAUGH)

686
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:16,108
But they're letting you out tomorrow,
so I can get you any kind you want.

687
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,777
-From anywhere you want.
-Deal.

688
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,781
You know, um,

689
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,245
growing up, we didn't have a lot of money
to go to the movies or buy toys.

690
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,750
Instead, she would just take me in the car
and we'd go for these long drives.

691
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,044
Just her and I and her music.

692
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,674
I remember being on the road with her
and just...

693
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,512
Watching the scenery flash by
and feeling so happy.

694
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,809
Now, when I race,

695
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,521
feeling that rush of speed, it's like...

696
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:58,568
It's like I get to go back to those days.

697
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,116
I didn't want to stop, because if I do...

698
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,456
(SIGHS)

699
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,376
See? That wasn't so hard.

700
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,299
-Actually, it was pretty hard.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

701
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,806
This is a sample of Barry's cells
after whatever Harry did to them.

702
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,266
As you can see,
not only is it drained of the Speed Force

703
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,770
but it's also presenting itself
as chromosomal damage.

704
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,440
If Harry kept doing what he was doing,

705
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,568
he could have taken
your powers permanently.

706
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:43,237
Even Evil Wells couldn't figure out
how to do that one.

707
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,614
Well, look.
Somebody better send his ass back

708
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,156
to where he came from
or I'm gonna shoot him.

709
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,700
-Amen.
-No.

710
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,910
What do you mean, "no"?

711
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,374
What would we have done,
if we were in his position?

712
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,627
I mean, what would you do
if it was Iris, Joe?

713
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,295
Cisco, when Snart kidnapped you,

714
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,840
threatened to kill your brother
unless you helped, you did.

715
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:06,344
And none of us judged you for that.
We still don't.

716
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,137
Because when it comes to family,

717
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:11,140
when it comes to the people
that we all love,

718
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,060
we're all vulnerable. None of us are
above making a wrong decision.

719
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,773
He could have done it,
he could've stolen my speed,

720
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,941
gotten away with it.
None of us would've even known.

721
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,276
But he didn't.

722
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,530
And now his daughter's gonna die
and we're okay with that?

723
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,156
<i>I can't just give up on her.</i>

724
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,950
I can't give up on a world.

725
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,371
This is a world full of people
who are facing death.

726
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,167
I don't know, I mean, I may not be
fast enough to beat Zoom yet, but...

727
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,213
I'm not gonna just close the breaches
and forget about it.

728
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,385
We have to help Wells.

729
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,472
Look, guys, I...

730
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:54,725
I was the one that trusted him first.

731
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,935
I own that.

732
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:59,229
I let him stay when literally all of you
told me not to.

733
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,899
So everything that's happened up
until this point, it's on me.

734
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,276
But this has to be a group decision.

735
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,701
Come on.

736
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,586
Well...

737
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,923
I guess this is good-bye.

738
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,342
No. It's not.

739
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,220
I told you we're a team.

740
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,097
Now you're a part of it.

741
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,267
We're gonna help you save Jesse.
We're not sending you through alone.

742
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,062
We're going to Earth-2.
