let me ask you something.</font></i>

00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,451
<font color="#fc01">- <i>Mm-hmm.
- Have you ever wished</font>

273
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,604
<font color="#fc01">you could have the answer to any question,
right at your fingertips?</font>

274
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:18,855
<i><font color="#fc01">Oh, gosh.</font></i>

275
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:23,151
<font color="#fc01">Yes. It's just like those...
those big fancy books you see on TV.</font>

276
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:24,961
<i><font color="#fc01">Oh, yes, they're lovely.</font></i>

277
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,865
<font color="#fc01">Yeah, just imagine, you'd never
have to go to the library again.</font>

278
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,119
<font color="#fc01">Or, hey, think of the money
that you'll save on gas alone.</font>

279
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:34,578
<i><font color="#fc01">- Oh, good point.</i>
- Anything?</font>

280
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,747
<font color="#fc01">Nothing.</font>

281
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,708
<font color="#fc01">Acceptance letters tend to come
end of week to make you sweat.</font>

282
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:39,917
<font color="#fc01">Well, I'm sweating.</font>

283
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,463
<font color="#fc01">- It's coming, Mrs. Byers. Don't you worry.

286
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,888
<i><font color="#fc01">- Of... Of course.</i>
- Great. So, what are we thinking?</font>

287
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:58,228
<font color="#fc01">Could do volumes A through C,
or we could do the... the whole alphabet.</font>

291
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:07,570
<i><font color="#fc01">Oh, sure.</font></i>

292
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:52,240
<i><font color="#fc01">After learning to speak,</font></i>

293
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,617
<font color="#fc01">she traveled the world
to spread her message,</font>

00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,036
<font color="#fc01">and along the way,</font>

295
00:24:56,118 --> 00:25:00,207
<font color="#fc01">changed how the world perceived
those like her with disabilities.</font>

296
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,960
<font color="#fc01">And that is why I have chosen</font>

297
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,880
<font color="#fc01">Helen Keller as my hero.</font>

298
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,094
<font color="#fc01">That was wonderful, Angela.</font>

299
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,137
<font color="#fc01">Truly wonderful.</font>

300
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,723
<font color="#fc01">What an inspiring story.</font>

301
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,434
<font color="#fc01">Okay. Now let's see
who has to follow that.</font>

302
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,022
<font color="#fc01">Jane.</font>

303
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,958
<font color="#fc01">Hi.</font>

304
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,170
<font color="#fc01">For my hero,</font>

305
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:49,337
<font color="#fc01">I...</font>

306
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,217
<font color="#fc01">I chose my dad.</font>

307
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,804
<font color="#fc01">And for my visual aid,</font>

308
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,224
<font color="#fc01">I made a "direyama" of our cabin.</font>

309
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:01,601
<font color="#fc01">More like diarrhea.</font>

310
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:05,102
<font color="#fc01">Quiet, everyone.</font>

311
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:06,480
<font color="#fc01">Let's be respectful.</font>

312
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:12,069
<font color="#fc01">This is my dad.</font>

313
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,655
<font color="#fc01">His name is Hopper.</font>

314
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,450
<font color="#fc01">He made the best Eggos,</font>

315
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,788
<font color="#fc01">and...
...we liked to watch <i>Miami Vice</i> on Fridays.</font>

316
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,208
<font color="#fc01">This is Mr. Fibbly.</font>

317
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,671
<font color="#fc01">He is a squirrel.</font>

318
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:31,964
<font color="#fc01">What?</font>

319
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:40,390
<font color="#fc01">And this is the alarm that my dad made.</font>

320
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,184
<font color="#fc01">I... I was never scared because...</font>

321
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,980
<font color="#fc01">beca... because...</font>

322
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:51,233
<font color="#fc01">Uh, Angela, let's save questions
until the end of Jane's presentation.</font>

323
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:52,943
<font color="#fc01">Yeah. Sorry.</font>

324
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,820
<font color="#fc01">I'm just, like, confused.</font>

325
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:59,075
<font color="#fc01">I thought this was
a presentation about a historical hero.</font>

326
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,826
<font color="#fc01">My dad was in the newspaper.</font>

327
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,412
<font color="#fc01">Your local paper?</font>

328
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,961
<font color="#fc01">I just don't think that's
what Mrs. Gracey meant by historical.</font>

329
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,381
<font color="#fc01">This is supposed to be
about famous people.</font>

330
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,050
<font color="#fc01">My dad is famous.</font>

331
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,260
<font color="#fc01">He... He saved lots of lives.</font>

332
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,429
<font color="#fc01">In a mall fire.</font>

333
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,684
<font color="#fc01">He was a hero for people.</font>

334
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:28,938
<font color="#fc01">And he was my hero too.</font>

335
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:37,197
<font color="#fc01">That's not what I'm saying at all,
but it's okay.</font>

336
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:40,240
<font color="#fc01">I am so sorry, Mrs. Gracey.</font>

337
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,785
<font color="#fc01">I didn't mean to interrupt.</font>

338
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:45,163
<font color="#fc01">I just wanted clarity
on the rules of the assignment.</font>

339
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,666
<font color="#fc01">Well, technically, you are correct,</font>

340
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,920
<font color="#fc01">but Jane has decided to do her father.</font>

341
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:53,002
<font color="#fc01">So,</font>

342
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,757
<font color="#fc01">please, continue
with your presentation, Jane.</font>

343
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,223
<font color="#fc01">El, it wasn't that bad.</font>

344
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,474
<font color="#fc01">Friends don't lie.</font>

345
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:06,601
<font color="#fc01">I'm not lying.</font>
