BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,098
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,938
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,271
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,893
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,984
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,280
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,618
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,121
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:32,289
CISCO: We got Turtle locked up
in the pipeline.

11
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,792
All we got to do is use him to figure out
how to steal Zoom's speed.

12
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,829
That might take longer than we thought.

13
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,542
HARRISON: Why's that?
CAITLIN: Because Turtle's dead.

14
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,878
HARRISON: You need to figure out
what triggers your vibes.

15
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,506
CISCO: Sometimes it's when I touch
something that belongs to a breacher,

16
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,091
sometimes itjust happens.

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,295
There's always a cause.

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,051
BARRY: We're going to help you save Jesse.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,514
What? You want me to leave everything
I have here? I mean, my life?

20
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,146
You don't have a life here anymore.
Zoom is too powerful.

21
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,896
Close it! Close it now!

22
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,021
(GRUNTS)

23
00:00:58,307 --> 00:00:59,479
No!

24
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,771
Jay's death was not in vain.

25
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,314
We will meet Zoom again.

26
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,233
And the next time, I will beat him.
Whoever that monster is.

27
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,332
Whoo-hoo!

28
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,466
Uh... It didn't look this deep on the map.

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,009
That's 'cause maps are flat.
This is like 1,000 feet deep.

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,757
Well, you wanna get faster,

31
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,472
maybe plummeting to your death
is the motivation you need.

32
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,305
So, to reach escape velocity,
you're gonna have to go...

33
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,022
(EXHALES FORCEFU LLY)

34
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,807
That fast.

35
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,735
Well, that fast is impossible.
I can promise you that.

36
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,316

- Kanye West.

39

If it makes you feel any better,

40
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,206

that was twice this long,

41
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,615
and he didn't even have super powers.

42
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,085
Ah, unless you count that sweet-ass ride.

43
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,376
- Do you hear yourself?
- Well, look,

44
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,000
you're gonna be fine. I'm 80% sure of it.

45
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,212
- Okay.
- 76.

46
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,635
Like, a strong 72. I can't stop.
Caitlin, help.

47
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,591
If you don't feel ready,
you probably shouldn't do it.

48
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,018
- Not helpful.
- Look, Zoom's still out there.

49
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,222
And once I find a way back to Earth-2,
I have to be faster than him.

50
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,022
And I mean, right now,

51
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,604
I wasn't even fast enough to save Jay.

52
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,687
I have to try.

53

along, Cisco?"

- What?

- So, you didn't make the canyon jump?
- Nah-uh.

68
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,536
What else can we try?

69
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,705
A bigger canyon?

70
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,002
Okay, fine, no more canyons.

Have we factored in drag?

- Wells, can we re-run the simulation?
- Let it go for now.

Barry, we've been working on this
all week.

79

You're tired. We're tired.

80
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,271
Yeah. What we need is some downtime.

81
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,860
Downtime leads to increased productivity,
ergo we have to have fun.

82
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,112
And the best way to have fun
is for us to go out to the club.

then you know it's serious.

You said
I should start a life here, right?

And Zoom's over there and we're over here.

through the facial recognition.

314
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,243
- She had a mask on.
- What was her suit like?

315
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,206
- Hey.
- Hey, it's a valid question.

316
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,283
It is, actually.
How was her suit constructed?

317
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,453
I, uh... lt was good. lt was very good.

318
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:42,591
It was like mine. It was made by somebody
who understands the needs of a speedster.

319
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:46,221
So, that would be someone
with access to tech and a lab.

320
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,600
Oh, no, I'm having a very bad thought.

321
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,389
(TYPING)

322
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,472
When I designed V-Nine,

323
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,893
I was having trouble
reformatting the extracellular matrix.

324
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,443
So, I called a colleague of mine
at Mercury Labs for some assistance.

325
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,024
Eliza Harmon.

326
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,773
She knows how to make this speed drug?

327
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,784
No. I followed the protocols
of information compartmentalization.

328
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,694
I only gave her
three of the eight components

329
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,328
necessary for V-Nine's structure.

330
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,580
Okay, so she didn't have the full recipe?

331
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,038
Unless she reverse engineered
her own V-Nine.

332
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,537
Eliza's a genius.
But that's way out of character for her.

333
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,630
- Well, it's worth taking a look.
- I'll go see her.

334
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,458
Hey, I'm coming, too.

335
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,588
Great. I'm gonna go train.

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,607
Knock, knock.

338
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:49,368
Am I hallucinating or is that disgraced
ex-Mercury's employee, Caitlin Snow?

339
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,747
Eliza Harmon, burning the midnight oil.
Don't you ever take a break?

340
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:55,578
Well, you know what they say, these
thiocyanate ions won't bond themselves.

341
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,576
- Hi.
- Hi.

Who is your handsome friend?

343
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,664
Detective Joe West, ma'am.

344
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,880
Detective, what brings you around
these parts?

345
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,634
Well, it's a funny story.

346
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:09,505
You know how there's a speedster
that's been wreaking havoc on the city?

347
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,465
Yeah. I heard the Flash went nuts.

348
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,012
Fame will do it to you.

349
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:14,893
I guess some people
just can't handle the limelight, right?

350
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,688
Well, we happen to know
it was someone else.

351
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,682
That's why we're here looking into this.

352
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,818
Wow! How very Law & Order of you, Caitlin.

353
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:30,404
Do you remember that formula that you were
helping me with a few months ago?

354
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,114
- Uh, yeah, vaguely.
- We think that it was somehow involved.

355
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,949
How? What did you have me working on?

356
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,877
It's classified, but let's just say
it was some kind of enhancement.

357
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,587
And we're afraid
that my research was stolen.

358
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,382
Not from this lab?

359
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,550
Okay, uh, between you and me,
the place is pretty vulnerable.

360
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,714
Ever since that break-in a few months ago,

361
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,683
some of us think McGee
hasn't sufficiently stepped up security.

362
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,432
But I kept my research on lock

363
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,393
and destroyed the originals
when it was given back to you.

364
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:02,186
But, hey, you're free
to look around my lab if you want.

365
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,940
Uh, I don't think that'll be necessary.

366
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,858
I'm sorry. lwish I could be more help.

367
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,156
It's okay. It's actually kind of a relief.

368
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,029
Will you call me
if you hear anything, though?

369
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,911
Of course. That's what friends are for.

370
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,913
Thank you.

371

- For now? We take her at her word.

373
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,888
Um, great.

374
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:42,065
I have a source who knows for a fact
that this speedster is not the Flash,

375
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,773
but an imposter.

376
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,271
Ah. Who's your source?

377
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,112
I am not at liberty to say.

378
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,115
Well, if you can't tell me your source,
I'm running the original story.

379
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,491
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

380
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:58,955
You're right. What's one unnamed source
compared to dozens of eye-witnesses.

381
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:03,457
Honestly, I'm having a hard time
wrapping my head

382
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,459
around your vision for this story.

383
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,835
Something isn't adding up.

384
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,426
How about we, um, talk about it some more?

385

Uh, grab some coffee, what do you say?

386
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,348
Coffee? Right now?

387
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,103
Yeah, yeah. I mean, a little caffeine
never hurt anybody, right?

388
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,138
Sure.

for the grant, for the promotion.

393

and six months behind on my research.

That's why I started all of this.

395
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,262
Your problem is
you're too much of a perfectionist.

and it ended up making it worse.

what she was working on,

so better move fast.

Ah, latte for me. And a Flash for you.

named after him.

He saved a lot of people's lives.
They just want to show their appreciation.

(SCOFFS) A few years back,

477
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,720
I won the
Dornfeld Award for Investigative Reporting

478
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,556
for my story
on corruption in the mayor's office.

479
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:39,059
I investigated a man that everyone loved.

480
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,526
The mayor was young, telegenic,
a former war hero.

481
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,567
(STUTTERS) He was voted in with
overwhelming popular support. It was...

482
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,403
But I knew that his campaign was
bought and paid for by the mob.

483
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,951
Okay, but not everyone is a corrupt mayor.

484
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,542
But I saw him for what everyone else
was too blind to see.

485
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,540
Everyone wants a hero.

486
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,006
Yeah, but in this case the Flash
actually is one.

487
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,549

488

are held accountable for their actions.

00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:21,327
But now, it's my turn to go out
into this new world on my own,

626
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,998
no shield,

627
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,702
and discover what this Earth can offer.

628
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,880
You know,
you are the best teacher I've ever had,

629
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,632
but I don't know
what more you can teach me.

630
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,387
Ilove you.

631
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,509
Please don't come looking for me.

632
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,074
So, Eliza just evaporated?

633
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:01,987
From running too fast?

634
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,791
It looks like cellular degeneration.
The same as Jay's.

635
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,206
Jay warned us V-Nine was dangerous.
At least now, we know why.

636
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,206
- You find Jesse?
- She went out.

637
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,054
IRIS: Barry, what is it?

638
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:21,260
Just right before Eliza

639
00:38:22,257 --> 00:38:24,681
disappeared, her lightning,
it turned blue.

640
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,262
Right.

641
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,893
But what if it's a side effect
of the V-Nine?

642
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:32,356
Yeah, but Jay took Velocity-Nine
and his lightning didn't turn blue.

643
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:33,777
But how fast was he running?

644
00:38:34,436 --> 00:38:35,733
Not as fast as Eliza.

645
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,284
All right, so what if V-Nine
is what turns your lightning blue?

646
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:42,407
I mean, that would explain why
Zoom is so much faster than me.

647
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,621
If that's true,
then that means he's sick, right?

648
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,161
He's dying.

649
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,750
That's why he wants your speed.
He's dying and he needs a cure.

650
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:55,925
Same as Jay.

651
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,797
No.

652
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,846
Jay? No.

653
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,766
He died right in front of us.
Zoom killed him right in front of us.

654
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,179
Yeah, Cisco, we've seen a speedster

655
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,023
be in two places at once before.

656
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,273
I guess there's one way to find out.

657
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,652
I guess now would be a good time to
tell you all, I've been vibing Zoom.

658
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,449
What?

659
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,989
For how long?

660
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,496
It started when we closed the last breach.

661
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,041
And every time it's happened,
I've been near that thing.

662
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,626
(SIGHS)

663
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:57,523
We need to know.

664
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,543
No.

665
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,255
No, no.

666
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,512
Cisco? What did you see?

667
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,317
I saw Jay.

668
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,561
He's Zoom.

669
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,172
Barry!

670
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,632
