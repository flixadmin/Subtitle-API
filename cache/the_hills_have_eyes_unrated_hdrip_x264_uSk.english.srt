1
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,000


2
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,000
Help me! Help me. Help me.

3
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,400
<i>My cake is ready.</i>

4
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,700
<i>Time for the show. Everybody on stage.</i>

5
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Ruby?

6
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,100
Is that you?

7
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,300
Goddamn it.

8
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,800
Ruby?

9
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Ruby?

10
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,300
Ruby?

11
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,700
Ruby?

12
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,700
If that's you, Jupiter,
I got some buckshot for you.

13
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,700
Ya hear me?

14
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,800
I told you, it's over!

15
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm out! Ya hear me?

16
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,800
You're on your own now!

17
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,500
I-

18
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,500
I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.

19
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,300
Oh.

20
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,700
Huh?

21
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,700
<i>Hello!</i>

22
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,700
Hey!

23
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,700
- Ah! It's hot out here.
<i>- Honey, you ought to stay</i>
<i>in the car out of the wind.</i>

24
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,200
- Well, honey, I have to stretch my legs.
- Where the hell is everybody?

25
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,300
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey.

26
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,700
- Get up, jackass.
- Bobby!

27
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
Oh. Hey.

28
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,600
<i>- Fill her up and check the fluids, my friend.</i>
- Oh, yeah. Right away, sir.

29
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,500
Hey!

30
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,700
- Beauty, Beast, stop it!
- Ah! Ah! Damn it!

31
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,100
You okay?

32
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Tell me again why we couldn't fly
like normal people? Oh, that's right.

33
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,500
- They wouldn't let your dad drive the plane.
<i>- Doug, relax, please.</i>

34
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,300
It's their silver anniversary,
and they're so happy you came.

35
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,100
- Your parents can't stand me.
- Nope, you're wrong. They love you.

36
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
I could have taken them
on a cruise.

37
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Hey, you know what?
Stop. I never ask you for anything, okay?

38
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,300
Just think how happy you'll be when
Catherine comes along on our 25th, huh?

39
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,600
Huh?

40
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,500
<i>Aw, it's okay.</i>

41
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,200
It's not gonna be
in a fucking trailer home.

42
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,900
<i>Don't see too many travelers around here.</i>
<i>Where y'all headed?</i>

43
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,100
- San Diego.
- California?

44
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
<i>- Sure didn't take the fastest road.</i>

45
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, no. We absolutely
<i>had</i> to see the desert.

46
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,400
- Didn't we, Bob?
- Absolutely.

47
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,100
There ain't nothin'
to see in the desert.

48
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,100
Really?
Did you hear that, honey?

49
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,600
Yeah.

50
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,500
Don't you know it's illegal
to smoke around a gas pump?

51
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,200
Yeah.

52
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,500
<i>Come here. Come on.</i>
<i>He's a good little piggy.</i>

53
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,200
<i>Little baby piggy.</i>
<i>Little baby piggy.</i>

54
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,200
Hey, Bobby, come over here.
Look at this.

55
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,800
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>That's so random.</i>

56
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,900
You two make a perfect pair.

57
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Hey.

58
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,300
You're sweet.

59
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,000
<i>Yeah.</i>

60
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,700
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't pee there.

61
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,500
What the hell do you care?
Just turn around for a second.

62
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,300
Uh, hello.
Don't you see that?

63
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,300
Geez.

64
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,500
She's so uncomfortable
in this heat. I told you to use cloth diapers.

65
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,500
<i>- Mom, the doctor said these were fine.</i>
- Look at those little cheeks.

66
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,600
- I know, sweetheart.
<i>- Yes, she is. It's okay.</i>

67
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,600
<i>I think she's getting hungry again.</i>

68
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,600
Uh, excuse me. Do you have a phone I can use?
I can't get a signal out here.

69
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,900
No, I don't.

70
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,700
Hey, Bukowski.
Give the cell phone a rest.

71
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,600
Sorry, Bob. Duty calls.

72
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,100
<i> Honey, you've been on the phone</i>
<i>since we left, really.</i>

73
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,500
<i>Well, sweetheart,</i>
<i>I've been gone two days.</i>

74
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,100
<i>I have to make sure that</i>
<i>my store's not burning to the ground.</i>

75
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,400
<i>Oh, God.</i>

76
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,100
<i>Thanks, Brenda.</i>

77
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,400
What the hell, Brenda?

78
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,300
Damn it!

79
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,700
Damn it!
Got it all over my hand.

80
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,600
<i>How far are we from l-88?</i>

81
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,500
- Freaking perv.
- What?

82
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
<i>- You're at least five or six hours.</i>
- You hungry, sweetie?

83
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,300
<i>- Why couldn't we</i>
<i>have gone through Santa Fe?</i>
- It's nasty out here.

84
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,600
- Honey, could you put a cork in it for a minute?
- Well, if I do say so myself...

85
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,500
ma'am, your husband here's
quite right.

86
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,900
This is the only southbound road
going to l-88. From there...

87
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,400
you can take the 40 to California,
but it's a long, old drive.

88
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,100
That doesn't bother me a bit.
I like to drive at night.

89
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
<i>I used to work the night patrol</i>
<i>for 15 years.</i>

90
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,500
Is that right? You a cop?

91
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,300
- Well, detective.
- Not anymore, thank God.

92
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,000
- I'm starting my own, uh, security firm.
- Uh-huh.

93
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,900
You a cop too, mister?

94
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,900
<i>No. I'm in telecommunications.</i>
<i>I sell cell phones.</i>

95
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,300
- You won't find any customers around here.
- Yeah, no kidding.

96
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,100
<i>- Everything's fine. Oil's okay.</i>

97
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,000
<i>Beauty, come back here!</i>

98
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,600
Hey, buddy.
What do I owe you?

99
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,900
Uh, $46 even.

100
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,100
<i>Oh, hey, Bob, here.</i>
<i>Let me take care of that.</i>

101
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,800
I can still afford the gas, Bukowski.
Keep the change, my friend.

102
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,700
That's not what I meant.

103
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,300
<i>Beauty?</i>

104
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,300
<i>Beauty? </i>

105
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
Beauty?

106
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,200
Beauty? Come on, girl.

107
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,700
Beauty?

108
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,300
Beauty? Come on, girl.

109
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,300
Hello?

110
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,400
Is anyone there?

111
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
Beauty!

112
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Beauty, what are you doing?

113
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,100
- Can I help you, miss?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

114
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,100
It's just our dog. She just-
She got out, and she won't stay put.

115
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,000
<i>- Lynn, we're leaving!</i>
- Come on, girl. Let's go.

116
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,800
<i>- Bobby, she keeps getting out.</i>

117
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,900
- It's all right. I got her.
- Okay.

118
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Oh, honey? Honey?
Could you, uh, tell him to take it easy?

119
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,100
<i>- The heat's making me nauseous.</i>
- Let's go!

120
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Do you need something?

121
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,500
No, thanks.

122
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,600
<i>Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!</i>

123
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,500
<i>Honey, we're on vacation.</i>

124
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,500
Yeah?

125
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,000
You know, uh...

126
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,400
it's not on the map,
but if you...

127
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,600
take a left at the dirt road,
couple miles from here...

128
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,500
- Uh-huh.
- It'll lead you through the hills.

129
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,500
<i>Probably save you</i>
<i>a couple of hours.</i>

130
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,100
Can't miss it.
Uh, there's an old fence right in front.

131
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,400
<i>Well, thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

132
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,600
Old fence, dirt road,
two miles.

133
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,600
Mm-hmm.
You have a safe trip.

134
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,500
Thank you.

135
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,800
<i>Dad, I hate your singing.</i>

136
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
<i>Guys, no.</i>

137
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,800
<i>- Stop!</i>
<i>- Imagine the first people</i>
<i>to cross this desert.</i>

138
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,700
<i>They didn't know</i>
<i>where they were.</i>

139
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,900
<i>- Yeah, I can, because neither do we.</i>
- Brenda, the road is here.

140
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,400
It exists.
It's got to go somewhere.

141
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,600
Besides, look how beautiful it is.
Look at the light on the rocks.

142
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,500
<i>It's gorgeous.</i>

143
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,100
- This is so fucked!
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

144
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,300
Watch your language, young lady.

145
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
<i>I would like</i>
<i>a little backup here.</i>

146
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,100
- This is such bullshit.
- Hey, watch your fucking mouth!

147
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,700
Can we just calm down here?
We're all a little tired, okay?

148
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,500
Yeah, Mom. Didn't you grow up in the '60s?
Why are you so uptight?

149
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,100
Your mom didn't
used to be uptight.

150
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,300
<i>- She was a little hippie chick.</i>
- No.

151
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
You should have seen her when she was
your age. She was a little hottie.

152
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,200
- Dad. - Stop that.

153
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,700
<i> Driving through the New Mexico desert</i>

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,300
<i>Great vacation.</i>

156
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,300
<i> I'm glad you came because</i>
<i>I would have been so fucking bored otherwise.</i>

157
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,100
Yeah. So bored.

158
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh. Give up on that, man.

159
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
I tried for an hour and a half.
Thing's ancient.

160
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,000
Wiring's medieval.
Needs to be replaced.

161
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,700
There.

162
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,700
There.
It's just the, uh, thermostat.

163
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,600
<i>It's disconnected.</i>

164
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,800
Anyway, at least
we can breathe now.

165
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,300
<i>Hey, I thought you quit smoking.</i>

166
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,600
- Does my sister know?
- Hey, man.

167
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,800
Fuck your sister.

168
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,600
You know, uh, Big Bob'd
get pretty pissed off...

169
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,700
if he found out you were smoking
in his newly renovated '88 Airstream.

170
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Well, fuck Big Bob too.

172
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,100
Here. Want one?
Go ahead.

173
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,200
Uh-uh.

174
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,700
Your sister would cut my nuts off
if you start smoking.

175
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,300
I think she did that
a long time ago.

176
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
I think you're right.

177
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
I think we're somewhere
on this blue road.

178
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,700
<i> Mom, we're not on the blue road</i>
<i>or any other road.</i>

179
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,900
<i>The guy said it wasn't</i>
<i>on the map, remember?</i>

180
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,700
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

181
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,100
<i>Jesus! Hang on!</i>

182
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,000
Watch the baby!

183
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,800
Honey? Where's the baby?

184
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,800
- She's right here.
- Is she okay?

185
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,700
- She's fine. She's fine.
- What the hell happened?

186
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,300
- The heat must have caused a blowout.
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

187
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,100
<i>- Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just a little scared.</i>

188
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,000
Where's Bobby? Bobby.
Are you all right, honey? Are you okay?

189
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,900
He's all right.

190
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,200
I knew this wasn't going
to be safe for the baby.

191
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,500
<i>- You okay?</i>
- Yeah, we're okay. We're fine.

192
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,900
Son of a bitch!

193
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,300
<i>- Okay, okay, we're all right.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God. The whole trailer.</i>

194
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,300
Come here, guys.
Come here.

195
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,000
<i>- Beauty!</i>

196
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,900
<i>Beast!</i>

197
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
We are so fucked.

198
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,100
- Did you find a signal?
- No. Nothing.

199
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,000
Ninety-seven percent nationwide coverage,
and we find ourselves in that three percent.

200
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,500
- Yeah.
- Well, your dad wanted to see the desert.

201
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
I hope he's enjoying himself.

202
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,800
Doug, don't start.

203
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,500
- Maybe somebody will need
a rent-a-cop around here.
- Doug!

204
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,300
- What? - Come on.

205
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,100
Every chance the guy gets, he takes me
down a peg. Can't snap back at him?

206
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,600
- Yeah, well, don't stoop to his level.
<i>- It's my fault?</i>

207
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,300
200 degrees out here!
It's everybody's fault.

208
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,700
- Don't listen to him.
- Get off my back.

209
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,400
<i>General, what's the damage?</i>

210
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,300
The axle is broken,
and it's... totaled.

211
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,700
Can we fix it?

212
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,500
What?

213
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,800
No, the frame is twisted to hell.
We can't-

214
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,300
- With what? I mean-
<i>- There she is.</i>

215
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,700
Give me your damn cell phone.
I'm gonna call a tow truck.

216
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,700
No signal. I tried.

217
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,600
- Well, we can use the C.B.
- You can try it, but I doubt
you're gonna get anybody.

218
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,500
The freeway's way the hell on the other side
of those hills. You won't get a signal.

219
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
So, what are we gonna do?

220
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,500
Excuse me.

221
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,800
Bob? What are we doing?

222
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,500
We walk.

223
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,100
- We walk?
- Yep. You and me.

224
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,500
We're in the middle of the desert.
We're miles from anywhere.

225
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,300
It's either that, or we sit here
and wait for somebody to drive by.

226
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,000
Have you seen anybody drive by
since we got off the freeway?

227
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,900
I haven't seen anyone drive by since
you decided to take the shortcut.

228
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,500
- Honey. Honey, let's go for a walk. Okay?
- Okay.

229
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,500
There's nothing there,
you shitheads.

230
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,500
<i>There you go. Ah, good boy.</i>

231
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm sure this desert is full of rattlesnakes.
Is that locked?

232
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,500
- Bobby, come here.
- I think that's locked.

233
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,000
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,900
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.

235
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,900
- You know, I saw- Mom?
<i>- What?</i>

236
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,600
- Safety's on, boy.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,600
- I saw a documentary on desert snakes-
- Uh-huh.

238
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,300
<i>On the Discovery Channel</i>-
<i>And there's some species...</i>

239
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,000
if you get bit, you can die
within like 25 minutes.

240
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,300
Really? I'd like to see
how they stack up against this one.

241
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,700
I thought those were gonna
stay locked up, honey.

242
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,900
- I thought you weren't talking to me, honey.
- You're right.

243
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,800
Relax, honey. I'm a licensed professional.

244
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,100
Besides, I'd take my bullets
over your prayers any day.

245
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,000
Well, some things never change.

246
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,500
So, what about, like, uh, scorpions
and coyotes and stuff?

247
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,000
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

248
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
Hey, Doug. You wanna try?

249
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,700
- Hey, don't point that at me!
- Don't worry, man. The safety's on.

250
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

251
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,100
Leave Doug alone. He's a Democrat.
He doesn't believe in guns.

252
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,400
<i>Oh. Come on, Dougy.</i>
<i>Come here. Just one shot.</i>

253
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,800
It makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

254
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,800
I don't think so, Bobby.
I'd probably just shoot my foot off.

255
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,100
You know, he's right.

256
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,500
He'd probably shoot his foot off.

257
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
- Hey, "B." - Hey.

258
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,300
How you holding up?

259
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,700
I am thrilled.

260
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,700
Yeah. This is a total drag.

261
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,800
Yeah, well, you know,
I really don't care what they say.

262
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,200
Next year, I am going
to Cancún with my friends.

263
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,600
Not going on any more
of these little family trips.

264
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,800
Well, we're not gonna have
many more of them, you know?

265
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,300
And if you want to go to Cancún,
you know you're gonna have to get a job.

266
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,700
Oh, yeah. What, you mean
like your job?

267
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,100
Brenda, I help Doug out
at the store, okay?

268
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,400
Oh, yeah.

269
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,500
Oh, yeah.

270
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,000
<i>Honey? Can you bring me my jacket?</i>

271
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,700
I'll be right there, honey.

272
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Bobby!

273
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,500
Fucker!

274
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,700
- Could you get me a Twinkie?
- No!

275
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,000
<i>Aw.</i>

276
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,700
- Just keep walking this direction.
- Yeah, fine.

277
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,700
You find out where the road leads,
and I'll head back the way we came.

278
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,300
- Stay away from me.
- All right.

279
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,000
It's gotta lead somewhere.
Maybe back to the freeway.

280
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,400
- Are you taking a gun too?
- No, honey, I'm not.

281
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I don't need a gun
to find help.

282
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,000
- I don't want this.
- You need the hat.

283
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,400
- It gives me hat head. I don't like it.
- Who cares?

284
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,800
<i>- It's not about fashion.</i>
- All right. Thank you.

285
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,800
Hey, listen. Uh, if you don't find help
within five or six miles, just come back.

286
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,200
All right?

287
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,800
- Here, honey.
- I'm gonna go to the gas station.

288
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,000
You're just never gonna make it back
by sunset is the only problem.

289
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,300
Honey, it's only about eight miles.
I'll borrow the old man's car.

290
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,500
Use his phone, if he's got one. I'll be back
with a tow truck before nightfall.

291
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,600
<i>- Can I go with Doug?</i>
- No. Nope.

292
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,000
You stay here with your mother
and your sisters. Now, hey, uh, Brenda?

293
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,500
<i>Listen up. Your brother is</i>
<i>in charge, all right?</i>

294
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,900
- So don't tease him.
<i>- I think we should pray before you go.</i>

295
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,800
- Oh, Mom!
<i>- Brenda, is it really so much to ask?</i>

296
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,000
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Come on.

297
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,900
Damn it.

298
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,900
We're waiting.

299
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,900
Thank God no one's watching us.

300
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,100
- Bobby.
- Stop it, Bobby.

301
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
- Stop. - Thanks.

302
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,700
Please bless us at this time...

303
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,100
and send your guardian angels...

304
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,200
to help us to walk through
this valley in our faith...

305
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,500
this, yeah, with the help
of thy dear Lord.

306
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
- Amen. - Amen.

307
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,900
- Okay.
- Bye, Doug. Be careful.

308
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,900
- See you later.
- See you guys in a few hours.

309
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,800
Honey? Keep the hat on, okay?

310
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,400
- Am I wearing it?
- Don't give me that look.

311
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,600
- Do you see it on my head?
- I love you.

312
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,800
I love you too. Bye.

313
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,400
<i>Hi.</i>

314
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,300
Hi, sweetness. Hello.

315
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,300
Who doesn't want
to sleep anymore?

316
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,300
Are you hungry?

317
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,100
Please take your feet
off the table. Honestly.

318
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,800
Just because we're camping
doesn't mean you get to act like a pig.

319
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,100
<i>You know, honey, really...</i>

320
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,800
you shouldn't go
from the breast to the bottle.

321
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,700
At her age, she should
get used to one or the other.

322
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,500
Mom, thanks for the advice,
but she's my baby.

323
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,900
I can't believe that we're stranded
in the middle of nowhere on your anniversary.

324
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,000
- Hmm.
- You know, if we just stayed on the main road...

325
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,000
we'd be in California right now.

326
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,800
What I'd give for a hot shower
and a cold margarita.

327
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,200
- The beach.
- A massage.

328
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,500
- I'll take a real bed.
- Yeah.

329
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,800
- The chronic.
- The what?

330
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,000
<i>Brenda!</i>

331
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,500
What?

332
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,500
The chronic.
It's pot, Mom.

333
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,300
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who smokes pot?</i>
- Yes, exactly.

334
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,600
<i>- Who smokes pot?</i>
<i>- Hey, has anybody seen my red sweatshirt?</i>

335
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,300
You know, the hoodie thing
in the backseat? Brenda?

336
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,500
- Weren't you sleeping on it?
- I haven't touched your smelly sweatshirt, okay?

337
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,900
<i>- Why are the dogs so excited?</i>

338
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,900
- There's probably some
rattlesnakes somewhere around.
- Ew.

339
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,500
<i>You know how Freud would have interpreted</i>
<i>your obsession with rattlesnakes, Mom?</i>

340
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Bobby!

341
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
<i>So bad.</i>

342
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,200
<i>- Bobby Carter! Stop that!</i>
- That's gross!

343
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,700
- That's so wrong.
- That was a little gross. I'm sorry.

344
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,500
- I apologize to the entire table.
<i>- Well, thank you.</i>

345
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,700
<i>I'm really glad that</i>
<i>we all came on this trip together.</i>

346
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,000
<i>Ah, well, that makes one of us.</i>

347
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,900
- Where is the, uh, fruit?
- Does anyone need anything?

348
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,600
No.

349
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,300
- Hey. Hey. Brenda!
- Wonderful.

350
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
- Are you kidding me? Do you know how long-
<i>- Bobby.</i>

351
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,300
- Bobby? - Sorry.

352
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,300
Bobby, it's dinnertime.

353
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,300
- I'll get him, Mom. Bobby!
- This always happens.

354
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,200
- Bobby, I don't want you going
away from the trailer right now.

355
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,400
Beauty!

356
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
Beauty!

357
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,000
Beauty!

358
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,800
Beauty!

359
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,900
Fuck!

360
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,300
What the hell?

361
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,600
Look at that. Huh.

362
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,200
Hello?

363
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,800
Hello?

364
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,100
Hey, buddy.

365
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,400
Hello?

366
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,500
Hello!

367
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,300
Hey, uh, I had a bit of a wreck
out on your, uh, shortcut.

368
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,900
Yo!

369
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,100
I grabbed some water, all right?

370
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,600
Uh-

371
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,100
It's dead. Damn it.

372
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,300
Yo, my friend! Hey!

373
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,700
You here?

374
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
You home?

375
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,700
Hello?

376
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,300
Hello?

377
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,700
Weird son of a bitch.

378
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,500
Yeah.

379
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,800
<i>Jupiter!</i>

380
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,300
I got buckshot, ya hear?

381
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,700
Hey, mister.

382
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,900
<i>You don't understand</i>
<i>what's going on here.</i>

383
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,900
Hey!

384
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
<i>The kids...</i>

385
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,300
<i>grew up in the mines</i>
<i>like wild animals.</i>

386
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,200
Open the door, slowly!

387
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,500
What kind of place
is that for children?

388
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,500
What kind of a place is that?

389
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,200
Okay. Put the weapon down.
Put it down, easy. Put it down.

390
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,000
I did the best I could.
I'm sorry.

391
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,700
Hey!

392
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,700
<i>Daddy.</i>

393
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,500
<i>Daddy.</i>

394
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,700
<i>Daddy.</i>

395
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,100
<i>Daddy. Daddy.</i>

396
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,300
<i>Daddy. Oh, Daddy.</i>

397
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,700
<i>Daddy. Daddy.</i>

398
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,300
<i>- Daddy. Daddy.</i>

399
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,300
<i>Daddy. Daddy.</i>

400
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,600
<i>Daddy.</i>

401
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,200
<i>Would you give me that gun, Pluto!</i>

402
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,300
<i>- Give me the gosh darn gun!</i>
<i>- Get on over here!</i>

403
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,300
<i>That's right. Come on.</i>
<i>You oughtn't have a gun.</i>

404
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,000
<i>Brenda?</i>

405
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,300
<i>Brenda!</i>

406
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,600
Hey, I'm here!
I'll be back in a minute!

407
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,800
Bobby!

408
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,000
Bobby!

409
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,200
<i>Bobby!</i>

410
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,200
<i>Bobby!</i>

411
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,100
<i>- Bobby!</i>

412
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,200
Okay, let me just-
Oh, honey, the hair.

413
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
It's just-

414
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,200
You know, you really are so lucky
that Brenda found you.

415
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,700
I mean, what if you'd had to spend
the whole night out there in the cold?

416
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,100
Hey, Bobby. Don't worry. Beauty will
come back when she's hungry, okay?

417
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,800
- Did you- Did you try the radio?
- It doesn't work.

418
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,100
But we heard something.
Some sort of breathing.

419
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,900
What breathing?

420
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,200
It was weird.
Right, Mom? I-

421
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,400
I'm sure it was just static.

422
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,300
Mom! It sounded like
a perverted call.

423
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,100
Only Mom would get
an obscene phone call out here.

424
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,000
Bobby! What-

425
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,700
<i>- Honey?</i>
- No, no, no, no! I want you guys to stay here.

426
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,500
What is wrong with him?

427
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,700
<i>What's he doing?</i>

428
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,400
Shit.

429
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,500
<i>Beast! Beast!</i>

430
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,300
- Hey, Bobby.
- Jesus Christ!

431
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,600
Hey! Whoa, whoa!
Stop pointing the gun at me! Please!

432
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,000
- Jesus, Bobby!
- Doug, I'm sorry, man.

433
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,500
It's me! You okay?

434
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,000
- Yeah. - God!

435
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,200
- Didn't mean to startle you, man.
- Yeah, I know. I just-

436
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,400
Look, I found this place out here.
You wouldn't believe it. It's like the Twilight Zone.

437
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,300
- Hey.
<i>- Is that Bob?</i>

438
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,200
<i>- It's Doug. It's okay.</i>
- Ta-da!

439
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,500
Honey! Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay.
I was so worried about you.

440
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,000
<i>- No, I'm fine. Just exhausted. Look.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

441
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,900
<i>Look at all this stuff</i>
<i>I found.</i>

442
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,200
There's a huge crater out there.

443
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,000
People must use it as a dump site.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

444
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,900
- What are-
- Look at this stuff. It's brand new.

445
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,100
What are we gonna do with
a fishing pole in the desert?

446
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,700
<i>- I thought you went to go find somebody.</i>
<i>- Road dead-ends in five miles.</i>

447
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,300
That's where the crater is.
It's not a shortcut. It's just desert.

448
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,200
- It dead-ends?
- Dead end.

449
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,100
- I knew that old man was full of shit.
- Hope your dad did better.

450
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,000
<i>Maybe we just missed a turn.</i>

451
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,900
- Honey, did you guys cook
any dinner? I'm starving.
- Yeah. Come on inside.

452
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,900
- Great. Thanks. Brenda?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

453
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,900
Do you have that lip balm?
My lips are really dry.

454
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,900
<i>Are you serious? That's gross.</i>
<i>I'm not letting you use my lip balm.</i>

455
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,800
<i>Do you use it</i>
<i>without telling me?</i>

456
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,600
<i>Wait. Bobby. Don't close that door.</i>
<i>We're leaving in a second.</i>

457
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,600
- What?
- Get some rest for Daddy.

458
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,500
You guys aren't gonna wait
till Dad gets back?

459
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,400
No, Bobby, I'm exhausted.
I need to get some sleep.

460
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,200
No, no, no. It's fine.
You'll be more comfortable here.

461
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,000
I'll sleep on the floor, and Mom and Brenda
are gonna be up front.

462
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,300
And you and Lynn can take the back.
We got extra sleeping bags.

463
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,000
Bobby, you got six people sleeping
in a three-person trailer.

464
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,300
It's not comfortable.
It's a little bit weird. Okay?

465
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,300
- Honey, you gonna bring the water?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

466
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,500
- Hey, hey, hey. Doug, Doug. Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

467
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,700
- Baby, you coming?
<i>- I'm almost ready.</i>

468
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,100
- See, uh-
- What's going on?

469
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,100
- Uh, when I-
- Bobby.

470
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,400
- No, no, no, no. It's-
- Bobby, hey.

471
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,200
I'm sure your dad's gonna
be back soon. Okay?

472
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,700
I mean, come on.
He's Big Bob, all right?

473
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,700
I'm sure it's gonna take more than snakes
and scorpions in the night to stop him.

474
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,100
- Okay?
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

475
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,400
- Sorry.
<i>- Did you get pillows?</i>

476
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,800
They're in the S.U.V.

477
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,400
Hey, hey, listen.

478
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,700
If he's not back by midnight,
we'll both go looking for him. Deal?

479
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,900
- Yeah. Deal.
<i>- Okay.</i>

480
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,300
- Get some rest, man.
- Good night, Bobby.

481
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,900
Good night.

482
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
What are you doing?
There's no mosquitoes in the desert.

483
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,100
Honey, there's
mosquitoes everywhere.

484
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,100
Hi.

485
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,400
Beast.

486
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,200
<i>Beast?</i>

487
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,800
Beast?

488
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,200
Beast?

489
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,200
<i>Beast?</i>

490
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,700
<i>- Beast?</i>

491
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,000
Beast?

492
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,600
Beast?

493
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,400
Beasty? Come here, boy.

494
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,300
<i>Beast?</i>

495
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,700
Hey. Guys! Guys!

496
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,100
<i>- Oh, good God. What</i>-
<i>- Jesus!</i>

497
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,900
- Bobby.
<i>- What is it, Bobby?</i>

498
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,800
- Guys, something- something
is going on around here, okay?
- What is it?

499
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,500
There-There are, like, people
or something living in those hills.

500
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,900
- People? Bobby.
- No, no, no, no. Doug.

501
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,500
- Doug. Doug. Please.
- Bobby. Bobby, listen to me!

502
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,600
We're in the middle of nowhere, okay?
Nobody lives in those hills.

503
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,900
- Beauty's dead.
- What?

504
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I found her,
and, uh, she was, like-

505
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,400
- It looked like somebody cut her open, you know?
- Cut her open?

506
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,200
Yeah, and I-I didn't want
to say anything...

507
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:02,100
because I didn't want to scare everyone
and I didn't want to get Mom upset.

508
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,300
But I'm telling you, there is something
going on, okay? And Dad's not even back yet.

509
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,300
Okay. All right. Stay right there.
I'll come check this out.

510
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,700
- We're not alone.
<i>- All right, Lynn.</i>

511
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,100
You stay here,
you lock the car, okay?

512
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,700
Calm down, man. We're gonna check this out.
Now where did you see this?

513
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,600
Now!

514
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,300
It's Bob.

515
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,000
- Wait. We don't know what that is.
- It's Bob!

516
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,300
- We don't know what that is!
- Bob!

517
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,500
Dad? Dad!

518
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,700
Brenda. Watch the baby!

519
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,200
No!

520
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,400
Hey, little birdie.
Hey, little birdie.

521
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,000
Get off! Get your mother out of here!
Get your mother out of here!

522
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,600
<i>Doug! Do something!</i>

523
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,100
Move! You gotta be
a man to do that!

524
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,100
I told you to move!
So, move!

525
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,100
Now, get! Get!

526
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,200
Whoo!

527
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,200
<i>What you got under there?</i>
<i>That's it. Give it to me. Whoo! Whoo!</i>

528
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,200
Fuck off!

529
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,700
Come on. Yeah!

530
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,000
Whoo!

531
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,000
Whoo.

532
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,400
<i>It's not my Bob!</i>
<i>It's not my Bob!</i>

533
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,700
Come on, Mom. No! Let's go.
No, just come on.

534
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,700
It's not my Bob.

535
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,300
What was that?

536
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,500
Mom, just stay here, okay?

537
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,500
<i>- Help! Help! Help!</i>

538
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,300
Oh, you fat.

539
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,900
Oh. Big, fat...

540
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,300
and juicy.

541
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
No. No, please!

542
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,700
Bobby!
Bobby, where you going?

543
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,800
Fucking kill those motherfuckers!

544
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,200
<i>Get back here! Don't do something stupid!</i>

545
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,700
No. No.

546
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,700
Get back to the trailer!

547
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,700
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Get out the door!</i>

548
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,900
Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!

549
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,600
- Brenda! - Bobby!

550
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,700
Come on, now.
Look at me. Look at me.

551
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,800
That's it. Look at me.

552
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,900
Shit! I'll come back for ya.

553
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,300
Brenda!

554
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,300
Bitch stuck me like a pig!

555
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,900
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

556
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,800
No.

557
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,000
Oh, God!

558
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,600
Don't move! Don't move, honey. Don't move.

559
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,000
Okay. Okay. All right.
You're gonna be okay.

560
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,500
You're gonna be okay. S-Sweetheart?

561
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,700
Okay.

562
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,100
Honey? Sweetheart?

563
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,700
Lynn, come on!

564
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,500
Lynn!

565
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,500
Come on!

566
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,900
Oh!

567
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,300
Hmm.

568
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,700
<i>Okay.</i>

569
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,100
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

570
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,400
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

571
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,100
What are we gonna do
if they come back, Doug?

572
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,300
This trailer is so small.
I clean and clean.

573
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,200
- It's still a mess.
- Shh.

574
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,300
<i>It's a mess.</i>

575
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,500
- Is Big Bob home?
- Not yet.

576
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,400
Every- Everybody went to bed?

577
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,300
- Yes? - Yeah.

578
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,500
Brenda's right here,
and Bobby's in the back.

579
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,300
Is Lynny sleeping? Hmm?

580
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,000
You need anything?

581
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,200
- A blanket.
- Okay.

582
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,100
- It's cold.
- Okay.

583
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,700
- It's cold.
- Shh. Shh. Nice and warm, huh? Nice and warm.

584
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,700
You're so sweet, Doug.

585
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,900
I understand why Lynny
loves you so much.

586
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So-

587
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,900
I'm not gonna take this shit.

588
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,500
- Hey, we're not going anywhere!
You wanna die too?
- I don't fucking care!

589
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,500
You wanna die, huh?
Look what they did to your mother!

590
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,100
Look what they did to your sister!
Huh? You stop and think!

591
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,100
You're not a fucking child anymore!
You won't make it three feet out there.

592
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,300
We need a plan.
We need to think.

593
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,200
- We need-We need to think.
- Think about what?

594
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,100
Think about what, Doug?
They have Catherine!

595
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,000
They have your daughter.
And you're just gonna sit here and do nothing?

596
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,200
That's 'cause you're a fucking pussy
just like my dad said!

597
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,500
- Shut the fuck up! You shut up! Shut your mouth!
- Fuck you.

598
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,200
<i>No! Turn the lights on.</i>

599
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,700
<i>Turn the lights on.</i>
<i>Turn the lights on.</i>

600
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,700
<i>- He said he's coming back!</i>
- Shh! Quiet!

601
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,400
He said he's coming back
for me. Please.

602
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,400
It's them! It's them!
It's them!

603
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,800
<i>Goggle? Goggle?</i>

604
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,500
<i>Goggle? You copy, Goggle?</i>

605
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,300
<i>Where's Goggle?</i>

606
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,800
<i> He stayed back there.</i>
<i>He's keeping an eye on them.</i>

607
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,100
- I told you.
- What?

608
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:43,200
<i>I told you,</i>
<i>you've gotta kill them all!</i>

609
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,900
Beast! Beast! You're alive!

610
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
<i>Oh, good boy.</i>
<i>Good boy. Good boy.</i>

611
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,900
- Good boy.
- Oh, my God.

612
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,500
<i>Jupiter's going to finish them off.</i>

613
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,600
Why are you doing this to us?

614
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:20,600
Why are you doing this?
You hear me?

615
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,600
Give me back my baby!

616
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,400
What the fuck
do you want from us?

617
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,900
What do you want?

618
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,100
You give me back my little girl.
You hear me?

619
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,700
- Bobby?
<i>- Hmm?</i>

620
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,600
How many bullets
do you have left?

621
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,000
A clip and a half.

622
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,200
What are we doing?

623
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,900
Which way, Beast? Which way?
Come on. Follow the trail.

624
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,800
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

625
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,700
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

626
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,700
Where are they, boy?

627
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,400
Which way, Beast?

628
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,300
Good boy.

629
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,000
Bobby?

630
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,600
Bobby, I followed the blood trail.

631
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:51,500
It leads to a town or something
out here. Bobby?

632
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,500
Who knows?
Maybe someone heard our calls.

633
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,200
Nobody's gonna hear
the fucking calls, Brenda!

634
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,600
Nobody's gonna see the goddamn smoke
in this goddamn desert!

635
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:59,000
We're in the middle of freakin'-
Ah, shit!

636
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,200
<i>- God!</i>

637
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,700
I'm sorry.

638
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,200
I'm so scared.

639
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,300
Who are these people?

640
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,300
<i>Good dog. Stay.</i>

641
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,700
<i>- Did you push her?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

642
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,700
<i>- Did you destroy the furniture?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

643
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,700
<i>Did you call her</i>
<i>trailer park trash?</i>

644
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,800
<i>- So, now, you're saying you still</i>-
<i>- I'm still in love with her.</i>

645
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,200
<i>Okay, but-So, you said</i>
<i>you treasured the marriage...</i>

646
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,400
and you wanted to end it
two weeks after you got into it?

647
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,400
<i>I wanted to end it</i>
<i>because I have</i>-

648
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,900
I had a feeling that things
weren't gonna work together.

649
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,500
She wasn't working as a team player
with me, and I tried coaching her-

650
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,600
<i>- What were you doing coaching her?</i>
<i>- Well, I tried to show</i>-

651
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,000
<i>- Is she your child?</i>
<i>- No, she's not my child, but she</i>-

652
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,400
Shh, shh, shh.

653
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,400
<i>She wanted me</i>
<i>to eat dinner-spaghetti</i>-

654
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,700
<i>and I wanted to do it</i>
<i>before it got cold.</i>

655
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,800
Watch her head, Bobby.

656
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,800
Come on.

657
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,700
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

658
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,900
<i>Answer me!</i>

659
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,100
I don't know where she is.

660
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:25,300
I never leave this place.

661
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:32,300
Your people asked our families...

662
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,400
<i>to leave their town...</i>

663
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:38,900
and you destroyed our homes.

664
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,600
<i>We went into the mines.</i>

665
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:48,100
<i>You set off your bombs...</i>

666
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,800
and turned everything to ashes.

667
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,200
You made us what we've become.

668
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,600
<i>Boom. Boom. Boom!</i>

669
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,100
Where's my baby?

670
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,000
What's so funny?

671
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,700
It's breakfast time!

672
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,000
Please don't kill me.

673
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,300
<i>"Please don't kill me."</i>

674
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,300
<i>- Please don't kill me.</i>
<i>- "Please don't kill me."</i>

675
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,800
Lizard.

676
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,800
Kill the baby.

677
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:47,600
Baby. Baby.

678
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,200
Get out of the way, Ruby.

679
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:13,100
I said get. Now, get!

680
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:28,300
<i>Mister, would you play with us?</i>

681
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,400
Ruby!

682
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,400
Catherine!

683
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,200
It's okay.

684
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,300
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>We'll be all right.</i>

685
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,300
<i>It's okay.</i>

686
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,200
No. No.

687
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,400
- Come on. Come on.
- No!

688
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,500
- Come on, Brenda.
- Bobby!

689
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,900
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

690
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,600
Come on. Come on.
It's gonna be all right.

691
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,900
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

692
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,400
Careful. Please? Please?

693
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,100
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

694
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,500
<i>Come on out,</i>
<i>you motherfucker.</i>

695
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,100
Look. Look. It's just a tumbleweed.
Come on.

696
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,900
Come on. Let's go back
to the trailer. Come on.

697
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,400
Come on. Come on.

698
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,200
Oh, my God!

699
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,200
- Oh, my God!
- She's gone.

700
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,500
She's fucking gone! She's gone!
Brenda! Brenda! Go get the trailer ready.

701
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,400
- Brenda, go get the-
- Where's Mom?

702
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,800
- Go get the trailer ready. Okay?
- Where's Mom?

703
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,100
- Where's Mom?
- Listen to me. I need you to go get the trailer.

704
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,300
Just go in,
do what we talked about.

705
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,300
Let's go! Get the window!
Get the window!

706
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,300
<i>It's stuck!</i>

707
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,600
Bob! Help me! Bob!

708
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:49,300
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get out!

709
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,500
<i>Here.</i>

710
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,700
<i>Ruby!</i>

711
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,900
<i>Ruby!</i>

712
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,900
<i>Ruby!</i>

713
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,900
<i>Ruby! Come back here!</i>

714
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,700
<i>You little bitch!</i>

715
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,400
Give me that baby!

716
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,400
Fuck!

717
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,300
Come on. Let's get out of here.

718
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,300
Oh, my God.
Look! Bobby!
