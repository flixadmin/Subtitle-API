00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,069
[Jaime] Okay, okay! Oh, my God!

804
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,195
[Jenny] I told you to go!

805
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,905
You should have started with,
"they have guns."

806
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,491
- [Jaime yelling]
- Watch out!

807
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,120
[horn blaring]

808
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,622
[Jaime] Oh, Rudy's gonna kill me.

809
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,127
[Rudy screaming in distance]

810
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,421
- [Rudy] oh, my headlights!
- [glass breaking outside]

811
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,506
No! My mirrors!

812
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,176
What the hell, man? [shrieks]

813
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,596
What's wrong with you? <i>¡Cabezón!</i>

814
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,139
Do you want some water?

815
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,223
[Rudy] My tailgate!

816
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:30,225
No, I'm... I'm good. I'm fine.

817
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:31,894
- [Alberto] Okay.
- [door opens]

818
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,190
What did you do to the Taco?
[clears throat]

819
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:37,441
And that... that's Rudy.

820
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,734
My name's César, okay?

821
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,319
And only my friends
call me Rudy.

822
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,321
- I'm Jenny.
- [mocking] "I'm Jenny."

823
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,489
Hi, Jenny.

824
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,741
We know who you are.
What are you doing here?

825
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,202
Thinking about turning our house
into a nuclear power plant?

826
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,495
I went swimming out there

827
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,996
by where your family
has that company.

828
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,749
My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

829
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,001
Shouldn't you be
pillaging cobalt

830
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,545
from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

831
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,340
- Where is it?
- Yeah.

832
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,301
- Allow me.
- [family exclaiming]

833
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,969
Rudy! What?

834
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,638
- What are you doing?
- [Milagro] Rudy!

835
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,014
[speaking Spanish]

836
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,557
[Rocío yelling in Spanish]

837
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:12,392
I thought the <i>chingaderas</i>
would come out.

838
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,977
- Come out?
- Jeez.

839
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,230
- What is he talking about?
- He's talking about this.

840
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,648
- [Nana exclaims]
- [gasping]

841
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,900
[gags] Oh, I forgot
how bad it looks.

842
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,026
[in Spanish]

843
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,027
No, it doesn't look that bad.

844
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,195
[in Spanish]

845
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,279
I've seen worse.

846
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,657
- Where?
- You don't wanna know.

847
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,492
Okay,
what the hell is this thing?

848
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,244
It's... it's called the Scarab.

849
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:33,038
It was given to my dad
when I was a kid, um...

850
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,749
It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

851
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,209
Oh, that's nice.

852
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,544
- Weapon?
- What did she say?

853
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,629
[Jaime groaning] What?

854
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,090
And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

855
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,842
when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

856
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,928
No, I swear to you,
I had no idea this would happen.

857
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:48,762
I mean, come on.

858
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,515
My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

859
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,100
It has to choose you.

860
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,895
So I'm guessing it's chosen you.

861
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:58,522
[Rudy] No more blind dates.

862
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,650
Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

863
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,236
I don't know.
But we better move fast,

864
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,446
because my aunt will kill us all
just to get it back.

865
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,656
- Kill us?
- [dismayed murmuring]

866
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,032
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

867
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,826
She's the one who sent
the assassins.

868
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,744
- [Alberto questions in Spanish]
- Yeah.

869
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,454
[in Spanish]

870
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:15,789
[chattering in Spanish]

871
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,500
I'm so sorry I put you all
in this situation.

872
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,669
I had no idea it would activate.

873
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,379
Really. I didn't know.

874
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,006
- That's convenient.
- [all chattering]

875
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,465
But she already said
she didn't know.

876
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:27,551
She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

877
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,011
[Alberto calming in Spanish]

878
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:33,140
We are going to figure it out.
We always do.

879
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,518
Come on, we are the Reyes.

880
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,187
We've dealt with harder things.

881
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,440
- We have?
- [Nana scolding in Spanish]

882
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,611
<i>Ánimo.</i> We can do this.

883
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:46,612
[Milagro murmurs]

884
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,197
Yeah. Yeah, <i>Apá.</i>

885
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:50,699
He's right.

886
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:55,537
Okay, so, how are we gonna
get this thing outta me?

887
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,956
You know, before it
busts another hole in our house.

888
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,083
- [Rocío] Exactly.
- [Jenny exhales]

889
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,836
There's a place where
we can get some answers.

890
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,255
But we need the key.

891
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,591
Okay, so where's the key?

892
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,509
At the Kord building.

893
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:11,136
And they're probably
on high alert over there

894
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,304
since I took the Scarab.

895
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,891
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

896
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,268
Wide area motion imagery maybe?

897
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:19,853
Photonic emitters?

898
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,314
I really don't...

899
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,607
Because I've been
working on something

900
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,484
that I believe can help us.

901
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,985
And it's almost finished.

902
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,113
If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

903
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,490
Mm. I love you, Ma.

904
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,200
Give me a couple hours.

905
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:35,827
[people chattering, laughing]

906
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,372
[live band playing
"Tú Serás Mi Baby"]

907
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,721
- [champagne cork pops]
- [people laughing]

908
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:03,647
[singing in Spanish]

909
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,440
[man] You're aware that
if you deliver the OMAC,

910
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:06,525
you'd be the most powerful

911
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,110
weapons manufacturer
in the world.

912
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,570
If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

913
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,948
Oh, if it isn't
the devil himself.

914
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,032
[chuckles]

915
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:16,368
General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

916
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,162
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

917
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:22,290
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

918
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,000
during the anti-communist

919
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:27,796
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

920
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,006
He's the perfect recipient
for the OMAC,

921
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,217
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

922
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,635
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

923
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,011
[Victoria chuckles]

924
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:38,014
Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

925
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,934
- When will it be ready?
- Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

926
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,770
We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

927
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,647
[quietly] We have a problem.

928
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,983
Well, if you'll excuse us.

929
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,486
Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

930
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,741
[Victoria] You lost her? How?

931
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,076
My men saw someone helping her.

932
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,829
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

933
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:04,124
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the OMAC.

934
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,835
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

935
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,463
This time I'll do it personally.

936
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:12,132
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

937
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,010
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

938
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,764
Just think of how much suffering
your body has been through.

939
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:21,099
I'm aware
of what you've done to it.

940
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:24,186
My God... What we've done.

941
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:28,648
Ignacio, I'm on your side.

942
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:33,779
Do you not remember what
it was like when I found you?

943
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,740
How badly crippled you were?

944
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,950
How broken?

945
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:44,206
I am just trying to fix you.

946
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:45,707
Okay?

947
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,920
Good.

948
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,088
I have to go back to the party.

949
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,967
Now, go get me that Scarab.

950
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:03,934
[Rudy chuckles]

951
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:06,770
That's it?

952
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,190
I call it, <i>El Chapulín.</i>

953
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,400
Why?

954
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,320
You know,
when you make something cool,

955
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,113
you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

956
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,658
Here, be useful. Hold that.

957
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:21,827
[Jaime] You're sure
that this one works?

958
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,287
Thank you. Yes.

959
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:28,291
Unlike the junk that Kord makes,
my tech delivers.

960
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,334
Okay.

[Rudy] Oh, you were a kid.
It's like Palmera's superhero.

Like Superman in Metropolis
or the Flash in Central City.

I don't know,
maybe just not... not as good.

1187
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:03,843
I can't believe
he was the Blue Beetle.

1188

No. But I mean...

It's like Batman's stuff, but...

...like if he had ADHD
or something.

1202

My dad was never able

it was pretty lonely

you three in here?

[Jenny] Yeah.

1232
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:04,046
That was my mother's

Why'd she stop?

1234

She changed my dad's life.

1243
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,575
She was the one who taught him
that the world

But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

1247
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,214
He obsessed over the Scarab

1248
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:49,467
and he would disappear
for days.

1249

Sometimes weeks.

And one day, he...

1251
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,476
he left and...

1252
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:01,687
...didn't come back.

1253
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,565
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

1254

You're really lucky.

1255
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:15,618
This house is...
it's full of stuff.

Sorry for... for what?

1264
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:40,142
I... I haven't talked about this
in a very long time.

[sighs]

1278
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:22,184
[Rudy] Okay. [groans]

1279
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:23,644
I've gone through the files.

1280
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:27,815
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1281
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,859
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

1282
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,986
before it chose you, Jaime.

1283
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,989
And <i>pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1284
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,408
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1285
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,785
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1286
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,620
It didn't go up my ass.

1287
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,622
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

1288
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,374
and that's what it's trying
to do to you, Jaime,

1289
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,792
connect to your brain.

1290
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:48,711
It's trying to become one
with you.

1291
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:49,712
Why?

1292
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,297
I think you should
ask it yourself.

1293
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,631
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

1294
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,133
[Jenny] It's sentient.

1295
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,968
That's why it chooses a host.

1296
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,553
That's why sometime
it does what you want

1297
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,013
and sometime it doesn't.

1298
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,098
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1299
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:03,184
[chuckles] This wasn't made
on Earth, <i>cabezón.</i>

1300
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,602
- No way.
<i>- Sí</i> way.

1301
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,353
It's alien.

1302
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:08,314
I don't really like
the term "alien."

1303
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:10,900
- You can use it, but I just...
- Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1304
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,526
What happened
to Ted's professor guy?

1305
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,903
How did he get it out?

1306
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:15,738
You might want to sit down.

1307
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,785
- Or not. All right...
- Rudy, please. Focus.

1308
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,536
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1309
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,747
The good news is,
I figured out how to get it out.

1310
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,207
- Fine.
- [chuckles]

1311
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,751
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1312
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:30,836
- What?
- Dead.

1313
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,505
[Jaime] What do you mean "dead"?

1314
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:33,714
[Rudy] Okay, right now,
Jaime, look.

1315
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:36,550
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1316
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:39,011
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1317
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,181
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1318
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:44,850
It's designed
to protect its host.

1319
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:45,976
To keep it alive.

1320
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,020
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1321
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,689
- [sighing]
- [Rudy] No, it's not forever.

1322
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:52,566
I mean, it's just until you...

1323
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:54,527
...until you die.

1324
01:00:55,236 --> 01:00:56,946
[stammering]
I think it's kinda cool.

1325
01:00:57,029 --> 01:01:00,241
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero, <i>cabrón.</i>

1326
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,701
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing...

1327
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:05,871
Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are my options now?

1328
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:08,666
So, option one is
to become an android

1329
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,167
for the rest of my life.

1330
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,586
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

1331
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,046
- billionaire psychopath?
- I'm so sorry.

1332
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:16,507
All I wanted was a job.

1333
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,717
- [Rudy] Maybe there's a...
- Maybe what, Rudy?

1334
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:20,010
It's all bad news.

1335
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,887
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1336
01:01:21,971 --> 01:01:23,639
I don't understand
why you can't...

1337
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,851
God. [sighs]

1338
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:29,395
Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1339
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:30,563
[Jenny] Jaime, just...

1340
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,274
Let me go talk to him.
I think I know where he's going.

1341
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,818

God.

1345
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:55,963
There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1346
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,132
[chuckles] Like a cat, Jaime.

[sighs]

1349
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:07,933
I'm sorry for yelling
at you, Rudy.

1350
01:02:08,017 --> 01:02:09,435
I shouldn't have yelled you,
but...

1351
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:14,023
It's not lost on me
that your situation

1352
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:16,358
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1353
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,154
[light chuckle] Yeah, we're...

1354
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:22,364
We're resilient people.

1355
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,701
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1356
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,621
...difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

1357
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:33,459
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1358
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:38,213
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1359
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,675
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1360
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,844
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

1361
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:47,181
The next 20 years after,
I mean, <i>la chinga.</i>

1362

But your <i>viejo</i> would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

1363
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:55,272
Any <i>jale</i> he could
get his hands on.

and to keep us all together.

1368
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,161
And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

1369
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:11,455
That's what we come from.

1370
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,541
The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

1371
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,170
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do with it.

1372
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,006
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1373
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:25,761
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

1374
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,139
And not just some
foot up our ass. [chuckles]

Hey, but what do I know, huh?

in his brother's living room.

Don't say that, man.

1379

You're not a failed promise.

1380

Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

Sanchez?

Yeah. Listen, kid.

The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,593
But now that you've
activated it,

1733
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:51,389
we can transfer its code
directly into the OMAC.

What are you even talking about?

No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

Oh, bummer.

1737
01:20:56,436 --> 01:21:00,356
Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

1738

And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

Do it, Sanchez.

1740
