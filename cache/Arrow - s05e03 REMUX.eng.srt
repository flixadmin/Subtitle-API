1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:03,546
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,506
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:09,093
I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,345
Today I fight that war on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,098
By day I lead Star City as its mayor.

6
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:15,725
But by night I'm someone else.

7
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,186
I am something else.

8
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,688
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,857
Previously on Arrow and Flash...

10
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:26,694
You ran back in time, and then came back
and noticed that things were different?

11
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,101
Who's that young boy with Digg?

12
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,673
- He didn't have a kid before?
- Baby Sarah.

13
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:30,948
Baby John.

14
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,076
I used your gun.

15
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,786
No one will ever believe your story.

16
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,432
Police never caught
your brother's shooter.

17
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,536
You leave Andy out of this.

18
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:41,334
Floyd Lawton. He is the sniper.

19
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,144
I'll kill you for what you did to Andy.

20
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:46,214
I have space for you right here,
right next to your brother.

21
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:50,259
I can't do it alone. I need a team.

22
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,720
You're not just joining up
with the Green Arrow.

23
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,347
You'd be joining up with me.

24
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,890
- I'm in.
- Me too.

25
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,892
So, what're we looking at here?

26
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,113
Carl Roberto.
Frequent flyer at Iron Heights.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,467
Seems like the only thing he's good at
is getting arrested.

28
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,344
He's not much of a challenge
for the Green Arrow.

29
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:16,678
He's not looking for a challenge.

30
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,888
This is about teaching the four of you

31
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,473
what happens out there
and how to handle it.

32
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,623
Well, I'm up for any lesson

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,601
that doesn't involve
him punching us in the face.

34
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,794
Wait. He hits you guys?

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,550
Oh, man, dude's gonna get it now.

36
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,893
Always assume that the target's armed.

37
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,582
Always assume that they're dangerous.

38
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,021
Stardust.

39
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,357
Who's "Stardust"?

40
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,025
It's not a "who", it's a "what."

41
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,654
Latest designer drug.
Makes PCP look like children's aspirin.

42
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,698
I want your supplier.

43
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,366
I can't, he'll kill me.

44
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,535
What do you think I'm going to do?

45
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,956
His interrogation technique
is a little unrefined.

46
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,500
He's not going to kill him, is he?

47
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,211
That's a terrific question.

48
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,546
You're not gonna do it.

49
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:10,965
Give me a name and I won't have to.

50
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:14,719
Word's out on you, man.
You Kill, but only when you have to.

51
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,056
Son of a bitch!

52
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,183
Oh, don't worry. You'll live.

53
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,228
All right. All right!

54
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,315
His name's Sampson. Derek Sampson.

55
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,691
Where can I find him?

56
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:31,211
I don't know. I pick up a package
on a different corner each night.

57
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,955
- And never from him.
- Give me the package.

58
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,489
The Stardust? Sure. It's in my pocket.

59
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,493
Good idea.

60
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:42,455
You really could use a high,
chill out a bit.

61
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,751
I am not gonna Kill you.

62
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,171
But I can't guarantee
you'll walk away from this.

63
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,223
So, what did we learn?

64
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,018
- Don't piss Oliver off.
- Like we needed that lesson.

65
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,436
Information.

66
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,203
Okay. It's the currency of our business.

67
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,066
When Oliver gets back here,
he's gonna ask me to analyze the drugs,

68
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,127
so we can find out
where it's being manufactured.

69
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,444
I hate drugs.

70
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:17,239
Not in a recreational sense. I have a life
like anyone else. It's just...

71
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,576
I saw what all the gang violence
did to my hometown.

72
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,744
Um...

73
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,538
I'm gonna make DVDs
of tonight's surveillance footage.

74
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,905
Oliver wants you to study them

75
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,768
like a football player
would break down a game tape.

76
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,227
And then he'll let us
get out on the field?

77
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,252
I'm guessing not.

78
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,419
That guy is seriously overestimating
my patience...

79
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:33,547
I am.

80
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,916
Because I didn't think that
you had any patience, Rene.

81
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:36,967
Cute.

82
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,654
Let's analyze this, see if we can
figure out where it's manufactured.

83
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,516
Look, analysis and forensics is
cool and all, but that stuff takes time.

84
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,143
I know the neighborhood where this dealer
is slinging out of.

85
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,205
I think I can guess
where the Stardust is being made.

86
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,898
Rene, we don't deal
in maybes and guesswork.

87
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,943
Or maybe rich boy Mayor Queen
doesn't know the streets so good.

88
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,240
Everyone get back to your training.

89
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,743
You impress me in here, then maybe
I'll let you impress me out there.

90
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,288
Text me when the analysis comes back.

91
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,501
B and E in a shipping center,
on 8th and Amsterdam.

92
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,461
Gunmen armed with an AR15.

93
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,516
I give up.

94
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:29,019
Detective Billy Malone.
Please don't shoot me.

95
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,773
Sorry about the fake radio call,
but I didn't have your e-mail address

96
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,191
and I thought we should meet.

97
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,111
- Whoa. Okay.
- What do you want?

98
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,989
I discovered some intel
that I think concerns you.

99
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,756
I caught the Conahan murderer.
He was a member of Mayor Queen's...

100
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,035
Anti-Crime Unit. Killed two weeks ago.

101
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,746
By a guy who's somewhat promiscuous
with his choice of weapons.

102
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:51,792
Apparently, he threatened someone else
you might be familiar with, Tobias Church.

103
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,711
What was his problem with Church?

104
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:57,423
According to the word on the street,
Church nearly killed you last week.

105
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,593
Well, this guy
wants to do the job himself.

106
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,477
Johnny...

107
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,980
- They tell you what happened?
- Just the charges.

108
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:16,734
Espionage, murder, conduct unbecoming.

109
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,571
I need you to tell me what happened.
And I need you to start at the beginning.

110
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,741
We were in Chechnya,
on an op to retrieve a trigger

111
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,618
from one of Damien Darhk's nukes.

112
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,620
Turns out,
my C.O. had a better plan for it,

113
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,580
sell it to the highest bidder.

114
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,542
Something went sideways, Lyla.
The buyer didn't show. I don't know.

115
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,503
I don't know.

116
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,881
I think pinning it on me
was the backup plan.

117
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,049
It's time.

118
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,592
You believe me, right?

119
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,177
Johnny, how can you even ask that?

120
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,678
Lyla, I love you.

121
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,890
Tell John Jr. I love him
and it'll be all right.

122
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,822
Hey, get me out of here.
You can't leave me here with him.

123
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,702
Hey, John.
Looks like we're cellmates again.

124
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,997
Ain't that something?

125
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,590
Your Honor, we need to talk.

126
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,797
Where'd you go last night?

127
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,278
I looked around the theater
after the movie and I couldn't find you.

128
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,405
Mr. Mayor, we need to
take your security detail more seriously.

129
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,516
I was serious when I said
that I didn't want a security detail.

130
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,309
And look where that got me.

131
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:33,686
Late for a meeting.

132
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,525
What're you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here till 9:00.

133
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,318
Our meeting was scheduled for 8:00.

134
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,736
Exactly.

135
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,197
What? Who's this?

136
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,157
This is Susan Williams,

137
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,327
and she's officially
my least favorite person on the planet.

138
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,913
It's not just that Oliver Queen's pick
for Deputy Mayor

139
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,249
has a history of alcohol abuse.

140
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,751
Recent reports confirm that Quentin Lance

141
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,337
suffered a relapse right before
Mayor Queen appointed him.

142
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,299
I told you not to offer Quentin a job
in the administration

143
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,676
and you decide to offer him Deputy Mayor?

144
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,095
Okay, see, that's what
those five voicemails were about.

145
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,702
The thing that I told you not to do.

146
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,515
I listened to what you told me not to do,

147
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,059
but then I decided to do
what I thought was right.

148
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,812
Anyway, and guess who I got that one from?

149
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,272
I'm an elected official.

150
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,983
I have to answer to voters
and a free press.

151
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,986
Unravel this, Speedy. Make it go away.

152
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,007
That's gonna be a little hard to do
now that the story is already out there.

153
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:31,327
I don't care.
You made this mess, you to clean it up.

154
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,626
Some nights, I still feel the sea.

155
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,337
Rocking, rocking. Oh.

156
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,130
In that cage.

157
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,800
- On that boat, The Amazo, you remember?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,596
Then I wake up, I realize where I am.

159
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,348
With family, with friends.

160
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,268
You are only one who knows
what I went through. That nightmare...

161
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,937
Here. I brought you something to drink.

162
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,898
No. No, I can't.

163
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,442
Not vodka. It's water.

164
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,738
How you feel, my friend?

165
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,132
Like I might have made a mistake.

166
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,741
But what of Kovar?

167
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,910
You still wish to kill him, no?

168
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:15,245
I tell you before, Bratva only way.

169
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,206
I think I'll take my chances.

170
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,416
This is about other men being killed?

171
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,752
That was first test. Two more left.

172
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,420
What was the point of the test?

173
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,089
To trust Bratva.

174
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,550
Well, I'm sorry, Anatoly,
but I don't trust Bratva

175
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,262
after I watched them
execute three innocent men.

176
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,722
Ah!

177
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,641
Mmm.

178
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,434
There is miscommunication.

179
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,603
You want to leave, leave.

180
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,607
But come with me first.
I have something I need to show you.

181
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,281
I cannot believe
I let you talk me into this.

182
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,910
Yeah, I'm a little surprised, too.
But it's just recon.

183
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,578
If this is just recon,

184
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,123
then how come
we didn't bring along Rory and Curtis?

185
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,291
'Cause Curtis would just tell
Mommy and Daddy.

186
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,043
And Rory?

187
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,962
Guy just weirds me out.

188
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:06,839
Ready?

189
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,153
Knew this'd be the place.
When's Queen gonna trust me?

190
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,573
I'm sure it'll be right after he finds out
we went here without his permission.

191
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,991
Night's still young.

192
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,118
Bring the Green Arrow back
and bust this place up.

193
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,205
You mean he will bust this place up.
He'll never let us get out in that field.

194
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,129
It's easier to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

195
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:50,090
You brought that?
What happened to this just being recon?

196
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,717
We did the recon part.

197
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,975
Mrs. Conahan,
this person will be apprehended.

198
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,186
I have the Anti-Crime Unit
working overtime on this.

199
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,440
Trust me,
we will get justice for your husband.

200
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,192
Thought that was my job.

201
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,194
Goodbye.

202
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,238
I'm sorry, you are?

203
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,073
Pissed. Royally. Off.

204
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,283
I'm getting that.

205
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,411
What I don't understand is who you are
and what you're doing in my office.

206
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,371
Adrian Chase. Your new...

207
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,832
District Attorney.
I'm sorry that we haven't met.

208
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,479
I'm buried up to my eyeballs
in motion practice and indictments

209
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,337
with a staff who's barely made it past
three rounds of budget cuts,

210
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,923
so how about we save the pleasantries
for the next fundraiser

211
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,759
- and get down to why I'm so...
- You're so pissed off?

212
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,386
Royally. Remember Vertigo?

213
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,430
Believe it or not,
I tried to buy some once.

214
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,723
Yeah, I believe it.

215
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,130
Well, what's hitting the street
is a million times worse.

216
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,895
"Stardust." I'm not as out of touch
as most people think.

217
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,831
But I do have some work to get done,
Mr. Chase.

218
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,875
So why don't we get to the bottom of why
you're so pissed off.

219
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,443
I've been building a case
against the dealer, Derek Sampson.

220
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,195
I was going to flip him,
but last night, somebody killed him.

221
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,448
- Rival dealer?
- A vigilante.

222
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,509
That doesn't sound like the Green Arrow.

223
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,703
Not him. Some idiot in a hockey mask.

224
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,416
I'm sorry. Did you say hockey mask?

225
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,836
Everything okay, boss?

226
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,505
A Stardust dealer was killed last night
by a vigilante!

227
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,816
Lots running around the city...

228
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,818
- Wearing a hockey mask.
- Hey, short fry was there too.

229
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,927
Thanks, Rene.

230
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,863
Rory and I didn't, though!
Just for the record.

231
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,765
Okay, I ain't gonna deny I was there,
but neither were you, man.

232
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,517
This guy was all sorts of nutso, loco.
It was either him or me.

233
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,437
You never should have been
in that position.

234
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,248
So, you're saying,
this city isn't better off

235
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,709
with one less dealer on the streets?
Have you told the mayor that?

236
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,986
You have no ability to think big picture.

237
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,780
Stardust is still out there.

238
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,449
The DA's office had a plan,
they were going to flip Sampson,

239
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,534
and then he was gonna give up
the suppliers.

240
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,620
They can't do that anymore.

241
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,387
How about you put an arrow in my other leg
and we'll call it even?

242
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,211
Last week, you said
you needed to be able to trust me.

243
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,923
Fine.
Well, I need to be able to trust you.

244
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,719
If I can't,
then why am I wasting my time with you?

245
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,019
Never in my entire life,

246
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,065
did I think that I was gonna meet somebody
more stubborn than him.

247
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,817
I would've lost that bet.

248
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,699
Is this normal behavior around here?

249
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,617
More than I'd like to admit.

250
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,838
Sorry, my friend's visiting
from Marseille.

251
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,339
No problem, Miss Williams.

252
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,842
I really appreciate you taking the time
to meet with me.

253
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,635
Anything for a fan.

254
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,055
I'm assuming you watched
the other night's broadcast.

255
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,266
Yes, actually, I...

256
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,144
I really appreciated
all the wonderful things you were saying

257
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,729
about my brother's administration.

258
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:14,896
Uh...

259
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,543
- Can you give us a minute?
- Mmm-hmm.

260
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,111
You're right. I was out of line.

261
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,613
My producer,
he's always pushing me to be "edgy,"

262
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,408
to do stories
that'll generate Internet traffic.

263
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,784
Sometimes I push too far.

264
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,120
Well, thank you.

265
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,955
I really appreciate that.

266
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,458
Of course.
I mean, we're coworkers, in a way.

267
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,211
Um, "co-worker to co-worker,"
I was hoping you'd do me a favor.

268
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,465
I need you to walk back your story.

269
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:45,677
The truth is, Oliver hasn't appointed
Quentin Lance, Deputy Mayor yet.

270
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,114
- That's not what my sources tell me.
- Well, they're wrong.

271
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,306
Because honestly,

272
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,892
my brother doesn't even know
that I offered him the job.

273
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,521
- Well, that certainly changes things.
- Yeah.

274
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,732
- I'll update the story.
- Really?

275
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,317
Co-workers, right?

276
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,532
How the hell are you alive?

277
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,993
Great question. But you know the answer.

278
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,163
They never found your body.

279
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,890
A hell of a world we live in, ain't it?

280
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,834
I survive a freaking building
exploding under me

281
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,003
only to get pinched a couple months later.

282
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,964
And it is hard going on the I am
with an eye-patch.

283
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,509
What's your excuse for being here?

284
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,847
I re-enlisted back into the Army.

285
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,809
Didn't go good.

286
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,647
Can't really picture you ever giving up
your day job as a superhero.

287
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,816
- I just couldn't do it anymore.
- Why's that?

288
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,527
I'm not here
to play 20 questions with you, Lawton.

289
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,070
All right.

290
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,532
How about we play cards?

291
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,915
Deceased male. Late twenties.

292
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,459
Six feet two inches, 214 pounds.

293
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,045
Found in a body of unknown chemicals.

294
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,383
Based on the lack of epidermis erosion,
the chemicals were non-acidic.

295
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,555
Autopsy was commenced at 18:25
with a Y-incision.

296
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,734
Why can't I feel anything?

297
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,912
Good night. I'm headed home.

298
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:37,914
Give me a sec, I'll join you.

299
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,916
Not home, I mean.

300
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,421
Bow! I'm a happily married man. Happy.

301
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,047
I meant join you out.

302
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,550
I figured. Besides, you're not my type.

303
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,260
- Are you gay?
- No.

304
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,345
Which makes you not my type.

305
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,639
Of course, yeah, I was...

306
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,726
Yeah, speaking of which, uh,
you were talking about home.

307
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,936
Hometown, are you not from Star City?

308
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,355
No. Havenrock.

309
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,566
Havenrock.

310
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,071
You know, I just realized that I...

311
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,115
I remembered, that I...

312
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:17,287
Oh, yeah, I promised Felicity
I would help her with some things.

313
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,956
- Yeah. No problem. Good night.
- Night.

314
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,416
Good night, Felicity.

315
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,792
Night.

316
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,301
Yes?

317
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,303
You knew, didn't you?

318
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,680
About Havenrock?

319
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,349
He told Oliver. I overheard.

320
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,018
Does he know? Rory, I mean.

321
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,230
Know that I destroyed his hometown
with a nuclear missile five months ago?

322
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,523
No. It hasn't come up.

323
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:50,153
You didn't destroy anything, Felicity.
That was Damien Darhk.

324
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:54,157
Darhk sent the missile to Monument Point.

325
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,869
I sent the missile to Havenrock.

326
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,998
I killed tens of thousands of people.

327
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,792
To save millions.

328
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,253
Tell that to Rory's family.

329
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,589
What is that?

330
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,968
911, from Starling General.

331
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,887
Where the hell are the cops?
We need backup!

332
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,393
Get out of here.

333
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,856
Derek Sampson, you have failed this city.

334
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,085
Hey, Rory, thanks for coming back.
Oliver should be here any second.

335
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,237
- What happened?
- Well, first meta-humans. Then magic.

336
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,126
And now you can add into the mix, zombies.

337
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,617
The guy that Rene killed
is kind of still walking around.

338
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,077
Sampson is not a zombie.

339
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,254
According to the coroner's
toxicology workup,

340
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,224
Sampson's body was infused
with a mixture of chemicals

341
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,685
that must have put his body into a state
that fooled the paramedics.

342
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,061
It was a matter of time before he woke up.

343
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,211
And kicked Oliver's ass.

344
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,796
He didn't kick Oliver's ass.

345
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,399
And can we please not say things like that

346
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,216
when Oliver could enter in,
like, any second.

347
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,260
Like, now, see?

348
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,763
We need to find this guy
before he hurts anyone else.

349
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,098
I'm tapped into all satellites
and CC feeds.

350
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,892
What happened?

351
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,229
Physiology changed. Enhanced strength.
And I don't think he can feel pain.

352
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,441
Felicity thinks it's from exposure
to whatever chemicals were in the vat

353
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,734
that Rene dumped him into.

354
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,903
- Any way to reverse it?
- I could run some tests.

355
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,922
But it would take time
and I'd rather keep my eye on the

356
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,632
"find Sampson
before he hurts anyone else" ball.

357
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,760
Well, good thing
I was a biochemistry major in college.

358
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:01,785
I'll get on it.

359
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,391
Text me as soon as you have anything.
We can't let the cops get to him first.

360
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,792
I want to help too.

361
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,960
I think you've done enough.

362
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,047
I'm sorry about before. But I get it now.
I'll do whatever you need.

363
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,966
What I need is to trust
that when I do ask for your help,

364
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,253
you're not, immediately, gonna
make the problem worse.

365
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,305
He said he was sorry. Let us help.

366
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,432
Yeah. We could canvas the city.

367
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,644
After what happened the last time
you went out looking for Sampson? Pass.

368
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,697
The recruit was a murderer?

369
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,949
Yeah. Police catch him

370
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,368
but he is son to friend of Kovar,
so he goes free.

371
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,121
Bratva step in to bring justice.

372
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,707
How is recruiting him
into the Bratva justice?

373
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,042
But he was not recruited, was he?

374
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,879
What if I wasn't the one
to ring the bell, Anatoly?

375
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,630
We still bring justice.

376
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,091
If you're trying to convince me
to trust the Bratva,

377
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,578
you're not doing a very good job.

378
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,053
You must trust process.

379
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,264
Not everything what it seems.

380
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:50,852
To defeat Kovar, you need army.
Bratva army.

381
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,732
You come this far. Why give up now?

382
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:06,284
Six of hearts?
Come on, six of hearts, where are you?

383
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,952
My kingdom for a six of hearts.

384
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,872
Will you shut up for five minutes
and I won't have to kill you?

385
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,499
Whoo! There's that temper.

386
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,169
Good thing your kid won't have to grow up
with it like your brother did, huh?

387
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,087
What'd you say to me?

388
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,923
How's all that going, anyway?

389
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,926
You ever find that group
that paid me to off him?

390
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,260
They didn't.

391
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,762
What's that now?

392
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,431
They didn't want him dead.

393
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,226
He was alive.

394
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,938
Like I said, hell of a world, ain't it?
I mean...

395
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,234
Wait, why did you say was alive, just now?

396
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:40,902
Huh?

397
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,780
Hello? John? Anybody home?

398
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,740
Because I killed him.

399
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,665
So all that hate that you poured into me
for killing your brother,

400
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,960
you really should've been
pouring into yourself.

401
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:06,028
I was just on my way to see you.
What can I help you with?

402
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,179
SCPD's working on locating Sampson.

403
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,640
I want to start with a search
of his last known address,

404
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,647
but Judge Pittson
won't sign the search warrant

405
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,435
for Sampson's prior residence.

406
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,062
I helped get Pittson elected.

407
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,606
Which is why I'm talking to you.
Could you lean on her?

408
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,442
- Absolutely. All hands on deck.
- Thank you.

409
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,071
Hey, you, uh...
You probably don't remember this,

410
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,822
but we actually met 12 years ago.

411
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,824
You tried to pick up my girlfriend.

412
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,078
I did a lot of things back then
that I'm not especially proud of,

413
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,664
but I'm sure she ended up
with the better man.

414
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,291
Hell, no. She went home with you.

415
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,502
It's okay. I don't hold grudges.

416
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,314
Looks like your Chief of Staff
needs a minute.

417
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,316
Let me know when you talk to Pittson.
I appreciate it.

418
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,425
Of course.

419
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,347
How'd it go with that reporter?

420
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,474
Well, I thought it went well.

421
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,684
Thought?

422
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,356
Unfortunately, Mayor Queen
doesn't seem to have the first clue

423
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,293
of what's going on
within his own administration.

424
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:03,693
For those of you who may recall...

425
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,821
- I'm so sorry.
- What did you say to this woman?

426
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,196
That...

427
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,531
That part's coming next.

428
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,700
Chosen
may be too strong of a word.

429
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,620
Not only was a disgraced public official
re-hired by the city,

430
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,415
in an even higher position,
but Mayor Queen wasn't even aware of it.

431
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,709
The decision was made by his sister.

432
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,254
Okay, look,
I am going to issue a statement

433
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,548
taking full responsibility for this, okay?

434
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:29,218
And, then I am going to offer you
my letter of resignation.

435
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,789
- Thea, that...
- No, Ollie, look,

436
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,223
you said it yourself.
I made this mess.

437
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,434
I'm gonna go clean it up.

438
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,485
You know, it's only a matter of time
before Rory figures it out.

439
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,736
What?

440
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,303
The "you and Havenrock" connection.

441
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,841
I mean, you can't seem to be around
the guy for more than two minutes

442
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,968
without acting widgy.
And sooner or later, he's gonna ask why.

443
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,911
Well, I will take the "later." Thank you.

444
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,558
Have you talked this out with Oliver?

445
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,624
No. Oliver and I don't have
that type of relationship anymore.

446
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,584
And you're right. I am acting "widgy."

447
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:02,951
Because having him on the team

448
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,897
is like having a constant reminder
about what I did.

449
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,255
So clear the air.

450
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,549
Look, if the past four years
have taught you anything,

451
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,010
it should be that keeping secrets
never works out.

452
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,220
I hardly even know Rory.

453
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,680
And what I do know about him

454
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,491
is that he has
several-thousand-year-old rags

455
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,909
that he can mystically use to strangle me.

456
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,518
He must be great at parties.

457
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,522
Look, I think that you need to just
trust the fact that he will not kill you.

458
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,525
And trust that he may be able
to see things clearer than you do

459
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,485
and know that this wasn't your fault.

460
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,867
Whoever called this meeting,
you best step up.

461
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,870
The text I got came from Sampson's cell.

462
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,123
Sampson is dead.

463
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,625
What'd Mark Twain say?

464
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:48,631
"Reports of my death
have been greatly exaggerated."

465
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,008
Man, he wasn't kidding.

466
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,972
Righteous. So we're back in business?

467
00:25:56,222 --> 00:26:00,059
Stardust? No. I'm thinking bigger.

468
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,520
You go bigger,
you draw attention from Tobias Church.

469
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:06,441
I'm not afraid of Church no more.
He should be afraid of me.

470
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,864
Ever see Lethal Weapon? My favorite scene.

471
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:17,827
Gary Busey, man. That guy, he could act.

472
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,543
If you can't feel pain,
you can't be stopped.

473
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,837
So we all get this treatment

474
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,007
and we take back this city
from Tobias Church.

475
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,981
I didn't know you were still here.

476
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,733
Oh!

477
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,610
That looks painful.

478
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,029
It's par for the course.

479
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,948
How'd things go at City Hall?

480
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,493
- Oh. That bad, huh?
- Channel 52.

481
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:05,208
Unfortunately, Mayor Queen
doesn't seem to have the first clue

482
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,416
of what's going on
within his own administration...

483
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,961
I already don't like her.

484
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:15,092
I can't keep my people in line.
As mayor or as Green Arrow.

485
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,387
"Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

486
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,389
Shakespeare. Or Tupac.

487
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,060
So this is Green Arrow brooding
or Mayor brooding?

488
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:26,395
What's happening with Susan Williams
is just politics.

489
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,249
Arrow brooding. That's excellent.
'Cause I have more experience with that.

490
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,943
Rene didn't listen to what I said.

491
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,445
And he created a superhuman.

492
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,490
Well, I used to have a dog.

493
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:42,537
Lucky. Adorable, but peed on everything.

494
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,248
A trainer told me that
next time it happened,

495
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:49,085
that I should roll up a piece of newspaper
and smack myself on the head.

496
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:53,005
Because it was my fault.
Lucky was just doing as dogs do.

497
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,675
You're pushing this "Wild Dog" codename
thing a bit too far.

498
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,428
My point is, when you're in charge
everything your team does is on you.

499
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,763
Even what Rene did?

500
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:03,200
He was right about being able to locate
Sampson's operation.

501
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,077
If you listened to him
instead of shutting him down...

502
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,781
Right, then none of this
would've happened.

503
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,437
And we both know why you shut him down.

504
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,275
Because I don't trust him.

505
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,736
Like you said, if you don't...
If you won't,

506
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,321
why are you wasting your time?

507
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,158
What's that?

508
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,203
I'm running an algorithm,
pings in case anything unusual happens.

509
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,455
"Unusual"?
That's casting a pretty wide net.

510
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,624
Well, all my other nets
are coming up empty.

511
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,084
Break-in at Allman Industrial.

512
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,335
That could be anyone.

513
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,771
Well, do you know anyone besides Sampson

514
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,106
who could get shot by security guards

515
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,274
and just shrug off the bullets?

516
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,465
What'd he steal?

517
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,694
Don't know. This is gonna take
a lot of time and typing.

518
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,696
Their warehouse
is the size of three football fields.

519
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,513
- Let me know what you find out.
- Okay.

520
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,098
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

521
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,975
To get the team.

522
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,273
I ran Walker through every database.

523
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:56,110
Initially he came up clean, but
there are some financial irregularities.

524
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,570
I want you to stop.

525
00:28:58,613 --> 00:28:59,822
What?

526
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:04,493
Stop digging.
I'm not gonna fight these charges.

527
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,329
Johnny, that's insane!

528
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,582
Actually, it's the first thing
that's made sense to me in a long while.

529
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,878
- Ever since I killed Andy...
- You think you need to be punished.

530
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,588
I know I do.

531
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,469
Lyla.

532
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:27,558
I didn't have to pull that trigger,
but I did.

533
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,716
Something's wrong with me, baby.

534
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:36,150
Then let me help you.
We will figure this out together.

535
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,027
When I thought Lawton killed Andy,

536
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:41,364
all wanted to do
was bring his murderer to justice.

537
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,034
I still do.

538
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,411
Floyd Lawton was an assassin for hire.

539
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:51,457
You're a good man. And you're alive.

540
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,376
Floyd Lawton is long dead.

541
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,836
No, Lyla, he's not. He's...

542
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,716
Johnny?

543
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,678
Johnny?

544
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,224
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.

545
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,186
I have.

546
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,741
You ain't gonna get me this time.

547
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,119
I've won eight in a row.

548
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,079
Are you sure you were an Olympian?

549
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:34,000
Having quick reflexes is not
the only quality in an Olympian. Okay?

550
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,086
There are other things.
Like determination. And stubbornness.

551
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,046
I guess a sense of fashion
isn't one of them.

552
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,267
Come on, man,
where did you get that jacket?

553
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,134
It's retro in all the wrong ways.

554
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,345
Wait, you don't know "Fair Play",
Terry Sloane?

555
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,433
Terry Sloane, Mr. Terrific?

556
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,436
The greatest wrestler
in the history of wrestling.

557
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,479
He was so good that he wore an outfit

558
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,249
with the words "Fair Play"
written across it.

559
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:00,192
Like I'm so good
I don't even need to cheat to beat you.

560
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,736
He was kind of my idol.

561
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,504
Did you have a little crush on him too?

562
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,781
Hey, that's beside the point.

563
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,665
- Something on your mind, boss?
- You've a good natural form.

564
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,543
'Cause it's not natural.
I've been working on it for years.

565
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,439
Rene, if I've been too hard on you,
it's because I want to make sure

566
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,063
you're taking this as seriously as I am.

567
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,091
Wouldn't be here
if I wasn't taking it seriously.

568
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,302
You were right about Sampson's operation.

569
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,599
You've have a knack for this
and I should've trusted you.

570
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,434
Whoa.

571
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,453
- That almost sounded like an apology.
- I'm still learning, too.

572
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,124
All right, well, before you guys
hug it out, you should really see this.

573
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,126
Found out what Sampson stole
from Allman Industrial.

574
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,819
- A molecular transmodality processor.
- What?

575
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,655
It replicates chemicals
based on their molecular structure.

576
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,199
What would Sampson need with that?

577
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,993
- The vat you dropped him in...
- It was full of Stardust.

578
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,953
But when we were fighting, a pipe burst

579
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,806
and some liquid drained from it
into the vat.

580
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,125
Sounds like you stumbled on the recipe
for making a superhuman killing machine.

581
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,002
And now he's gonna use the...

582
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,571
- Molecular transmodality processor.
- To make more of them.

583
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,217
And he'll need the original mixture,
which means that he'll return to... Oh!

584
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,720
I've always wanted to say this,
"The scene of the crime."

585
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:15,351
If Sampson is building an army
then I'm going to need mine.

586
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,686
- For real?
- For real.

587
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,025
Suit up! Oh.

588
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,129
I thought we were all going, like,
it was going to be a nice moment

589
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,464
where we all said it the same time.

590
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,907
Is that just your thing?
That's you, only? Okay, yeah.

591
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,394
That's you, that's just him,
for the record, for everybody.

592
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,709
This area's closed off, pal. Crime scene.

593
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,336
Yeah. I know.

594
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,726
Move in.

595
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,492
Y'all gonna be fearless.

596
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,369
Painless.

597
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,247
Unstoppable.

598
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,226
Let's do this.

599
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,771
In position. Ten seconds.

600
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,458
Make sure to activate the pressure sensor
before the detonation.

601
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:48,086
So the spark ignites the entirety
of the pipeline, yeah, I know.

602
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,653
Now let me concentrate.

603
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,704
Why're you smiling, dirtbag?

604
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,184
You are a freaky kind of scary.

605
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,479
It's the whispers, right?
It just does that. I have no idea how.

606
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,147
New mask looks cool, by the way.

607
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:28,484
Well, thank you. Actually,
still feels a little weird on my face.

608
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,207
I think you dropped this, Mr. Fair Play.

609
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,460
Thank you. Okay.

610
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,853
Thought we've been over this.
You can't hurt me.

611
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:17,700
Just because you can't feel your tendons
being sliced,

612
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,576
doesn't mean you don't need them.

613
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,040
Too bad my guys still have you surrounded.

614
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:28,544
No. I trust that
my guys took care of them.

615
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,338
Okay, Curtis. Kaboom time.

616
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,657
Where exactly are we going?

617
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,202
Did the people who built this elevator
know your secret, too?

618
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,413
You know, I've been meaning to ask.

619
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,999
What kind of vigilante
wears a hockey mask?

620
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,834
I think it's cool.

621
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,547
Okay, everyone, uh,
just breathe normally.

622
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,883
I know it's a lot to take in, so...

623
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,527
He fainted the first time he saw it.

624
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,346
I had the flu. I had the flu, ya'll.

625
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:25,059
So this is the cave... I like to call it
the Arrow Cave. It's Oliver-esque.

626
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:48,665
Bratva. Do you know what this word means?

627
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,919
Brotherhood.

628
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,171
If you are hungry,
brothers will feed you.

629
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:59,093
If you are hurt, brothers
bring 10 times pain to men responsible.

630
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:03,263
If one brother succeeds,
all brothers are rich.

631
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:08,310
If one brother fails, all brothers suffer.

632
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,688
Your brothers would kill for you,
would die for you.

633
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,692
As you would kill and die for them.

634
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,573
If these men
are supposed to be my brothers,

635
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,783
why would I fight them?

636
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,410
These men are not here to fight you.

637
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,679
Most of these men in this room
have tried to kill me.

638
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,330
And with these knives, they could.

639
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:31,500
But, you must trust they will not.

640
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,381
Do you trust your brothers?

641
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,051
I trust my brothers.

642
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,636
Take off jacket, turn around.

643
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,961
Sorry. I keep on seeming
to interrupt you two.

644
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,381
Don't be. I was just telling the Mayor
that Derek Sampson was apprehended.

645
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,300
- By the SCPD?
- No.

646
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,761
Based on forensics, the Green Arrow
is either as fast as The Flash

647
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,598
or he's got a new team behind him.

648
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,524
This city never seems
to get easier, does it?

649
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:37,774
Well, as promised, I will stay on

650
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:42,738
until you can find a more qualified
and experienced replacement.

651
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:46,074
I don't want experience.
I want someone that I can trust, Speedy,

652
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,576
and that person is you.

653
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,454
I messed up, Ollie. Big time.

654
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,586
No, Thea. You didn't. Follow me.

655
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,965
Thank you all for coming.

656
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,636
I would like to address, head-on
and with brutal honesty,

657
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,764
some of the recent reports
regarding my administration.

658
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,100
Reports that suggest
that while the voters may have elected me,

659
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,520
others have been making decisions
in my stead.

660
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,273
The truth of the matter is
that every decision

661
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:21,860
made by any member of my administration,
is my decision.

662
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,322
The buck, as they say, stops with me.

663
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:29,952
Because when you're in charge,
everything that your team does is on you.

664
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,454
And I trust my team.

665
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,957
That team

666
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:38,377
will include former Police Captain,
Quentin Lance.

667
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,004
Who'll be serving beside me
as Deputy Mayor.

668
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,801
Appreciate the vote of confidence,
Mr. Mayor.

669
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,345
You're the right man for the job.
Trust me.

670
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,144
Susan. A word?

671
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,023
Thea, I'm so sorry.

672
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,543
You must think
I'm the worst kind of person.

673
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,527
No, I actually already know that's true.

674
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,946
Thea, let me...

675
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,990
Explain? Lie?

676
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,826
No, I'm just gonna
save us both the trouble.

677
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,911
I already know exactly what happened.

678
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,956
You played me.

679
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,333
You only get to do that once.

680
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,086
And the next time
you try to cross me like that,

681
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:24,047
you'll be lucky if you even have a blog.

682
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,516
Never gets old.

683
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,230
Paul! I was just about to call you.

684
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,274
I'm on my way home from work now.

685
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,736
No, I never said that.
Well, traffic was crazy.

686
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,948
So, if Curtis is married, what's the rule
on dating while vigilanting?

687
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,369
Uh... One sec. The short answer is don't.

688
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,039
Rory, wait up, can I talk to you?

689
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,374
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

690
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,043
No.

691
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,715
There's something that I need you to know
about Havenrock.

692
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:10,677
Havenrock was not the intended target.

693
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:12,971
Monument Point was.

694
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:18,977
Someone redirected the missile
to reduce the number of casualties.

695
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,565
That someone was me.

696
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,820
I am so sorry.

697
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,045
Oliver.

698
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:46,922
Lyla.

699
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,423
We need to talk about John.

700
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,092
- Is he all right?
- No.

701
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,052
He's back in the country.
And he's in prison.

702
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,638
And I need you to break him out.

703
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:29,798
English - SDH
