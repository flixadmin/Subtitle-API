1
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,640
There you are.

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,480
I've been all round the bloody house
looking for you.

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,040
- What're you doing?
- Nothing.

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,600
You, my old son, are a terrible liar.

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
What have you got there?

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Come on, show me.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,440
Oh, you stupid little boy!

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,160
It's gonna be all right.

10
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
Hi! I'm Patti.

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,040
This is Doug.

12
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,120
We're with the Mayor's Homeless
Outreach Project.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,880
We have some sandwiches
and some soup.

14
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,240
We got cookies. We got candy.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,560
Who here likes chocolate?

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
Ain't you hungry, Cat?

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,880
Yeah, dig in. Take a sandwich.

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
- This is what I need.
- Sure. Go ahead.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Plenty for everyone.

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,280
Yeah, sure. Take two.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,960
- Hey!
- Hey, lady.

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,080
- Fudge!
- Don't worry. I'll go.

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,320
Slow down there, buckaroo.

24
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,440
I got you one, but I dropped it.

25
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Yeah, thanks.

26
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,800
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

27
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
What do you think?

28
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,000
I think it's been a long shift.

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,400
We give this bum three hours,
then we knock off.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,520
He was a vet.

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,840
I salute his service.
Now he's a dead bum.

32
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,040
People are shooting bums
all the time.

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,240
We might as well be looking
for the tooth fairy.

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,520
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bo.

35
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,160
How come you weren't here?

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
Good morning to you, too.

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,920
Where were you?

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
I was at the restaurant down
the street here. <i>Chezz Vowse.</i>

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,960
They had some homeless junkie kid

40
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,760
fell through their front window
last night.

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
I've been taking care of that.

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,600
This is a potential murder.
You're first responder.

43
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
You're supposed to preserve
the integrity of the crime scene.

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,240
He's got a point.

45
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,160
The restaurant that pays me
50 a month to look after them.

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,800
So I'm gonna babysit a dead wino?
I got a family.

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
He's got a point.

48
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Why the kid jump through the window?

49
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,320
Who knows? He was high.

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,360
- Did you ask him?
- Why am I the bad guy here?

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,120
I'm asking about the kid because
maybe he's related to the victim.

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,560
You're not a bad guy.
You're just a bad cop.

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,120
Oh, who are you talking to?

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400
- I know where you hide him.
- Come on! Come on!

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
You want it? Any day.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey!

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,360
Zeb and Smoke went right down,

58
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,880
and that's when that wacky dude
just shot Soldier,

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
and that's when I realized
I needed to get out of there.

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
So I ran and I ran,

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,920
and that's how I end up
on the floor of that restaurant.

62
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,680
- She used a pin.
- I swear!

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
A big pin.

64
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,760
But listen,
this is not the first time.

65
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,760
Street kids have been disappearing
for weeks now.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,880
By a dozen. No one knows why.

67
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
First, we've heard of it.

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Why would you?

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,840
Nobody gives a crap about us.

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,760
- I mean, look! That is...
- Proof! Proof!

71
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,440
That's a scab. Now listen, Mackey.

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,040
We're grown-ups.
We're smarter than you.

73
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,000
- Man, whatever.
- You're gonna tell me the truth!

74
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,680
It was you, wasn't it?

75
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,480
It was you that killed
that poor old man.

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
It was you!
Now you got to tell me the truth

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,400
or I swear to God
I'm gonna beat it out of you!

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,640
That old man was a war veteran!

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,600
Listen, Cat was there.
Cat saw the whole thing.

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
- Ask Cat.
- Relax, Mackey, relax.

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,640
No one's gonna beat you. Who's Cat?

82
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
What do you mean
no one's gonna beat him?

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Isn't that what I just said
I was gonna do right now?

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,960
- Just now, I was gonna beat him.
- Come here! Come here.

85
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,040
He is 16.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,760
Yeah, and six-foot, 220?

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
He can take a punch.

88
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,120
Look, I wasn't going to beat him.
I just wanted to scare him.

89
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
But if I did want to beat him,
I could.

90
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,960
- It would be my prerogative.
- It's illegal.

91
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,120
How now so righteous?

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,080
Not long since you put a man
in the river.

93
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
You want to say that a little louder?

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,560
Not everybody heard.

95
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,320
Ever since that, you've been
a royal pain in the ass.

96
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
You think I or anybody around here
gives a crap

97
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,760
about a dead snitch
or your guilty conscience?

98
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
We got our own problems.

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,520
Guilty conscience,
call it what you want.

100
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm going to do what's right.

101
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,600
You are beginning to irritate me.

102
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
Get your hands off me!

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,560
Hey!

104
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,080
Watch the shoes, clown.

105
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Shift's over.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Come on. Come on.

107
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,320
Come on, seriously.

108
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,800
Thank you so much, guys, truly.

109
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm very grateful.
I've been waiting for hours.

110
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
No kidding.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,640
Look like you crawled
out of a cemetery.

112
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,760
Smell like it too.

113
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,960
Open the window back there.

114
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,200
- There you go.
- Yes, thank you.

115
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,480
Forgive me, I am somewhat disheveled.

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,360
A temporary setback, I assure you.

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
Oh, thank you so much.

118
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,760
What the hell happened to you anyhow?

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
It was my own fault.

120
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,040
Foolish arrogance led me astray.

121
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
But I've learned my lessons.

122
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
I'll be back.

123
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,960
Stronger and smarter than ever.

124
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,200
Good luck with that, bro.

125
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,240
Here I am riding
about a lovely truck,

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,480
sharing an ice cold beer
with my new friends.

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,120
My luck has already turned, right?

128
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,360
Dude, anyone ever tell you,
when you walk?

129
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
You look just like a Penguin.

130
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,280
No.

131
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
Nobody's ever told me that.

132
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,360
He's saying he has a right
to stop me from beating on a mope.

133
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Damn right I do.

134
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,760
How am I supposed to work with that?

135
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,720
{\an5}Look it, Jim, it's not like I can
order you to break the law.

136
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
{\an5}But this is Gotham.

137
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,120
{\an5}- You don't bend, you'll get broke.
- I understand.

138
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,760
I thought you were with the program.

139
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,440
- He is.
- Well, let's get back to work.

140
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,680
Where are you at?

141
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,480
{\an5}If the boy we have
is telling the truth,

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,680
{\an5}there's a couple of kidnappers
out there

143
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,960
{\an5}abducting homeless children
in numbers.

144
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,600
{\an5}They lure them clothes
with the food truck

145
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,640
{\an5}from the Mayor's Homeless
Outreach Project,

146
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,160
{\an5}and they drug them with a jab
from a big pin.

147
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,760
Why would anyone wanna abduct
scraggy-ass orphans in bulk?

148
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,320
I mean, where's the market?

149
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,880
{\an5}They're out on the street
because no one wants them anyway.

150
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,600
If they said they were snatching
cute girls, I'll believe them.

151
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,240
But why would anyone want
with a lard-ass like Mackey?

152
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
What is it, Ed?

153
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
{\an5}Guess what I found?

154
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,400
{\an5}I did a blood test on him
and he has high levels of ATP.

155
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
What's ATP?

156
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
{\an5}It's a fast acting knock out drug.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,840
They used to use it
at the old Arkham Asylum

158
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,520
{\an5}to bring down troublesome patients.

159
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,520
It's hard to get.
No recreational use.

160
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,880
{\an5}Okay.

161
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,800
{\an5}- That's interesting.
- Anything else?

162
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Thank you, Ed.

163
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
{\an5}Thank you, Ed.

164
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,440
{\an5}Get to work.

165
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,200
{\an5}And keep this quiet. No press.
Not a word.

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,440
{\an5}Shouldn't we tell the public
what's going on?

167
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,320
{\an5}- Warn them?
- Department policy.

168
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,240
{\an5}We don't advertise
this kind of stuff.

169
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
{\an5}Causes panic.

170
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,240
{\an5}The headlines will read
"Gotham Kids Snatched."

171
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,920
- Which would be true.
- No press. That's an order.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,440
Follow-up on the drug, the ATP,
and the Arkham connection.

173
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
Arkham's been closed
for like 10 years

174
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,560
Yeah, 15.

175
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,400
{\an5}Their drug suppliers
might still be in business.

176
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
This happened on Fish Mooney's turf.

177
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
{\an5}Do you wanna see if it's safe for us
to go back there

178
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,360
{\an5}or is she still mad at us?

179
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
{\an5}It's a good question.

180
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,640
{\an5}Bravo!

181
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Bravo!

182
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,000
Don Falcone.

183
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,760
{\an5}What a wonderful surprise.

184
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
Welcome.

185
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
{\an5}Thank you my dear.

186
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,160
{\an5}- Can we talk?
- Of course.

187
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,400
{\an5}Give me a moment to clear the place.

188
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,760
{\an5}No, no. No need to spoil the fun.

189
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,360
{\an5}Men who are about to die
are very honest.

190
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,800
It pays to listen to them.

191
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,760
That's some toast.

192
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
I spoke with your man, Cobblepot,
before he died.

193
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,800
Odd little fella. Perceptive.

194
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
{\an5}He told me the death of the Waynes

195
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,600
{\an5}would bring troubled times
for our family and Gotham.

196
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,120
What did he know?

197
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,920
Business is good as ever.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No, he was right.

199
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,040
The Waynes and the Falcones
were pillars of the same house.

200
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,680
We understood each other.

201
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,680
Now that they're gone,
everything is out of balance,

202
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,640
and the Wayne Empire is in flux.

203
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,440
Who knows who'll end up in control?

204
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,760
The Maroni family senses weakness.

205
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,440
They'll start making moves

206
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,640
and every criminal in the city
will start making moves.

207
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,560
Please, don't lose
any sleep over Maroni.

208
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
He's number two for a reason.

209
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
I never lose sleep over my enemies.

210
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,600
It's my friends that keep me awake.

211
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,880
Cobblepot told me you say I'm old
and soft and ready to be taken out.

212
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,400
And you're the one to take me.

213
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,840
Don Falcone,
I would never ever say that.

214
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,880
I only have deep love
and respect for you.

215
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,800
You have been like a father to me.

216
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,360
I was so happy to hear that.

217
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,240
Let's forget all about it then.

218
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,200
The babbling of a condemned man.

219
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Enough business.

220
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
How have you been, my dear?

221
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
- Thriving I hope?
- Yes.

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Good. I'm good.

223
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,200
Which of these is your lover?

224
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,560
Please, my heart has been broken
far too many times for that nonsense.

225
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,680
I heard you had a lover.

226
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,160
Well, if you are referring to the boy

227
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,160
that I keep around for exercise,
my lover he is not.

228
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
- What's your name?
- Lazlo, sir.

229
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,320
Lazlo, be good to this woman.

230
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,720
She's very precious to me.

231
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,560
If you break her heart,
you break my heart.

232
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Yes sir.

233
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Give me your hand.

234
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,400
Thank you for being honest.

235
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
It means a lot to me.

236
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,680
It shows wisdom and humility.

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Out!

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,960
Everyone out!

239
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,120
Never, never in his life my son
is away this long.

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Nightclubs is his business.

241
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,800
Such hours.

242
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,920
But always, he comes home
to his mother.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,800
His clothes are here.

244
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,680
My son would never leave his clothes.

245
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,280
Oh, so elegant he is.

246
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,840
Yes, I show you.

247
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,240
Damn. Mooney and the cops
must have had him killed.

248
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,360
Looks like. Snitches get bumped.

249
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
That's life.

250
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,320
They're not gonna get away with it,
not as easy as they think.

251
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,920
You take things too personal,
you know that?

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,280
Yeah, I do.

253
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,520
That was a good snitch.

254
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,200
- What are we...
- Nothing.

255
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,640
- Mrs. Cobblepot...
- Kapelput.

256
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,440
Mrs. Kapelput.

257
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,600
Do you know anyone
who might wanna do your son harm?

258
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Harm?

259
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,600
No. I would feel it.

260
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,840
A mother feels these things.

261
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
It's a woman.

262
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,440
Some painted slut has him
in her clutch.

263
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,480
- A woman, you think?
- I'm sure.

264
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,400
So handsome he is.

265
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
And so naive.

266
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,400
Who are you again?

267
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,840
Detectives
with Major Crimes Unit, ma'am.

268
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,840
- Oh, G.C.P.D.
- Like that.

269
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
But honest.

270
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,000
Boss, don't get mad at me.

271
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
But I know that look.

272
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,840
Now is too early to make a move
on Falcone.

273
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
I know.

274
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Not yet.

275
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,000
I need more money, more men,
more territory, I know.

276
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll play this being loyal
and bide my time.

277
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,400
But I swear, Butch...

278
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,280
on my sainted mother's grave,

279
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,560
someday soon I'm gonna kill
that old man

280
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,640
with my bare hands and my teeth.

281
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,480
I'll be holding your shoes.

282
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,000
I just wish that Penguin
was still alive.

283
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,120
I didn't make that little punk suffer
near badly enough.

284
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Excuse me, sir.

285
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,000
I couldn't help but notice
the sign on your trailer.

286
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,640
Is it still for rent?

287
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,400
Hundred bucks a week.
It ain't much, but...

288
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,840
I'll take it.

289
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
- You don't want to look at it first?
- No, I'm not fussy.

290
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
It's all yours.

291
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
The key?

292
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,080
A sweet truck.

293
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,440
You got that big hemi in there?

294
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,800
Yes. Yup.

295
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,040
That big hemi is in there.

296
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Somewhere.

297
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Sir, the key?

298
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
It's in the door.

299
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,080
Okay.

300
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
What's up, player?

301
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,280
- You got any smokes?
- No.

302
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Where are we?

303
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Damn if I know.

304
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
I think we're dead.

305
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,920
Harvey, Jim, how marvelous.

306
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,160
Are you still mad at us?

307
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,240
No, please.

308
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,120
I'm quite fond of you
and you intrigue me

309
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,560
I knew I'd regret killing you
as soon as I gave the word.

310
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,760
But you know me.

311
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm feisty.

312
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,600
What do you know
about a man and woman

313
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,480
abducting street kids on your turf?

314
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,000
No foreplay with you, huh?

315
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,320
Figures.

316
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,480
But you got with the program.

317
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,280
Killed Penguin your own bad self.

318
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,800
I was surprised.

319
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,600
Straight arrow like you.

320
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,040
I guess you misjudged me.

321
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,680
I guess I did.

322
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,320
You are just a little sinner
like the rest of us.

323
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm almost kind of sad about that.

324
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,440
We're looking for a man
and a woman...

325
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,840
middle-aged, white,
targeting children under 16.

326
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,520
They use a poison pin,
if you can believe it.

327
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,760
Used to be there was only a market
for nice looking girls.

328
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,160
That's what I said.

329
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,520
But now there's a new buyer overseas

330
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,640
that will take anyone young
and healthy.

331
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,760
- Overseas where? Who's they?
- Nobody knows.

332
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,640
- What do they want them for?
- Nobody knows.

333
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,320
And no one cares to know.

334
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,280
Ta-da, moo shu.

335
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,120
Sorry, go on.

336
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,800
They drug them with a big pin?

337
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,120
That is so creepy.

338
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
No. You don't want to hear
those stuff. It's depressing.

339
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,440
What do they use them for?
The children.

340
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,840
Nobody seems to know.

341
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,640
We can't say a damn thing
to the press.

342
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,960
Bad PR.

343
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,680
I can't believe the system
is so corrupt.

344
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
You have no idea.

345
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
What do you mean?

346
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,600
No.

347
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Figure of speech, I guess.

348
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,520
Did something happen
that you're not telling me about?

349
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,120
These last couple of weeks
you've been different.

350
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Troubled.

351
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
No.

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,400
I'm having trouble sleeping, I guess.

353
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,040
The newspapers must get anonymous
tips all the time.

354
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Sure. Yeah.

355
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,440
You mean, call it in myself?

356
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
No, I can't do that.

357
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,280
- Gotham Gazette, the newsroom.
- Wait. No.

358
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,800
Hi. Listen. I can't talk long.

359
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,160
Somebody is abducting homeless
children off the streets

360
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,680
and the cops
are trying to keep quiet.

361
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,280
Go talk to Captain Sarah Essen
of the G.C.P.D.

362
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,640
She has a kid in custody
who can tell you the whole story.

363
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,840
- End the call.
- I got to go.

364
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Listen to me, Barbara.

365
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
When I tell you stuff,
that's just between us.

366
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
You can't do that what you just did.

367
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,840
- But it was the right thing to do.
- That's not the point.

368
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
What is the point?

369
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,560
You're right.
It was the right thing to do.

370
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,840
- Don't do it again, okay?
- Yes, boss.

371
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,320
Gotham Spirals Ever Downward.

372
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,960
Mayor James under attack,
vows swift action,

373
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,440
points finger at Police Department's
sluggish response, etcetera.

374
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
It's just ink.

375
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,200
- Did you give them this?
- Me?

376
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,400
You've done it before.

377
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,640
On my own case? Never.

378
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,240
It would be a very stupid thing
to do.

379
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Jim?

380
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
I didn't call it in.

381
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,880
I swear.

382
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,040
Another mystery.

383
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,000
We have a thin lead on the case,
if you'd like to hear it, ma'am.

384
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,120
There's only three companies
in Gotham that stock this ATP stuff,

385
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,720
and you need a special license
to buy it.

386
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
Chances are,
one of the three is crooked.

387
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,760
We're looking to lean hard
on all three,

388
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,880
like they are crooked
and see which one pops.

389
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
That was sneaky good.

390
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Almost couldn't tell you were lying.

391
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
I wasn't lying.

392
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,720
Good morning, Judge Baker.

393
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,280
Thank you, sir. Yes, all three.

394
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,440
Wellzyme, Dracotech,
and Quillan Pharma.

395
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,800
You guys have screwed me.

396
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,160
Against my better judgment,
I sell you the juice.

397
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,520
I let you, guys, use my storage space
because no problem you said.

398
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
And now look.

399
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,120
Heat.

400
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,360
- White hot heat!
- No problems, my friend.

401
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,120
We're here to take the merch away.

402
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,600
You'll be clean as a whistle.

403
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Merch?

404
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,680
They're children, dammit.

405
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,320
They're human beings.

406
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,480
Didn't I tell you to check on them
10 minutes ago?

407
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,760
I want another five large.

408
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,120
But we have a deal already.

409
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,320
I got to stand up
for what is right here.

410
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Be fair, sir.

411
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,320
We don't have that kind of cash
on hand.

412
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,640
That's your problem.

413
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,760
I can wait.

414
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,560
I thought you were worried
about the heat.

415
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,840
If heat arrives. In the meantime,

416
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,160
I can get rid of the evidence
very quickly.

417
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,920
We have an obligation to deliver.

418
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,040
The Doll-maker
doesn't tolerate failure.

419
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,800
- We need those children.
- Well, that's also your problem.

420
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,160
No. Hey!

421
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,600
This is totally inappropriate!

422
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,160
I mean, we were having
a business discussion here.

423
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,520
You weren't being fair.

424
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,120
Oh, gosh.

425
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Cops.

426
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,080
You didn't call the Gazette,
but did your girl call the Gazette?

427
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,280
Yeah.

428
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
- I knew it.
- I didn't know

429
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,680
she was going to call them.

430
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,600
Seriously, you got to learn
to control your woman.

431
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,480
I kind of like her the way she is.

432
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,280
These high-class temperamental bras,
they need firm handling, trust me.

433
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,680
Trust you? On women?

434
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,520
Damn right. All varieties.

435
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,240
From hausfraus to movie stars.

436
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,960
I love them all.
Now you, let me guess.

437
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,840
High school sweetheart,
and a bunch of hos overseas

438
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,720
only made you sad,
and then there's Barbara.

439
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,680
Pretty much.

440
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,440
You, my friend, are a monkey riding
a racehorse.

441
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
Good evening. May I help you?

442
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
Detectives Gordon and Bullock.

443
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
We need to speak whoever's in charge
here, ma'am.

444
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,680
Of course. Mr. Quillan,
detectives are here to see you.

445
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,280
Wow.

446
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,760
Detectives. Hey. What's up?

447
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,520
Nothing serious I hope.

448
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,880
Cut the crap.

449
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,600
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

450
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,760
We know what you're doing.

451
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,120
Well, then, you know
some boring stuff then.

452
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
What are you talking about?

453
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,400
You're peddling ATP
to those kids' snatchers.

454
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,960
Oh, my gosh, no.

455
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,240
I mean, we used to stock ATP, but
not since the Arkham Asylum closed.

456
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,880
I heard that the Wayne Foundation

457
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,880
is planning on reopening
the old place again.

458
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,520
But now that the Waynes are dead,
I guess everything's up in the air.

459
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
What a world, eh?

460
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Nobody's safe.

461
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,200
- Jim!
- Go, go!

462
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,760
Where the hell were you?

463
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
Get rid of them now.

464
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,640
Then hose down the room.

465
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Zeb.

466
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Freeze!

467
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,080
On behalf of all the citizens
of Gotham,

468
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,160
I wanna thank the brave gentlemen
from the bottom of my heart,

469
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,640
and I wanna promise, you kids,

470
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,240
we will take care of you
as if you were our own children.

471
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
But here's the thing.

472
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,920
The people who victimized these kids
are still out there,

473
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,000
and hundreds of vulnerable youngsters

474
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,280
are still living rough
on our streets, alone, unprotected.

475
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,280
And let's face it,
that's the real crime here.

476
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,120
So what are we going to do
to help these kids?

477
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,600
Yesterday, I made a phone call
to Juvenile Services

478
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,120
and the G.C.P.D. to initiate a humane
but tough love program,

479
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,360
to get these kids off the streets

480
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,920
and into the loving arms
of Juvenile Services.

481
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,000
- I think that went very well.
- I think so.

482
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,440
A small toast, Your Honor?

483
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
You read my mind.

484
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Mr. Mayor.

485
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,600
Where are you sending
all the children that get rounded up?

486
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,520
Foster homes
for the cute undamaged ones.

487
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,920
Upstate for the rest.

488
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,160
Upstate?

489
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,440
The Alpena Youth
Corrections Facility.

490
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
A fine institute.

491
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,600
Prison in other words.

492
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,080
Forgive me, Your Honor.

493
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,560
Detective Gordon
is our house firebrand.

494
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,160
No, no, no, that's okay.

495
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,080
Jim. Can I call you Jim?

496
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,400
Half the petty crime in the city
is homeless kids.

497
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,560
They need structure.

498
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,640
People who care about them,

499
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,920
for the greater good of Gotham
and for the children, you see?

500
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,760
I see you're using
the child snatchers as a pretext

501
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,640
to lock up children without a trial.

502
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Thank you, my friend.

503
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Valuable input.

504
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Most refreshing.

505
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
<i>L'chaim.</i>

506
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
Yo, Gordon.

507
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,760
Man's been waiting for you upstairs.

508
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Mr. Pennyworth.

509
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,320
Alfred, please.

510
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's bedlam, innit.

511
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,920
Rough job you do.

512
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Best job in the world.

513
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,680
I wonder if it might be convenient
for you to visit us tomorrow?

514
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,560
Of course.

515
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,760
- Why? Is something wrong?
- I don't know.

516
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,080
I never had a child before.

517
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,520
Nor me.

518
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,680
The boy respects you.

519
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,720
Teatime should we say?

520
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Teatime.

521
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,720
- Name.
- Ma'am, there's been a mistake.

522
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm not meant to go upstate.

523
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,800
I need to talk to James Gordon.
He's a cop.

524
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,800
You'll be allowed a phone call
when you get upstate.

525
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,400
- Name.
- I need to talk to him now.

526
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,960
- He'll thank you for it.
- Not happening.

527
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,280
- Name.
- Bite me, Pigarina.

528
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,600
Jane Doe.

529
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,840
Hey.

530
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,160
Relax kid.

531
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Juvie's not so bad.

532
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,560
First week, whatever you do,

533
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
don't make friends
with anyone that's friendly.

534
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,920
When you get into a fight,
go for their eyes.

535
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Hi, kids!

536
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,680
How you doing?

537
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,520
Are you ready to go
on a big adventure?

538
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,000
Sit down, young lady.

539
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,920
I said sit down!

540
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,200
Like now!

541
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,960
Okay.

542
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:15,520
Next naughty child to stand up
gets a black mark right here.

543
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,560
One or two or three.
I can explain that.

544
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,000
But a bus load, a whole bus load
of the little bastards?

545
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,520
What am I supposed to say?

546
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,160
Oops? Just tell me it's wasn't them.
I'm begging you.

547
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Just tell me it wasn't
"The Snatchers."

548
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,680
Bus driver was a man,
guard was a woman.

549
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,160
- It could be them.
- You're killing me.

550
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,920
- You're killing me!
- We're working it, Your Honor.

551
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,720
I told you everything I know.
I told you.

552
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,280
Now you see that man there?

553
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,680
He doesn't like it
when I beat people.

554
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,800
But for you, he's got no objection.
Why is that?

555
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,760
Math. The lives of 30 children
versus one scumbag.

556
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,480
So I can beat you like a bongo drum
and Saint Jim here won't intervene.

557
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Give us something.

558
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,200
Okay, okay!

559
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,080
The truck, when they came to pick up
the last bunch of kids,

560
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,320
on the side of it,
there was a picture.

561
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,440
Like a logo.

562
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,160
I didn't want to say before because
it would give a bad impression

563
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,920
- that doesn't reflect really...
- What was it?

564
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,400
There's a blue plate
and a silver fork.

565
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,640
A plate and a fork.

566
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Yeah, you know like...

567
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,840
- Like a catering company? Like food.
- Like that.

568
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,440
I mean, you know... But, I mean,
that doesn't mean, you know.

569
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,680
Doesn't mean what?

570
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,640
Look, I don't know
what they do with them.

571
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,560
Hey! Hey.

572
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,400
All right, draw the logo.

573
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Uncuff him.

574
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,560
There you go, kids.

575
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,240
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be all right.

576
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,680
That's right. That's right. Come on.

577
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,600
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on.

578
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Go.

579
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Funny thing, by my count,
according to the sheet they gave us,

580
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,520
- we're one short.
- Me too.

581
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
Maybe there's one on the bus.

582
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,520
Nope. Weird?

583
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,840
Must be a miscount some place.

584
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,200
Never mind.
We've got more than enough.

585
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,680
- We did good.
- Indeed we did.

586
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,720
<i>The Doll-maker
will be so pleased with us.</i>

587
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
All right, thanks.

588
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Nothing. You?

589
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,680
Apparently, there are no companies
in Gotham

590
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,600
with trucks with a plate
and fork as their logo.

591
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,680
Selling children for food.

592
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,880
Is such a thing even possible?

593
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,200
We've got officers searching all the
trucks on every bridge and tunnel.

594
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,360
But they had a three-hour window.

595
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,360
We can only pray they stayed
in the city.

596
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,040
If not, they can be any place
on Earth by nightfall.

597
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,160
You scum sucking toads,
where are they?

598
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,160
It's not a blue plate.

599
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,520
It's not a fork either.

600
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
It's a trident.

601
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,720
When you stow this on the ship,

602
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,640
make sure there's plenty of room
for the doors to open.

603
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,040
- The ship's crew has to...
- Let me out!

604
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Quiet in there!

605
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,560
Hush. Hush.

606
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,400
My eyes! She scratched me.

607
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Come on, follow me.

608
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Let me look.

609
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
It's nothing. It's a scratch.

610
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,920
We'll get you to a doctor,
you'll be right as rain in no time.

611
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You sure?

612
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,800
- What was that?
- Hang on.

613
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
Well...

614
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,320
You are a very naughty little girl.

615
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Hi.

616
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,720
- What's your name?
- Why is that your business?

617
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Jim!

618
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Where are the kids?

619
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,400
Where are they?

620
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,480
He's not been sleeping.

621
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
And when he does,
he has these nightmares.

622
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Now he's hurting himself.

623
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,920
Burning himself.

624
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
He's cutting.

625
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,360
- Is he getting professional help?
- You mean psychiatrists.

626
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
No, no. He won't have them.

627
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,600
No psychiatrists. That's a rule.

628
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,680
You make the rules, don't you?

629
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
You're his guardian.

630
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Bruce's father gave me very firm
orders was him and his missus to die.

631
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,760
I'll raise the boy the way his father
told me to raise him.

632
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
Which is how?

633
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Trust him to choose his own course.

634
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,720
He's after all a Wayne.

635
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,560
Sounds like a recipe for disaster.

636
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
What do you want me to do?

637
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,080
He wants you to talk some sense
into me.

638
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,600
Haven't I told you to stop creeping
up on people like that,

639
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,880
for it's bloody rude.

640
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,960
All right, then, Bruce, talk to me.

641
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,760
I'm perfectly fine.

642
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,080
Alfred is a worrywart.

643
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
What did you do to your hand?

644
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
I burned it.

645
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Listen to me, Bruce.

646
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,800
You've been through
a terrible experience.

647
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,040
Talking to someone
can be very helpful.

648
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,800
You must have seen terrible things
in the war.

649
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,400
Does it help you to talk about
what you saw?

650
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,600
Yes, a little.

651
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
You're not a very good liar.

652
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,640
- Bruce, you're hurting yourself.
- I'm testing myself.

653
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,440
Different.
But I appreciate your concern.

654
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,680
I've been following your adventures
in the newspapers.

655
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,440
I feel very sorry
for all those poor children.

656
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Me too.

657
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,240
I'll give you some money
to give to them.

658
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,640
I'm afraid it doesn't work that way,
Bruce.

659
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,480
What way does it work?

660
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,400
Those children need someone
who cares for them.

661
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
Like you have right here.

662
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Money won't buy that.

663
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,760
There must be something I can do.

664
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
What about clothes?

665
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,400
They all looked awfully ragged.

666
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,840
They did, didn't they?

667
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,440
After all this?

668
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,560
You're sending us upstate?

669
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,920
- Selina...
- Cat.

670
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,600
Cat, even if you didn't have
outstanding warrants, you're 13.

671
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,120
- No parents or guardians.
- That's not true. I have a mom.

672
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,040
- It says here she's deceased.
- That's not true.

673
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
She's alive.

674
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
- Someplace.
- Be that as it may,

675
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,360
we're not allowed to put you back
on the street.

676
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
For your own well-being.

677
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,320
Have you been there? Upstate?

678
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,560
- Yes.
- Then you know!

679
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
You know.

680
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,560
Go get Detective James Gordon.

681
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
He works here.

682
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Cat.

683
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,400
- The police are very busy people.
- Go get him.

684
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,320
Or I'll say you touched me.

685
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
Excuse me?

686
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
James Gordon.

687
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,560
I'm going to scream
in about three seconds.

688
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Hello.

689
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,800
Yes, this is he.

690
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,120
Well, I'm looking at your son
right now.

691
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
He doesn't look good.

692
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,520
Madame, I assure you,
your son is not trying to trick you.

693
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,880
Well, he will die a horrible death
unless he...

694
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,680
No, no, no.

695
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,800
Really truly, he isn't joking.

696
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,840
I'm not joking.

697
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,440
I will poke his eyeballs out and...

698
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,960
How can you say that?

699
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,800
You saw the video I sent.
I'm not lying.

700
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,320
Madame, Madame, calm yourself.

701
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,120
If 10,000 is too much,
I'm sure we can...

702
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Hello?

703
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Hello?

704
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,240
Well, that's disappointing.

705
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,520
She didn't believe me.

706
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,880
You must be quite the scamp.

707
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,440
I got it.

708
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Hello again, young lady.

709
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,160
- How can I help you?
- We need to talk.

710
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,240
So now you wanna talk, huh? Okay.

711
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's all right.

712
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,480
- Selina is it?
- Cat.

713
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Cat.

714
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
You're Mackey's friend.

715
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Yeah, I know Mackey.

716
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,920
Those bastards nearly got you twice,
huh?

717
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,200
You're quite a survivor.

718
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,400
You have no idea.

719
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,880
Suppose I had something
you really, really wanted.

720
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,360
If I gave it to you,
could you get me out of here?

721
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,360
What do you got?

722
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,520
I've been watching you.

723
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
You're a friend of the boy.

724
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,160
You're not like the rest
of these crooks.

725
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
The boy?

726
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Bruce?

727
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,760
What do you mean
you've been watching me?

728
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,880
That Mario Pepper guy
was a patsy, huh?

729
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,640
- What make you say that?
- Could you?

730
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
Could you get me out?

731
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
It's possible.

732
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,840
I saw who really killed the Waynes.

733
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,120
Saw him clear as day.
