00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,154
But your involvement
in this ended

166
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,118
the moment you put
your pants back on.

167
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,680
(scoffs)

168
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,076
What?

169
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,616
You don't think I'm
fit to be a mother?

170
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,710
What do you think?

171
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,670
Barbara.

172
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,554
(door opens forcefully)

173
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,553
(rats squeaking)

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,912
(woman laughing)

175
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,151
(clinking)

176
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,152
(laughing continues)

177
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,917
(speaks inaudibly)

178
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,311
(giggles)

179
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,315
Who are you?

180
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,513
Well, look who decided
to join us.

181
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,756
Hello, champ.

182
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,190
ALFRED:
Master Bruce!

183
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,710
Alfred, how did you...

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,275
Look at the state of you.

185
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,711
What have I told you about
rolling around in the muck?

186
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,117
Alfred, what's going on?

187
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Who are these people?

188
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,754
MAN: Whatever do
you mean, Bruce?

189
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,394
We're your parents.

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,840
Right. Well,
let's get you spruced up.

191
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
After all,

192
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,435
we have a guest.

193
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,396
Welcome home, Bruce.

194
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,398
Jeremiah.
You're alive.

195
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,873
(laughs) Well, you
didn't think Selina

196
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,872
could kill me so
easily, did you?

197
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,431
(laughs) I just had
to put you off my scent

198
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,439
until I could finalize
my... project.

199
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,673
Manners,
Master Bruce.

200
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,360
Let's not be rude
to our guest.

201
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,950
Especially when I
come bearing gifts.

202
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,350
ALFRED:
Oh, Mr. Jeremiah. A cake.

203
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,120
How exceedingly kind
of you.

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,275
Is it Italian meringue?

205
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Sure.

206
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Oh.

207
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,274
Now, now, Bruce,
you come

208
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,352
any closer
and I blow up Wayne Manor,

209
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,874
with all of us inside of it.

210
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,037
I have a dozen
more of these, uh,

211
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,116
Italian meringues sprinkled
all throughout the house.

212
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,873
What did you do to Alfred?

213
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,994
And who are these people?

214
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,355
Ah, glad you asked.

215
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Mm, come.

216
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,876
(quietly):
Come, come.

217
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,150
JEREMIAH:
Mommy and Daddy dearest

218
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,310
were just an innocent couple
I kidnapped based on...

219
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,196
bone structure and, um...

220
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
build.

221
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,589
Just a touch

222
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,514
of plastic surgery,
and voilà...

223
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Waynes.

224
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,195
(chuckles)

225
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,437
Alfred I nabbed
in the Green Zone.

226
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,480
They're hypnotized.

227
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,199
Well, I'm afraid
there was no room

228
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,794
for improv in
our script.

229
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,480
Today is a...

230
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,195
<i>very</i> important day, Bruce.

231
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,595
Just look at the way
they're dressed.

232
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,152
It's the night
my parents were killed.

233
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,355
And I'm giving
you the chance

234
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,513
to experience it
all over again.

235
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Why?

236
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
Isn't it
obvious?

237
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,076
Bruce...

238
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,676
this...

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,391
this was the most important day
of your life.

240
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,956
And I didn't get to be
a part of it.

241
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,753
We need to
rectify that.

242
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,276
Alfred. It's
time for dinner.

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,720
Chop-chop.
We're on a very tight schedule.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,992
Of course,
Mr. Jeremiah.

245
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,791
(motor chugging)

246
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,753
(explosion)

247
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,752
That's zero for three.

248
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Yes.

249
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,960
It seems the government
was quite thorough

250
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,151
- when they mined the river.
- You didn't have a plan

251
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,074
to get off this rock <i>before</i>
you stole everyone's crap?

252
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,995
I was working on a plan.

253
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,953
The river is mined.

254
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Everything that flies out
gets blown from... the...

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,878
- sky.
- What?

256
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,758
Jeremiah was digging a
tunnel under the river.

257
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
A tunnel?

258
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,873
(chuckles)
Really?

259
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,351
Do you have any better ideas?

260
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,760
Didn't think so.

261
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,075
It's in the Dark Zone.

262
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
We should wait until
night to check it out.

263
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,354
Well, I was running out
of guinea pigs anyway.

264
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Oh, look!

265
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,595
He's swimming to shore.

266
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,473
(explosion)

267
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,199
THOMPKINS:
<i>Are you sure</i>

268
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,953
you should be out
in the Narrows alone?

269
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,396
When the bridges fell, this
place descended into chaos.

270
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,496
Figure our best bet of
getting out in one piece is

271
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,376
- to keep a low profile.
- So all the work I did to make the Narrows better

272
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,914
- was for nothing.
- (loud clattering)

273
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,480
(indistinct shouts,
man whistles)

274
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,717
It's the Leopards.
Rivals of the Chessmen.

275
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,799
(men speaking indistinctly)

276
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,359
About this Barbara thing...

277
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,476
Uh, Jim, just don't.

278
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,836
No, it's important to me
that you understand.

279
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,155
(sighs)

280
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,671
Okay. So, what
are you gonna do?

281
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,757
I don't know,
but it's my child, too.

282
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,511
Barbara seems to have a
difference of opinion.

283
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,470
But hey, people change.

284
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,360
You don't know her
like I do.

285
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,590
You can say that again.

286
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,269
(engine revs, pulls away)

287
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Look.

288
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
We're clear.

289
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,234
The Chessmen moved around.

290
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,160
They used these as signals
for their members.

291
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,840
The rook's a compass needle.

292
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,793
North-northeast.
Let's go.

293
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,838
♪♪

294
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Hmm.

295
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,830
Alfred told me
such great tidbits

296
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,315
about your childhood.

297
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,672
How you used to eat here,

298
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,634
in the kitchen, when it was
just you and the family.

299
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,679
My, how...

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,231
homey and intimate.

301
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,236
Grilled cheese and Branston
pickle sandwich, Mr. Jeremiah.

302
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,675
Master Bruce's favorite.

303
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,232
My influence,
though Thomas did add a dash

304
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,557
of aioli for extra flair.

305
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,315
(laughing)

306
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,713
Oh. Come on, Bruce.

307
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,600
That's a weird favorite
food for a 12-year-old.

308
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,633
I'm playing your game.

309
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,153
Now let Alfred
and these people go.

310
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,390
They're innocent.

311
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,072
I'm sorry, Bruce,
it's just...

312
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,870
it's very important
to me that I get

313
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,192
every detail
exactly right.

314
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,714
Speaking of which...

315
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,440
the final touch.

316
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,838
♪♪

317
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,199

losing your parents
that night?

319
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
(deep, distorted gunshot)

320
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,474
I lost my family,
too, Bruce.

321
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,757
The wound still
hasn't healed.

322
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,640
I... think about it often.

323
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,474
None of this is real.

324
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,071
You're trying
to manipulate me.

325
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,472
It will never be real.

326

But you are thinking
about that night.

327
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,113
That's all I need.

328

330
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,036
But I've realized
if we...

331
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,630
can't be friends...

332
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,912
then we <i>can</i> be connected
in other ways.

333
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,635
How?

334
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
You'll see.

335
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,960
In time.

336
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Hmm.

337
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,676
I'm sorry to cut
tonight short...

338
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
but...

339
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,756
your parents and I have
a very important date...

340
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,839
Jeremiah.

341
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,593
- ...with destiny.
- Jeremiah!

342
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,038
You might want to find your
faithful butler and leave.

343
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Quickly.

344
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
(steady beeping)

345
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Alfred!

346
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,238
(bell tolling)

347
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,560
The signs lead
this way.

348
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,676
Look at the smoke.

349
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,952
Someone restarted production.

350
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,751
(tanks burbling)

351
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,400
My God, Jim...

352
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,235
look at all of this.

353
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Come on.

354
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,197
- Who's in charge here?
- (softly): Tick tock,

355
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
the chemical stock,

356
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,238
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

357
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,394
Tick tock, the chemical stock,

358
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,240
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

359
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,357
Tick tock,
the chemical stock...

360
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,392
...shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

361
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,670
They've been
hypnotized.

362
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Tetch.

363
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,616
- (one person clapping)
- WORKERS: Tick tock,

364
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,915
the chemical stock

365
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,080
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

366
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,591
My, my, what a thrill.

367
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,595
Jim Gordon...

368
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,920
and the woman
he told me to kill.

369
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,918
(mock gasp)
Brings back memories.

370
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,795
That tea party,
so long ago.

371
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,354
But now, to order these men
to attack my foe!

372
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
(Thompkins yelps)

373
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,193
JERVIS:
All for one, and one for all!

374
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,192
Ain't this a grand old ball!

375
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
(grunts)

376
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,436
(pipes clanging)

377
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Yoo-hoo!

378
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
(gasps) Jim!

379
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,554
Ain't this...

380
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,793
some... game!

381
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,515
Give it to me again?

382
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,193
(sighs) Penguin
has been stealing

383
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,477
everything in the city
that's not nailed down,

384
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,115
and now he needs a way
of getting it off the island.

385
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,835
Hmm. And you're
helping him?

386
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
Well, that's what he thinks.

387
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,632
Barbara, Tabitha
was my friend, too.

388
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,873
If anything,
I want to gut the twerp...

389
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,040
- and take his loot.
- Except you don't actually have

390
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,430
- a way out of Gotham.
- I'll find one tonight.

391
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,478
I'll still need your help
moving the stuff.

392
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,433
We can get out of here together.

393
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,794
Away from Jim Gordon.

394
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
Rich as Midas.

395
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,719
Penguin dead in a ditch.

396
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,076
Well, aren't we just
two single ladies and a baby

397
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,630
about to kill
our sworn enemy together.

398
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
What?

399
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,040
It's just you're pregnant.

400
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
Don't even start.

401
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,560
BRUCE (in distance):
Alfred!

402
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
(beeping)

403
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
(in distance):
Alfred!

404
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,509
(running footsteps)

405
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,554
- (beeping)
- Alfred. We need to get out of here.

406
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,680
Ah, Master Bruce. I was
just taking a quiet moment

407
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,154
- to tidy up.
- We need to go.

408
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,238
- The bombs.
- What bombs?

409
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,830
These bombs.

410
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,909
No need for roughhousing, sir.

411
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,311
(beeping continues)

412
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,240
There has to be a way.

413
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,136
Alfred, you'd do anything
to protect me, right?

414
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,119
- Absolutely, sir.
- There's a gas leak. In the kitchen.

415
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,496
It's only a matter of time
before this whole place goes up.

416
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,398
A gas leak?
Where are your parents?

417
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,336
- Where's our guest?
- I've already warned them.

418
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,635
I know a way out.
Come on!

419
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,798
(rapid beeping)

420
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,077
(deep rumbling)

421
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,510
BRUCE:
Alfred!

422
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Alfred.

423
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
(groans)

424
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
(groans)

425
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,316
Oh, bloody hell.

426
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't move.

427
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,876
Do you, uh...?

428
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,152
Oh, yeah, I remember everything.

429
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,996
Clear as day.

430
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,736
And let me tell you,
if ever I see

431
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,320
that Jervis Tetch character
again I'll stick that watch

432
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,678
so far up his... his nose.

433
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,230
How about you?

434
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,310
You all right?

435
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,280
Yeah, I'm all right.

436
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,914
But the manor...

437
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,117
Don't you worry about that now,
son.

438
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,990
Come on. Help me up.

439
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,713
(grunts, groans)

440
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Oh, your leg's hurt.

441
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,279
Yes, but it's not broken.

442
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,030
(grunts)

443
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,400
I thought I lost you.

444
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Me?

445
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,752
Never, Master Bruce.

446
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,716
Go on.

447
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,560
You know where
he's gonna be at.

448
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Go.

449
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,395
If you're here,

450
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,197
Jeremiah must
still be alive.

451
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,234
And if you're here, I'm guessing
you found our test subjects,

452
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,791
all boiled and bubbled.
(giggles)

453
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
What's he planning?

454
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,392
Shh. It's a surprise,
don't you know?

455
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,191
A real killer.

456
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,400
JERVIS: Shall I hypnotize
our friends here,

457
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,040
and have them slit
each other's necks?

458
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,640
ECCO:
(laughs) Nix.

459
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,519
Better check
with the boss.

460
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,390
He might have other ideas.

461
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,793
I'm sorry I got you
involved in this.

462
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,119
Don't be.

463
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,416
I knew what I was
getting myself into.

464
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,159
I know, but, Lee...

465
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,915
Jim, whatever
you want to tell me,

466
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,759
save it till
we're out of here.

467
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Fair enough.

468
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,471
We need to find out
what Valeska's planning.

469
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Hey, Tetch.

470
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,394
You know, it's funny.

471
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,994
I never figured you for
Jeremiah's errand boy.

472
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,438
Oh, Captain.
No errands do I run.

473
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,155
This is simply a way
for me to have some fun.

474
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,596
THOMPKINS: (laughs)
Tell yourself that.

475
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,919
What are you
when you would take away

476
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,833
your games and your rhymes?

477
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,670
Nothing but a second-rater
with a really silly hat.

478
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,676
Shut up.

479
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,032
(whispering)

480
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,720
- (laughs)
- Beautiful.

481
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Beautiful.

482
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,392
Lee Thompkins,
you do intrigue me so.

483
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,316
First, you were a doctor,

484
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,192
then the Narrows queen.

485
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,760
Tell me, please do,

486
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,957
are you running
from your past

487
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,552
when you become
someone new?

488
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,198
(door creaks)

489
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,673
When I found Jeremiah,

490
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,760
he had a bunch of crazies
digging this tunnel for him.

491
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,880
Well, that certainly
fills me with confidence.

492
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,631
- Whoa. You hear that?
- (rustling nearby)

493
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,593

00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,600
You always have an answer for
everything, don't you, Oswald?

661
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,110
We have been
through all of this before.

662
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,794
I've tried to kill you.

663
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,113
You've tried to kill me.

664
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,555
But here we are in this room.

665
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Together.

666
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,710
It means fate has
different plans for us.

667
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,320
What are these plans?

668
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,511
Haven't you realized
what Gotham is yet?

669
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,318
It is no longer a city.

670
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,600
It is a prison.

671
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,357
And I think it's time
we escaped.

672
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,875
You heard the news?

673
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,560
Everybody's
talking about it.

674
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,993
Reunification
isn't happening.

675
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,391
Word of the chemical spill
reached the mainland.

676
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,311
No action until the government
can determine if Gotham is safe.

677
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,712
I figure at least
a couple of months.

678
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,480
You don't sound surprised.

679
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,595
Guess I'm not.

680
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,834
Could've been much worse.

681
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,312
- You stopped that.
- (sighs)

682
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,296
Every time I think
we're turning things around,

683
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,880
I look up...
right back where we started.

684
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,879
What were you
about to say to me

685
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,238
when, uh, Tetch had us?

686
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,195
I don't know.

687
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,318
I guess I, uh,
would have said...

688
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,956
what I said the last time
we saw each other.

689
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,632
I wish I could go back.

690
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,960
Do things differently.

691
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Better.

692
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,318
- It feels like a long time ago.
- Nothing's changed.

693
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,993
But it has, Jim.

694
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,279
That was a mistake.

695
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,350
A mistake?

696
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,999
Put yourself in my shoes.
After everything you said,

697
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,437
suddenly you're having a baby
with Barbara, of all people.

698
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,760
But it's not just that.

699
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,456
You talk about doing
things differently

700
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,834
and I keep thinking,

701
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,752
what if we hadn't lost ours?

702
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,319
What are you doing here, Lee?

703
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,996
I don't know.

704
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,949
I know you've taken
on so much, and...

705
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,352
and I want to be
understanding, but...

706
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,759
you let me down, Jim.

707
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,595
I'm sorry.

708
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,870
- What does that mean?
- (sighs)

709
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,390
For us?

710
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,156
I don't know.

711
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,116
Can't change the past,

712
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,840
so I guess we just
have to live with it.

713
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,720
No, Lee...

714
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,998
(monitor beeping steadily)

715
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,476
SELINA: I can't believe
he's still alive.

716
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,433
They've been doing scans,
and he has no brain activity.

717
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,313
He's no longer a threat.

718
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,473
To either of us.

719
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,637
Thank you for coming to help me.

720
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,696
That night your parents
were killed,

721
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,757
I should have done something.

722
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,513
Selina, you've done enough.

723
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,799
(thunder rumbles)

724
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,913
It's not much, but it's home.

725
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,157
I've been looking through
your treasure trove.

726
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,474
- You've been a very naughty boy.
- Barbara?

727
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,034
How did you...

728
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
Selina?

729
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,716
Hmm. She and I
were gonna go murder-halfsies

730
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,559
to get you back for Tabitha,

731
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,435
but it seems I will have to do
the dirty work myself,

732
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,750
as usual.

733
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,036
NYGMA:
Oh, my God.

734
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,635
You're pregnant.

735
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,760
- How could you possibly know that?
- Look at you.

736
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,230
She's glowing.

737
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,234
You're glowing.

738
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,440
How very observant of you.
Adieu, Oswald.

739
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,676
Wait!

740
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,629
Come with us.

741
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,832
- What?
- Yes.

742
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,030
I killed Tabitha.

743
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,596
You're angry.

744
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,600
You want revenge.
But do you really want

745
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,959
to raise your child
in a toxic waste war zone?

746
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,833
Come with us.

747
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,870
Are you telling me
you found a way out of Gotham?

748
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
Ed did.

749
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,436
It's a submarine.

750
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,349
- A submarine?
- It can track

751
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,677
mines in the river using sonar.

752
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,155
So, where's this submarine?

753
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,116
We have to build it.

754
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,000
- Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you.
- (whimpers)

755
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
God.

756
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,955
What is happening to me?

757
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,274
- Perhaps...
- Shut up!

758
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,238
That was a
rhetorical question.

759
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,550
(sighs)

760
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,995
Fine.

761
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,479
I won't shoot you
for the sake of my child.

762
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,558
- But I will never forgive you.
- Of course.

763
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,074
I understand.

764
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,995
Call me when it's done.

765
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,470
- So, who's the lucky father?
- Shut up!
